The Devil's Advocate," Tremendous fun
","Never believable for a second, but was it supposed to be?Devil's Advocate is a surreal folk story about a hotshot lawyer headhunted by a mysterious law firm. He's got a pretty perfect record, so on moving to New York he starts to become big business. Pacino is Milton, the boss of the new company, and as usual, he exudes charisma like it were going out of fashion. Clearly having a ball, he obviously enjoyed playing a character who always seems to be one step ahead. Reeves, Lomax, is the weak spot in this movie, with a role giving him the chance to prove he's more than a surfer dude with a penchant for 'whoa'. Unfortunately he struggles with his part, putting on a pretty hammy Texan accent which makes him look like he's contriving every word. Theron's his wife, Mary Anne, and puts on an understandably overacted show as a woman who can't cope with the strange goings-on around her.The plot's daft, and the movie never takes itself seriously for a second. Consequently as hokum, it's pretty darn good.",Null,2,4,29 December 2003
Blade Runner 2049," It's terrific but not quite up there with the original
","Let's face it, it could NOT be as good as the original, which is one of the greatest pieces of movie making ever be conceived, so let's get that out of the way.Rarely are sequels as good as the first one, and while this makes a hell of a good shot at it, it doesn't manage it.But what it does manage is to refresh the world of Blade Runner, making it relevant for the present day, while still keeping the feel of the original as much as it can without being derivative.The story follows on 30 years from BR, with Ryan Gosling, a new-age Blade Runner doing the same thing the old ones did - but after making a discovery, needs to track down ol' Deckard to solve an even bigger mystery.The original story was filled with so much philosophy and depth it's impossible to know where to start - what the sequel does is keep in enough of a level of depth to keep audiences engage but not making it as extensive - it's a sad reflection of the iPhone age that we just do not seem to have the capacity to think as much as we once did, and it feels like Villeneuve and Scott knew this and made a Blade Runner to accommodate the modern world.But they keep enough of what made BR good to avoid alienating its many fans, while adding in enough new stuff to avoid it seeming dated.For Gosling's part he's brilliant - he was immaculately cast in this role and it's the best I've seen him. Ford isn't in it a huge amount and definitely seems a different Deckard to 1982's. And a lot of the structure is similar - there's a 'Roy Batty' (if a pale imitation and nowhere near as threatening) type, a Tyrell (a much more cynical one) and even a kind of Sebastian too - an isolated soul who makes their own world.So fans will feel familiar ground. The directing is good - it does not feel like a long film and it goes by quickly - the pacing is spot on.But it just cannot compare to the original overall. It is a 10/10 by today's standards, but the original was a masterpiece which is off the charts.This is close enough, but no cigar.",10,0,4,28 December 2017
Vertigo," Very well constructed indeed
","The legend that is Alfred Hitchcock needs absolutely no introduction, so I won't waste time with rhetoric. Vertigo is a psychological mystery starring the fantastic James Stewart as John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired detective who is approached by an old school/college friend, Gavin Elster, and requested to follow the gentleman's wife, in the vein of a private detective. The reason for the pursuit is the friend's wife Madeleine is acting bizarrely, and Elster believes she is literally possessed by a ghost. She seems to have conscious blackouts and doesn't remember things which have happened to her.Scottie reluctantly gets involved and follows her, studying her intriguing behaviour and trying to figure out what on earth is happening to her, without making contact. However, after a dramatic event at the Golden Gate Bridge, the 2 'meet' and Scottie finds himself getting involved to an unprofessional level...James Stewart, as expected, is spell binding. He truly is the most popular star of all time and with performances like this it was not hard to see why. He brings an everyman personability to every role, and is never less than utterly likable. His down to earth charm is always as gripping as it is believable.Kim Novak, as the troubled Madeleine, is also absolutely excellent in a type of Sugar Cane but-more-serious-type of role as the perfect woman who seems unobtainable. Her slightly austere personality fits the story perfectly.The last major player next to Elster is Midge Wood, a type of live in 'friend' who stays with Scottie. She is also completely besotted with him but it doesn't seem entirely mutual. Balanced but infatuated, her existence is a slightly tortured one.The direction is the 4th major character here, and I say that deliberately. It is quite outstanding, with some truly rich colouring, top class cinematography, and impressive special effects. The world of Vertigo is brought to life by a true master of cinema in Hitchcock.It might not have the claustrophobia or wit of Rear Window, or the horror of Psycho, but it's clearly intended as a movie entirely on its own merits.A great tale and utterly timeless.",9,8,14,7 November 2004
Scarface," Involving drama
","A classic rise and fall tale, Scarface sees Al Pacino in a slightly different role to his Godfather days, but still operating on the wrong side of the law.A remake of a 30's movie, Scarface is the story of Tony Montana, a lowlife Cuban punk who migrates to the USA with his best buddy Manny to make a better life for themselves, free from the oppression of Fidel Castro. Quickly taken under the wing of Robert Logia's Frank Lopez, Tony finds himself heavily involved in the criminal underworld and as he rises through the ranks, he begins to make bad decisions and to trust the wrong people...Essentially Scarface is the tale of how you can lose it all through your own pig-headed stupidity. We see multiple characters' fates in this being cast in stone from the moment we are introduced to them, but the narrative shows us that even when we're shown the right path, our own arrogance can take us up the wrong one.Brilliantly acted throughout by a *very* strong cast including an effective Steven Bauer as the amiable and reliable Manny, Loggia as the personable but soft Lopez, F Murray Abraham as the untrustworthy Omar, Michelle Pfieffer as the troubled junkie Elvira, and Elizabeth Mary Mastrantonio as Tony's kid sister Gina, Scarface gives us a strong script with which to couple these convincing characters, and it drags us into its world as a result. The top class direction from de Palma aids this too by keeping it moving swiftly.Certainly one to see. Top quality drama.",9,0,1,27 August 2004
Requiem for a Dream," Sad, disturbing, but smarts.
","This is a strong movie. Very strong. It's not easy to watch in certain respects, but *commands* respect because it comes across as so honest.It's basically about the effects of drugs, and how they proceed to destroy the lives of 4 individuals around whom the story is focused. The intriguing thing is not all the drugs are illegal.The performances, particularly from Ellen Burstyn, are excellent. In fact, she is outstanding, and the rest of the cast are highly commendable.It's a very difficult movie to describe, because it doesn't follow the usual movie plot structure. It benefits from this fact and seems more 'real', somehow. There is only one moment which seems daft and contrived, but given the effective grit of the rest of it you'll forgive it.Overall, a very well constructed movie which makes no apologies for its content.",9,0,0,23 July 2002
3:10 to Yuma," Modern western hits the target
","Bale and Crow put in a masterclass in a serious and western-set version of Midnight Run.3:10 to Yuma is a modern western, a genre which is rather fading out these days, which is not something to sadden me greatly as I was never a fan of the theme. So when given this DVD to randomly borrow, I went in with as open a mind as I could muster, and was certainly attracted by Bale and Crow as both are actors I can watch.Bale is Evans, a former military sharpshooter now trying to get his ranch into some kind of fruitful state and his family comfortable, but he has to battle against the odds with authorities wanting to tear him apart given his location on wanted land, and a son who looks at him with contempt not respect.Crowe plays his nemesis Wade, an outlaw with a black heart and rotten posse.Initially the point of the movie seems unclear until Evans volunteers his (paid) services to aid in the transport of Wade who will be trialled for his various crimes.Just like Midnight Run, this is basically a tale of two arch rivals one of whom has to take the other to justice. Difference is this is anything but a comedy. Sure, it isn't the most serious movie you will ever see, and even manages a little humour (if not a lot), but it is certainly a fairly deadpan drama.The performances ensure this; Crowe oozes charisma as the colourful Wade, a truly 'bad man' but who elicits charm throughout and even hints at a humane side. Bale's Evans is a successful display of a man who simply has to battle everything, who is not a dominant personality by nature, and whose own chidren seem to lack respect for him.This escort is his chance to make things right.The directing in this movie is impressive - fast moving and never boring even for a second. Serious work went into this and the cinematography flows seamlessly as a result.And the acting makes you care about the characters, even Wade. However, Foster puts in a cracking shift as Prince, a truly rotten and despicable killer with not an ounce of decency in him - he is a lot of fun. He is very much the villain of the piece.3:10 to Yuma is an impressive piece of cinema, and the 3 main leads steal the show - which is really the point.",8,1,3,7 March 2008
The Ring," Surprisingly decent remake, really
","Don't get me wrong, Ring, the Japanese original is still head and shoulders above this, and possibly the finest horror movie ever made, but this, as an American remake does not attempt to 'hollywoodise' the story and consequently retains a *lot* of credibility.There are alterations in the story in terms of little additions which actually add to the movie, but the basic premise remains the same.'there's this video, and if you watch it, you die on the 7th day after.'This is the idea, and the film-makers did remarkably well to remain faithful to the original, keeping the same storyline and using the same ending.I don't wish to spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it, so I do recommend this. But only after watching the 'real' one.",Null,0,1,24 February 2003
Hereditary," Almost perfect horror
","Hereditary, like The Conjuring and Insidious, was 'boosted' by a hype train which alluded to it being the greatest and scariest horror ever etc - in the case of Conjuring and Insidious, these claims are miles off.And while Hereditary is not outright terrifying, it is by far the finest slice of horror to come out of Hollywood in an unspeakably long time, and comes much closer to truly getting under the skin of the viewer than any of its pale peers.If we start with the basics, and the story, we're introduced to a family of four, with what can only be described as a dark background permeating them, but while we get teased glimpses of what that might be, it doesn't start to unravel until something happens to change it all.And that change helps to develop the story from what many people expected into what it really is - a true horror about the hell of grief, the nightmare of loss, with more than a touch of darkness in there to show just how deep the root of evil can go.The performances in Hereditary are... they're mixed. Shapiro's Charlie is absolutely brilliant, while Colette's Annie was only overlooked for an Oscar because it's a horror. But Gabriel Byrne's Steve is forced into stupid moments and situations because the writers couldn't find a way to make his character work in this film properly. Quite frankly they made him annoying. But Wolff's Peter is another fine example of a strong performance, without it being stunning.The direction is superb, truly superb. It's a long movie but it doesn't feel it, and Ari Aster has done an outstanding job of showing what you need to see, while avoiding a lot of silly 'boo' scares. The ones he uses are excellent and work brilliantly. He and Pogorzelsi created a fine look and feel for the film, a sense of production which is fantastically made and some frequently excellent touches to make this film stand out.Sure, the story isn't really all that unique, in the grand scheme of things, but the way it's presented is, with originality, flair and panache plus that unbridled epidermal creaking horror lying under the surface.This is one very twisted film but without doing it overly gratuitously. What you don't see is more scary than what you do and Aster nails that.However, and a few have mentioned it, the ending - it's hideous, at best. It doesn't undo all the fine work which came before but it doesn't fit and it definitely detracts - I know where it should have ended and it really missed a trick.But this is nitpicking. It's the best horror to come out of Hollywood in decades and shows Asia doesn't have a monopoly any more on good quality terror.Excellent stuff.",9,0,2,24 January 2019
Minority Report," Simply *ok*
","A lot could rightly be expected of this movie. A great deal has been made of the fact that it's the first collaboration between Hollywood's most successful director and Hollywood's biggest actor. Many years have passed in-between them both searching for the ideal project to work on jointly, and finally it's arrived. The story here is that a unit called 'Pre-Crime', which has not gone national yet, has been developed to predict murders before they occur. Using so-called 'Pre-Cogs' (3 people permanently assigned to viewing the future) the cops in the Pre-Crime unit are on stand-by should any future murders be discovered. On this eventuality they race to the scene to prevent it.But the tables are turned when a routine check of a case reveals the murderer to be Tom Cruise's character, John Anderton.This is a highly original story in concept, no question. But the problem is that under the hi-tech surface lies a fairly bog-standard murder-mystery. The future setting certainly provides a more interesting setting for the plot, but the plot itself, while engaging in curiosity terms, ultimately isn't that gripping.Cruise is fine in his role - a part which requires a lot less charisma than perhaps he's used to portraying. None of the characters are all that fascinating because you don't really identify with them.It's a fragmented and fairly mediocre story, told in a more original way. But the shine can't hide its flaws.Good I suppose, but it could have been a lot better.",Null,0,0,8 July 2002
Training Day," Unusual study of ethics
","Definitely a bit different this one.For his performance, Denzel Washington received a best actor oscar as the narcotics officer who takes the naive Jake (Ethan Hawke) under his wing. Constantly referred to as a rookie, Jake goes on a training day to see if he can handle the street as presented to him by Alonzo (Denzel), and cope with the way narc officers deal with the law.It's a supremely well-told story, because nothing is given to the viewer on a plate. Every feeling you have towards the main characters is your own, and the movie never attempts to dictate your emotive response. This is a rarity in the sentimentally-driven industry Hollywood frequently is. The performances are utterly excellent, and Ethan Hawke does equally as well as Washington in my opinion - the only difference being that Washington's character has more scope and more of the opportunity to be dynamic.
The movie is objective, never takes sides, and gives the viewers the chance to deduce their own feelings. That's how cinema should be.Fine movie.",Null,0,11,12 February 2003
Monster," Quite incredible performances
","Monster is another true story about despair and hopelessness, leading to inevitability. What it also encompasses is a love story in among the tragedy and it does surprisingly well to make the combination of love and destruction compatible, almost conjoined.Charlize Theron is simply not recognisable (Bar the voice) as Aileen, a prostitute who lost control of herself a long time ago. Condemned to a life of failure on every front, she essentially possesses no dignity and is barely even at the level of trailer trash. This makes Selby's initial fascination with her somewhat unbelievable, but they do say beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Selby is played by Cristina Ricci, and having been brought up in a strictly catholic household she got disowned when a girl accused her of attempting to kiss her. Dispelled into an alien home, she is aching to rebel, but doesn't know how. Cue Aileen who is her polar opposite and a mutual fixation builds up of each other after a chance meeting in a bar. The problem is neither has money or prospects, so fake promises and empty optimism that things will get better are all they have to hold onto, and when Aileen's aggressive nature gets the better of her and she murders a client who tries to rape her, she seems to get a thirst for it - the murder of these scumbag rapists seems justifiable to her. It goes without saying that Charlize Theron defies belief here - she is 1000% convincing as Aileen, and the makeup is also top notch. If her voice had been in any way altered, you would *not* know it was her. Not only is her acting superb, but her bodily mannerisms are so convincing too - she seems to be a different person entirely.However, it must be added that Ricci too is outstanding as the naive then foolhardy Selby. Her transformation from submissive to aggressive is completely believable.In saying all this, the performances can be top notch but if the story ain't that hot then the movie isn't fufilling all that it can. Here, it can't be denied the story is pretty well told. The narrative is kept moving at a good pace, and ultimately we get fairly suckered into the world portrayed.There are better movies out there but not an awful lot of better performances - this is worth your time for them alone.",Null,0,1,6 July 2004
Memento," Ordinary story, told in an extraordinary way
","Memento is one of the smartest films ever conceived, no question.Its base story about a man's hunt for his wife's killer is certainly not original, but the way it is told here certainly is, and it uses an incredible plot device to make it work even better.Guy Pearce is Lenny Shelby, a man suffering short term memory less - 'can't make new memories'. His wife was raped and murdered and all he has are fragmented clues about what happened and who's responsible.  His problem is that because his memory last about 2 minutes he repeatedly forgets who he just met, what he just did, where he's just been. Consequently he tattoos apparent facts to his body to remind him of the 'truth' and photographs everyone he engages with as a 'memento' of them and to enable him to identify them later.This is only half the genius of this story, the other half is equally, if not more brilliant; the story is told in reverse. It starts at the end, and makes its way to the beginning, but it's because Shelby doesn't remember anything, and of course, we do, that makes the narrative flow superbly.
The core idea is vengeance and trust - who is he after and who should he trust to help find them? The editing in Memento is absolute genius, and somehow it all makes perfect sense and works succinctly. It is one of the most satisfying films to sit back and admire the structure of.In terms of performances, Pearce, Pantoliano (Teddy) and Moss (Natalie) are decent if uninspiring. None of them are particularly personable but that's more down to the nature of the story than bad acting. Pearce does lack charisma, but again, you could accuse his character's condition of being the reason.It is difficult to say more without spoiling the plot, I'll merely recommend if you haven't seen one, then you should.Superbly original film-making.",10,0,2,7 March 2004
Underworld," Stronger ending redeems the rest
","A dark vampire action thriller - these are always appealing to me. Something about the lives of vampires is extremely enviable - all the sex, drugs, rock and roll with lashings of blood somehow seem *very* seductive.Underworld is the first one I've seen in a while and fails to entertain for much of its duration, which is unfortunate, as usually the mere 'atmosphere' and 'look' of these type of films is enough to grab my attention. Here those aspects simply serve as a platform, and don't particularly draw you in. Kate Beckinsale is Seline, a vampire who's part of an ongoing war between her kind and the Lycans, (Werewolves) a war whose origin is not made clear till later on. Kraven is the leader of the vampires, but Seline despises him and hankers for her dead mentor, Vincent, the former leader, which alienates her from her ilk. However, things get dangerous with the emergence of Michael, a mortal who the Lycans appear to be after, for reason the vampires must find out.This sets the pace of the movie, the story essentially evolving around him.The main problem with this picture is the acting is appallingly banal and lifeless, with absolutely cliched characters because none of the actors are capable of making their part their own. Mundane dialogue with insipid delivery serves to bore rather than grip. The only actor who breaks this chain is Bill Nighy, who commands the screen every time he appears. He's not even that outstanding but the feeble competition makes him look so.The second problem is drab direction. At no point for the vast majority are we made to feel part of what we're watching, because it fails on so many levels to suck us into its world, which is essential in any good film, especially one with such a distinct theme. The action itself seems to be going through the motions too, with decidedly uninspired gunfights and slaughter scenes.However, amazingly, the last reel is actually rather good. Without giving anything away, obviously events come to a head and for once, the acting is tolerable and the plot genuinely gets interesting. The final action sequence isn't *overly* breathtaking, but it's reasonable, and finally the film pulled me in.Just a pity it took seemingly forever to get there.",5,0,0,1 April 2004
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," By a distance, the finest Star Wars movie
","Let's not lie about this, for all the colossal and justified popularity of the Star Wars franchise, they are not cinematically the greatest movies ever. They are fun, endearing, charming, captivating, but the acting could be better, the effects (for those who have seen the originals) are pretty weak and for his iconic imagery, Darth Vader is not the scariest or most intimidating movie villain ever.So there was definitely some room for a genuinely high quality story to join the Star Wars world, and while Force Awakens made a good fist of it, there is undeniable irony that a 'stand alone' adventure with character cameos is by some distance the strongest in the whole saga.Rogue One is the story of the team who managed, by hook or crook, to get the secret weakness plans for the Death Star back to the Alliance so Rogue Two and crew could destroy it. What exactly happened to that team I will not spoil by describing, because that is the story here in a nutshell.Felicity Jones, in her first headline act (unless you count the bizarre mess that was Inferno) is Jyn, daughter of the chief scientist behind the Death Star, separated from him at a young age and forced to live her life raised by an outsider before ending up alone. She finds her way into the Alliance and a plot to kill her father, and her attempts to save him lead to a domino effect which will eventually lead to the end of the Death Star.To say more would spoil the meat and guts; but it is safe to say this is an impeccably filmed, directed, produced and conceived stand alone adventure which gives avid fans some excellent and worthy back story while winning a few new ones thanks to the lack of need to have seen any of the other movies in the series.This is the first Star Wars to actually make you care about the characters - in that what happens to them truly matters - all the rest while enjoyable, simply didn't connect emotionally with the audience in the way this one does. Not in the opinion of yours truly anyway - and it's that control it exerts over its audience which makes it so strong - it respects its viewers, both seasoned fans and brand newbies, and produces a fine result for both.There is some character development, subtle though it may be in places, more obvious in others, aided by direction which gets the pacing dead on, and the cinematography is as good as any you'll see in any movie.The visual effects too are up to scratch, even certain cameos, and it really does neatly tie in with the rest of the franchise, with some fine humorous moments as well which don't feel as cheesy as the gags from the earlier efforts.Overall it's a rip roaring ride and hard to really fault on any level. Some characters ARE a bit wasted, which is a shame, but that's about the only thing wrong with it.Highly recommended.",9,1,2,2 April 2017
Dawn of the Dead," Great fun which does the original reasonable justice
","Taking an older classic into the modern day, Dawn of the Dead is a more than effective remake with its own charm.Quite a few years have passed since the original Dawn of the Dead. In my own humble opinion it was actually the weakest of all 3, but the majority seem to disagree with this, citing it as the best.Universal agreed with this consensus and commissioned this remake, bringing a slightly new angle and characters into a similar situation as previously set. As with the original, DOTD is set in a shopping mall for the most part, and sees the protagonists trying to survive the onslaught of zombies in an apocalyptic environment.Sarah Polley is Ana, a nurse whose partner is attacked by a member of the undead in the family home. When he, after being killed, regains 'life' and goes for her she escapes and encounters Kenneth, a cop along with a group of 3 other survivors.Together they go to the mall and set up sanctuary along with power-crazed security guards who initially have them under their control. The rest of the movie unfolds from this point onwards as all the party endeavour to remain alive.The acting isn't expected to be A-class but it is more than decent to be quite honest. With Rhames, as Kenneth, you're getting a presence on screen like few others - he *makes* you pay attention, and that's something an actor cannot buy - he either has it or not. Polley is decent enough as Ana, doing an acceptable job of being a Ripley style character without quite stealing the show. Jake Weber, as Michael, is pretty decent as well and it's commendable than even though Rhames is a heck of a powerhouse, he never really overshadows Weber.Other characters are reasonably well played too, and it's a testament to the improvement in the standard of Hollywood in this type of film that even the *relatively* peripheral characters are played well.The special effects are more than worth a mention as well, with some very exciting moments and some truly awe-inspiring moments aiding the film's narrative extremely well. The only weakness is the truly awful looking CGI helicopter. At least I hope it's CGI otherwise something went badly wrong with the way it was filmed.The movie, naturally, is a gore fest far in excess of the appalling Resident Evil, and more akin to its true father trilogy. Using modern standards on those old gory but unconvincing effects really smarts well, and to those with weaker stomachs this film would be hard to watch.The direction cannot be faulted - it pushes along the story and there's always plenty of action in each scene to keep interest.The plot itself was never *that* strong, and that's not changed here. It's relatively peripheral such is the claustrophobic nature of the movie, and is more a tale of survival than an epic yarn.Sure, the oldies are always 'the best' but in this remake they've done a good job of making a movie worthy of the name.",Null,0,0,25 October 2004
12 Monkeys," As complex as they come, but ultimately rewarding
","This is a film which does not pretend to be simple, nor does it try to be straight forward, but stick with it to the end and it is ultimately a pretty satisfying ride, even if certain illogicalities serve to baffle.This Terry Gilliam effort is a slightly apocalyptic tale of the future, with mankind's majority having been wiped out by some kind of virus. Now underground where the air is breathable, our future selves have developed time travel it seems, and wish to use it to send volunteers back in time in order to somehow figure out how the virus broke out and use that knowledge to escape the confines of their enforced prison.The always highly personable Bruce Willis is James Cole, one of said volunteers in this future time. He goes back in time but ends up in 1990. Suffice to say his mission to find '12 Monkeys', which seems to be some kind of army responsible for the problems mankind now suffers, goes very wrong and the rest of the film is a convoluted story which requires a good level of concerted concentration from the viewer.Without question this is a demanding picture. The plot and direction are rich with subtleties and vast amounts of information, and you need to be on your toes to make sense of it all. The biggest problem with it on a technical level is much of the dialogue is viciously mumbled or delivered way too quickly. Lots of it simply passes you by, particularly Brad Pitt's over imposing Jeffrey and his rapid fire diatribe. Willis' Cole doesn't suffer this so badly, fortunately, but the overall audio quality perhaps lacks at times and the clarity of dialogue could be better.The actual performances are generally pretty good. Willis' Cole is neatly understated, and makes an effective reluctant hero. Madeleine Stowe is fairly convincing as Railly, the psychiatrist who initially takes Cole in as a patient when he arrives in 1990 and babbles inanely about nonsensicals, but Pitt is basically a bit too boisterous and too much as Jeffrey, a mental institute patient Cole meets in the hospital in 1990.As touched on earlier, the direction is pretty decent, and it helps the story move on reasonably fluidly. It's maybe not quite as immersive as it should be, but it does enough to facilitate the narrative.Overall it's a decent film really, and if you find yourself interested in philosophy and determinism et al you'll find this particularly satisfying. You'll also get a kick out of it as a time travel movie.There are certainly a fair few inconsistencies, and things which make no sense, but it does enough to merit inclusion as one of the better films I've seen.",7,0,0,28 January 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Engaging enough but overrated for sure
","As another Brit comedy flick, Shaun of the Dead certainly has some illustrious peers such as Lock Stock and 4 Weddings. However, while it's certainly not in the same league as any of these it still holds its own reasonably well.Simon Pegg is Shaun, an average joe sales assistant in a fairly crummy flat with very little to look forward to. Ed is his best friend and flatmate and when everyone begins to turn into a zombie (This one ain't overly realistic) they put together a motley crew and set out to survive the onslaught of the dead walking.Yes, more than a nod towards the Romero 'Dead' trilogy is in evidence here, not least of all in the *name*. Plenty of other homages are showcased but it obviously helps to have seen the originals otherwise you just won't 'get' them.This *is* a comedy, but it lacks a lot of laughs, and that is the main criticism. When it tries to be funny it succeeds, but it doesn't try often enough. This is a huge shame. There are many moments of amusement which aren't belly laughs, but for a comedy you expect to laugh out loud a little more often.A very clique cast is featured here, with actors and actresses who are known as off-screen friends playing most of the main roles. That chemistry works on screen in places but not all.The direction does what it's supposed to without being especially inspiring, and the acting is sitcom standard. Overall it's decent enough entertainment, but ultimately it could have been a bit better.",Null,0,0,26 September 2004
12 Angry Men," Greatest movie ever made
","Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic.Starring Henry Fonda as Juror #8, 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. On the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. Only one dissenter remains, and that is Henry Fonda's Juror #8. Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt.12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. Indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. Initially it may seem that Fonda's Juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. The more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers.Obviously, Juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws.The whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life.To detail the jurors themselves; Juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. He appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. He does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge.Juror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. He does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value.Juror #3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner. May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. As time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. But he refuses to cave.Juror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. Experiences inner conflict between head and heart.Juror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. Emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others.Juror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion.Juror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. Doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice.Juror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. He meets much opposition.Juror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths.Juror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. A vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them.Juror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. His European accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought.Juror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job.Overall, 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get. Incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction.Highly recommended.",10,12,19,28 May 2007
Hostel," Complete, and total, and absolute drivel
","Idea inspired by the grim horror of Texas Chainsaw Massacre fails miserably in every sense to even vaguely emulate that classic.I'd heard a little about this movie - such as the extremely squeamish gore levels and pain contained therein, and always enjoying dramatic and edgy cinema, decided to give it a spin.I have never regretted watching a movie more in my life; this is up there with those luminary shambles such as Resident Evil, Cabin Fever and Darkness Falls. If I'd known this was from the hand of Eli Roth, the same man responsible for the dire and truly pitiful afforementioned Cabin Fever, there is no way I'd have committed myself to wasting 2 hours on it.Hostel is set out in the Eastern Bloc of Europe, namely the small nation of Slovakia, after initially being set in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.A group of 3 friends are enjoying the hedonistic pleasures of the flesh offered by the seedy districts of Holland's capital, before a chance encounter with an apparent pimp sets them on course to travelling east where a hostel hosting the most beautiful and sexually precocious women is apparently situated.Unfortunately for them, it is also the location for a torture chamber, and they have no idea of what visceral depravity and horror awaits.As one can clearly tell, this is inspired by the style of Texas Chainsaw Massacre - a 'group' of conspirators try to lure unsuspecting victims into a dungeon in which vicious and unspeakable hells lurk, carried out out by psychotic lynchmen.Regrettably it shares only that similarity with TCM and nothing else; a truly appalling, shallow, and thoroughly disjointed plot which commits the cardinal sin of being fundamentally boring completely undermines this movie's chances of being half decent. There is simply no point here; once the first sequence of torture is over, you find yourself wondering why the hell you're watching this drivel. I was very close to quitting entirely, but it switched elsewhere, deluding me into thinking there might actually be a moral or purpose concealed within.But there simply wasn't. This mess was a monumental hash - implausible, pointless, bereft of originality and poorly conceived. Plus if you only watch the first 30 or so minutes, you'd think it was practically soft porn.The one saving grace is that the acting was actually OK, and nowhere near as pitiful as Cabin Fever's, for example.Eli Roth clearly cannot do horror, and I plead with him to refrain from trying again.",1,1,3,16 November 2006
Us," Jordan Peele = M Night Shyamalan?
","When 1999's Sixth Sense came out, it made a star of its director, M Night Shyamalan. His reputation soared, but the American newcomer's stock plummeted from there, and he was never able to make a film as good as that again.Get Out, from Jordan Peele, made a similar star of its rookie director, and while the final portion of the film lost its way a little, the story certainly got under our skin.Sadly, the follow up, Us, is a bit of a comparative fail and struggles to secure the credibility its director's debut managed. Sounding familiar.Trying to follow up a major and unexpected hit like Get Out was never going to be easy, but Peele really has dropped the bomb here, and made a duffer.To sum Us up, little girl goes through trauma, and then as an adult her family are attacked by a group of four people who look exactly like them.For the first portion of the story, it manages to be interesting - it's intriguing, what happened to her, what has she grown into now, how does she deal with the past.But then the bad guys show up, and way too is given to the viewer on a plate, and while the story is certainly intentionally funny at times, it fails as both a horror and a psychological thriller.It just doesn't work, and manages, in fact, to be boring in major areas - and sadly the twist ending is a diabolical mess and is guilty of the 'Scott Shelby Fallacy' (players of Heavy Rain will get this one).I just didn't buy any of this, and after such a strong debut, I can only presume Peele tried too hard and tripped over his own ego. Frankly some of the content in this was completely idiotic.It's not the worst movie of all time, but it's a poor follow up to such a strong first film, and it makes me very wary indeed of Candyman.Hmmmm.",6,0,2,2 May 2020
The Day After Tomorrow," Cheese factor 100
","Day After Tomorrow is another in a long line of modern disaster movies, more or less started by Independence Day. True to form it provides popcorn nonsense and appalling dialogue.Dennis Quaid is Jack, a climatologist (Or something) who has, as they always do in these films, a troubled family life due to his workaholic mentality. However, being not too bad at his job (as they always are in these films) he discovers the Polar Ice Caps are melting as a result of global warming due to our usage of fossil fuels etc and the current of the Altantic is being altered by the flooding into the sea of the reservoirs of ice.*phew*Essentially he tells anyone who'll listen that an impending ice age is on its way, and fortunately a few kind souls believe him and give him time to prove it.The next stage is the son, played by Jake Gyllenhaal who's isolated in Manhatten with some school friends and others as a result of the crippling weather. Yeah, you can predict the ending already...This is pure utter fluff. It's hardly even worth skimming any more of the nonsense plot such is the sheer lightweighted nature of it. The substance, if that's the word, of the story is based on the appalling dialogue and cheesy delivery of it. The amount of cringeworthy material here is enough to sink the Titanic, never mind an audience's tolerance.The special effects are the real star of this, and it must be said they're pretty darn good. The storms look breathtaking, and the tidal wave is fairly convincing. Furthermore the panoramic scale views of cities is pretty impressive as well.Without question the effects save this from being absolute tripe, and fortunately the players here are aware this is hardly serious stuff and seem to ham it up on purpose. There are plenty of moments which give an unintentional laugh from the director's point of view, but intentionally from the cast. They never seem to take it seriously for a second. Well, either this or they're just *really* bad...It's mindless drivel and absolute rubbish but it's personable enough entertainment for a couple of hours if you're bored.",Null,0,0,4 October 2004
Cloverfield," Lives up to the hype
","Blair Witch really does meet Godzilla in epic disaster movie which thrills and entertains.It must be said that a fine job was done of using viral networking to promote this movie. This built up hype beyond what marketed promotion can ever achieve, but of course has the knock on effect of creating a monster (no pun intended) which may fail to live up to the expectations.With Blair Witch already having used the same method of advertising, and being of the same filming style, Cloverfield had to hope its product was at least as good as that seminal classic.And quite frankly, it is probably better.Cloverfield, in brief summary, sees Manhattan attacked by a huge beast which appears to come from nowhere. Obviously, this basic premise is caked in 100% fantasy but there are clear 9/11 overtones throughout, particularly the main characters coughing in dust-dense air, but these real life comparisons should end there.This movie is fiction, and is about a group of 20 somethings as they desperately try to survive the onslaught, and of course, the main selling point of the story is that it is all told through the camcorder one of them has, in order to document the whole ordeal. There is no 'fancy' and glossy Hollywood celluloid here, it is all through the eye of a 'gritty' camera. Of course, the wonderful benefit of this is that by having the 'real' look, the actual special effects also manage to convince entirely. Under a glossy movie, it is that bit less convincing, but out of this kind? It really works much, much better - same budget, but real look.The acting is also extremely good, and frankly barely even looks acted - the real look correlates to how the performances come across - they look terrified, confused, and there are even moments where dialogue seems improvised or 'stumbled' - further increasing the realism instead of pristinely articulated lines.A love story is even thrown in for good measure, but rather than being cheesy, it fits well - indeed, the whole movie just fits - and even manages to amuse in places. Hud, in particular, with his inept and ignorantly awkward conduct, provides many laughs.This really is a great movie and a hell of a lot of fun. Yeah, it's only 74 minutes or so long, but I'm not sure more could have been added to it to lengthen it, and of course there's the point about the camera's battery life. Further realism.I highly recommend this one unreservedly.",8,1,4,7 April 2008
Silent Hill," Average as a movie but good as a game adaptation
","Horror game franchise comes to life on the big screen, and the flavour of the games is well captured.Silent Hill, as a game, always preyed on our deepest darkest fears. It projected an innate wrongness and the monsters in it were designed to defy what we had come to expect from horror - add to that a wretched doomed atmosphere and hideous graphics which propagated a genuinely sinister and foreboding facade. This was the strength of the Silent Hill games, and any successful movie would have to go to town to create the same effect.Silent Hill, as a movie, succeeds superbly at this, certainly for the first half of the story. The locations, the events, some of the characters and *even* some of the camera shots are dead ringers for the game, and those familiar with it will find themselves totally engulfed in the Silent Hill world.The buildings, the monsters, the foggy town, even the change to Dark Silent Hill are absolutely bang on the money and make afficionados feel completely at home.The story is close to the original game; a woman, Rose (Where it used to be a man, Harry Mason) drives her daughter (Sharon) to the town of Silent Hill but has an accident. Her daughter disappears from the car (In exactly the same way as the game) and the movie is then her hunt to find her.Throughout the movie you'll notice homages to the sequels of the original game - and all of them are very convincing and clearly time has gone into producing a movie with this level of accuracy to the games.As such, Silent Hill was a serious horror game and the gore factor and hideousness of monsters and deaths is exactly what you expect. There is even a fair bit of imagination going on to give it a creative edge.The acting is staple, without being anything outstanding, but what else would you expect from Hollywood horror? Sean Bean has a rather small role as the husband/father and it seems slightly strange to see him in this kind of movie, and putting on a pseudo-American accent which never convinces. As Rose, Laurie Holden does a fair amount of screaming and looking panic stricken - exactly what she needs to do.The direction is very good indeed - it's a fast moving film and never slows down unnecessarily. The special effects are also very impressive - lots of CGI went into this to create convincing monsters and atmosphere effects, and they work very well indeed.Overall, as a story it's not bad although there are several comical leaps of logic - but you'll forgive them. It does lose its way ever so slightly in the second half where it goes for maximum confusion, but in a way it's actually the best method because the game went the same way in terms of plot. It just perhaps doesn't translate to the big screen so well. But the makers did as good a job of making it as simple as they could while remaining faithful to the game.Horror fans will get a fair kick out of it although recognising it's not the greatest horror one will ever see, and devotees of the games will certainly enjoy its accuracy.",6,2,4,15 August 2006
The Expendables," Brainless action fun at its finest
","Let's get one thing out of the way immediately; if you look at a blu ray cover and see Sly Stallone, Jason Statham and Steve Austin on it, it's a sure-fire thing you know exactly what you are getting when you stick the disk in.This is not Pride & Prejudice, nor is it Blade Runner. What it is is exactly what it suggests on the cover; a cracking hour and a half of explosions, fisticuffs and shoot-outs featuring an amazing ensemble of many of the 80s finest action heroes plus more recent ones like Jet Li and aforementioned Statham.While nowhere near as prolific a director as he is actor, Sylvester Stallone has nevertheless proved himself many times as extremely effective shouting 'action' as he is likewise saying 'Adrian'.With previous credits including 3 of the Rocky movies, plus the Rambo remake, Stallone is no slouch when it comes to having an eye for a good action movie. He has made a career of pretending to be quite dim when the man is clearly a lot brighter than many give him credit for, and that is evident again in Expendables.The story, a flimsy load of nonsense, is just a vehicle in this movie to travel from one explosive action scene to another, and quite simply it works brilliantly. The fights are bone-crunchingly satisfying, the shootouts crazily hectic and the explosions so over the top you'll smile and giggle like a kid reliving these kinds of moments from Hollywood's past.What IS surprising is the level of acting and characterisation - while in places the voice clarity is very poor, nevertheless the narrative in terms of the protagonists is actually half decent, and the viewer genuinely wants Sly and his chums to succeed. A little touch of class was casting Mickey Rourke and his brief monologue in the middle works because you buy him - we saw him in the Wrestler as a hopeless case and he achieves it here too. Mainly because while the words are fake, the emotion is real given Rourke has hardly had an easy ride.But getting back to why we watch it, the explosions, the fights, and the shootouts - they're compelling, engaging, well staged and the humour which punctuates them is used perfectly. The one-liners here, including the multitude of in-jokes and nostalgic references are delivered with aplomb.With Stallone's fun-filled direction and an excellent cast who do their jobs very well indeed, this is a very enjoyable piece of brainless entertainment.I do agree with another review which pointed out the one flaw which was the unconvincing CGI sequences which were obviously digital. They did rather blot some shots. That aside there's really little to complain about here.Just don't expect The Shawshank Redemption.",10,0,4,8 October 2013
Lost in Translation," Nice story
","This is a fairly straightforward tale.Bill Murray is Bob Harrison, a US movie star spending a week in Tokyo to promote whiskey. Scarlet Johansson is Charlotte,with her photographer husband, and like Bob is essentially bored and lonely and feeling slightly dissillusioned with everything.The movie is basically about true platonic love between the older Bob and the teenage Charlotte, who spend a lot of time with each other and find something beyond true friendship.The story charts the progression of their relationship and counter-balances it nicely with the feeling of despair they both feel in the unfamiliar Tokyo.Performances are uniformly excellent with sympathetic characters mixed with irritating and quirky ones, which all meld nicely together to make a fairly involved narrative.It's simple, effective, and above all, it gets the equilibrium of all its elements just right.Recommended.",Null,0,1,23 May 2004
Interstellar," It's not his best, but it's still stunning
","Many people will claim to be 'Christopher Nolan's biggest fan', so I'll add myself to that list as a huge admirer of his work, and to the group that can't actually believe he hasn't won an Oscar.Consequently my hopes are always sky high when it comes to his latest movie, and when it came to Inception, while it took two views, my hopes turned out conservative.But we're here for Interstellar. When it emerged Nolan's next picture was to essentially turn his attention to space my trust was implicit in him that it would be something special - and those hopes were realised, but I will concede he has done even more special work than this.Interstellar sees McConaughy's retired naval pilot Coop trapped in a borderline post-apocalyptic earth of the near future where dust and blight are basically killing all crops and mankind with them. The only way to save man is to find a new home, and Michael Caine's Professor Brand has a plan to achieve that, but it will require Coop to abandon his family (including beloved daughter Murph) for an indeterminate period while the plan goes into action.So just how good is Interstellar? Plot wise it's another which requires a couple of views to get the most out of it, and while you will feel much more satisfied on that second viewing, there will remain questions which come as a result of the topic - space, time travel and quantum mechanics are astounding topics to take on in cinema, and Nolan would never have been able to cover them all flawlessly. It's a fantastically compelling story, which has created a massive world of intrigue within itself - philosophical questions will abound for months, years afterwards, and those little plot holes probably only add to that.Directorally I would concede it is not his best piece of work - some aspects here are a little muddled and not overly clear - such a convoluted storyline was impossible to smooth over completely - but cinematography-wise it's by far his best. Some of the cascading views you will see here, in conjuction with the truly staggering special effects/CGI (the black hole and tsunamis are simply gorgeous), are mesmerising and probably the best ever seen in cinema.It is a slight pity, in terms of plot, that while it's well known Nolan made this his most personal and emotional film yet, the themes of love don't truly convince in the way they're delivered. A monologue Anne Hathaway's Brand gives reeks of Nolan's own opinion desperate to find a place for itself in this story, and it doesn't work.But the soundtrack does - very different to Inception, and no less epic, haunting or beautiful, even if the same riffs and melodies tend to be reused a lot.The acting? McConaughy's muddy Texan accent still struggles to make sense - same trouble with True Detective, but that aside it's entirely flawless from the entire cast.And lastly the ending. Some will not be happy with it - my issue with it was how abruptly it was delivered, and how the mild flaws in overall direction led to it not being as coherent as it could have.Overall it is still a 10/10 - Nolan is judged in different ways to mere mortal directors, and the only one of his films I haven't got as 10/10 is Insomnia, itself a remake. But it's the weakest of his non-Batman movies.Still outstanding though.",10,0,3,26 September 2015
Full Metal Jacket," Certainly entertaining and polished, but no Apocalypse Now
","A film by the legendary Stanley Kubrick is always going to be worth viewing, but by his own standards, this is just nothing more than good.Matthew Modine is Joker, a new recruit in the US marine core. War has broken out in Vietnam and new soldiers are being taken on with more velocity than before. However, rather than just immediately taking us on a trip through the battlefields, Full Metal Jacket starts at the very beginning where new blood is trained and abused, and readied for the harsh realities of war by their gunnary sergeant Hartman. Wickedly played by Lee Ermey, Hartman's dialogue is nothing short of fantastic, almost legendary, and while there's a touch of the overblown drill sergeant stereotype about him, his sheer entertainment value more than compensates.His job is to sort these young men out and train them for battle. Modine's Joker is the one to show a touch of 'spunk' and as such earns his name, not to mention Hartman's respect.Anyway, events take us to Vietnam and where Joker's stationed after induction. As part of a war newspaper, he along with his photographer colleague Rafterman go out to where the action's hotting up. Before too long, war truly breaks out and he finds himself in the thick of it all.That's as much as I can say without entirely ruining the plot, so I'll halt there.The one thing which stands out here is the sheer feel of Kubrick. His movies all have the hallmark of his touch, and it's in absolute evidence here. From the dynamic moving cameras, to the slightly surreal ambiance at times, it has all his trademarks.However, one thing which perhaps is lacking is powerful acting. Modine is pretty staple, and the rest of the players are merely 'there'. Only the gunnary sergeant and Pile are truly impressive and genuinely strong characters.There is also a lack of soundtrack to aid the flow of the story. Perhaps Kubrick felt music wasn't totally suited to this but somehow the empty score detracts slightly.The direction is obviously top class, with some stunning cinematography and amazing shots. Many of the scenes are truly involving such is the clarity and intimacy of how the movie is captured. You really feel part of this one.Furthermore the plot and script is really strong, with an extremely well constructed picture in evidence - it's completely believable and never expects you to suspend your disbelief at all.However, for all its technical mastery and strong narrative, there's an overall lack of genuine punch. Apocalypse Now, for example, leaves you reeling and Full Metal Jacket doesn't really smart like it.While it is a good film, a good war film, it's perhaps not quite the engaging and thought provoking piece of cinema that Kubrick's other efforts were.",7,0,3,30 December 2004
The Bourne Identity," Engaging enough for the duration
","Despite what it thinks of itself, Bourne Identity is an old fashioned spy thriller with a slight psychological overtone and a substantial helping of action.The film picks up out on a rough sea and a fishing boat which spots a body floating in the choppy water. On recovering the man, the crew find out he's alive and lay him out to rest. The doctor (Presumably) removes 2 bullets from the man's back and a strange lazer device from his neck/head. On waking, the man realises he has absolutely no idea who he is and his only clue is the lazer device. On docking, he begins to realize he has skills beyond what most people do, with a heightened level of physique and instinct. Bourne Identity sees the man, Jason Bourne, set out to discover his identity and to find out what happened to him aided and abetted by Marie, a drifter he encounters at the American Embassy in Switzerland.Matt Damon puts in a pretty good turn as Bourne, and looks suitably confused by the general situation and the events going on around him, and Franka Potente is reasonable as Marie - certainly convincing enough for the purposes of this type of film.The action is pretty exciting in general, but it suffers from the 'God' syndrome. As Bourne himself is so damn skilled, he never seems in danger at all so it's not as thrilling as it should be.The plot comes thick and fast and never lets up, but the problem is there are a few aspects which are decidedly confusing and the ending feels a bit nicey nicey and hollow.It's a decent enough ride but ultimately I didn't get much out of it.",Null,0,1,14 October 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Better than Reloaded but not as good as the original
","When the original was released, it was hailed in many quarters as a masterpiece. It was certainly original, and used foundation of many concepts of philosophy as its plot base. However, the ending was a bit of an anti-climax really, and a few questions remain unanswered. Reloaded overdid the cheese element, made the plot totally baffling, but featured a thrilling freeway scene. So now it is left to Revolutions to tie up all the loose ends and conclude the story. Right? Nah, not really. It doesn't answer much at all, and ultimately isn't a conclusion, but is still a decent enough movie. Many are taking it way too seriously - yes, as a climax it's anti-climatical, and a bit shallow, but it's still a good enough ride and will entertain you. If you let it.Die hard fans of the series may feel hard-done by, and as a whole trilogy it probably falls flat on its face, but if you judge each movie seperately it's a good enough film.",Null,0,0,14 November 2003
The Village," The most stupid and absurd film ever made?
","Can I start by conveying my absolute disbelief that this film scored as highly as 6.5 on IMDb?The Village is the latest offering from M Night Shyamalan, and I began viewing with tredipation such is the downward spiral of his career. Sixth Sense was magnificent, Unbreakable was quirky and passable, Signs was brilliantly directed but ultimately its ending ruined it, and now this.The Village is set around the 18th century and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius, a young and reserved man living in a small town. The town has a chequered past, in that there is a serious and dangerous rivalry between it and another village which mirrors it on the opposite side of a large forest which separates both. There is a tense 'ceasefire' between the villages so peace seems to be present. Indeed, in the forest itself there are dangers so the villagers *never* go in. There is also a colour code too - red represents the danger of the forest, and is forbidden in the village. However, when it seems that the truce between the 2 villages has been broken, the walls of civilization apparently begin to crack, and chaos starts to dominate life in the village.To say any more could spoil the story, so the summation will halt there. There is a good cast here; Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody make up a very strong group of actors. You are given at least decent performances by them all, but Weaver and Brody are both criminally underused and woefully miscast. Brody was the pianist for goodness sake and he's been reduced to a minor Forrest Gump-style character in this. Why on earth did he accept such a poor role? Weaver also deserves better. Little more than a peripheral character, Lucius' mother, she's truly Hollywood royalty and such a small part to play is a complete waste of her time.Phoenix is the main character along with the relatively unheard of Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy, daughter of William Hurt's Walker, and all 3 of the above are given fairly meaty roles, particularly Hurt who's by far the best thing about the Village. Howard is slightly melodramatic and sentimental, and Phoenix isn't sympathetic enough, though reasonable, as the almost autistic Lucius.Outside of the basic flaws which I'll get to later, The Village suffers pretty feeble direction. Signs was far better, and almost an exercise in how to direct a thriller. The Village, on the other hand, seems to bore with its direction, and completely lacks interest. However, the main gripe is simply the ridiculousness of it all. This is an unbelievably contrived film, which simply defies sensibilities and makes up its own rules. Being different can be good, but doing it for the sake of is really not. This film at times feels like a 15 year old is just making it up on the spot.The ending is simply vacuous and not clever at all. There is no way I can bring myself to say 'ah, so *that's* why it's been ridiculous, oh, well that's really smart then'. Believe me, I've tried.Overall this is a silly and futile film which is partially saved by Hurt, but its stupidities cost it dearly.Avoid.",2,2,4,14 December 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Tremendous fun which does well to continue the legacy
","It's been a long time. 6 years between the first and second, and now 13 years after the second, the 3rd.In the hype up to production and release, the fervour around this movie centred on the absence of many key players in the previous 2 installments - such as Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong, Robert Patrick, and, of course, James Cameron. So we have merely Mario Kassar (Producer), Stan Winston effects studios, and of course, Arnie. But to say the new director makes this an inferior movie would be innaccurate. Although there *is* a new feel to this, it's not a bad one. It's just different. Whether you can accept that will decide whether you enjoy this. The story obviously continues on from T2 but I won't give away exactly how it achieves this, because that's half the mystery. Arnie *is* the Terminator - his presence on screen is magic - he has the same 'charisma' as he had previously and still convinces. He's not quite as sympathetic as he was before, because he's playing a different kind of role this time. Kristanna Loken, as the Terminatrix, manages to ooze sexy danger pretty well. Sure, she's no Robert Patrick, and has little dialogue, but she does portray the cold efficient invincible nature of the Terminatrix pretty well. As John Conner, Stahl does a decent, if perhaps slightly uninspired job. He's probably the weakest player. Clare Danes is staple, again nothing particularly special. One aspect of T2 which is enhanced here is the comedy - there are many snappy one liners and humourous moments which serve well to counter the serious theme. The special effects are pretty seamless, and epic as we would expect. But the explosions are a tad overdone. I've never heard a noisier movie in my life. Some of them seemed just a bit unnecessary. As for the story, well it kept me gripped. I missed certain characters and the previous atmosphere, but this still did enough to have been pretty much worth the wait. If you like Terminator you *will* get a kick out of this.(Look out for a cracking cameo from a previous character)",Null,0,0,7 August 2003
"I, Robot"," Good mix of action and philosophy
","Like the Matrix and many other major movies, I, Robot has its foundations in philosophy, in its case the question of epistemology(The study of knowledge itself and computers being self-aware).Will Smith is Spooner, a cop with an apparent attitude problem. Set in the future, I Robot sees Spooner embarking on a puzzling case of suicide where he believes it was actually murder. By a robot.In this future society (With more than a homage to Blade Runner) robots are used as slaves of humans in all facets of life. They have 3 rules of conduct hard coded into them which essentially state they cannot harm humans. So the postulation by Spooner that a robot killed a man after a history where no robot had ever committed so much as a mugging presents a big problem to both his peers and his boss.Suffice to say the story's plot thickens and a number of twists and turns emerge before the truth is revealed.Will Smith is an absolute surprise here. Having previously been a light-hearted comedy actor he puts in a truly excellent and believable shift as a wise-cracking cop with a dark past.However, the real star is the special effects and visual trickery. Impossible but ingenious camerawork and some jawdropping animation really make I, Robot feel truly alive and utterly believable, while never being dull for a second.It arguably doesn't delve too deep into its philosophical undertones, but it doesn't really need to.

","Knowing little about Apocalypse Now bar it being set during the Vietnam conflict, I viewed the Redux version with a completely open mind.
Having journeyed through a 3 hour 15 minute epic I can only say this really is as breathtaking and brilliant a movie as I'd been led to believe.Martin Sheen is Captain Willard, a soldier stationed in Saigon after various missions in Vietnam. Holed up alone, he is picked to undertake an assassination mission of the reclusive Colonel Kutz, played by the ever-marvellous Marlon Brando. Getting to Kutz will not be easy, such is the isolation he's ended up in deep in Cambodia. The mission is based on the fact the American army believes Kutz to have become insane, and commanding armies on the wrong side of the war. 'His methods are unsound'. Willard must infiltrate Kutz' army and murder the man himself.However, to say it will be an epic journey is an understatement of some magnitude and summing it all up is practically impossible.The many strengths of this movie result in a level of depth which is quite flabbergasting. The acting is absolutely outstanding and incredibly convincing. We undoubtably care about the characters such is the warmth and affection with which they are portrayed. Even the lesser-featured characters are vastly significant in their own right, such as Robert Duvall's gung-ho Kilgore - he loves the smell of napalm in the morning. And then there's the spaced out but endearing photographer, played by the energetic Dennis Hopper. Similar character to who he was in Easy Rider, but more exaggerated here.Then there is the quite superb direction/cinematography. Each scene has an amazing amount of life within it, with camera work which has to be seen to be believed. Some of the shots are just astounding, either encompassing impressive scale battle, or more humble close ups. I don't quite know how Ford Coppola did it, but this was a masterstroke and a lesson in filmmaking.A review of Apocalypse Now would be empty without mention of the enigmatic Brando. Every scene he is in he steals just as he did in the Godfather. The man was the human embodiment of the brilliance of cinema, and while he's not on-screen for a massive amount, he still becomes by far and away the most important and intriguing character in the entire tale.To summise, Apocalypse Now is everything a movie needs to be; gripping, dramatic, intruiging, exciting and personable. One of the all time greats? Without doubt.",9,3,3,17 August 2004
Face_Off," Cracking entertainment, thrillingly played
","I'm really not a fan of John Woo - Broken Arrow was alright, and MI2 was shallow.However, I decided to give him another try with this one, and to my utter delight this is leagues ahead of the rest.Face Off is an action thriller flick with a little hint of sci-fi, and a big arch-nemesis theme. Sean Archer (John Travolta, initially) is the good cop who's up against the bad assassin type feller Castor Troy (Nicholas Cage). However, after capturing him, he realises there's a bomb and only Troy and his brother know where it is. So in order to get the information, Archer *becomes* Troy via a face transplant. However, it all goes wrong, of course, and Troy comes back and steals Archer's identity and wrecks all the evidence proving the existence of the mission...Convoluted plot on paper, but in the movie it all works really well, and is marvellously directed. Plenty of thrills, plenty of spills, and all players appear to be having a great time, particularly Travolta when he becomes Troy.Great yarn, and Woo's best for my money.",Null,0,0,11 January 2004
Dark City," Elegant, thrilling and visionary piece of sci-fi
","With overtones of Blade Runner very evident here, Dark City seems derivative at first glance. Look deeper though and you'll see a movie which stands alone in what it achieves.Rufus Sewell is John Murdoch, who wakes alone in a bath with no memory of who he is. He discovers certain strange clues in the house he's in and sets about trying to remember the past from them.There are, however, strange looking people called the Strangers after him who appear to not be of this world, while a sinister doctor seems to be attempting to help him from afar.On further investigation he begins to discover the city is hiding a huge secret, and people are being manipulated in unimaginable ways by the Strangers, but for some reason he's not amongst them and the Strangers want to know why they can't affect him.Not only the people are being modified, but the city is too, and every so often everyone falls asleep while their minds are messed with and their city is changed, something they're oblivious to.One clue drives Murdoch on though - a postcard from a place called Shell Beach, but no one seems to know the way though they know of the place.
Add to this highly complex plot his estranged wife who he doesn't remember and who hurt him badly in some way, and the fact he is wanted for the murder of 6 prostitutes with William Hurt's Detective Bumfield hot on his trail and you have a very complex sci-fi thriller with epic overtures.Dark City is pretty well acted, without being spectacular. Overacting is rife in places (Particular from Kiefer Sutherland as Doctor Shreber), but it suits the environment and setting well.Sewell is convincing as the baffled Murdoch, and makes the part his own with a level of charisma which seems surprising.The plot moves thick and fast, with nary a moment where things slow down - this keeps us glued without managing to confuse us.If you like sci-fi you'll like this, and if you don't and want an apparent action-packed thriller with psychological overtones you'll also get a kick out of it.Great story, and well realised.",Null,1,4,6 June 2004
The Exorcist," Impressive piece of cinema, but hardly scary
","As one of the most controversial movies ever made, the Exorcist was one of the first to so explicitly target religion in such a mainstream way. Viewed as a work of heresy by the Catholic church, the Exorcist's plot centres around young Regan, the daughter of a famous actress, who seems to be possessed by Lucifer himself. After trying everything down the medical road, her mother turns to religion, and Father Damien Karras.Karras recently lost his mother and blames himself, and added to this the fact he seems to have lost his faith would compel us to believe he's not the best reverand to be dealing with an exorcism. Enter Max von Sydow's Father Merrin who's previously carried out a 4 month exorcism, however, and the 2 of them take Hades on, head to head.This film goes down in folklore due to the hype and reputation surrounding it. And yet, when we probe the surface, what we really find is a simple good Vs evil yarn, albeit with a supernatural twist.It must be said that Blair is quite incredible as Regan/the demon, and never fails to convince us that she is either or both. The makeup and special effects are extremely well realised, and there's no doubt that in the 70's, this would have been terrifying stuff. Nowadays, however, the likes of Ring have eclipsed this on fear levels, and consequently I barely even got a chill out of this - but I *did* thoroughly enjoy it. The level of 'wrongness' is quite good, what with the semi-subliminal demon imagery, and the all-round performance of Blair - especially that Spider walk down the stairs...All in all it adds to really a rather enjoyable and impressive piece of work.",9,1,2,7 June 2004
American History X," Stunning move with powerful message
","First things first - Edward Norton was superb in this, but so was Edward Furlong. The story is about hate, specifically racial. Problem is the outline of the story gives away too much, so I'll say this: Norton is a nazi-skinhead who despises 'foreigners' because they apparently leech off his country's government and cause American 'natives' to go without. Truth is he is just a racist who hates anyone who isn't a white christian. The movie is about how he justifies this existence and causes his own brother to follow the same path. Telling more would spoil it.The story is brilliantly told without stereotyping different races - it shows how hate exists as a pre-meditated evil of society.Excellent.",10,0,0,15 August 2002
Resident Evil," Absolutely awful - but had to be seen!
","As a *very* big fan of the games I had to see this.I knew it would be tripe, and it was. The acting was dreadful, the action wasn't particularly exciting and the zombies looked unintentionally hilarious. In places it was boring too, with a distinct lack of chemistry between any actors and poor 'one liners'. They went for a serious movie and came up with a joke. Romero's screenplay got him sacked and they came up with this instead?As for the actual linkage between the games and the movie, well it was sparse. There were definitely similarities in places, but not particularly good ones. None of the characters from the games are here which is a huge gamble. Overall, if you're a fan of the games, see this because you'll want to - but be warned that it's terrible.A number of 'patrons' actually left half way through. I was tempted to do the same but thought better of it. On a side note, the certification in UK gave this a 15? What does it take to get a an 18?",4,0,1,23 July 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Intriguing premise eventually let down
","It seems that the less we know, the better a movie sometimes is.Butterfly Effect starts out *extremely* promisingly, with more than a hint of a psychological edge.Ashton Kutcher is Evan, a lad who's suffered mysterious blackouts for years, but into his late teens is impressed to have gone 7 years without a single one. They were always the same - he'd suddenly gain consciousness and find himself in a position he can't remember getting into. This made for a decidedly interesting plot, but unfortunately the more we see, the sillier it gets. When a date comes back to his college dorm and discovers the journals he used to write as a result of advice from his doctor (With respect to the blackouts), she asks him to read out loud what he wrote. However, amazingly while reading it he finds himself back in time during an incident which occurred in his youth. This sets up the rest of the movie as he realises his journals are a portal to his past, and to discovering what happened during his blackouts.On paper this really does sound promising, but somehow it just doesn't work. Kutcher is hardly versatile as an actor, so he's not entirely convincing if tolerable enough, but the plot does him no favours. The concept of going back in time is unbelievable enough, but the idea that reading a notebook out loud achieves this journey is nothing short of ridiculous. Even now, I still can't fathom what on earth chaos theory (Which is what the title Butterfly Effect refers to) has to do with this. This is nothing more than a popcorn timetravel movie about changing destiny, yet the title refers to the concept of how one insignificant action on one side of the Atlantic (Like a butterfly flapping its wings) could cause a hurricane on the other side of the Atlantic. Totally unprovable of course, but also far removed from the 'chain reaction' plot of Butterfly Effect.Anyway, forgiving this discrepancy and back to criticising the story, because while there's no doubt it holds your attention throughout, it is just so silly. It loses its psychological grip once the main plot device kicks in and descends into implausible and convoluted sci-fi.It is hard to sum up the film, such is its nature, but suffice to say it is let down by its own attempt at being original.",Null,1,4,28 June 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Great idea, badly done, but tolerable
","AVP was hyped as much as the second coming. 2 of the biggest sci-fi horror franchises coming together in an amalgamated effort designed to cash in on both's fanbases while hopefully not alienating (No pun intended) either market. Freddie V Jason had already been, and frankly was quite a pleasing effort which managed to be both entertaining and gory while being acceptably contrived. So in the same vein comes AVP which sees a fairly mediocre cast brought together as a group of scientific experts on a mission headed by Weyland, boss of Weyland industries, played by Lance Henrikson (In pretty much the only single homage to either franchise) whose imaging equipment has uncovered something big in Antarctica. On the mission to explore it things start to go predictably awry, and before long it's a battle between aliens and predators for something or other.There's no doubt this film was great on paper - a cataclysmic battle between 2 of the biggest movie warrior-types around would make for a great movie if done properly. Problem is, not enough good work went into this.Firstly the dialogue is quite toe-curlingly embarrassing. Lines like 'I'd rather have a gun and not need it than not have a gun and need it' serve to make you cringe, and conversations between characters are absolutely appalling at times with some of them laughing where there's nothing even funny. Secondly the level of star here is truly b-movie rate. Even Lance Henrikson's appearance doesn't improve it much. Sure, there are plenty of folk you'll recognise, but their names will more often than not escape you. Only Ewan Bremner as Miller sprung to mind, and that was because I'd seen him in Snatch, and am myself Scottish so I know him.Lastly is the truly boring direction and camera work. For such allegedly exciting content AVP doesn't half do a good job of boring you rigid. It never grips you, it never amazes you, it barely even entertains you. Appallingly drab and 'by-the-numbers' direction and camera work makes dead sure of that.The last 20 minutes have to be seen to be believed, and while we can all take a little cheese in sci-fi, pizza-sized fromage frais does not go down well. Quite nauseating and ridiculously stupid is the last reel.The movie clearly takes itself way too seriously, and ends up being laughed at. It's not the worst film I'll ever see, but at times it wants to believe its the best.Shame.",5,3,6,9 December 2004
Batman Begins," Terrific and overdue return to form for the Batman series
","Prequel takes the Batman franchise into an altogether maturer dimension.With an all-star cast, huge budget, polished production values and the great pedigree of the Batman name behind it you would be forgiven for expecting something which elevates this movie above the appalling turkeys in the series which preceded it like the truly dire Batman and Robin, Batman Forever and the quite embarrassingly awful spin off, Catwoman.Well thankfully the Batman legacy is back in force to an ephemeral degree and this movie succeeds in single-handedly resurrecting the brilliance and darkness of the first 2 movies while adding yet more to them and evolving the overall name.Christian Bale is the latest Batman, and while Michael Keaton was probably the best Batman, Bale is a *different* Batman because the purpose of this movie is to make the character far less of a comic book fantasy and much more of a believably human individual while still retaining just a *little* touch of supernatural influence.The plot here takes us to Bruce Wayne's background, and explains his exact development from young boy to exceptionally angry young man who turns criminal and becomes lost in his own nightmare due to the circumstances surrounding him. It charts how his own fears become what drive him to become vengeful against those who have wronged him and his family in Gotham City, while also waging new wars against emerging enemies.As mentioned before, an all star cast is resplendent in Batman Begins. The likes of Gary Oldman, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Katy Holmes, Tom Wilkinson, Cilian Murphy, Rutger Hauer and the always superb Michael Caine provide outstanding support to Bale's haunted Bruce Wayne. There is absolutely no sense of upstaging in evidence, and all actors appear to be entirely respectful of one another. This show of solidarity as opposed to individual prima-donna style behaviour is a pleasure to see in a movie of this nature, and lets the story flow without disturbance.The direction of them certainly takes some credit for this as well, plus also letting the action freely move forward. Sure, the fight sequences can occasionally get ever so slightly confusing, fast as they are, but this never gets in the way of enjoying the movie.Part of enjoying this movie comes from Batman's wholly grounded humanism. Instead of being a superhuman creature, Batman Begins portrays him as a normal man who's benefitting from magnificent Martial Arts tutelage as well as the empire of his family which happens to involve a huge company responsible for much highly advanced army technology. It is this technology which he uses to become Batman, and combine it with his terrific fighting capacity and suddenly the whole Batman facade is almost believable. There are, however, just enough *slight* supernatural overtones just to keep it feeling like real Batman the fans can identify with.Another great quality to the story is the superb cinematography - some of the camera work is truly extraordinary and frankly breathtaking. This is one impressive looking movie.There is is a lot more to the movie as well, but rather than surmising any more of it I would simply recommend it as up there as one of, if not perhaps the best Batman movie yet.Top class.",8,0,1,24 September 2005
Seabiscuit," I mean it's sorta good...but...
","It seems slightly pointless. Maybe I'm so used to quirky offbeat movies which are dramatic or fx-ridden to some degree, but Seabiscuit was just so straight-forward that I was left wondering whether I enjoyed it or not. It is an old-fashioned tale based on a true story about a horse called Seabiscuit who gave America something to cheer about when it was experiencing strife at the beginning of the 20th century. I mean yes, I guess it's worth telling the story, but it seemed such a sanitised and hollow portrait. Maybe that was all they could do with the story, but I was left wondering where the punchline was. This movie didn't seem to have a message, or anything to drive home to the viewer. I am probably alone in these criticisms, but hey. It *was* well acted, very well directed and the overall narrative was certainly good, with appropriate humour inserted every so often. It just seemed to lack a purpose, with very little twists or turns. Even if it's based on a true story, they can use dramatic licence to excite things up a little, but I reckon they didn't here.Overall, it's a good movie, but just lacking a bit of depth.",Null,0,0,28 November 2003
City of God," Well acted and well shot, but not as emotive as it claims
","I knew this was a powerful tale of despair in amongst violence, and that it was a very well received piece.It's the tale of Rocket, a young boy who grows up in the slums in the City of God, and who witnesses at first hand the full extent of conflict.In the City of God, violence is a cancer which spreads and engulfs its host, and no one can escape from it unless they are very, very lucky.Rocket's love of photography may just be his passport out, but with the city under the iron fist of Li'l Ze, a gang leader with a totalitarian control of the city, realising his dreams may not be easy, or indeed possible at all.There are many, many characters in City of God, and each of them get a significant amount of screentime which gives the movie a depth few others can achieve due to the effective grittiness of how their respective stories are told.The main problem I have with this story is that somehow it fails to really suck you in. A movie like this relies on drawing emotion from the viewer, and having a genuine view of each character be it hate, love, empathy, or sympathy. In City of God, too few characters achieve this.I found myself having feelings only about Li'l Ze and Knockout Ned. The likes of Benny, Shaggy, Carrot and the main protagonist Rocket drew very little from me.It took until about an hour and a half in before I felt truly part of the story which, for me, is too long.Putting this flaw aside, City of God is a very well told movie, which uses effective direction. It's just a pity I felt like I was watching events from afar rather than right inside.",6,1,3,24 April 2004
The Football Factory," Simply dreadful
","There are films with wit, charm, sophistication, plot and premier quality acting which inspire and entertain.This is not one of those films and should have been burned in celluloid form before getting anywhere near the public domain.Football Factory is basically about football hooliganism, and the yobs which make up the hooligan element of such clubs as West Ham, Millwall, and, focused on in this one, Chelsea. We follow a traveling gang who essentially drink a lot, and arrange a 'barney' with opposing fans whenever they get a chance.A bunch of of non-descript actors play the roles here with excruciating blandness and overwhelming stereotyping that from the off it is both hard to hear what they're muttering, and hard to want to continue watching such is the complete and utter dislikeability of every one of them. I accept that we're probably not supposed to sympathies or even empathise with these fellows, such are their natures, but not even *one* protagonist exists and we feel completely distanced from everything.The plot is that a cup draw between the arch-rivals Millwall and Chelsea has been made, and a meet between the hooligans is planned. However, so much peripheral nonsense and uninteresting drivel is played out in between that frankly by the time they all meet the viewer really couldn't give a monkey's.The battle scenes are gritty enough, but all it does it repulse you - there is no attempt to convey it in a societal manner, or to explain *why* they do this and what motivates them - it's just 'we beat each other up because we like it'. As said before there is little characterisation, and the stereotyping is utterly miserable: the racist cabbie, the degenerate hooligan friends, the psychotic ringleader, the quiet overall leader, the wise but gruff old men, the young scumbags, and all the various yobs on 'the other sides'.I'm trying to fathom what else there is to this and I'm dry already.Frankly to watch this film is to view an embarrassment to the British film industry which is capable of much, much better fare than this.",Null,7,19,17 October 2004
Garden State," Classy, subtle and beautifully conceived, but...
","I saw the 8.3 on IMDb and decided this was one I had to see. I wasn't quite sure what it was about, which is a good thing - going into a movie entirely blindly is something I've not done for some considerable time, and it was refreshing to do so here.Zak Braff stars as Andrew, a man in his mid 20's living in LA having emigrated away from New Jersey, to pursue a career as an actor, with only limited success. His present day-job is as a waiter in a Vietnamese restaurant, and when he receives a call from his estranged father telling him his mother has died, he travels back to his childhood home, to the area he was raised, which re-ignites old acquaintances.It would be unfair to label Garden State as some kind of superfluous coming of age drama, as the main protagonist is well into his adult life. However, there is without doubt a semblance of this kind of theme, in that Andrew is a troubled individual who's been on medication since he was only a young boy, and has come to some type of crossroads since attending the funeral of his recently passed mother.What it would *not* be unfair to label Garden State as is 'subtle'. I can rarely recall such an underplayed movie, which gets the balance of action and dialogue absolutely spot on, while never appearing to think a lot of itself. The humour is subtle, the acting is subtle, the entire picture is subtle. This delicate and almost poetic approach serves it extremely well and is a fine antidote to the forceful movies more commonly produced by Hollywood.Another of the main aspects it has in its favour is the quality of both the dialogue and acting. Every character says just the right thing, at the right time, with the right delivery. And by 'right' I mean 'realistic'. There's even a subtle flub of a line at one point which gives the scene a genuine grit. The movie is extremely down to earth without being morbid. The acting adds to this, with all characters coming across as actual people and never caricatures of stereotypes that we usually suffer.As both the main star and director, Braff is simply perfection. His character sometimes appears as awkward and bland, but believe me it is intentional, and when he actually adds a bit of emotion to a moment, it truly works and is utterly believable. His direction is absolutely spot on. Never overly flashy, never dull, there's an equilibrium which draws the viewer in as well as anything else I've seen.As Sam, the love interest, Natalie Portman shows she can actually act. The only things I recall seeing her in besides this were the quite appalling Star Wars prequels and her wooden displays were an embarrassment. Here she portrays a warmth and quirkiness which is, yes, subtle, as well as personable. The fellow leads, such as Peter Sarsgaard as Mark, all add extremely well to the movie without ever outstaying their welcomes.However, you *knew* there was a 'but' coming (as indicated by the title)...Slight spoiler ahead:The ending is atrocious. Yes, it's possibly been raised elsewhere but I have to affirm it. The ending goes disappointingly Hollywood and is an absolute rush job which undoes all the brilliant work which went before it. This ending is why Ridley Scott released the Director's Cut of Blade Runner, rather than the walking off into the sunset finale originally released.Spoiler over: This is a fairly original, beautifully constructed and poignant piece of cinema, which is let down by its desperation to have a conclusively predictable ending. I still rate it very highly, but I'm disappointed that I felt so empty after the ending. This should have left me with a lot more.",9,1,2,16 December 2004
Event Horizon," Decently structured sci-fi horror
","Event Horizon is a decent movie. There's no question it's never going to win awards for originality, or anything else, frankly, but what it does it does well. It's based on the idea of a space ship, which disappeared just under a decade ago, reappearing mysteriously, prompting a search and rescue vessel to go in and investigate. Telling more would spoil the premise, so no more will be said. It is all set in the future, as much sci-fi is, and deep in outer space, of course. The performances are as polished as you'd expect from Sam Neill, as the doctor, and Laurence Fishbourne, as the scout ship captain, so there are generally no complaints there. The gore levels at times are not for the squeamish, but what else would you expect from an 18 (UK) rated movie? There are a fair number of predictable moments, and cliched lines, but the overall production is more than decent and able to keep your attention focused on the plot. A good effort all round, and the overall 5.5 rating it received here is a touch harsh. I'd say 7.",Null,96,135,11 February 2003
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Far better than the dismal original
","I was appalled by the first Resident Evil film. As a big fan of the games it was based on I hoped for something which tied in with it. Indeed, George Romero agreed with this philosophy and coined a script featuring recognisable characters from the franchise, and a similar setting. This script got him fired and the final movie bore pretty much no resemblance to the games bar the locale of Raccoon City and the name of the Umbrella Corporation. If alienating the fans wasn't bad enough, the actual quality of the picture was quite dismal, and though it was successful on the name, the film content left the majority of neutral viewers fairly apathetic, and actual fans mildly annoyed. Bearing this in mind, the sequel would have to rectify a lot of the mistakes the first one made, and contrive something far better than the original.They succeeded admirably.Apocalypse picks up exactly where the original left off, with Milla Jovovich's Alice staggering out of some kind of Umbrella medical installation to be greeted by the chaos of the town of Raccoon City under the state of emergency the outbreak of T-Virus has left it in.However, Umbrella have plans to use the situation to their advantage by way of the Nemesis program, and endeavour to test their bio weapons within the carnage.Meanwhile the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) members are still in Raccoon City and trying to escape, but after Nemesis slaughters a crew of them, it is left to the few remaining ones to try and escape. They are flanked by Alice who doesn't feel quite herself any more...Resident Evil Apocalypse succeeds on the vast majority of levels the original feebly capitulated at. Firstly, and very importantly, there are far more references to the actual games in evidence. Carlos Oliveira, Jill Valentine, Nemesis, an Ashford reference; there are more than enough superficial homages to the games to satisfy the connoisseurs. Moreover, the 'feel' of the movie is vastly more akin to the games. Rather than the slightly sci-fi sanitised original which felt a million miles from the games, this one gets the scenarios and general ambiance closer to what purists wanted. Also in evidence here is the fact it's a mix of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis video games. Jill has her Nemesis outfit on, Carlos from 3 is here, the underground lab from 2 is featured. There are plenty of game links to satisfy. Sure, there are some slight modifications to the game plot, with certain details quite different, but you don't find yourself holding such facts against the film.Secondly, and crucially, the actual movie itself outside of being faithful to anything is a genuinely enjoyable tale. Sure, it's hardly realistic, with plenty of gravity-defying stunts and absurd moments of combat, but it demands you suspend your disbelief for the duration and assuming your compliance you'll get a kick out of the action and explosions et al.Then we have Alexander Witt's far more engaging direction compared to Paul Anderson's drab attempt in the first movie. Witt achieves an engaging ride here, always making each scene buzz with life. Never a dull moment in this one.The cinematography is more than competent as well, with some great aerial shots and some effective street scenes. You feel part of the action at all times, and you're certainly never bored. Set layout is especially good, so good you actually don't notice it.Finally the acting. OK, that's always going to be a weakness here, but besides the corny accents and overdose of cheesy dialogue the actors do a decent job of getting on with proceedings. Hell, they even manage to look like they're enjoying themselves. But this film is not about acting; clearly the narrative is centre stage. And as a result of a reasonable script, good direction, and close ties to the game, Resident Evil Apocalypse manages on every level its predecessor failed at.If you're a fan, highly recommended. If you're not, you will probably still get a blast out of it.",8,1,2,12 December 2004
8 Mile," Utterly engaging
","When music stars make the transition to movie making, the results have been eclectic to say the least. David Bowie was surreal in the mind-bending Labyrinth, Madonna has been decent in her movies in general (With the exception of the panned Swept Away), and there was the dreadful Crossroads with Britney Spears. S Club 7 Seeing Double was another example of a shocking attempt at bridging the gap between music and film.Bearing all this in mind it would be highly understandable to be somewhat skeptical of 8 Mile given it stars Eminem in his first big-screen role. The supporting cast is hardly strong (With the exception of Kim Basinger) clearly designed to give him the limelight, so ultimately the quality of the movie depends on him. However, the doubters, after watching this, would surely be willing to consume humble pie because 8 Mile is a thoroughly enthralling story which is universally well acted and extremely well directed.Eminem is essentially himself in this, though his name is Rabbit. He plays a trailer-trash young man who's locked in the slums by circumstance, and who is trying to use rap/hip hop as a vehicle to escape. Sure, it's been done before, albeit not this exact setting, but the lack of originality in premise is more than made up for by the quality of the acting, and the way the story is told. In his first film, Eminem is breathtaking. Yes, he might not have had to do a lot of research into the part due to his clear familiarity with the situation, but just because he empathises with it does not automatically make him a good actor in front of a camera.The movie opens with a rap battle, where 2 rappers try to outwit each other in front of an audience. Rabbit is up next but freezes on stage and experiences ridicule from his peers as a result. The rest of the movie sees him struggle to make ends meet, hold down a job, keep his family together, attempt to regain his reputation and all the while never being sure what tomorrow holds.Britney Murphy plays his love interest, but it isn't exactly a match made in heaven and the story does a good job of conveying her as apparently out of his league initially before making us realise she's the same as the rest of them, albeit with a hint of glamour.Director Curtis Hanson does a terrific job with this film, making it fast and dynamic, but not too quick as to be incomprehendable, though he *is* guilty of slightly overdoing the stereotyping, which is prominent throughout.Generally it is extremely worth seeing, and although the ending is pretty predictable it is still well made.Good job.",Null,1,2,20 June 2004
Shrek 2," Not as sparkling as the original but still very good
","This one was hardly going to be as fresh as the first film, but it still manages to entertain.Following on from the previous film, we see Fiona and Shrek living happily in their swamp having just come home from their honeymoon. Donkey's holding the fort in their absence and when they get back he doesn't *really* want to leave, citing 'problems' with his missus, Dragon. No sooner do they force him out of the door when Fiona's parents (She's a princess, remember) wish to meet her Pince Charming for a dinner and ball...Shrek 2 features the same 3 core voice-cast as Shrek, namely Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. Murphy manages to sound every bit as raucous as he was before, and Myers puts in a great shift again, but Cameron Diaz isn't quite as effective as she was earlier. She seems a little outclassed by every one else. Newcomers include a fantastic Antonio Banderas as Shrek's 'assassin' Puss in Boots, Jennifer Saunders having a whale of a time as Fairy Godmother, and a decent replacement for the now departed (Unfortunately) John Lithgow in John Cleese as Fiona's king father.The comedy element is simply not as prevalent in Shrek 2 as it was in Shrek, relying far more on sentiment and drama than laughs. However, it is only the last two thirds this is a problem during; the first third is absolutely riotous in places. Just a pity this wasn't kept up.Essentially this is the main downfall of Shrek 2 - for all its technical brilliance (Yes, it looks fantastic again) and polished performances, it takes itself just a little bit seriously and loses marks as a result. The intrinsic lack of freshness doesn't help it either.It's still superb entertainment, but it just isn't as good as its precursor. Could it *ever* have been?",Null,0,0,5 September 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Stylish and strongly directed
","It's been a fair while since a Quinten Tarantino movie. Famous for the groundbreaking Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino later created Jackie Brown to mixed reviews. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is his first major release since then, and it manages to to be as fresh as his earlier hits, as bloody as them, and as groundbreaking, in a sense.It's simply a story of revenge, as Uma Thurman's character, whose name isn't revealed except 'Black Mantra', goes on a rampage to kill those responsible for ruining her wedding day by killing the entire congregation bar her, and for the loss of her child as she was pregnant at the same time. After a 4 year coma she's free to hunt the assassins down in vengeance.It's never made clear, yet, who she is, why she's so proficient herself as an assassin, and why her wedding day was ruined.The first volume, as it is a 2 parter, is simply about the first events.The story is simple, but effective - and simultaneously rather strong, with very stylish direction, some original sequences such as anime, and plenty of action with visceral lashings of the red stuff. It *is* a bloody movie, but it's carried out in a comic book fashion so it never seems gory for the sake of it.The acting, from Thurman, is exactly what it needs to be, and to be honest it's the same from everyone. It's supposed to be *slightly* corny and cheesy, given the comic-book theme.The only real downside in this movie is the characterisation, or lack of. You don't really care about Thurman, or anyone else. I don't know if this is also intentional, but the movie draws no real emotive response from the viewer. You don't feel as involved as you perhaps should.But in saying all that it's a fine piece of film-making and highly recommended.",8,0,1,15 November 2003
Saw II," Far superior to the average original
","Gory horror suspense mystery race against time movie does everything right which its predecessor got wrong.Saw II is a direct follow up to the overrated original which featured a psychotic maniacal serial killer who set up traps for his victims to fall into. They could get out of them, but at a huge personal cost.Saw II reveals the killer after the original very much kept him as a hidden figure, and places him right in front of the cops who've tracked him down after he purposefully left a clue to his whereabouts on his latest victim's body. Once the cops find him they discover to their horror that he appears to have set up another trap, this time involving someone close to the main cop.The rest of the movie is a race against time to find the location of the latest trap and save the day.This being Saw, however, nothing is as it appears and twists and turns rule the roost.It's fair to say this is a much more satisfying movie than the first one was. The acting is acceptable enough without being Oscar standard, but particularly from Jigsaw (The bad guy) it has a nice sinister and dark edge to it. Everyone is suitably stressed out and while there is a stereotype or two in the mix, the characters are generally pretty good and reasonably well thought out.The direction is really excellent, so good in fact it's completely un-noticeable. The movie flows at a superb pace and never bores for a second. The cinematography isn't really the name of the game in a movie like this, such is its claustrophobic indoor nature.However, what *is* the name of the game is gore. Well, not so much gore as pain. Saw devised ingenious ways of depicting how painful death could be. The various traps portrayed yet crueler ways of hurting a victim, and of murdering them in the most repugnant and toe curling ways.Well Saw II takes this further and has many sequences to make your skin crawl - the level of agony shown is quite disturbing at times. It goes without saying horror fans will be in their element with the sheer imagination on show in this one.Add to that the all round helplessness and general despair on offer, and you have a pretty smart movie with lashings of dark overtones.Very good and recommended. But you do need to have fairly strong resilience to the content.",8,0,0,3 February 2006
Paranormal Activity," Psychological horror goes back to basics
","BWP-style chiller horror affects at a deeper and more cerebral level than the likes of Friday 13th.The hype: Paranormal Activity wasn't released in the UK till late 2009, but the blurb surrounding it was that it was a horror movie on a new level from the more traditional Hollywood fare. Furthermore, there was the 'do not see it alone' warning which only added to the reputation it was gaining.Shot in a Blair Witch 'real cam' style, Paranormal Activity likewise smoothly passed itself off as a documentary about individuals being caught up in haunting or terrifying environments, and the subsequent danger they found themselves in.The passage of text at the start strongly implies this is real footage of what happened when a young couple moved into a new house, aware the female protagonist had a history of being haunted. This move was 'an experiment' to lure the entity out and get hard evidence of its presence and a consequent cure.However, like Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity uses simple horror techniques, also seen in the Japanese original of Ring; it's not so much what is on camera which terrifies you, but what isn't.Much of the fear is left to the imagination - save for a few bumps in the night and the odd special effect, the majority of scares are inside the viewer's head.And that's the most effective method to really scare the watcher - who wants to see gore all over the place when you can terrify watchers purely by suggestion.There's also the 'is it or isn't it real' aspect, whereby the viewer, who knows nothing about the movie's origins, half suspects what is happening is real, and really was captured on camera. To this end the acting is more than adequate, and the bumps and sounds (and effects) are extremely effective.Paranormal Activity is a movie to watch knowing as little about it as possible, and preferably on your own.It is also the first movie for years to actually scare me, and achieve a 'watching through fingers' moment, for which it earns my respect and praise. And yes, that again was a 'what isn't on the screen, but is in your head' moment.It's not the best horror you will ever see, but it is a very, very good attempt and deserves praise for its simplicity and effectiveness at what it does.Recommended.",8,1,2,4 February 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," An utter enigma, but still commendable
","This is a very 'different' movie. I've never seen anything like it before and doubt I ever will again.I'll say this categorically - it is *not* the best movie ever made, not even close. It's not even as good as A Clockwork Orange which is magnificent.But it is superbly crafted, deep, and ultimately so thought-provoking that it deserves a place in the hall of fame for its sheer visionary content.Yes, the plot's a little fragmented, and none of the characters are particularly personable, but the truth is the story isn't about them.It's a tale of existence, of viewing and perceiving the universe and understanding that 99.999999% of everything is way beyond our own comprehension.As for the Planet of the Apes comparison another reviewer made, well Planet of the Apes clearly concluded - one of the greatest endings cinema has ever bared witness to. Possibly the out and out best. But the 2 movies are *very* different to one another.Anyway, for something which takes movie-making in a whole new direction check this out. It's certainly an experience.",10,0,2,8 August 2002
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Incredible originality
","Yes folks, Hollywood's produced an original film ! *gasp*Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind seems to be billed as a light-hearted bittersweet comedy, but the truth is much further from this.Jim Carrey features in his joint best role to date (With the Truman Show), as a socially inadequate loner who takes an impulsive detour on the way to work one day, and meets Clementine on a beach in a resort called Montock.Initially awkward around her, she gets into his life but events begin to get confusing as it emerges that she's had him erased from her memory.To divulge more would spoil the plot, and it baffles me that IMDb's outline reveals aspects we don't find out till later.This is a movie which relies on 3 crucial things: a strong sense of a psychological mystery, superb performances, particularly from the 2 leads, and a level of originality I don't remember seeing anywhere else.These 3 combine to grip the viewer at all times and allow the story to unfold in a way which may seem confusing, but which forces the viewer to stick with it, intrigued to learn the truth behind what's going on.The movie is aided by a very genuine performance from Carrey, who excels as Joey and continues to prove that Carrey's Liar Liar days are only one aspect of his repertoire. On the other hand we have the incredible Winslet. Her performance is exponentially more admirable given the fact she's an English actress with an absolutely faultless American accent. I forgot she *was* English such was the natural sound of her accent.Other cast of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood and Tom Wilkinson provide A-List backup but you can't help but feel they're all a bit wasted here with such comparatively minor roles. Particularly Dunst who's now surely, along with Wood, a leading lady.Anyway, I nitpick. This is a great film with a lot of impressive elements to it. Maybe not the greatest film ever made, but premier league certainly.Recommended.",9,0,1,25 September 2004
Saw," Really quite average
","This one had been hyped to me by just about everyone I know as being quite brilliant. Indeed, the Second Coming got less airtime than this one, so I've finally settled down to watch it. Now, we're talking about a true horror connoisseur here, someone who holds Ring (The Japanese original) in such high regard that it's the benchmark for anything else.So without further ado, how did this one go down?Saw is, primarily, set in an archaic dungeon style room, with 2 strangers separately bound by chains and unable to remember how they got there. They begin to realize, through an amount of clues provided, and by recollection, that they're here at the behest of some kind of madman whose game insists the only way out is by one killing the other.Danny Glover is the cop who's pursuing the 'Jigsaw Killer', a killer notorious for never actually killing anyone directly. It seems to be the same person responsible for the situation the 2 strangers find themselves, but no one knows where they are.Through anecdotal conversations between each other, and continuing discoveries in their 'dungeon', they try to figure out how to get out of the cell. They're given 2 saws, but are unable to cut through the chains.To say any more would possibly spoil the plot.There's really very little more I can add to this synopsis to effectively review the film, other than on a technical level. Essentially, for a potentially scary film, it was decidedly short on fear. Maybe it was just a gore-fest, but even then there wasn't a great deal of visceral stuff. The best way I could describe it would be a slightly psychological thriller mystery with a hint of violence. The biggest problem I have with it is I got absolutely nothing out of it. It wasn't really all that good at anything. No fear, little tension, ineffectual psychology, etc etc. There was just very little to make me sit up and take real notice here.By all means it entertained, and the characterisation was decent enough I suppose to warrant the desire to know what happened to everyone, but truthfully there was just a lack of punch here. The direction was decent enough without any frills, and there was also a huge lack of cinematography. Even though the confined space of the dungeon was small, there wasn't much claustrophobia going on. This was probably due to the counter-balance of the flashback scenes of the outside world.Overall, it was just *there* and isn't anything I haven't seen before. For fear, check Ring. For blood, check any number of gorefests. For thriller go with Memento. There are a lot better films out there than Saw.",5,0,0,9 December 2004
The Last Samurai," Nicely told epic
","The Last Samurai continues Tom Cruise's evolution from his Top Gun/Day of Thunder days to his current Magnolia/Vanilla Sky tenure where he proves he can act. Well, certainly in a deeper way than he could when he made The Firm, a Few Good Men etc. Indeed, Last Samurai is one of his finest performances, managing to convey a convincing portrayal of a reluctant war hero who is held in contempt by his superiors and banished to Japan to train a regiment there in preparation for war against the uprising samurais. The war is short lived, and his men are nowhere near experienced enough to handle it causing them to get easily overpowered. He gets captured and is made a prisoner in the samurai village. And that's where the development of his character really begins.Where this movie excels is the level to which it draws you in and makes you care. It is directed with flair but without arrogance, the cinematography is highly impressive, the performances are uniformly excellent bar the Emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) who really struggles with his English in one scene, and the relationships between the characters are extremely well-judged with some highly appropriate humour showing a lack of conceit and ability to smile.It is a long story, but a rewarding one.",Null,0,1,18 January 2004
Life Is Beautiful," Utterly magnificent, not a single flaw
","No *wonder* Russell Crowe missed out on best actor...Not knowing a great deal about this one besides the fact Benigni won best actor, I decided to get it on a whim.To say I was not disappointed is an understatement.Life is Beautiful is about a charismatic and quite loveably affable waiter by the name of Guido who manages to capture the woman of his dreams and the life of his fantasies. Life is indeed beautiful. Until, that is, the second world war begins and due to his religion of judaism he finds that society begins to condemn his people - this is something which he tries to hide from his son by putting on a facade of explanations as to why people are behaving why they are towards his family. When the family is shipped off to a concentration camp this front is tested to the limit, by Guido maintains it throughout to hide the true horrors of war from his son.To say that Benigni is outstanding would do him no justice - he's every inch worth his oscar, and commands the screen superbly. He conveys a man of pure heart who loves his family and people in general, and who bounces off everyone without being irritating. He keeps his spirit no matter what happens in his life, and this is reflected by events in the concentration camp.The rest of the players truly are top notch too, such as Nicoletta Braschi as his wife who is perfectly understated - this, really, is Benigni's show and she gracefully gives him centre-stage.Throughout, the story uses comedy immeasureably well, and contains plenty of extremely humourous moments. It even manages them in the concentration camp in a way which never hides the seriousness of such a place but which smarts as bitter sweet. Again, the centre of all comedic moments is Benigni.As well as being amusing, his character is completely believable - he is so convincing as the kind of man there are too few of - completely good, through and through. His only vice is stealing another man's bride, but she wasn't happy in that relationship anyway!I fail to mention the quality of the direction and storytelling - the direction is perfect and never fails to keep you hooked to the screen - we feel a part of this world. The storytelling, or narrative, is top notch too - not for one second is this close to being boring, or daft, or unbelievable.There is much more I could say, so I'll finish by stating you really should see this one.Immense.",10,1,4,28 April 2004
The Descent," Good film and better than the bog standard Hollywood fare we're used to
","Superior British horror movie sets tense claustrophia with old fashion suspense and comes out on top.There have been a lot of less than impressive horror movies in recent years, particularly out of Hollywood. Cabin Fever is a prime example of such a sub-standard flick and there are many more. One distinct advantage British horror has is a true grittiness to it, a kind of 'realness' which makes the characters a lot easier to identify with.In The Descent we follow the fortunes of an all female cave exploration team who are going on an adventure in a mountain range. The purpose of this expedition is to bring them all together after the hideous events of the previous year which are revealed at the beginning of the movie.It's not a particularly big name cast with perhaps Saskia Mulder as Rebecca who also appears in the BBC's Book Club the best known actress on display. Certainly the most recognisable. However, the strength of this movie isn't in its star acumen, but rather in its story telling and direction.The Descent is claustrophia in abundance; tight cave systems barely give room to breath, and the overwhelming darkness compounds it ten fold. In this movie, light is at a premium.As for the horror side of it, well let's just touch on the fact that there are rather unfriendly cave dwellers (Who it must be admitted look successfully hideous) who intend to make life difficult for our heroines. They also sound vile - a testament to the sound engineers and overall design of these characters.Gore levels are impressive without being over the top, and what would a horror movie be without its gore? On that note although this could easily be classified as horror, I would also class it under suspense and claustrophobic dark thriller.The direction is uniformly effective, but the insatiable darkness and occasional fast action do tend to make certain parts a bit confusing. It's a small price to pay for what is overall a very useful technique in terms of film making - although it should be added that it's quite unique as deployed here.Overall, this is a good film and worth your attention. It's certainly one of the better horror films I've seen for sure. The ending clinched it for me for sure.(Private message for IMDb - this review is being re-submitted under my proper id. I used the wrong one previously)",7,0,1,9 November 2005
Some Like It Hot," Charming but way overated.
","A recent poll in saw this come out as the best comedy of all time.Beating the likes of Odd Couple and Airplane!, Some Like It Hot is revered by so many, and while I can see the charm of it and concede that the performances are really excellent, the film *really* isn't that funny.It stars Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as 2 witnesses to a mob shooting. They're a saxophonist and a bass player respectively who're part of a band, but the mob are after them after escaping from the hit, and the only way they can hide is to dress up as women and join a female band. Enter the amazing Marilyn Munroe as a band member (Sugar Cane) they befriend - it just so happens they're both crazy about her yet cannot give up the facade of their disguises. This provides much fuel for the contrivance of some very funny moments as Curtis' 'Josephine' sets about wooing her (By putting on an impression of a millionaire) while Lemmon's 'Daphne' gets the short end of the deal every time.To say the least, the performances are truly top drawer, *particularly* Munroe's Cane, who even in the 21st century utterly exudes sex appeal. This was surely her finest role.The boys do a great turn too and the chemistry is spot on from one adventure to the next.The problem is the situations are in places funny, but it's never *truly* the funniest thing you'll ever see. The script in the Odd Couple (For me the greatest comedy ever) is head and shoulders above this, and that's what sets it apart. Sure, there are some very witty and intelligent lines here too, but somehow they're greater in number in the Odd Couple. I single the Odd Couple out as it was also focused on a cracking comedic partnership and also starred Lemmon. It also benefitted from greater comic timing.This is certainly a classy comedy which is well acted and thoroughly enjoyable, but it suffers from a little bit of overhyping.",7,1,12,9 June 2004
The Da Vinci Code," A lot of fun
","Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou star in long-awaited big-screen adaptation of Dan Brown's famous novel.Dan Brown's novels have become rather legendary in their own right, and thanks to the stunning success of his 3rd novel, The Da Vinci Code, have made their author a multi-millionaire.The Da Vinci code was set in France, and featured a Harvard scholar, Robert Langdon, and a French policewoman, Sophie Neveu, and its principle subject was that of the Catholic religion and its secrets and history.Hanks is Langdon, and Tautou is Neveu. The story starts out with Langdon being interrupted at an engagement by the police, who wish his help solving a crime. However, events take an unexpected turn and before he knows it he is battling Gendarmes, the Catholic church, and unseen forces of apparent evil.The great strength of the novel was its electric pace and popcorn action - it was thrilling stuff, and gripped the reader from the first line onwards. Truth is the big screen version captures this surprisingly well. The pace is just as quick, and while plenty of aspects of the novel didn't make it, the adaptation is overall surprisingly faithful.Furthermore, the novel had plenty of major characters, and they all make it to the big screen intact - Ian McKellen's Leigh Teabing, Alfred Molina's Biship Arangosa, Paul Bettany's brilliant Silas, and Jean Reno's Fache. The cast for this one was definitely heavyweight.That said, the acting wasn't particularly good in this. McKellen was decent enough, and Jean Reno did a good job of a cop on the edge, but the 2 main protagonists Hanks and Tautou were frankly average - in places Hanks visibly struggles with the dialogue, and seems to be looking elsewhere for inspiration.But the strength of the novel was the plot, and that makes it into translation pretty well - the one word which describes this movie is 'entertaining' - it's a fast rip roaring yarn which may take itself a bit seriously but manages to engage well for its duration.The direction helps hugely - it's non-stop and never slows down to ponder - there are no boring sequences in evidence.And if you overlook the staple acting, and the fact there are apparently occasional leaps of bizarre logic (Which the movie couldn't explain in the way the novel could) then it's a really engaging movie which should grab your attention.",8,0,1,15 September 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Basically good movie but flawed.
","After all the hype, The Matrix sequel finally arrives. The original was a breath of fresh air - one which got us all talking. How do we know we're *not* in a Matrix? Thought provoking and refreshingly new, it was a big hit even if it did contain some cliches too. The sequel, Reloaded, therefore has a slight problem beause everything that was fresh before, isn't now. So what did they do to combat this? Everything as before but *bigger*, more polished and just 'more'. Plus there is a massive lean towards action as opposed to plot.As for opinion, well it's a bit divided. Personally I think they got aspects spot on, but others were just a waste of time. There was an unecessary character, a scene which is frankly filler, overdone CGI which detracts from the realism, cheesy dialogue, confusing dialogue, too many identical fighting scenes, and an unexplained beginning.But the irony is I enjoyed the movie for its flaws, and recommend it as it *is* so dramatic and polished and exciting.",Null,0,0,23 May 2003
Mystic River," Strong story but overall lacking bite
","Directed by Clint Eastwood, Mystic River is about the murder of a teenage girl, and the hunt to find her killer. An all-star cast of Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishbourne and Sean Penn appear in this one, with a good selection of character actors also featured. Consequently the performances are universally extremely good, and mutual respect is going on with no one attempting to upstage anyone else - no egos on display here. The story is good, with decent enough plot progression which does start to plod a little in the middle but which does enough to keep you interested. The main problem with this movie is Eastwood's direction, which is really very bland. The cinematography is very insipid, and there are a few aerial shots which seem contrived and unnecessary. The general look of the film is a bit uninspiring. Eastwood needs to develop his own style rather than being so generic.Overall it's a decent enough story, but lacks killer punch due to a combination of the plod in the middle and Eastwood's direction. Not as magnificent as we've been led to believe, but worthy nonetheless.",7,0,0,16 November 2003
It's a Wonderful Life," One of the greatest movies ever made
","I'm not one for watching black & white movies. In face, I specifically turn off when one is on. So when I saw the tail-end of It's A Wonderful Life I quite liked it and thought I'd give it the chance when it came on at Christmas a year later. By the end I could only say it was one of the finest feel-good movies ever, and one of the finest movies ever - period. It's a simple tail of a man called George who's reached his wits end with life and feels everything is going wrong. The story is told in flashback from the point of view of an angel, Clarence, who's been sent by God to make George realise certain things, and gives him the chance to see things from a different perspective - of a world in which he doesn't exist. The story is extremely well-told, and the ending will have you cheering. It's heartwarming and was recently rated as one of the top 10 movies ever made by Channel 4 viewers in UK. As rated by the whole of society and not just older people this shows the broad appeal. Your life is not complete if you haven't seen this.A true masterpiece.",10,0,4,22 July 2003
Die Hard," About as good as action movies get outside James Cameron
","The movie which truly launched Bruce Willis' movie career and made him serious, Die Hard is quite simply a perfect slice of 80s Hollywood action, cheese, humour and bang for the buck.Willis, as if you didn't know, is John McClane, arguably the most famous fictional cop of all time, up against maybe the most defining villain in Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber we've ever seen.McClane is quite simply wrong man wrong place wrong time and yet right man right place right time and right result - a truly epic David v Goliath face-off where McClane, with his walkie talkie and Al at the other side, sees the viewer rooting for the little guys while the big bad guys appear untouchable.Terrorists have taken over the Nakatomi Plaza in California, see, where McClane has gone to be with his wife following her move there from New York - and it doesn't take long before John is outwitting them wherever he can, aided by one of the most underrated performances in Hollywood history.Willis manages to portray a good honest flawed man in a fine display of actual acting, while keeping himself going by sheer will and a touch of help from Al - and just keeps staying one step ahead of the terrorists.But if we're praising Willis, Rickman's Gruber is just sensational - pure villainy, with great humour, incredible charisma and this movie launched Rickman as much as it did Willis. All the supports are great too, and the cheesy fun never outstays its welcome - the movie teases us a little with its intro, but the body out of the window onto Al's car might be one of the best ignition sequences in the history of movies. It's dynamite.As is the rest of the movie.A few tiny plot holes, sure, but who cares. It's as good as action gets without Cameron being involved - you will have an amazing blast with this superb yarn.",10,1,1,17 December 2018
The Green Mile," Stunning story, stunning performances...
","Let's cut to the chase - this was brilliant. The story was superb, as were the performances.It's from the pen of Stephen King again, just like the outstanding Shawshank Redemption, and also like this it's a prison drama. Or should that be, death row drama.Michael Clarke Duncan is a condemned prisoner who'll die by electric chair. He's been convicted of 2 murders, but there's a lot more to him than it seems. Tom Hanks plays the guard who befriends him. Without giving the plot away, it's all about discovery of the truth, and the flaws and strengths of humanity.It's hard to give a review which justifies how good this movie is. You must see it.On a side note Doug Hutchinson (Xfiles Eugene Tooms) puts in an excellent performance as an utterly despicable guard. I've never hated a character more.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the rubbish ones
","Last in the collection of Star Wars prequels is a good film, but absolutely nothing more.I detect a lot of the hysteria surrounding Episode 3, particularly on this website, is more down to overwhelming relief that it is nowhere near as awful as the drivel which preceded it. However, it is likewise nowhere near as good as any of the 'last' 3 either.As we all know, this episode centres on the switch of Anakin Skywalker to the dark side, aided and abetted by the increasingly evil Chancellor Palpatine. Other key Star Wars developments are realised here too, such as Ob Wan's survival, the birth of Leia and Luke, and the ultimate emergence of Darth Vadar.The movie begins with Anakin and Obi Wan launching an attack on General Grevious' party who've kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, and their saving of the commander.From there on in the plot slowly weaves its way to the conclusions we know from a New Hope.Ewan McGregor is Obi Wan, with Hayden Christensen once again the misguided Anakin. McGregor is his usual understated self, and while he's never anything spectacular, he's more than passable in the role. On the contrary though, Christianson is poor again - OK, maybe poor is harsh, but he's out of his depth as he was in the Clones. Fortunately for him, Natalie Portman's Padme is even more awful than he is, and when there are scenes with just the 2 of them you will do well to stop cringing.However, Iain McDiarmid's Palpatine takes all the acting honours by far here - a great show from him, and he does well to show an evolution from apparent sinister behaviour to pure absolute evil.The CGI is inconsistent at best - some scenes look great, but too often it looks flakey. For example, Obi Wan on the 'creature' that gives him a ride looks completely fake - totally unnatural. On the other hand the expansive city panoramas look fairly good.There is also a generous helping of cheese here, particularly at the end battle. Furthermore, I found that the environment's state leading up to the end battle had miraculously changed based on dramatic license. This won't make much sense now, but watch out for it.The plot in Episode 3 is OK, the acting is wildly varied, the special effects inconsistent. The most solid aspect is probably the direction, even if, as usual, it's a touch too fast for its own good at times.This is basically a decent film, but still not up with the best 3. Still, anything's better than the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.",6,2,4,8 June 2005
Inception," Stunning sci fi which gets better and better
","I won't deny, from the off, that I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan. Everything the man touches turns to gold, and even his 'weakest' movie (Insomnia) is still exceptional.From the earlier (and simply perfect) Memento, to the Dark Knight, Nolan has an astonishing gift for magnificent film making, clearly enjoying a labour of love with every piece of cinema he painstakingly creates.When Inception was announced and previewed, it looked like Nolan was perhaps going to a new level of mastery. A psychological science fiction about the manipulation, use, and mystery of dreams on an epically grandiose scale. Given the man's record prior to its release, Inception looked like it might be his best work yet, and whether or not it is widely considered as such, it is nevertheless undeniably an astonishing piece of movie making which perfects every aspect of its content, from the superb performances, to the staggering cinematography, to the absolutely bewildering special effects, and of course the seamless direction.Inception sees Leo DiCaprio's Cobb take on an almost impossible mission set to him by Ken Watanabe's enigmatic Saito. Cobb specialises in Extraction, a highly sought-after skill which sees extractors enter the dreams of their 'victims' in order to steal information sealed away in their subconscious. Clients pay big money to gain this precious information, and extractors like Cobb are in high demand for their skills.The impossible mission in this case is the very opposition of Extraction, which is Inception. Instead of stealing information from individuals, Inceptions sees ideas being planted there. Ideas intended to change the person's very being and perception of life. Saito wants Cobbs to Incept the idea in Cilian Murphy's Fischer of not becoming like his father and dominating the market of the company he owns. Saito is a competitor and believes Fischer's current path will destroy his company and industry. In exchange Saito will make one phone call and get Cobb legally back to the USA where his children have waited for him for an unspecified time.This is where Cobb's team come in - Ellen Page's Ariadne is the Architect who will design the dream's structure and environment, Tom Hardy's Eames will 'forge' characters, while Joseph-Gordon Levitt's Arthur is Cobb's right hand man and performs vital utility duties so the specialists can perform theirs.The question is will Cobb's own demons wreck the mission, or will Saito get what he desires, while simultaneously saving Cobb? Inception is such an incredible and complex film that while the first viewing is a rewarding experience, it requires a second or maybe a third to full grasp the concepts contained therein, such are the layers and depth contained here. Aspects which may baffle the first time become completely coherent the second and the viewer is rewarded with an astonishingly rich and philosophical canvas on which so many ideas and elements flourish.While the story and direction themselves are masterful, Hans Zimmer's quite miraculous soundtrack give the experience an entirely extra dimension. Tracks like Dream is Collapsing and Mumbasa are simply extraordinary and are an essential component of the feel of the movie.All in all, it's a wonderful story, with intelligence, provocative ideas, great performances, and special effects on a staggering level which will live in the memory for some considerable time.Just a pity Nolan is so disregarded by the Academy Awards...",10,1,7,14 January 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," Every bit as good as its reputation
","There are some very special movies out there. There are those which are highly thought-provoking and leave you questioning things. There are those which are a mindless blast and great fun to boot. And then there are those which are simply sublime. They might keep it simple, but they execute in such a way that they drag you in deep and have you caring about the characters. The Shawshank Redemption is one such film. This is a absolutely outstanding story which is as simple as it is eloquent.It's about a man wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife and sentenced to life at Shawshank. There he slowly finds friends and the drama of their lives is the focus of the story. He promises many times that he *will* break out within 20 years, and no one, of course, believes him. It's this hope which drives the whole movie. Men in prison have nothing but hope. Take that away and they have nothing. And that's what Andy (The main character) wants to avoid.The ending to this is simply breathtaking in its simplicity, but incredibly heartwarming and will have you punching the air in delight.Nominated for 4 oscars, this won none of them. Utter travesty.A magnificent story, and one which will stand the test of time.",10,0,1,22 July 2003
Prometheus," Not spectacular but better than the reputation
","I wouldn't call myself a MASSIVE fan of the Alien franchise but I've generally rather enjoyed them. The original was classic sci fi horror cinema from Ridley Scott, with its sequel indeniably the best entry in the whole series, coming from the master of sci-fi action/horror James Cameron. The subsequent films were admittedly not staggering, but something about the atmosphere of the Alien stories kept audiences nevertheless coming back for more.There hasn't been an Alien film since Resurrection (excluding the Vs franchise) so there was certainly a bit of expectation about this; it being a prequel explaining where it all began, and also being the only one in the series without 'Alien' in the title.Prometheus sees a project ship of the movie's name traveling to where it is believed the creators of mankind originate; 2 scientists, Charlie and Ellie having discovered what appears to be intergalactic maps pointing to the destination are aboard said project ship leading the expedition, trying to find out answers. Naturally they get more than they bargained for.Prometheus wasn't made to be a masterpiece, it is pretty clear it was made as an enjoyable tale which endeavours to explain the backstory of the Alien arc, and in that respect it does a pretty good job.Michael Fassbender is technically the main character (David) as the ship's 'host', an odd-job handiman employed by the project to, among other things, learn multiple ancient dialects in order to communicate with alien civilisations. He is not human, and in a very subtle nod to Scott's earlier masterpiece Blade Runner is an effective replicant - a manufactured human without 'a soul'. He does not want, desire, or feel emotion. He serves. And is pivotal in the progression of the story, with possibly questionable motives despite his limbo state. Fassbender puts in a fine performance and steals every scene he is in.The cinematography is impressive, with some eye-catching panoramic scenes and Scott's direction is its usual impressive self. One thing this isn't is boring.Other performances are decent if not striking, with Kate Dickie's Ford particularly struggling. Whether it was just her Scottish accent contradicting the others I'm not sure, but her lines were rather forced.One thing I'm confused by is the really poor reputation in terms of word of mouth this movie has. It scores 7.3 here but most people I've known who've seen it did not like it much, and the critical reviews were scathing. Yet, I'd agree with the 7.3 overall.Sure, it's not as good as Aliens, sure, it's not Scott's finest. But it's still a pretty decent couple of hours of entertainment which does a better job than many prequels of filling the gaps in.",7,2,3,16 October 2012
Blow," Has Depp ever been in a bad movie?
","On the evidence of this one, no. Blow is a beautifully played movie with mostly excellent performances all round.Potential spoiler, but if you know your history it's not really:It's about George Jung, who was a major marijuana and cocaine traffiker in the late 60s and early 70s, and his rise and fall. He tells the story as the narrator, superbly delivered in general by Depp, who always brings a personably human touch to every character he plays which no other actor can convey. From the heyday of the swinging 60s to the hippy love of the 70s, Blow tracks the life of the man who didn't believe he was actually doing anything wrong. And in many ways he wasn't - free will from others dictated whether or not *he* was committing a crime. But that doesn't gloss over the fact that what he did was wrong, and obviously highly illegal.About the other players here: Ray Liotta plays his Dad perfectly, a man who's own life could be better, with a wife who has little respect for him, but who works 24/7 to put food on the table and tries to make life as good as possible. His mother, played by Rachel Griffiths, gives a good account of a woman selfishly expecting more from life and giving others her wrath when she doesn't get it. Penelope Cruz is pretty forgettable as Mirtha, and doesn't merit being on the DVD cover as she doesn't show up till over half way through, and her performance is acceptable if nothing overly inspired. Overall it never tries to make George out to be a hero, just a misguided freeloader who jumps on a bandwagon. It's an excellent story, and well worth viewing.",Null,0,1,1 September 2003
Vanilla Sky," Engaging psychological tale
","Recently the BBC in UK held a poll for worst film ever, and while Titanic *won*, this came 4th. I just don't understand how anyone can dislike this movie...Vanilla Sky is a dark psychological drama about dreams, reality and 'what might have been'.Tom Cruise is Dave, a yuppie who has it all. He has a 51% stake in his father's company, therefore the majority shareholder, and constantly finds himself in a battle to main his control over the '7 dwarves' who make up the rest of the board. His personal life is a mess, with a shallow relationship with Julie (Cameron Diaz) the closest he gets to love, while his best friend Brian (Jason Lee) who adores Julie sticks by him regardless.However, on holding a birthday party he's introduced to Sofia (The perfect Penelope Cruz) and falls instantly for her.This is all very well but the plot is parallel to a side story of Dave wearing a white mask in a cell with Dr McCabe (Kurt Russell) who's accusing him of murder and wants to understand why it happened.Dave begins on a journey to make sense of his life.I admit there is a 'Hollywoody' feel to this film, and given it's a remake of a Mexican/Spanish original also featuring Penelope Cruz it's probably disappointing to purists. But only viewing this on its own terms I absolutely love this movie. It keeps you guessing, and the ending is very conclusive.It may not be to everyone's taste, but I loved it.",Null,159,200,21 December 2003
Blade Runner," Stunning piece of visionary sci-fi
","I'll set out first of all by stating that this is a kind of combined review of both the original Blade Runner, and the more recent Director's Cut.Set in the year 2020, the world's fallen into decay in the world of Blade Runner. Perpetual acid rain, low quality of life, and a seriously bad state of environment has led to the rich classes abandoning earth and moving to the off-world colonies. On these colonies replicants are used as slaves, replicants being engineered humans made by the Tyrell Corporation. They're physically superior to normal humans, and at least equal in intelligence. Unfortunately they're volatile too, and a Nexus 6 group of replicants goes on a murderous rampage on the colonies, and come back down to earth.This is where the story begins. Deckard is a former member of the Blade Runner unit, charged with hunting down and 'retiring' loose-cannon replicants. Brought back in on this case, because he's the best, he reluctantly finds himself drawn back into the world he wanted away from.Atmospherically Blade Runner was amazing. Neon skies, behemoth corporate buildings, constant darkness, and other forms of haunting futurisms compliment the theme supremely and make the world totally believable.The characters were excellent too - with uniformly superb performances all round from the likes of Harrison Ford, as Deckard, Sean Young as Rachel, and the unforgettable Roy Batty, played by Rutger Hauer.They made this into more than a film - it was an experience - suckered into this world we felt part of too. Ridley Scott's direction was magnificent here too, making every scene buzz with activity and ensuring the plot was always moving.In the original, the voice-overs were nauseating and obtrusive, but nonetheless they were informative and educational. The Director's Cut saw them removed, which enhanced the narrative but did make certain things less clear.There's also the ending of the original, which was removed from the Director's Cut and meant it finished at a much more poignant and meaningful moment.Truthfully you are better off seeing both movies, as you can only get the full experience that way, but just know the Director's Cut is a superior film.Overall this was an amazing film which was maybe too visionary in '82 as it was a monumental flop. It's taken some time for it to be truly appreciated, and now it's up there as one of the principal sci-fi movies.Outstanding.",10,0,1,2 January 2004
Signs," This really was a strange one
","2 hours after coming back from the cinema and I still don't know what to make of this one. On one hand is the utterly outstanding direction. Night Shyalaman is an absolute master of cinematography. He knows exactly what to show in each scene, and how to build up suspense. He knows how to surprise you incredibly effectively. On the other hand is the slight damp squib of the story.
SLIGHT SPOILERS:
Basically the point of this movie is less about the supernatural and more about faith. It seems that the principle is to see how far we can be pushed before we're rewarded, and ultimately what we're willing to believe.SPOILERS OVER:The performances are good, and Shyamalan once again puts in a small cameo, and very well acted it is too. Basically the story is about something very strange happening on Gibson's character's farm. They appear to be signs, but what do they mean, and what's making them? Ultimately it's so immaculately conceived it's easy to look at the good parts and forget that it doesn't seem to be a story which is what is necessarily expected. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you.I'd certainly recommend it, but what you get out of it is up to you.",Null,0,2,13 September 2002
Identity," Best movie this year of its type
","A Hitchcockian murder mystery, Identity is a great example of how to keep the audience guessing while throwing in a lot of red herrings.The premise is simple - a crowd of ten people find themselves stranded in a motel after fate contrived to put them there.However, after a series of sinister 'incidents', they all find themselves in grave danger and fight to stay alive.Saying *any* more would spoil this, as there are a lot of tricks up Identity's sleeve. All performances are excellent, and with a cast such as John Cusak, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet you'd expect no less.A cracking story, excellent direction, and good camera work combine to provide you a movie well in the top drawer.Highly recommended.",Null,0,0,13 June 2003
Live Free or Die Hard," Absolutely ridiculous but incredible fun
","Revival of the Die Hard franchise sees Willis' McClane up against Cyber terrorists.It's been a while coming - the Die Hard trilogy seemed to be the neat conclusion of a very engaging and enduring action story, featuring Bruce Willis' legendary McClane as the cop who all bad things seem to happen to - but rumours began to spread that a fourth offering was in the works, and here we are in 2007/2008 and a shiny new Die Hard movie.First things first - yes, it is called Die Hard, and yes it has Bruce Willis as John McClane - but those are basically the only real aspects this one has in common with the other 3 bar the obvious genre attachment.This McClane is older, wiser, a little less wisecracking, but also more charming than he used to be. And that's not the only difference.To sum up the story, a terrorist organisation headed by Olyphant's fairly mediocre villain (not really the actor's fault, the character just wasn't that good, certainly compared to the previous Die Hard villains) is trying to shut down the USA - public services, national security, computer systems; these are being targetted for incapacitation.Long's computer hacker genius Farrell is being targetted by this organisation for elimination - but McClane rescues him and the two set about trying to save the day.First and foremost, a movie has to be entertaining - and Die Hard 4 is absolutely that. It is 100MPH from beginning to end, and manages to engage the cyberpunk world without totally confusing the viewer. The direction is simply not noticeable at all, such is the pace the whole thing moves at.The action sequences are a lot of fun; big explosions, fights, gunfights, and the odd car chase or two. Die Hard 4 has it all and manages to fit it all together without it seeming disjointed.However, as hinted at in my title, the action sequences (and most of the movie, being honest) is just so implausible and utterly ridiculous that suspension of disbelief is entirely required.Truth is though, you won't much care - it's just a fun blast from beginning to end which never takes itself remotely seriously.The reason this feels removed from the rest of the trilogy is because it doesn't have the same grit - it's a lot more smooth and hi tech, and fun. And as mentioned, this really isn't the same McClane as he once was.That doesn't matter though. It does what all movies should do - entertain, engage, and captivate.",9,0,1,9 March 2008
Lucy," Throwaway sci-fi fun
","It's to know how to start this review. Lucy is filled with almost every sci-fi cliché under the sun and borrows so many aspects from dozens of other movies (including ones Johansson herself is in) that if you take it too seriously it'll be completely lost on you to the point of being terrible. It is derivative, vacuous, and slightly shallow.But, and you'll have seen from my score, it is far from a bad movie.Lucy sees Johansson's protagonist of the title caught up in a drug deal gone bad. Through no fault of her own she ends up ingesting the drug and finds her mind and body fundamentally altering and seemingly evolving to a higher plane.Already I can see people screaming 'Limitless', 'X men', and even '2001 Space Odyssey'. They're not completely wrong - this movie borrows so many aspects from these and more that it basically is a compilation of every sci-fi movie you've ever seen.But that said, while it tries to take ITSELF seriously with pretentious twaddle about evolution and psychology, it is delivered stylishly enough to be entertaining.Besson's direction is also good - there are plenty of stylish set-pieces and another of his notable works, Fifth Element, is here in spirit too. The guy does know how to produce a slick movie.The problem is the content, and the way it's delivered. The first half of the movie sees 'correlation' cut offs between what's happening to Lucy and Morgan Freeman's Dr Norman giving lectures to a crowd of academics which 'just so happen' to be explaining the nature of evolution and the primitive stage of human psychology. It's all very interesting but the idea all this is happening to her while he's delivering his very convenient sermons really pushes the envelope. Naturally she finds him and seeks his help 'because he's the only one who can help her'.Another notable flaw is the 'bad guy' is literally there for the sake of being a bad guy. He doesn't exude any fear, menace, or indeed interest, and seems wholly contrived for the sake of there being a nemesis.But, while Besson probably did intend this to be taken more seriously than it ends up being, it nevertheless entertains thanks to quick pace, an intriguing premise, and good cinematography. The visual effects are especially decent.However I have no idea why he thought it a good idea to stick Scarlett in a ridiculously sexy dress for two-thirds of the movie - don't get me wrong, I'm as hot-blooded as any other man and don't object to it, but it was unnecessary, distracting, and it served no purpose beyond eye candy. It certainly wasn't practical for the character's situation.Ultimately it was a fun, silly, well-executed if flawed movie which had designs grander than it was actually able to deliver.",7,0,2,8 January 2015
Rear Window," So brilliant and yet not...
","I'm quite frustrated having watched this one. I'll get to that later...Rear Window is about Jeffries, a photographer for a magazine in a kind of half-way house (Or maybe it's his own place) after an accident broke his leg. With nothing to do all day he stares out the window onto the courtyard and watches his neighbours' various lives. However, after a while one of them seems to go missing and her husband seems suspicious in his behaviour, so Jeffries decides he must have killed her. The rest of the movie sees Jeffries bringing his girlfriend and nurse in on the paranoia, as well as a detective friend he has.The acting is terrific, no 2 ways about it. Superb, witty dialogue which exudes intelligence handled charismatically by all players. They truly suck us into their world, as the incredibly claustrophobic direction does. The cinematography is amazingly effective given the movie is set in one room, and makes the viewer as involved in the story as any movie I've seen. Hitchcock does a fine job here.Moreover the plot itself is utterly gripping, and, not surprisingly, suspenseful, and all 3 factors combine to give it all a level of charm which really smarts.SPOILER>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>The film just 'ends'. There's no twist, no plot, no explanation, nothing. What they suspected was the truth. The end. And this is what frustrates me about the movie.SPOILER>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>It's a fine piece of cinema, but ultimately because of the reason I state in the spoiler, it's a bit hollow.",8,4,7,9 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Fitting end to epic trilogy
","The major 2 trilogies of recent times have been Lord of the Rings and the Matrix. While the Matrix clearly peaked during its first installment, with the Two Towers it was clear that Lord of the Rings was capable of getting better all the time. Now, with Return of the King we see the final part, and it was certainly worth the wait.Having never read any of the books I cannot compare or judge the movies compared to them, but I can judge the movies on their own merit. And ROTK is a fine piece of cinema with a touch of everything a movie needs. It has action, adventure, cracking direction, mouth-dropping scale, good dialogue, a dash of comedy, and a gripping storyline. One could argue it is a tad convoluted due to the number of locations and characters referred to throughout, but it really doesn't detract from the quality.ROTK sees Sam and Frodo on their final part of the journey to the volcano, with Aragorn and chums engaging in battle with Orcs who're trying to take the City of Kings. I think that's what it's about anyway...The special effects are, again, marvellous, and are utterly breath-taking when seeing mass armies of thousands colliding with one another. The acting is good again, with characters we unquestionably care about.There aren't really any flaws with this, and it's definitely better than Two Towers. Only Fellowship of the Ring comes close, and I'd actually it's pretty even between the 2.Overall, superb film and fitting end to what has been a great adaptation.",10,0,0,18 December 2003
Fantastic Four," It's just *there*...
","Yet *another* of the conveyor belt line production systems provides us with a comic book adaptation, and this time it's the Fantastic Four.Jessica Alba is about the most famous name here, and she's the overly attractive and cleavage-endowed Sue Storm. Along with a group of 3 scientist she makes a trip to the moon (I think) to sample DNA (I think) but when a sunflare attacks the expedition the crew all experience genetic changes and find themselves with super powers.Yup, all original plot here.The rest of the movie sees the four of them at loggerheads with Von Doom, the big bad guy. Sort of.You see, the Fantastic Four is all a bit pointless. 4 scientist types get physically changed and then we wonder what the point is. Are they using these powers for good, or are they just trying to entertain the viewer? The ending reel is incredibly anti-climactical and really unsatisfying; not to mention cheesy and unoriginal.I honestly feel confused by what I make of this one; on one hand it *did* entertain for sure, but on the other it was completely futile and I got nothing out of it.As mentioned, for the guys there is Jessica Alba and her ample cleavage, and that's the attempt at giving the film sex appeal. To be fair, it works. She is a very hot lady.And yet there's little more to say about all this.It will kill an hour and a half, but if you expect something to think about and discuss, you might want to look elsewhere.",6,2,5,27 July 2005
Click," Mish mash of slush and surreality
","Sandler in a comedy, er, darker role, em...about a stressed out architect who gains a magical remote control.My opening line sums up my difficulty in categorising this movie. If you look at the press images and the DVD cover, it looks like any other Sandler comedy. In fact, it looks like any other fluffy Hollywood light hearted tale with plenty of amusement and more than a touch of sentiment.And for the first 45 minutes to an hour, it does this more than successfully - it is actually amusing, it is fairly sweet without being saccharine, and it is extremely entertaining with superb performances all round, including Walken as a crazy inventor and Hasselhoff in a role he was born to play as a hedonistic boss.And yet thereafter it becomes a dark, epidermal, and actually rather depressing tale of a man who makes mistakes and has to pay for them.Before ending sugar sweet, nauseatingly so.The problem I have with reviewing this movie is that it isn't sure what it is. It is not a comedy as the second half is anything but, and it is not a dark tale as the first hour is so light. So what is it? I'm not sure.First off, I have to say Sandler plays his part well, and does a good job of such a tricky role, while the simply gorgeous Kate Beckinsale provides the glamour and a very convincing US accent.And the direction is good with the story never slowing down.But it's the wild shifts in direction which leave a sour rather than saccharine taste in the mouth.One minute it is a comedy, then it's a depressing and grim sci-fi drama, before turning into 'it was all a dream' Dallas style (yes, really), before a sickly ending which tries to pay homage to the end of It's a Wonderful Life and fails horribly.That all said and done, it is not a bad movie, just a mixed up one.You will see worse, but it's better you know what on earth this one is.",6,0,1,5 November 2007
Spectre," Bond by the numbers
","Before I say anything critical of this Bond entry, I will prefix it with the assertion that the film IS entertaining, and reasonably fun. A movie's basic job is to engage, and on that level, it manages it reasonably well.However that is basically the major highlight of the production, with slight visuals and spectacular set pieces failing to mask a flimsy story, wooden acting and a hammy ending.In Spectre, a beleaguered and frankly bored-looking Daniel Craig once again takes the Bond reins - he appears randomly in Mexico in a fairly impressive 'one take' opening scene which lasts a seamless five minutes if not longer, and is enjoyable as much for the novelty of it as the digital trickery. Bond is after some guy and once he takes him out, pursues his wife, who in this case he is defending. Then convoluted plot about digital surveillance, information being power, and nemesis-esque characters appear and frankly you give up trying to make sense of the story.The problem with Spectre is how utterly meaningless all the meaningful stuff is - it tries to moralise about various aspects of its own plot and winds up making them look completely vacuous. And Daniel Craig does his job by the numbers, quite frankly going through the motions more than ever and making it look like his time as Bond is up. Given the utterly bizarre ending in this one, he probably thought it was.The set pieces are decent, but overblown. From the idiotic helicopter sequence to the even worse airplane one, there is a sense of director Sam Mendes trying far too much to impress and managing to parody the living daylights (pun intended) out of action movies.Meanwhile we still don't really know what the story is, or who this or that bad guy is or why on earth Bond ended up with that sultry chiquita.The problem is how badly it's all cobbled together. There is actually a basis for a decent story here, about how Bond appears to be going off the rails and losing his way, but it's never handled carefully enough for us to believe he's losing the plot - MI5 want him suspended through poor conduct and yet we know he's in the right - we never believe he's turning rogue or struggling.It's all a bit vague, messy, and while it's daft fun and not worth losing sleep over, two mediocre or worse movies of four from Craig is a pretty poor hit rate. His saving grace is the strong ones are both outstanding.Personally I think it's time for a new Bond - he was a good Bond but he struggled with this mess and while he's supposedly involved in the next one, I'd call it a day.",6,0,3,24 July 2017
Donnie Darko," This is what I call a debut
","I simply don't know where to start here. Having just got home from the cinema after viewing one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of witnessing I find myself in a state of awe.This is superb.The story is focused on a young man called Donnie Darko, who finds himself plagued by visions which suggest the end of the world is nigh. I will say no more than that, as to do so would ruin the story, just suffice to say the direction, acting, narrative, and overall structure is just so fresh, clean and brilliant it could only come from someone with an outstandingly creative mind and a flair for doing the right thing, at the right time. The structure of the story is brilliant, and the theme, very psychologically approached.If this is a debut from the director, Richard Kelly II, I can't wait to see his next project. Let's just hope he gets better, rather than bordering, like Shyalaman.",10,1,2,6 November 2002
The Birds," Usual Hitchcock quality shines through
","Slightly abstract thriller/horror engrosses for the duration and shows once again how good a director Hitchcock was.I'd heard vague references to Birds, particularly in relation to the opening scene of modern sci-fi flick 'The Core', and given my previous enjoyment of the content (If not always the endings) of other Hitchcock movies I thought I knew pretty much exactly what to expect. The Birds is a chiller from the 60s about a young woman, Melanie, who finds herself in the middle of a battle with huge flocks of birds. Aided and abetted by her beau Mitch, his mother Lydia and his sister Cathy, the motley crew endeavour to survive these ever increasing and inexplicable attacks, attacks which it becomes apparent are for the purpose of killing humans.The very first thing which struck me about this picture was I'd been convinced it was a black and white movie, and of course it is not. This gave the film a vibrant life not unlike Vertigo yet radically of its own ilk. However, like all Hitchcock flicks, the direction and cinematography are out of this world. The man's genius for breathtaking scenes and stunning colour combinations continues to amaze even today, and the multiple scenes with practically thousands of birds was on a scale I doubt has been repeated. It amazed me.Another of the qualities Birds has is that it is absolute enchanting. Undoubtedly helped by the richness of each scene, it is completely gripping all of the way and your attention never weans.The acting is also pretty good, if not quite as remarkable as Rear Window, Vertigo et al. It still oozes class, however.But the direction really is the main character in this, much like it is for so many of Hitchcock's other movies. The life which breathes from the celluloid never lets up, and while the ending isn't exactly conclusive, you shouldn't find yourself particularly worried or feeling hard done by. Instead feel enriched by yet another fantastic of cinematic genius at its finest.Truly absorbing.",9,4,7,29 April 2005
