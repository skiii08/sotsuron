10 Cloverfield Lane," I was worried there - for a bit!
","Let me start by telling you that I love Mary Winstead. I also really, really enjoyed the previous 'found footage' Cloverfield. It was a fun movie that gets you invested in the characters quickly and does not disappoint with the action and the effects. So, you can imagine why I was worried about the fate of this film. I wanted it to be as good, if not better than the original - a feeling I shared with Prometheus.It starts off well enough and moves into familiar territory for anyone who has seen the trailers. The movie does what the trailer promises. It builds an atmosphere that switches back and forth between oppressive and relaxed, and then back again so quickly that you get whiplash!! Fun!! It follows our strong leading lady and we are happy to go along with her. The script seems to be well written with no extra words or actors talking aloud unnecessarily just to explain what happened. I like that. But, the exclamations are there when they feel feasible. I would have probably said the same things. The plot moves, builds, and takes off a little predictably, but it is still done well enough to have me heaving a sigh or relief. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a fitting prequel. I can't wait to see what they do next!",7,0,2,8 May 2016
The Witch," nothing 'chilling' about this premise
","I was waiting for this one. I had heard so many rave reviews about it and really was looking forward to something fresh and new. However, the premise that is there in the synopsis(so no spoiler) about the family turning on each other is the oldest tale in the book! There is nothing 'chilling' or unexpected about it. In fact, it would have been more surprising had the family banded together to fight the 'evil'. It would also have give the story some much needed action! Now, I am not a lover of pure action gore only. I understand and enjoy the slow burn that leaves a lot of questions unanswered. This tale, though, doesn't have any questions, nor does it burn - at all. It is, however, shot quite beautifully. There are some jump scares and some unsettling gore (unsettling I say - for the uninitiated). The end is predictable and boring. Disappointed! :(",3,3,8,8 May 2016
