Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Starwarsfilm, and that tells it all
","I went in to the theatre i Norway 0001 in the night with an open mind. I had to be positive, try to like Jar Jar, and I was ready for fun, lots of fun. I that I got. I loved it -10 out of 10!!!!! The only real problem with the film was that it was no brakes, just action non stop. I guess the original story was weigh to long for one movie, so George Lucas just packed it extra tight together, but it worked. And I must say that Starwarsfans that got disappointed over this movie had just too big expectations, they was expecting a movie with the action of Ep 4, 5 and 6 together! Yes it was not the film that was wrong, but their expectations. At the end I would like to say that real fans are fans that love Starwars no matter what, in good and bad days! (even though this was a bloody good one)",10,0,0,20 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The greatest ( together with the rest of course)
","What can i say? This film must be one of the most beloved movie ever, together with the 2 others. I have not seen TPM yet, because it does not show up here ( I am from Norway) until 20. August. But enough about the others. This one you have to see, and i am sure you have, and I am sure you love it. Cause this is no ' Piece of junk' or 'old fossile' or 'big walking carpet'!MTFBWY all, always",10,0,0,15 July 1999
