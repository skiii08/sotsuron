Ford v Ferrari," Best film of the year
","In my opinion this film is the best film of the year. The acting is amazing. The music is perfect. The cinematography is flashy in a way that suites the film. The story is brilliant. Based on a true story, this film kept me captivated the whole time I was watching it and it made me want to watch the real Le Mans this year. Excellent watch. A must see",10,3,6,2 December 2019
The Irishman," Complicated without being overwhelming
","This film is brilliantly directed, written, preformed and edited. Everything in this film feels realistic but not boring. The story is hard to explain but great to watch. It's a film like I've never seen before and although it's a bit too long for my liking (3 and a half hours) it never feels too drawn out.",9,4,8,2 December 2019
