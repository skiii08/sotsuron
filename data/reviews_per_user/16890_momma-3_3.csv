Requiem for a Dream," Ellen Burstyn was robbed!
","Ellen Burstyn gave the most powerful performance of the year (and of her career) in this haunting, surrealistic look at addiction.  Although this film is highly disturbing and is more like a two hour assault on one's sensibilities, it is worth watching over and over again for Burstyn's flawless performance.A cinematic masterpiece...a powerhouse performance.",Null,0,0,12 May 2001
Good Will Hunting," Can you say overrated?
","I couldn't stand this film.  After hearing all the hype surrounding its release, I rushed out to see it.  What a disappointment!  Get real, a conventionally attractive genius works as a janitor at Harvard!  What a concept! If this were a spoof or a satire it would be worthy but geez, they were serious!!! And Minnie Driver!  How much more whiney and annoying can an actress be!  Harvard attendee portrayed as such a loser...I kept crying out to the screen:  'Get a backbone already!'.  An overall waste a film.  Damon and Afflek are boring, annoying and have about as much charisma as captain kangaroo.",Null,0,5,24 April 1999
Jackie Brown," NOW I understand what all the Tarantino hype is about!!!!
","Fantastic performance by Pam Griere, amazing soundtrack, wonderfully directed, brilliant script...One of the year's best coming from one who thought Pulp Fiction was completely overrated and Tarantino was the flavor of the month.  Jackie Brown is worthy of Tarantino's praise.",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
