Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 - A monumental feat of genius sci-fi filmmaking
","Let me start by saying that I am fairly new to the Blade Runner universe. Prior to seeing 2049, I had only had the pleasure of seeing the original twice (both times being The Final Cut), and both viewings within the month leading up to the new installment, helmed by French-Canadian Denis Villeneuve, a man who has solidified himself as quite possibly my favorite working director at the moment. So, having been a massive (albeit brand new) Blade Runner fan, does this one live up to the hype? In short, abso-frickin-lutely.I need to see it again now, not because of how much I enjoyed it, but because 2049 requires a great deal of thinking. The plot, the story developments aren't conveyed via words, but rather mainly through visuals. I won't deny that there were several segments throughout the film where I felt about as intelligent as a can-opener, because as an audience member you're forced to sit back and think about what has happened and why. There were moments where I actually had to ask myself if I was an idiot for not understanding why something was happening upon initial viewing, or is this a film that asks you to think instead of explicitly displaying everything you need to know at the tip of your fingers? After some theorizing once the movie ended I realized that it was definitely the latter. 2049 is one of very few sci-fi films that actually forces you to think, not because of plot convolution or narrative inconsistencies, but because of its complex nature.Everything is on point here. The direction is superb, as is the writing. The cinematography is genuinely among the best I've seen from a mainstream film (as is Gassner's heavenly production design). And every actor brings out some of their best performances (with Ford deserving special praise, he truly is a powerhouse here). Blade Runner 2049 represents a monumental achievement in modern-day filming that meets and supersedes the expectations set by Blade Runner (1982), thanks to the undeniable efforts of everyone involved.",10,9,21,8 October 2017
