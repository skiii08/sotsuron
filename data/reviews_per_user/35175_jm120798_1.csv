Iron Man 3," Iron man 3 disappointment
",This movie was a huge disappointment to the visual effects and characters in this movie.I am a huge fan of iron man from the first movie to the third and having picked Shane Black there I knew this director was to make a few changes to this movie.Unfortunately they weren't up to my expectation the visual effects were to much to stand for in this movie not enough slow relaxing time without visual effects. The mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who I hoped to be the main villain in this movie was just a spoof so the real villain in the movie Aldrich Killian who is played as Guy Pearce wasn't any good at playing a bad villain in the movie so I'm very disappointed.,5,4,8,6 May 2013
