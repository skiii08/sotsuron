The King's Speech," Little told piece of history
","Just saw this movie, Firth & Rush should get an Oscar for their performances. It was well directed, produced & well cast. Maybe the Winston Churchill character was a bit of a push; not by much & the rest of the actors did very well in their characters.The movie didn't drag in the very least, it moved right along. The viewer is well informed of the dynamics of mostly of these two characters, the King (George the VI) and the therapist. They are pushed together mostly out of desperation, on the Kings part, but also by a sense of servitude on the therapist's.The movie centers on a very dramatic time in the world. A monarchy that has ruled a large part of the world, an impending World War II and the shake up, that gets thrown into the lap of a man who barley saw it coming.It was again, a very well scripted movie; it has elements of comedy, drama, suspense. It isn't an action movie by definition, but there is an allusion of it, in that the viewer is held in suspense that without knowing history, you wouldn't know how this story would turn out.",9,0,1,30 January 2011
Black Swan," With every white side, is a dark one
","This movie is more about character development than an involved plot. There is no real twist & turns that encompass many other thrillers. But the acting, casting, production & directing is top notch. Not a real heavy story line, but there are anticipations that leave the viewer wondering.Natalie Portman, as Nina Sayers, does an excellent job in this story. She is completely believable, and leaves nothing behind in her portrayal of this tortured to the dark side character. Mila Kunis, as Lily, the rival, does a good enough job in portraying the part. I might be the most critical on her but her dancing was as good as any of the other people in the film. Mila might have been just a touch over the top as the 'bad girl' of the dancing troop. Barbara Hershey plays Nina's mom. She plays the part like she was born for it. She is over bearing & controlling, and can be seen as the root to why Nina is so embattled. Winona Ryder (beth) plays a small part, but underlines the ruthlessness that is the competitiveness in the dancing world, and the back drop to this film; bringing out the dark side in all of the main characters. Finally, Vincent Cassel, Thomas Leroy character, is the catalyst that brings the characters together. Thomas is a very powerful character that pits the others against each other in his own clandestine manner. You get the sense that when his dancers are used up, he casts them aside like trash. In the mean time however, if you are the dancer in his favor, you are the member of royalty that is monarchy in the world of his ballet troop.The story unfolds as an up & coming young talented star, Nina, is thrust to the lime light, due to the falling of grace of an aging dancer, Beth. Nina is by her own word, 'perfect' as the white swan but falls short in the metamorphosis into the Dark Swan. The dance director, Thomas Leroy, casts doubt on Nina's ability to dance the full spectrum of the swans. Nina's battles not only emerge from competition from the other, under study dancer, Lily, but from her own mind. Nina knows all she needs, is to find 'it', but will Leroy allow the development? Nina is tortured because she feels that Leroy is playing her with Lily. In the mean time, Lily is getting into Nina's head by being an intervening force of Nina's self discipline & personal life. Lily is selling it as a friendship but in Nina's head, it is a torment that is an em-battlement of her wits. With no real plot twists, the viewer is left wonder where they are? Though they're not in the overall plot, there are always twists that can haunt some minds",8,1,4,24 December 2010
Life of Pi," 3D does it justice
","I don't know if it is fair to compare to the book? If not comparing to the book, I would give it eight stars (8********)! The reason I think the movie lags comparatively, is the book makes the story plausible. There are holes that need to be filled, that the movie doesn't give the back story to.The 3D effects are excellent however & that alone is probably reason enough to see this movie. Though a lot of the movie is CG, you'll be pressed to point it out. Everything in the movie seems real.The spiritual content was actually crucial to the story & the accompanying symbolisms. Though not outlined so much in the movie, the book does effectively, that at the end of the story the reader says: 'ah'.The movie is only an above average story that leaves the viewer the questions & partially lost. There is the main plot, but those other elements from the book, not effectively projected to the movie, leave a lot more questions than answers.The viewer only has to follow the main plot & write off the other elements to open interpretation.",6,0,2,24 January 2013
District 9," Looking from another's point of view
","There were some funny moments in the film. I thought it well produced but the directing left the imagination of the viewer to reason why a human would have developed a strong bond with an alien; 1st name basis? It is from a view of a documentary that the main character is taking the viewer through, to show how aliens are to be evicted from 'District 9'.It shows the vindictive side of oppression & from the view of an oppressor that the table turns.From a development, the protagonist of the film must ally with the sub character. Sort of like the Huck Finn adventures.In the sense of the overall plot, there is a real message to be taken from the film; not so far from what South Africa has had to keen themselves to in recent history.",7,0,1,8 May 2011
Gran Torino," The many sides of prejudice
","It is a meta-chromatic message of prejudice that is conveyed in this film. Basically, it has a protagonist coming from of an era of times war, that paint a picture of hate for the enemy. His relationship with friends have greetings inundated with racial slurs of endearment.The message given is that a person using these slurs to express prejudice & racial hate, may indeed look deeper through the surface of the skin to see the true person, and their character. His prejudice isn't necessarily ingrained with hatred but certainly was part of his culture growing up.Clint Eastwood has a fine delivery. There are some loose ends that are left to the imagination. I feel that the imagination left to the viewer is what makes the film so good.The message from the film can be more profound than the film itself.",8,1,3,8 May 2011
The Fighter," They brought their A game.
","The main actors really put out their best work in this film. It seemed that Mark Whalberg, the actor he is, took the back seat in this film. His part wasn't weak, it is the others really stepped up in their performance level.Christian Bale seems to translate into a complete metamorphosis, to play the drug addict brother to the protagonist in the film. His part in no way had any flaws; probably one of his top performances ever.The mother, played by Melissa Leo, also a great performance. Though she is in real life, only 11-14 years older than the actors playing her sons in the movie, she pulls it off; again flawlessly.The others, including Amy Adams, really have it together in this story. The cast ensemble are really good.Though this movie might have a 'feel' of a Clint Eastwood production, it in no way resembles 'Million Dollar Baby'. This movie is based on a true story, each of the main characters having their own life struggles, having to need the others support to make their mark in life. Each of these main characters struggle for their significance that is part of the mark in their life.Though this movie is probably classified as a 'sports' or 'boxing' movie, the actual sport has little to do with the fabric of the overall structure of the story. It is a story of underdogs coming from the ruins of their particular neighborhood, working hard to get to where they could be on top or within reach of it. There are the usual struggles & trials, in the trips & falls along the way. How one can rise, just to fall harder & lower than ever before, or to rise, keeping at a plateau until you can finally walk into the sunset with head held high.",8,0,0,17 February 2012
