The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The worst movie of decade!
","I would like to review this film. In my opinion, it does not deserve any review, because the plot is awful, sometimes it feels you watch different films at the same time. Acting is bad; especially the main role actress does the 'credit'. I will admit that previous parts entertained me to some extent, but this one not only disappointed me. It made me so angry, that I wanted to complain to OFCOM. The trailer showed completely different film. 2.5 hours of boring talking about nothing with poor acting! Not a single person on this planet deserves that punishment.THE WORST FILM OF THIS DECADE EASILY!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!",1,24,40,23 November 2014
