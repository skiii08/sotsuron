Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Martial Arts Western
","What I like about the BILL movies so much is how QT drops itty bitty pieces of information and he uses it as a *plant* while he self-indulges in action and bloodbaths (Ok, we know the Bride is deadly, she can pull eyes outta people's sockets) - and then the payoff comes when we get the Pai Mei training sequence. - Oh, so that's how she managed to cut through those 27 some body guardsDeath List Five.She coulda killed them all easily and QT coulda used different methods for their massacre... yes, easily killed them. But what's also great is this nice contrast in rhythm and pace the both films have, and the fact that the plot never does seem redundant:The sh** happens moments in VOL. 2 when B. gets shot with rock salt... or the unexpected turn when Elle poisons Budd.You hear comments from fans (or fan-boys) who state that all the DVa's should have been extensively 'characterized' as O-Ren? THAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE FILM REDUNDANT! And besides, didn't anyone love how O-Ren's exposition revealed what the genealogy of KILL BILL would be(a ongoing tale of bloody revenge)While the film is more talky than not, and a lot of heavy OTN at that; it has its trailer moments of action... action in V2 isn't overblown but it still rivets attention and awe from the viewer when QT blends his images with the music from Westerns like Navajoe Joe, The Good the Bad and the Ugly and this track called 'Silhouette of Doom' which plays in the film's film noir recap intro and in the gruesome 'eye for an eye' scene in the chapter called ELLE AND IIts also got the flavor of the cheesy oldies rear-screen projection; rear-screen thats B&W with colored F.G. elements. Also the different film stock and Chinese Shaw Bro. crash zooms in the Pai Mei chapter. Its a mainstream film that has the flavor of NONMAINSTREAM movies. Had Michael Bay directed this, it would have been CHARLIE'S ANGELS.But its directed by Quentin Tarantino. He's a weirdo and a psycho. But a bona-fide weirdo and whack job at that. Arrogant as people call him, the man brags about how much money he has to live the life of an artist; because he is an artist.Kill Bill saga? Both films get a 10/10 (GRADE A+) as a guilty... or maybe a not so guilty pleasure film in my book.",Null,0,1,23 August 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Graceful.
","A mixture of different genres. I, as before admire QT's choices of songs. It is evident how they had to cut out the 'If it is Christ you seek' part in the Pai Mei chapter... and how I feel it turned out better that they stopped it at the dinner table scene where Beatrix hands are ruined to pick up chopsticks.Was rather starteld at the fact that they had to reveal what Elle later did to Pai Mei ... 'You treacherous dog'.Had mixed feelings about QT NOT including the monologue of Beatrix in the coffin where she was to say 'You've been breathing like you've just been f----- but it mighta seemed awkward if he put that in anyway. so there.
A fun piece of artful cineplex made by a man who truly puts all his heart into what he does; what he did with this one.On another bewildered note, the fight with Bill is NOT how you people who read the s.p. expect it to be. Its really quick. But I'm glad to report that the dim-mak stuff was portrayed onscreen just right. No sound fx though about the 'exploding heart'.Did she really kill Bill?Anyways, have fun at the end credits seeing footage of Vol. 1 looking back at those sober times when you couldn't wait for the chopped off second half.

Vertigo," Johnny-O
","An example of how much information can be withheld from the audience as the movie progresses and the irony (in literary terms) of letting them know MORE than the protagonist as the story reaches a certain turning point.I saw a clever tool being used when Kim Novak writes the letter of apology and there is a voice over, speaking NOT to the audience but to the person she is writing too in the process letting the audience know too, some information of the plot we didn't have a clue about early on.The dolly/zoom effect is used extnsively in this film and has been used by many imitators and inspired. Namely Spielberg in JAWS, when Roy Scheider gets up from his reclined position.What we get in the end, since we already know everything is NOT surprise but rather, anticipation and a lot of suspense. And finally we get the payoff of those earlier scenes in the film that lasted about an hour or so of the movie - when Scottie finally explodes in the end releasing the hurt of his betrayal.And there is one final twist in the movie, that despite Scottie's character arc of having possibly conquered his acrophobia - displays the irony and recurring area of the plot. It's like poetry, where it rhymes and some stanzas are repeated. And that's cohesion in the world of storytelling to me. You'll see what I mean when you see the film.As usual, Hitchcock has shot the film beautifully with excellent styling and Bernard Hermann's music accentuates the hypnotic thrill and dread; something that contributes even more to the suspense of the movie.A great movie. Highly recommended, if you are a film student. Especially if you are a screenwriter.VERTIGO. Grade A+",10,35,59,11 April 2005
Mission: Impossible III," Show me courtesy by looking at me when I speak.
","I was surprised to see extreme tension in the film... The movie was enjoyable popcorn fun, much much better from any stale rendition John Woo could ever do to a Mission Impossible movie. I'm glad the score of Lalo Schifrin wasn't as sacrileged as it was in MI2..... Phiip Seymour Hoffman does a terrific job of playing the very hatable antagonist - and the movie takes a few turns. What else is new? So much more is at stake, well at least for us, whom whose shoes we step into is that of Ethan Hunt's. I won't see more about what is at stake, but anyway witness superior IMF skills like forging a mask at a moment's notice, calculating math impromptu and in a very hilarious scene where our hero is captive - lip reading where Ethan must 'show someone the courtesy of looking at him when he speaks.' From righteous fury to retrieving what is personal is Ethan's character arc. A standard Hollywood piece, but I'd like to repeat - has plenty of tension to get you going.Eight out of Ten.",8,4,8,3 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Juvenile, and the pacing is glacial.
","Yeah, right. It is. But I think the subplot of Sidious controlling the Senate so the cowardly Chancellor Valorum will be voted off office was genius. Only hardcore fans can see through this.But like many people say, the execution wasn't as brilliant as that of ANH, or the favorite of everyone: The Empire Strikes Back. The direction wasn't particularly that sharp; albeit the mixing of principal live action plates and CG was a daunting challenge that required discipline. And the acting? Its awful! Save for Ian McDiarmid, and Ewan McGregor who were good enough in their roles. Liam Neeson was good enough, at least as good as Alec Guiness might have been some 25 years earlier.The only thing worth it here is the end duel at the hangar done to the operatic 'Duel of the Fates' by John Williams. A brilliantly choreogrpahed piece of lightsaber swashbuckling action. Watch how Darth Maul (played by martial arts champion Ray Park) kicks Qui-Gon in the chin at bulletspeed when Qui Gon leaps after he backfists him knocking him to the lower catwalk. Just beautiful. It is one of the best fight scenes in movie history in my book. But this movie itself??? Well, you can pretend that you love it by watching it with fastforwards. Do it that way, and you'll only eat up 45 minutes of your life.6/10",Null,1,2,4 February 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Come Fly With Me
","Some lighthearted family entertainment...... its a Christmas movie! Frank only calls Carl (Hanks) every Christmas. Spielberg can do sleight of hand, some very interesting camera angles. This movie was shot in 40 days or so if I'm not mistaken.  Plants and payoffs... e.g. the necklace, the 'two mice', Hanratty's issue of 'not having a family', and the biggest one; how Frank passed the bar in Louisiana.The ultimate payoff for me were the arcs of both the protag and the antag. And its an ending thats satisfying, and brings closure to this comedy caper INSPIRED by a true story (save for the stuff they made up).Watch out for the Forest Gumping in the beginning of the movie. You can never know its CG. John Williams's score is great too, reminds me of PINK PANTHER.

And then later on blow up the ark of the covenant to negotiate Marion's release.Karen Allen is hot at this time. Ford and everyone else shine in their roles.

Minority Report," Do I even have one?
","One of cinema's best and genius whodunnits. In fact, a 'whodunnit before hedidit' Thanks to scribe Scott Frank and the dynamic and enthusiastic direction of Steven Spielberg. Without spoiling why, it's got excellent misdirection in one scene in the end. And this is a good example of how a protag's internal discord can be made into an external goal and how the main conflict and the action can be integrated into character. I've read the Jon Cohen early draft and it's not as impressive as the version being used in the movie. But I've also read the script that was used for this one; I noticed how Spielberg eliminated the pay off for the 'one eyed man being king'.In our point of view, we get an arc for Colin Farrel's character. Speaking of arc's there would have been no arc for John Anderton if the movie ended with the little misdirection twist in the Leo Crowe confrontation.Were the final scenes a dream?

Se7en," It's hard to comprehend. But no one can deny it.
","Directed by David Fincher.If this film had a clear-cut protagonist, I'd say it would have to be Somerset. The characters come to the surface as Mills (Pitt) is paired with Somerset (Freeman), Mills being an overconfident, cocky Detective and Somerset being the more laid back, methodical and wise.Gwyneth Paltrow is lovely as Tracy Mills, who hides her being pregnant to her husband but seeks advice from Somerset. What's interesting is to see how vile 'the city' was portrayed in SE7EN. Somerset quits because he can't take it anymore. Paltrow doesn't want it here, but she couldn't tell David to have them go back home because she doesn't want to be a burden. It is the perfect symettry of the underlying theme of <i>sin</i>, and how the killer uses capital punishment and how he uses his work to preach.If you haven't seen this movie and haven't been spoiled, mind you there is almost nothing that is gonna prepare you for it. The ending is not for the squeamish... Fincher portrays the final scenes with ominous nuance and beautifully photographs them. Wonderful early-morning scenery in that deserted setting.Fincher, as a former music video director uses his technical expertise on cinematography, editing and he does it very well, as every shot of this movie is brilliantly crafted and edited in. That low-angle 'worms eye view' shot of Doe pointing his gun on Mills's head. The temporal snippet of the shot of the slide of Mills's pistol snapping back as he fires it in the final scenes, the taut editing of Mills kicking the door to Doe's apartment. Reminds me of Forest Whitaker opening the safe in PANIC ROOM, right when he pulls it open, the movie cuts RIGHT INTO the safe. And many other beautiful shots in this movie...This is NOT a feel-good movie, so if those kinds of movies are your bread and butter, you might want to pass on this one. But then again this movie is too great of a film for you to even miss.I said Somerset is the protag of this movie. He is. You'll see his arc during his VO, the last line said in the film.You may find the ending of SE7EN hard to comprehend, but it is something you will remember and can not ever deny.Grade A+",Null,1,2,6 October 2004
Unbreakable," Always beautiful.
","Still very beautiful and typical M. Night. Watch for him as a drug dealer in the stadium. As in good movies, the twist in the end IS in the beginning, the text on the demographics of comicbook collectors foreshadows that twist. I loved the stylish upside down POV shots, that happens when the kid is watching TV and when Sam finally gets a glimpse of what the man in the camouflaged jacket is carrying. And I loved that shot in the train where Willis's face is put in sharp focus while the bright background is behind him as he looks around, scared and confused when the train is about to crash. Similar to that shot in SIGNS where Mel Gibson is centered in the frame as he watches in terror what happens to his son in the living room. I'm always impressed by the way Manoj Nelliyatu frames his sequences.Also, I'm glad there was a payoff for the 'revolver', foreshadowed in the scene where Dunn recollects the two big incidents in his life, by the way that scene with the revolver later on? It is pretty tense. Very nice the way Manoj plays with the tension between David and Audrey, it is setup in an early powerful sequence in the train where Dunn removes his wedding ring as he is about to speak to another woman. I also loved the long take in that train sequence by the way... the 'reflection' shot of young Elijah on the TV... Night'smovies are always beautiful to look at.Don't worry about the WHERE ARE THEY NOW superimpositions in the end.Unbreakable is 9/10, way up there with Night's 3 other entertaining Hollywood thrillers.

Fight Club," Profound. But OTHERS will find preposterous
","This movie reflects society and attacks it simoultaneously. It asks questions that most wouldn't bother to ponder on. This movie goes past REASON and what really motivates us, and what could make us better.Not sayin' any just person should imitate anything depicted in this movie, but also try askin: How much do you know about yourself if you haven't been to a fight?Others will find this movie ridiculously overwrought. Some will find it a rather abstract, and artistic depiction of a man faced with a conundrum where his world is now influenced by his best friend... (Tyler Durden)David Fincher is the genius of modern- visual IN YOUR FACE moviemaking and magnified focus on the subject matter of his movies. Particularly this one.

Speaking of arcs, I won't give much away but was VERY pleased to see an arc for Octavius's character...... I thought the finale was gonna be a rehashing. But not it wasn't. Its got cohesion... sure its got lines that weren't very impressive. And oh, speaking of cohesion there were scenes that once you watch them you felt that Koepp in the first film had precognitavely setup when in fact the writers of this second film DEVICED their own creative ways to put in the payoffs.Hmmmm...... one problem is that I don't remember it being explained why Spidey got rusty on his powers. Lack of protein?The scene in the hospital where Ock wreaks havoc tips off Raimi's skill as a horror man... True, some scenes were LOUD but because of the thrill and the excitement that is DELIVERED so well by this movie, I can't complain... or rant... maybe in later viewings I'll see parts where this falters (besides some of the unimpressive lines)I think this movie has the spirits of light, saturday matinee classics such as BACK TO THE FUTURE or RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.

Match Point," Luck?
","Luck. That is what Chris Wilton describes at the opening scene of MATCH POINT... Please take note that the thoughts explored in that opening are exactly what is explored in the closing scene. The film is a matter-of-factly depiction of the troubles one has to face during extra-marital affairs, or forbidden relationships for that matter. Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays the character with the much needed intensity and bustling pressure that occupy Chris Wilton. Johansson is able to stand out as the strong-willed Nola Rice, aggressive and anxious to put things to a resolve suspense builds as she always desires to make things her way if Chris's actions aren't enough for her... Bryan Cox is excellent as Alec, the father-in-law of Chris, this is the first time I have seen Cox with an English accent... same with all other players, they shine in this Woody Allen piece. Woody Allen handles his work with the D.P. and camera operators very well, some interesting shots, long takes e.g. the scene where Chris bumps into Nola in the sidewalk and walks her into her audition and many more.The suspense in this tragic drama builds to an almost unbearable level when Rhys-Meyer's character decides to do the deed that will be the turning point towards the climax of the movie. The intensity of his portrayal of what Chris is going through in those scenes is perfect and only appropriate. As with most of the movie, that turning point of a scene is accentuated with some opera music as well, and more spine-chilling in it's melody at that during the sequence.Well, the movie does not end as ... Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson) would have had it, but it does not end on an 'up' note either. And it does not end the way you think it would, if you can tell my train of thought (no, not a happy ending) but not that either. Instead it closes with a little discrepancy, in fact a little twist that happens against Chris Wilton's act in the end of the film... and as mentioned in the opening scene, it closes with a little bit of luck. Just watch what I mean. The 'lucky' element is a visual parallel of the first thing you see when the film opens. Excellent filming of the 'objects' involved in what I am referring to.Allen has done a terrific job in weaving a tale of passion, obsession and the release of self-control and decisiveness and the consequences of it in this life. Whatever his intentions have been, MATCH POINT has been a most engrossing, suspenseful and riveting experience of cinema.Grade A+",10,0,3,16 May 2006
The Prestige," Watch closely.
","As if I don't already disrespect The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, my bias and unfavorable view of AMPAS will be reinforced if THE PRESTIGE is not at least nominated for Best Original Screenplay. In that category alone, is where the film succeeds. Another tautly written piece of Gothic cinema and heavy drama from Christopher Nolan, and Jonathan Nolan. Good and intense performances from everyone all around, and although Scarlett Johansson is the hottest thing to look at, it was hard for me to adjust to her playing an Englishwoman.The movie takes the audiences behind the scenes in the art of ledgerdemain, but more essentially - behind the intricacies of the relationships of these rivaling performing artists. More than trap doors, and body doubles (although the latter element will be a heavy aspect of the plot, that I say without spoiling much) - each complexity and nuance of the interpersonal relationships in this film are thoroughly explored, without the audience hinting that some of these little details are foreshadowings in themselves that will be exploited as shattering revelations as the film concludes. So pay attention to detail.There may be a little pomp in the SCI-fi element, and I do mean Science Fiction, NOT magic or prestidigital fiction, but the way Nolan crafts the story make it all seem acceptable, and maybe even worthy of your standing ovation because of the tautness of this dark masterpiece. So really, without trying to merely parrot the movie's tagline, I echo it in of my own accord: Watch closely.10/10",10,2,4,25 October 2006
Silent Hill," Burn her at the stake!
","First of all, let me say it was never a surprise to expect the top-notch performance by Ms. Mitchell; one of my favorite Aussie talents, after 'Phone Booth', 'High Art' among the titles in her repertoire. I liked the maturity she brought to the character, and same can be said of course for Sean Bean - both players set the seriousness of the mood in the film's opening. Also, following 'Flight Plan' it's REFRESHING to sea Mr. Bean play a good guy after playing the villain in countless flicks, Fellowship of Frodo, Patriot Games, Goldeneye, Ronin, et cetera.<ul><li>The 'entrance' into the terror is one of the best cinematic moments I've seen but for some reason it was marred by the sudden explosive grandiosity of the demonic villains who were shown right on the moment Rose encounters them. I would have wanted an inductive motion in revealing them a little later on. You'll also see Rose's calm despite her missing daughter when she tries to make the female cop relax.</li></ul><ul><li>As it progresses, you will see Sean Bean portray a father in a desperate time, fighting no matter what to get to his wife and daughter.</li></ul><ul><li>The visuals are great, but like I said the sudden exposure to the bombast of the situation and the grotesque villains didn't work for me... They should have saved it or restrained themselves from being too overwrought.</li></ul><ul><li>The score was masturbatory. Whoever scored this film should retire.</li></ul>But in the end it raises some questions in the audience, like what would you do if your daughter was tied to a world so alien like that? And of course the theme of persecution is played out when we see the religious zealots as the 'weaklings' fighting against the demons but a reversal occurs in the end when Rose is the one persecuted by the fanatics.It's watchable.

Ocean's Twelve," The beauty of Peter Andrews's work

The last movie I did, I use some upside down POV shots... maybe I should try this takilid camera angle some time...I've also wondered early on why the film had to show Toulour very diligent practicing his graceful dance - the scene juxtapoused when most of the Ocean personnel are busted.

","No spoilers here, so read on.I found this completely riveting to watch. And with great performances from all of the players. And at some point I like the framing, the tightening up slowly on character's faces. I'm n0t sure if Mike Nichols is a trendy director, but I do know he is a veteran and I enjoy his previous works that I've seen. But I guess it only does get trendy if he starts using the rack-focus, and I don't seem to remember that being used in the movie.Very entertaining. Especially the chatroom exchange between Larry and Dan, and the ultimate payoff, it is foreshadowed but very subtly in the beginning. A nice little twist in the end.

Lost in Translation," For relaxing times. Make it Suntory time.
","At first viewing you'd think the scenes were put together arbitrarily. Lost In Translation demands a second viewing to fully appreciate how Sofia Coppola makes the movie actually live up to it's title. There is indeed cohesion of scenes, if only just merely referencing something earlier as opposed to the standard blatant foreshadowing and payoffs. Such as the smile at the elevator. And Charlotte, when she was all by herself really did bang her toe up hard. All I'm saying is that the cohesion is very subdued, and you don't exactly get the KILLER SHARK feel of the story moving forward. You'll get the impression that the way Sofia tells the story is rather frivolous but it's not. Bob's character arc bends 180 degrees when he DOES want to stay to be with the Johnny Carson of Japan guy. I don't wanna spoil anything but you'll know why this character arc surfaces when you watch the film. And there is still the conflict in each scene - and Bob's relationship with his wife comes to the apex of bitterness in a bathtub scene later in the movie. Speaking of bitterness, Charlotte becomes this way a little later in the film when something unexpected happens. 'I guess you're busy', Charlotte says that's all I'm gonna give a way as a hint to what I'm talking about. Sofia Coppola does know what she's doing and after what she has put you through with the rest of the film, the ending ultimately becomes a depressing payoff. As Bob regains level headedness and his arc has gone to a complete 360. And despite this praise I am giving Coppola - know that the way she writes narrative on page she was criticized for her work reading like that of a first year film student. But I guess the technicalities of the page in the screen writing craft don't matter, it's ultimately the execution and how you pull off your sleight of hand when you tell the story. I said a depressing payoff - but yes the payoff this similar reaction Coppola has also managed to do in her movie THE VIRGIN SUICIDES where the ending is spilled at the beginning but when you get to it, you feel like you've been riding a vehicle that hit a hard sudden brake. I guess that's skill from the writer-director. And in those moments where Bob and Charlotte are happy-go-lucky, we as the audience would love to unwind as we have been put under pressure earlier exempli gratia Bob having to go through that irritating shoot of the commercial Suntory Time or Charlotte just really lost and bitter as she confides with someone in the telephone with some tears. I reiterate, you must reserve judgment - something I have failed to do until two or three viewings. Ultimately, what you will think of this movie's subdued acting, and storytelling is subjective but as the saying goes you truly haven't seen a film unless you've seen it three times. Is this one of the movie's failures because it didn't manage to hit me hard on first viewing? If it is, then this doesn't deserve the recognition it got in the Oscars. But NO. No, in my opinion Lost in Translation isn't overrated. A-",8,3,6,30 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," They did their best
","While still not as solid as A New Hope or Empire Strikes Back, this movie sure does entertain and is well worth a look.The chase thru Coruscant is nothing short of spectacular. The Battle at Geonosis, although it might be considered by some as abuse of CG is pure eye-candy.The pacing of this film is an improvement over TPM.

(During the scene when Michael learns about upset news, and younger Vito sorrowful over his ailing baby).The ending is a study of how Michael Corleone can plunge into darkness, and a meditation of the decline on the family.

The Bourne Identity," Extreme Ways.
","I loved it. Matt Damon is very convincing as an action star. The action in this movie really HURTS. There are no overblown sequences like parachute jumping or airplanes crashing into casinos, instead there are gritty hand-to-hand grappling sequences; where Bourne is able to disarm security guards with his empty hands. The first of these scenes is very interesting - it takes place outside, and for some reason Bourne rediscovers his abilities and muscle memory as a killing machine when he incapacitates two night officers.His boss, Conklin after being disturbed by the unusual turn of events that took place after Bourne failing his mission, decides to call on other hit men to take Bourne out. And with this Tony Gilroy is able to incorporate action and plot, where Bourne easily memorizes a map and drives through the city fleeing policemen. And running in the line of fire of an assassin after he distracts him by blasting a grill with a shotgun. With the scenes of Marie, we get to learn how caring and compassionate and compassionate a hit-man Jason Bourne really is... he cares for the kids; he sacrifices his sleep just to do so. This of course really pays off in the end when Bourne remembers why he failed the mission of Equono Wombosi.Gilroy's screenplay deviates from Ludlum's novel - set in another era when Carlos The Jackal Sanchez was still a fugitive; Gilroy obviously perceived that none of us can relate to that kind of story TODAY. Instead, he comes up with a very engaging plot about a professional killer with amnesia running from his own co-employees trying to investigate who he really is; why people are after him. And what was that mission he failed to carry out anyway.Acting is topnotch. So is the direction. There are stylized reverse cut-ins or cut-'outs'? Especially towards the end. But used to great effect. Doug Liman proves that less is more.I loved Moby's song in the end.9/10 Grade A-",Null,0,1,29 September 2004
The Village," Graceful. Frightening
","I walked in expecting to be let down. I wasn't. Guess the only thing I can rant about is how LOUD the film was at times...

North by Northwest," A True Classic
","An advertising executive is unsuspectingly setup by intelligence to pose as a decoy to a spy who supposedly, but doesn't exist. The suspense and thrills are great. And I especially like that frightening sequence in the airport after Thornhill asks Townsend 'Do you recognize this man?' And then Townsend's eyes suddently bulge... and - well, I won't spoil that scene just yet.I just wished that the fact that Thornhill was divorced by his ex's because of his living a dull life was foreshadowed more extensively. but I guess they couldn't have because as they say: START WHEN YOUR STORY STARTS. And I dont think it can count as a plothole or a flaw.You can see how Lehman crafts his story with care, precision and how he waits for that scene in the end where Eve reveals why she works for intelligence, and why she decided to cooperate. -- 'Has life always been like that?'Very interesting to see Thornhill's character arc. Watch how he pretends to have forgotten about Eve in the hospital. Watch what he does when CIA old man steps out to get him his drink. There's also a quick, funny scene where the woman in glasses goes 'STOP...... I mean.... Stop.'
I especially like Bernard Hermann's thrilling score. It has such an exhilirating, and sometimes hypnotic mood to it --- It's played in the beginning, in the scene where the intoxicated Roger tries to drive thru the hills, and in the movie's finale in Mt. Rushmore.Nowadays, its often hard to find an action film that's can be very solid, plausible and maybe have a feel-good aspect at the end.

So was Moynahan's, and as always Bridget Moynahan remains beautiful. The robots were too robo-ty at times. But I guess hence the title of the movie.I also wasn't really impressed with the John Woo-ish slo mo action scenes; but I've guess I've seen some of those in THE CROW or in DARK CITY. That something to rant about? I'm undecided.Some of the lines tried so hard to be funny; some were kind of on the nose.

Collateral," Typical Cruise
","Typical Cruise. Excellent performances by the players; but was surprised to see Foxx and even Pinkett in topnotch mode; not just mediocre nigga-nigga kind of acting. But really decent in executing their roles.What's interesting was to see a film shot in HD video, right? You could tell... its a different kind of look than the standard film stock kind of look. Although I believe there were INT. shots of the cab shot using FILM? I don't know.It was very well directed. Has a LOT of its moments, like the one where Vincent loses his patience with Foxx's boss... and attacks him later on telling Foxx to confront his boss by himself on the radio. Cruise is very convincing as the cold, efficient, agile double-tapping killer... There are those scenes that really make you grit your teeth because their fun to watch, and they just have that visceral amphetamine to rivet you to watch what's going on on the screen. Like when Vincent shoots the muggers, and the scene at FEVER where Vincent beats up the sentry men and later on fires rounds all over the place; eventually capping Peter Lim while he does so.Oh; lets not forget the scene at the hospital. How Foxx isn't really accepted entirely by his mother... and the possibility of Vincent insisting on visiting his mother so he can use it for his own ends; if its called for. A very morbid thought, Vincent even brings it up in a later scene... but that's why this movie is good. Its got it thrills set at night time LA... LA, right? Does have its scare factor.Does anyone notice Cruise's being a scientologist surface? Cosmic coindicence or not... when Vincent talks about those cosmic coincidences, Darwin the stars in our galaxy... Were those lines ad libbed? Perhaps there's a DVD commentary track that touches this.. Cruise is a scientologist is he not?It gets very suspenseful, and turns into a chase towards the end... you see Vincent as a sharpshooter and a true pro throughout the movie; don't wanna spoil anyone but what Vincent finally GETS in the end despite his being THAT professional and efficient? The last scene in the train. Will you feel cheated? This is a subjective matter.But I give my round of applause to Michael Mann, the players, the rest of the people who were able to produce this. plausible, highly entertaining suspense thriller. Its great. Definitely will grace my DVD collection.

The Machinist," I know who you are.
","One can only admire the discipline of Bale as he emulates what DeNiro has done in Raging Bull. They probably summarized the shooting scenes where he had his medium build before he lost some weight and ended up looking like the cadaver he is in this movie. He has this intensity that clearly is reaping the rewards of his earlier career in heavy drama as a child actor. The movie is extremely creepy and the score has some traces of Bernard Hermann influence in it. It's very Hitchcockian more than anything and it has moments that are not for the faint of heart. I wonder if the green palette was intentional and I wonder if it was achieved in post or during shooting. It has a clichéd concept though when you get to the end, but the execution, the tension you get from watching the film. The contageious fury that Bale brings to his role. It's all worth it. All involved are to be commended but praise goes to Bale, director Anderson and of course his scorer. The music makes this movie creepier than it would have been without it.",Null,2,3,12 August 2005

Gandhi," Think of it.
","Very beautiful and powerful movie. I found certain scenes very touching just like when Gandhi tells his stepdaughter that in times of doubt, the way of love and truth will always win, and sometimes, God's way is the best way. Also the very intense scene when the Indians persist going through the gate guarded by the troops and take their blows fearlessly; Walker telephones his report and testimony of the unbelievable event at the salt factory. The early scenes expose the fact that Gandhi, besides being a man of nonviolence is also a man of unbiasedness in worldwide religiosity, as he supports the teachings of Hinduism, the Koran and even Christianity... he even quotes Jesus in the New Testament in one scene where he converses with his Christian Presbyter friend. This, and other early scenes foreshadow the compassion, patience and endurance in the name of peace and love that Gandhi was to display for the rest of his life. Was also interesting to see Gandhi's stepdaughter mention something that might have been borne out of her love for him --- she says that Gandhi has always shown people a way out of madness, yet he and the world were not able to recognize it. This is also a film of TRUTH and unpretentiousness, as Gandhi's end is shown to us in the beginning of the movie, and recapped in the end. Beautiful VO by the Mahatma in the end when he mentions that powerful, evil tyrants always fall. And the way of truth and love has always won. I'll put GANDHI in my top ten from now on.",Null,3,6,15 October 2004
Batman Begins," It's what I do that defines me.
","I like the sociological commentary it has the same goals that the protag and the antagonist have but have different moral standards and methods of getting there. The movie opens with it's first Act having temporal displacement, to hold our interest and at times to delay exposition, answers to questions like why did Wayne end up in prison. What are the things that have kept his disturbed. From here, we also learn of the philanthropy and good will of his parents and his childhood fear of bats. When the movie clocks 45 minutes, after an immersion of rigid training with the League of Shadows, Wayne manages not to flinch and remain steely calm amongst a cyclone of bats inside a cave.Cillian Murphy - you wouldn't know he was the hapless and the hunted in 28 DAYS LATER when you see his effective villaneous performance in here. The theme of FEAR, is very well played-out. How Bruce Wayne uses his own weakness to make him stronger and to make his enemies share his dread. And you can see the symmetry between scenes, what Rachel tells Bruce in the hotel and what Batman throws back at her when she asks for his name. The compound in the blue flower, the hyperbole of it's effects displayed by the Scarecrowe and the ecoterrorism that stems from the mad doctor's medicine. Or how the TRAIN also becomes a character in the film at one point.Nolan is also a master at creating surrealistic nightmarish sequences, juxtapousition and quick flashes, we've seen him do this in Memento and even more in Insomnia where we become as restless as Al Pacino's character. From the side-effects of the blue flower to what happens when the good guys get poisoned by psychotropic hallucinogen.Batman Begins explores moral standards as well, from philanthropy to how our hero applies what he has learned in a monastery of Ninja Warriors to shake people out of apathy. There is no obvious contrivance of plot devices as the narrative is decisive and taut. The twist behind who or what group of people were really responsible for the depression in Gotham city that has caused many to hunger and turn into a criminal. One thing that Wayne tries to turn into at the beginning of the film and how he reveals how he lost many assumptions of what is 'right and wrong'.You will also see excellent location photography (like Nolan has given us in INSOMNIA), dark and eery sequences with a touch of film noir (we know Nolan is a master of this genre) in them especially with Jonathan Crane, the fear mongrelling Scarecrow who manages to bring down our hero and his District Attorney Lady friend for a time. And eventually, drives the mind of Gotham's toughest most feared criminal boss in for a reversal after the Batman puts him behind bars.Bale brings much duality to the character. Compared to Keaton who was also very good, Keaton was all about subtleties, but Bale brings an arrogance and caustic wit to the character of Bruce Wayne who immediately dons the persona of a beast when he wears the 'costume'. Many might NOT easily grow into appreciating how Bale approaches the role, but his skill because of previous experience in heavy drama as a child actor is put to good use here. Michael Caine, unlike Gough in the quad franchise is more than just a senior citizen lackey but also much like a guide and sort of a father-figure for Bruce. Alfred in here constantly reminds Wayne of his NAME and what might have been left of his father's legacy.And it boasts an all-star cast who all do very good. Morgan Freeman is entertaining as he is a much, older, wiser aid to Bruce Wayne and Batman. 'Didn't you get the memo?' The contentiousness of Rutger Hauer. And Neeson the movie's master antagonist is imposing as Ducard, Bruce Wayne's trainer in his techniques of subterfuge and warrior arts. Refershing to see Gary Oldman do an EXCELLENT job as the honest and noble Sgt. James Gordon amongst a crooked police department (someone who might be eventually Commisoner in the sequels).The score isn't the like the stylized Gothic timbre and melody that the duo of Tim Burton films had, but the collaboration of James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer coudln't have been a better marriage. From propulsive motifs to hints of histrionic texture as we mostly get from Newton Howard who scored 'Prince of Tides' and the last 4 M. Night Shyamalan movies. Zimmer has his signature in the score and the propellant energy of his music further accentuates the action scenes.Begins has finally vindicated the name of the Dark Knight after the failures of the last two in the earlier 'Batman quad'. And it is something (not just for fanatics of the DC comic) for those who love to watch an action or thriller movie with a good plot and some things that might be worth thinking about. While a rude awakening for some, the film stresses practicality and contains a verisimilitude not-so expected in movies of this genre. A very good character drama, disguised as an action-thriller. Kudos to Goyer, Nolan and his cast and crew.10/10",Null,0,1,31 October 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Einstein was no mutant.
","As I have expected, this by no means surpasses X-Men United, it's previous one, nor the original film. Yet it pays off certain plot points, such as the fully unleashed Phoenix, and the final revolt led by Magneto. Ratner does a reasonably good job, although this could have done better with the writers that Bryan Singer have used in X2. It has an intensity when the Phoenix is being dealt with, certaind deaths take place in X3. But on top of this, Professor Xavier maintains his higher sense of morales, in one sequence, Kitty Pryde even compares his ideals with that of a theory of Einstein... well, Einstein wasn't a mutant, replied Xavier. Watch Magneto levitate the most gargantuan object he has ever manipulated, see Shadowcat fight bravely against Juggernaut in a compassionate mission to rescue the mutant boy with the cure. Who's hiding, dickhead? And later, see Rogue make a decision of her own, a character highly underused in this film, but a key player if only; in respect the movie's main plot line.And it ends with Wolverine's flesh being subject to destruction in the movie's final sequence. All in all, it is watchable but does not pack a wallop as Singer's X-2; X-MEN UNITED has. But think of it as a sociological drama, with a few scenes of action, some frights that you can enjoy courtesy of Brett Ratner and company.7/10",7,2,4,24 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better
","I find this film a better film to watch than FOTR. Some might complain about the pacing - true; but with Gandalf fighting the balrog, the battle at Helms Deep, and the attack of those werewolf thingies? And overall better epic scope than FOTR; oh did I forget to mention Gandalf and the riders of Rohan trodding down the slope? Fantastic!I didn't like Sam Wisegamgee's VO at the end though. There's also a hint of their optimistic, yet slightly sick and desperate conversation about being in storybooks at the end though.The writers and PJ don't end like the TTT book does. They saved the real ending for TTT for ROTK, and if you watch ROTK - which is also a great film; you'll be impressed as to how they managed to rechronologize it along with the battle of Minas Tirith. Anyway, if they ended it this way for the TTT movie adaptation, it wouldn't have felt right.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Hard to assess
","As much as I think this is 2003's most enjoyable film, it is difficult to assess storywise because we have yet to wait for its second Volume. So I wouldn't call it 'best' of 2003. It has some pretty interesting music tied in to its images. The Crazy '88' battle (there were only 27 of the Ukoza guards) is supercharged, beautifully shot and is guaranteed to make you grit your teeth and watch closely. I love the silhouettes fighting against the blue background. As in all Tarantino, this film has nonlinear storytelling, and it is also difficult to praise or criticize him for constructing the script this way. There might be some plants in Vol. 1 taht would get payed off in Vol. 2 - who knows? But the last thing that Bill says in the end is guaranteed to keep fans of this one waiting anxiously for Vol. 2.

World Trade Center," I saw Jesus! And he had a bottle of water!
","WORLD TRADE CENTER is portrayed in typical Stone style... the rhythm of transition between scenes is bridged by elliptical 'black outs'. Performances are above par all through out. The opening scenes that quickly change from normalcy to the instant and unexpected pandemonium are handled very well also. Then it progresses into scenes of a more grueling nature, featuring tension, despair and unpleasant anticipation. The sound design is excellent, as many have hyped about this film. It closes with the life affirming message from Nicolas Cage's character - a refreshing motion picture due to an apolitical perspective because it focuses on the essentials of the 2 men's accounts and those of their families. It is a film told on a very personal and candid level, very well worth catching if you want to know the story of the 2 men who went to risk their lives; but in return were the ones in need of the salvation and risk from the men who found themselves having that task to accomplish for them.",9,1,4,18 October 2006
The Last Samurai," Definitely a carbon copy of DWW
","Yes it is! There are even references to the war with the American Indians! But that's what was Algren's internal conflict in the movie. The film is very watchable. There are some very funny scenes in it too:'The President of the United States' or 'He smells like the pigs' or Katsumoto presuming that it is only Japan's custom to introduce their names...The VO's in the beginning of the movie, IMHO had no motivation. Made by brave men? Sure they are brave men but they were just killing each other for their own cause! So what if they 'made' Japan? But they did personify 'that forgotten word' though. Honor. But again, I'm not entirely sure the VOs were all that necessary.The VO at the end? I guess it was too ON THE NOSE. Since we woulda figured how Algren finally found peace of mind. I didn't entirely care about the Samurai being exterminated either since the village wasn't entirely in harm's way. So I agree with whoever said this film doesn't have the heart that DWW was.

The Da Vinci Code," The Adaptation.
","First of all, kudos to the cast and crew of the Da Vinci Code adaptation. The movie is more abridged than I would have it but it is certainly more faithful than Tony Gilroy reconstructing the Jason Bourne story or Steven DeZousa ripping apart Roderick Thorpe's story of Joe Leland for the betterment of the movie we now know as 'Die Hard.' The opening scene and the last scene are exactly what the mind's eye would see if one would read the book. The last scene even performs beautiful photogrammetry or 'omnipresent' phantom camera-work to confirm the innuendos of Dan Brown's finale to the story. What is different? Among many, are the cryptex - I can tell you now if you've read that book that Sauniere in the movie obviously was more merciful than in the film, there was that shocking discovery regarding the cryptex in the airplane that was spared in the movie, the Hieros Jerjerous or whatever it was called was only flashed and not annotated by Langdon and instead of on the airplane, this flashback happens in the end. Let me also commend Howard for creating a beautiful atmosphere of the ages of old when Teabing or Langdon recount their interpretations of history. From the Council of Nicaea, to the execution of the Templars, and even later scene with 'scepter-like' super imposition when Langdon explains about 'A. Pope' and Sir Isaac Newton while crossing the street. And as one viewer has already noted, Akiva Goldsman was calculating enough to make Langdon and Teabing even debate a bit just so the unorthodox Gnostic ideas aren't necessarily fortified, and as Dan Brown stated in a forum - the audiences are free to believe which of the interpretations in these matters are correct. Langdon even emphasizes the words 'MAY have... MAY have...' at one point in opposition to Teabing's strict affirmation regarding the Grail legend. Langdon also cracks the final puzzle instead of it being accidentally unravelled as in the book, the one regarding the missing orb. The five letter word. Missing are a great many things from the book, such as Sister Sandrine per Ron Howard or Akiva Goldsman's hand failing to say the line, 'I do not see that one message in Opus Dei.' before Silas silences the nun. Omitted also is the sequence when the otherwise maniacal Aringarosa, in the book tells Silas that forgiveness is God's greatest gift, in the end when they discover about the treachery. The reveal of The Teacher is less shocking in the film than it is in the book although I love the tease of cinematic sequence when Remy speaks to the initially anonymous villain. But among those which are made concise by Ron Howard, I appreciate the 'instant library card' in the bus a very appreciated short-cut as to eliminate a rather taxing task that Langdon and Sophie had to do in the book.... I do NOT appreciate the fact that Sophie was not the one who deciphered the mystery language in the airplane, the engravings on metal, that Langdon thought was reminiscent of Semitic writing. It was a language, or system of writing that only Sophie knew about from her grandfather... And also, I didn't mind much about the absence of an extended recount of the Fibonnaci sequence, the androgyny theory of the Mona Lisa as these things I'm afraid are gonna require the observer to read Brown's novel. The discovery in the Rosslyn church is also altered much, but as I mentioned earlier it doesn't change the very very very last scene, but the revelations are similar nonetheless. Sophie, and no one else instantly spots the 'blade and the chalice fused into one' in the church building which is not the case in the book. Zimmer's score is above par and it accentuates the visuals and nuances that Howard and his crew have put to the screen. And for Christians whether candid or the more religious, I may have sensed an attempt of Akiva Goldsman to put in Dan Brown's conscious thoughts and even his comments on the fact that Da Vinci Code and it's maker isn't one that has the luxury of absolute correctness. Langdon expounds more on his spiritual side, and regarding his childhood mishap at the well, and this tops off his unbiased convictions and makes ground for those who might be otherwise offended by the movie's Gnostic concepts. That scene was a payoff for what was foreshadowed, a question asked by Sophie in response to a question about belief that Langdon brought up earlier in the bank vehicle. By the way, Vernet doesn't get any denouement in the end, in the book he is only referenced but Goldsman probably chose to make him one we merely pass-by. Jean Reno is as intense as he can be as the zealous Fache, and it will also be a loss to NOT see his final exchange with Aringarosa in the book..... he has no resolve with Collet either and the funny alibi Collet makes about the error of the DCPJ on TV in the novel is nowhere in the film. Nonetheless Howard and company create a piece that reflects the bestseller and can hardly be called a sacrilege in light of it's source and author. But because of some writing decisions of Akiva Goldsman that I have disagreed with, I will give this an 8 instead of a 10 out of 10. And P.S..... P.S. Mickey Mouse doesn't get an explanation or an annotation of his presence in an appliance that Langdon owns, obviously to jive with how Goldsman put lesser bias in Langdon's stand of the Grail legend, the book gave Langdon more conviction on the theories and consequently the book chronicled hidden references to the legend in Walt Disney.Grade B+",8,4,13,18 May 2006
The Untouchables," Classic DePalma. Impressive Mamet
","A brutal, energetic depiction of the Prohibition era of the 1930's. Solid performances all around. What's interesting is to see some very nice trailer moments. Take the train station for example: The scene was punctuated cinematically by the exquisite cinematography, De Palma's over the top direction and some dramatized action.  And let's not forget Ennio Morricone's thrilling score. But mind you the train station scene is one that integrates action with character; Stone's character. He's a pretty good shot. Remember where Malone and Ness recruited him.Love the way Mamet keeps things a question; who Malone gets information from... speaking of that, I also loved the ambush scene in the police headquarters, and the furious, emotional scene involving Ness and Capone later on. The ultimate payoff for me was to see Ness change his mind about sparing Capone's rind hand man in the end; see it to find out what I'm talking about.One of my top tenGrade A+",Null,1,2,30 May 2004
Mystic River," Are you gonna send 500 dollars to Celeste too?
","More than anything, the performances of all involved is what makes this movie extremely riveting. Added to that, Eastwood's meticulous and methodical directing, which was obviously the driving force behind the great performances. Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon give enough intensity to their portrayal. As does Tim Robbins who carries out a deranged persona of someone who came out from a terrible childhood ordeal with scathing after effects.Marcia Gay Harden is also surprising and brings a lot of fear and doubt from her character. Linney brings maturity to her role, and during the turning point that launches Act 2, she and Penn conjure up the appropriate magnitude of emotion required. Let's not forget Laurence Fishburne who brings us his zeal and typical imposing persona that all of us know him for having... And hey, you've got to love Emmy Rossum, at least during her few minutes of screen time. She's just charming, but Phantom of the Opera is the movie to see if you want more from the girl who plays the ill-fated heroine in Mystic River.Interestingly you will see a lot of depth to the character's past and the interpersonal connections that each have. Much more than being a whodunnit, there are other twists in the end, - you wouldn't know Jimmy Markum's secret until all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place. And before meeting his fate, Dave Boyle (Robbins) redeems himself and the flashbacks reveal the act of violence that he did, that once divulged to us, the movie audience - can only be enough denouement we could ask for, well to make up for his disgraceful and forced confession to his tormentor and captor in the last scene.What the observing spectator may note from the way Eastwood operates as a director, and perhaps his writers as well is the amount of time and minutae executed with respect to bringing out the best and the worst from his characters and their ruined lives. Elements of disgrace. Elements of redemption. You will see some of those things as well as the movie closes. I hope I didn't give much away in my essay here, I'll just leave you to judge for yourself whether Mystic River deserves the critical acclaim it has from many, or from the other end of the polarized group of audiences; the hate and destructive contempt coming from the people who don't appreciate this film. It is up to you. As for myself, I found myself watching the whole movie through, there are times that on DVD I pause a film and watch it in 2 sittings, but for this one? I sat all the way through merely because the performances, the good story and direction made the 2 hours and 11 minutes blast by very fast. But should you you take my word for it, go ahead and give Mystic River a try.",10,1,3,8 July 2006

","It starts out rather slow and methodically. But the plot rivets attention unto itself because of how we know WHO everyone is in the story... Great performances all around. I loved the scene when the 2 men joke about a dog-walking girl being the Commissioner of the police department.I think in storytelling, the irony of having the audience know more than the characters makes for BETTER suspense and anticipation. Yet THE DEPARTED still has it's unexpected U-Turns. I like the last and final shot.

Die Hard," DH1
","The first of its kind that created a genre of its own. The direction of John McTiernan packs a wallop. What's interesting to see is how McClane conquers his internal conflict in the bathroom, so he may defeat his external conflict and finally decides to get outta there to find out what the fck Hans was doing upstairs. And from the start it wasn't a rescue mission, he was having a conversation with his wife... something that started 6 months earlier, only to get cut off. Also interesting to see the antag from being passive to becoming reactive when McClane steals his detonators.Very interesting to see Powell's trauma being resolved --- he swore to never draw his revolver ever.Michael Kamen's upbeat and tense score is unforgettable, in my book. I especially like the track -- during the scene where Hans hands Ellis the walky-talky. Listen closely and see if you get reminded of 'Singing in the Rain' or Beethoven's 'Symphony no. 9' as the movie goes on.Some of the best lines ever... e.g. 'After all you speeches, you're nothing but a common thief'...

War of the Worlds," No, not like Europe.
","You get terrifying grand spectacle in the beginning and Spielberg's lens tries to pan away from the terror as if it's afraid of the tripods. But there are beautiful establishing shots such as that when the first tripod appears or the one that was coming from the woods when in the scene when they are on the barge. Beautiful shot of the Digital 8 camera LCD seeing the terror by the way. Some breathtaking cliffhangers, courtesy of Koepp who has always been a master of cliffhanger sequences - the one in the basement is handled well by Spielberg although we've seen something like it in the kitchen in Jurassic Park. We get a chance to be very intimate with the antagonistic appendage, - our characters are obstructed just by a mirror. And we also get some tension and conflict with some of the characters, Robbie and Ray. I thought the scene of what Dakota Fanning finds when she was supposed to relieve herself was wicked, and beautifully shot. By the way, Fanning almost steals the show, at a young age she can deliver an above par performance of a terrified little girl. See the look on her face when she's captured in the basket somewhat disoriented and it takes Cruise some time to snap her out of it, almost as if she's prone to autism. It would seem the only way the arcs were made possible is because of the tragic events that have been taking place in the movie. I wanted more, it almost seemed that the action that have defined the characters reconciling with each other was a big, noisy contrivance. Nonetheless, it has more of it's moments like Tim Robbins and Cruise looking at the carnage being caused by the tripods from the basement and it's definitely got a lot of tension. I felt awkward with the TELL DON'T SHOW ending even if what narrator Morgan Freeman tells us can be slightly touching - 'Human beings don't live and die in vain'. But don't mind my rants here, don't even take my word for it regarding my praises. Just go see this. And I won't look! Just stay where I can see you! Nope.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I am the Senate...................*spoilers*
","If only Lucas didn't cut the scenes where the theme of 'compassion' leading to eternal consciousness, Yoda telling Luke that the dark side isn't stronger in Empire would have had a whole lot more meaning. Dark all through out save for some comic relief such as Yoda almost being hit by laser fire as he watches the ground battle from above in Kashyyk, Artoo torching the battle droids and what Yoda does to the Red Guards before he confronts Sidious.It is ambiguous as to whether Mace Windu genuinely gained the upper-hand in his encounter with the Chancellor Sith Lord or was Palpatine putting in a show of farce when he loses his red blade on the ledge, we also get to see that the Sith also must have had experience in theater (he is fond of operas, right?) and the actor's guild as he plays possum at a certain point.Duel of the Fates is perfectly married to A Hero Falls in the two epic duels of the film, (love the way Yoda and the Emperor are elevated onto the Senate rotunda, right after Yoda, force hurls Palpatine onto his throne, everyone laughed here). I liked the music of despair when Anakin meditates in the Council chamber during the sunset while Padme shares the same feelings of apprehension. 'Qui-Gon's' funeral music is revived when Vader is transformed into the half-man half-machine monster in black. Beautiful POV shot of the mask coming down and good work of sound design when we hear the first 'robotic breath' of the mutilated Sith Lord. A NEW HOPE music is beautifully put in the scenes of Alderaan with Bail Organa and his wife, the last scene and even at the end credits. Perfectly bridging the gap, if only musically.Portman, I don't know how to get into discussing this seemed to leave somewhat a little bit more to be desired in her performance. McDiarmid almost steals the show as the movie's treacherous antagonist, his ominous whispers are frighteningly spooky, e.g. when he tells Vader that they will discover the secret of cheating death if they work together.Speaking of which, Lucas has cut a lot that should have been left in at the end, such as Yoda speaking to Qui-Gon Jinn and that 'eternal consciousness' just being able to speak from beyond the grave making one more powerful than any Sith would have been a great pay-off unless Lucas doesn't believe in what is generally agreed to be 'good' and 'evil'. Well, the Sith Chancellor mentions, 'Evil is a point of view.' The best Star Wars film since Episode 5. Although from an editorial standpoint, Lucas at times fails in terms of what he has decided to chop off with his NLE... and possibly with some he has left in.A-",10,1,4,18 May 2005
The Terminal," Victor the goat
","Has a lot of its moments. I especially liked the Gate 67 Dinner scene where Gupta displays his dexterous skills as a table performer; and there's even one comical part where he fumbles but nonchalantly leaves Amelia and Viktor.There's the intense scene where Viktor is requested to be an interpreter for a fellow Krakhozian; it follows with an odd sequence where the photocopies of Viktor's hand are then placed in every one of the establishments of the terminal and is venerated by those working there.Was interested to see Gupta's arc, he went from being overly paranoid about Viktor, to Viktor's friend; and twas a very touching scene when Officer Torres gives an answer to Enrique- the mystery man.At times, you'll try to anticipate what could happen in a scene that follows ('cause and effect'), but those are the times when you will be disappointed because most of the time the story takes unexpected and sometimes hilarious turns. Was very touched by one of the final scenes, when Viktor is blocked as he attempts to take a step on American soil; everyone in the airport was his follower... and I was especially touched by what Ray Thurman did when he told Viktor 'Do you see what is behind those doors? Turn around'.I hope this won't tip anything off but the final scenes in the club, and in the taxi were had beautiful composition. Always a bravo for Januzs Kaminsky... Some may complain that there are those moments that feel kinda mawky, but I reckon those scenes were added to put layer and backstory to our hero and in that, I guess the writers have succeeded.; no I'm not necessarily talking about the love story between Viktor and Amelia.Catch Me If You Can. 2002... and now, 2004, yet another laid back Spielberg: THE TERMINALGrade A- or 8/10",Null,0,1,24 September 2004

","Some might dismiss this as weak storytelling and pretensious moviemaking. But no, the by the book textbook horror techniques employed by John Carpenter in HALLOWEEN are worth being studied for the aspiring moviemaker who would like to study the essence of what suspense really is and what defines SCARY and what distinquishes SCARY from just merely being GRISLY. This is a number of cliches packed into one brilliantly directed 90 minute horror film and its only originality comes in the simplicity of the story. There are some scenes that are predictable, but it was meant to be that way. We dont want PJ Soles to go back into the car. We wanna scream at Laurie for going to the house across the street. Horror is also about misdirection as Carpenter says in his commentary. Letting us know where he think he's gonna go but surprising us really effectively.

The Silence of the Lambs," During the silence.
","I think Ted Tally is amazing. And this, in my book still stands out as the best in the Hannibal Lecter trilogy. I like the way he delays exposition e.g. Jodie's father..... Clarice telling Dr. Lecter everything about her running away. Its almost interesting to think of Lecter as Clarice's shrink.
The violence is more psychological and suggestive. Its spookier that way, although there are occasional glimpses of the big cheese, they're kept subliminal. Such as the scene where Anthony Heald shows Clarice the photograph of what Lecter did to one of the nurses, oh Tak Fujimoto is a sucker for red light, Demme can say... And I like the foreshadowing for a later, pivotal scene when Chilton warns Starling not to pass Lecter anything other than paper. The payoff? I won't spoil it for you... you may see it coming, but its a very gripping, earth shattering scene near the end. Just see it. 10/10 Grade A+",Null,0,0,29 May 2004
Casino Royale," Bond... James Bond.
","I've seen the 2006 rendition of CASINO ROYALE, surprisingly since this is probably a reboot a la Batman Begins, Judi Dench from the Brosnan films reprises her role as M. She and Bond exchange the funniest of lines. Goldeneye director Martin Campbell returns in this restart of the franchise using vintage techniques of movie-making, and cinematography. The b and w noir opening was one of the best Bond openers ever. An aggressive, abridged exposition and intro into his promotion as a Double Oh.Eva Green is sexy, smart and sly as the financer in Bond's operation. Things in their relationship take a turn for predictability towards the final act, but the film is still fun and you'll be treated to the original score was it by John Barry? - in the end credits.Save for some uncomfortable tight shots during hand to hand combat scenes, Martin Campbell is definitely one of those directors who understand biomechanics of camera movement and framing. You'll see plenty of exquisite shots in the film.Definitely an improvement over Brosnan's overly bombastic 007 films. Let's hope ROYALE's successors will be just as subdued and slick.",10,2,5,15 November 2006
Signs," Swing away.
","What I like about M. Night is how he never compromises his direction and the artistic rendition of the stories he wants to tell. This movie has some flaws and a glaring plot-hole. Why couldn't the aliens at least bring body armor when they knew that much of the earth is covered with water?The first time I saw this, I was really catatonic as Night is an expert in making his motion pictures solicit for the appropriate viewer's response and reaction. He is an expert in anticipation of action. Hitchcock said 'The terror lies not in the bang; rather in the anticipation of it'.For example, watch the scene where Merril Hess has to check out the house if everything is clear; and then he disappears for a moment. Or the scene in the cornfield where Mel is in the center of a huge crop circle, and the camera has Gibson's POV... anything can jump outta nowhere any second.Second time you watch it, the film loses scare factor but it is still beautiful as Manoj Nelliyatu is always very good in framing his sequences. Watch the beautiful mobile framing when Morgan Hess is holding the baby monitor upward towards the sky. Or the medium close-up of Gibson's face centered in-frame in the final scene inside the living room right before the concluding flashback.This film can NOT be appreciated by people who have intellectual arrogance and those who claim to have 'cultured' taste in cinema. But it is very entertaining, the pacing is good. And it's beautiful.The good thing about a movie with a screenplay that's NOT as taut as... The Sixth Sense or Back to the Future is that the helmer's DIRECTION stands out and you really see M. Night display his skill as a director.Great string music by James Newton Howard and I suppose a round of applause should be given to DP Tak Fujimoto (Silence of the Lambs) as well. By the way, the knife that lops the creature's hand is CG, but you didn't know, did you? I hear Night would have wanted no CG in this film, but ILM did a good job too... and that final scene in the living room? It just gets you supercharged.The LAST scene outside is where Newton's enthralling score starts to flex it's muscle and melody but it still remains as the three-note motif you hear throughout the movie. The opening credits, done to Howard's score foreshadows the kind of experience/ or the emotions/ moods/ suspense that you will see in the film.Signs.10/10although no one will agree.",Null,0,2,9 November 2004

For instance, what was Nightcrawler's motivation for attacking the president? Loved the oepning scene, by the way.The movie is beautifully shot. Magneto's escape. Wolverine vs. Deathstrike and I particularly love Mystique's agility when she takes out those military men in a heartbeat.Anna Paquin is very attractive as Rogue, she is one woman who I can say does not have fabricated beauty.

Rear Window," Female intuition
","Very thrilling. Very riveting. Disturbing in a psychological manner. Truly, it is what you don't see that scares you - this adage is personified in this movie. I loved Lisa's character arc, as she tries to draw Jeff's attention away from spying on Thorwald. She was in denial, trying to prove Jeff wrong all the time. But a moment before that scene fades out, she's very well hooked into what might have happened across as well.And hey, we even see her and Stella - Jeff's aid audaciously dig in the apartment's garden across. And Lisa - the cynical girlfriend who couldn't care less even ascends through the fire escape. And watch this very thrilling scene as Jeffrey's could only scream his girlfriend's name and watch in horror. Hitchcock said to always make the audience suffer as much as possible - we do suffer as a helpless and disabled audience as well in these scenes I am talking about.If PSYCHO was creepy enough - you'll get some of those eery moments in here too, but more psychologically than visually or graphically portrayed as they talk about the clues to Mrs. Thorwald. You don't see any of these of course - but what your mind imagines or visualizes is far more terrifying than anything you'll see in this film.Plus a breathtaking climax.

Speaking of soldiers and posts, I also thought it was pretty funny when Gandalf got a little physical with the false king after he could do nothing but mutter and tell his men to fall back.

","Heavy Spielberg. After taking a walk in the park with Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal and pumping up some energy with War of the Worlds, Spielberg again conjures up heavy material in this movie about conscience, revenge (hence the title of the book it was adopted from) and the human condition in relation to it. Spielberg may have taken liberties in some areas, as a filmmaker he has done that in Catch Me if You Can or anyone for that matter is entitled to artistic liscence, but he captures the reality of the TRAUMA involved in each of the main players. Bana does a terrific job as do those who play his team, and also his wife. One thing I'd also like to point out is that Spielberg and DP Kaminski always always manage to photograph movies BEAUTIFULLY with an aesthetic that's both atmospheric and at times chaos-inducing such as some freestyle albeit carefully calculated hand-held and choreographed sequences. Safe to say that beyond a doubt Spielberg is a master in of biomechanics with respect to blocking and cinematography. You will also see him fabricate the most appropriate visual sensations during some of the most tense sequences such as the under the bed bombing sequence, you will momentarily see human appendage left over and rotating from a ceiling fan amidst Bana going through demolition seeing to it that his sexually active neighbors are safe after the mishap. And there are moments of cliffhanger and tension such as the telephone-bomb sequence. I need not say more, but that is one moment in the cinema when I actually said 'No!!!', proving that this movie does manage to unnerve when it gets its moments albeit it is a drama by essence. MUNICH does not shy away from violence, but it is a movie that is sort of anti-violence, once again it echoes an innate ability to show compassion and remorse. This is also one aspect where Spielberg's talent and maturity shine as he always depicts his pieces in context of the human condition his movie preceding MUNICH may have been scorned for being a bombast marred by mediocre storytelling yet in that movie I will say it has excelled in portraying the human condition. John Williams, as he has done many times with Mr. Spielberg before showcases versatility and a different type of music, has avery Middle-eastern feel yet deviously and subliminally propulsive that has repetitive motifs of fear, anxiety. And the screen writing? As with most of the best in the art of adaptation of true to life events, the use of temporal displacement is deployed. You'll know what I mean when you see the delay of exposition and progression during the Olympic Massacre. It is flashed back all throughout instead of being depicted all at once. (Would have marred the pacing and flow that way), so I commend the screenwriters as well. While many will be irritated by this expected Spielberg routine: YES the movie ends somewhat low key it has moments of suspense but it is more histrionic and probably this isn't to everyone's taste. In the POV department, who are we supposed to be rooting for? It's instinctive to say Mr. Bana, yes that is a fact but ultimately we are supposed to be examining conscience and our own morales. The movie has also a lot of subliminal portrayals of these issues in society and in our lives, from a lady discussing Karl Marx's theories on right and wrong with respect to situational ethics and philosophy, to temptation of adultery and SEXpionage rolled into one. And the remorse and maybe even confusion that Mr. Bana's character feels, you will feel too in the end. It's NOT a feel-good movie but it's GREAT. What is also visible is Avner's character arc, we see him being dismissive about assassination many times repetitively, even telling Carl his team mate to NOT think about it. And also in the dinner table when discussions escalate on the replacement of the slain leaders. His 180 turn around takes place towards the end, and it is depicted by Spielberg carefully with a lot of gusto and emotion. From the juxtapousition of a love scene to a graphic and ultra histrionic recollection of the actual murders of the athletes. It ends with Geoffrey Rush (also someone to be commended in his performance here) telling Avner that what it was really all about was COMING HOME or the essence of home; but closely regarding Avner's final experiences in the dreaded field op, was it really about that? That is the recurring theme of the movie, would you still consider or would you reconsider right and wrong? Why do I cut my nails? They grow back. Grade A-",9,2,3,17 February 2006

(Would have marred the pacing and flow that way), so I commend the screenwriters as well. While many will be irritated by this expected Spielberg routine: YES the movie ends somewhat low key it has moments of suspense but it is more histrionic and probably this isn't to everyone's taste. In the POV department, who are we supposed to be rooting for? It's instinctive to say Mr. Bana, yes that is a fact but ultimately we are supposed to be examining conscience and our own morales. The movie has also a lot of subliminal portrayals of these issues in society and in our lives, from a lady discussing Karl Marx's theories on right and wrong with respect to situational ethics and philosophy, to temptation of adultery and SEXpionage rolled into one. And the remorse and maybe even confusion that Mr. Bana's character feels, you will feel too in the end. It's NOT a feel-good movie but it's GREAT. Grade A-",9,0,0,16 February 2006
Heat," Bravo Michael Mann
","I really loved the emotional payoff to what was setup in an early scene ... where Vincent and Neil meet face to face - 'The Discipline'; and when we get to the scene outside the hotel - with Neil and Eady, it does get pretty rousing. The only other Michael Mann film I've seen is COLLATERAL. Just like that 2004 movie, this film has excellent location cinematography of night time in the city and the sound of gunfire just ROCKS you. A round of applause to Mann's sound guys. You'll also find the tense moments of Hanna and his wife goading, as will you find emotive the scene when Ashley Judd signals to Val Kilmer that she is NOT alone, at one point sequentially; we see the heartwarmed look on Judd's face. She doesn't want to give up Chris no matter how much salestalk about Dominick's future the African American officer tried to persuade her with. Wonderful to see Hanna and his wife reconciled in their last scene together in the movie, its not a lose end left untied, but its something that's given closure up until the moment Vincent takes off to hunt down Neil.A lot of rough action scenes to make your viewing of this 2.5 hour movie worthwhile and exciting. Now, I'm gonna try to find a copy of MANHUNTER and THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS. Michael is the Mann. Grade A- 10/10",Null,1,2,3 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Shoot 'em up
","This is easily one of the most entertaining movies in the history of cinema. Too bad the OT isn't released in original DVD yet. But GL?? that didn't stop me from buying a ripped dvd version of your classic!Anyway, its basically the same plot as Kurosawa's Hidden Fortress. An wise and powerfulold man, with the company of a farm boy who just joined his company must take classified data to a rebel base before they are attacked and blasted into oblivion by the galaxy's most deadly space station.I don't know whether to believe if Lucas already knew the ENTIRE plot for the trilogy when writing A NEW HOPE, but I like the foreshadowing when Owen says 'That's what I'm afraid of' as a response to what Beru told her. And I also like how Obi-Wan tells Luke the truth about his father from 'certain points of view.'Very entertaining. Don't let the influence of modern cinema and SFX bias you against the cheese factor in this one.10/10!",Null,0,0,3 February 2004
Jackie Brown," Unrushed.
","What's very interesting was to see how Tarantino never rushes things. First he shows you how Jackie is very defensive; then there's a quiet table scene in Jackie's house where she voices out her fears and insecurities to Robert Forster. The scene with Beaumont Livingstone was staggeringly funny and amusing and it is used as a payoff and a reference point throughout the movie; and even in one of the final scenes ---- 'she just gotta remember what happened to Beaumont'.Very interesting to see the relationship of Fonda and DeNiro develop; Fonda gets a little cynical and hostile towards DeNiro --- and in the parking lot scene, very good exposition or insight as to a possiblity of why DeNiro and Ordell got jailed. And its hilarious at that...All the characters are very well fleshed out. I can't imagine anyone not liking this film just for the fact that its more talky than any  of Quentin Tarantino's other movies...Finally, I liked Ordell's reaction of denial once he learns what DeNiro did to Fonda in the parking lot... and once he DOES IT to DeNiro; we find out how Ordell REALLY felt about what DeNiro did to Fonda in the parking lot.Once again; excellent characterization and portrayal of the 3-dimensionality of the players.Grade A-10/10",Null,0,1,28 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Why it is the best
","It is the most well directed, most well-acted on and has the best story dynamics. At least better than any of the other SW films.The full version of Yoda's Theme played at the end is just magnificent. But this movie is marred by continuity as Ian McDiarmid, for some reason was not called back to reprise his role in the SE overhaul of the trilogy. Still, 10/10; not a standalone movie though.",Null,0,1,3 February 2004
Back to the Future," Perfect.
","This is one of the most of the most perfectly constructed movies ever. Mostly, I'm speaking of the script. As entertaining as this movie is, you can't go wrong by studying how the writer PLANTS and how he puts in PAYOFFS near the end. many of which can be hilarious. Pay attention to 'Pepsi Free' or how Lorayne doesn't want her daughter to 'chase boys'. Also I love the skateboarding scene done to 'POWER OF LOVE' by Huey Lewis. And watch how Marty knows how to grip the backs of vehicles and ride with them while his legs are still on his skateboard. Also very clever and appropriate foreshadowing. 10 out of 10.",Null,0,1,19 January 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," Unsupreme Greengrass
","Sorry, couldn't find the BOURNE2 thread, so please bear with me, hope this won't get locked. And if anyone has perhaps some final words on this movie; which I was kinda behind seeing.... please do say something. :)Very goodly enough written by Tony Gilroy. Actually was impressed of how Tony managed to continue on from the Treadstone storyline; and to develop Conklin's character and even Bryan Cox's character. I saw a 360 arc for Cox's character, I saw I guess a 180 one for Landy. One of my favorite scenes was when Bourne disarms the two guards who detained him. Really fast. As that is how action would happen in real life.Gilroy leaves no lose ends? Or does he? Did he leave one untied knot to be tied up in ULTIMATUM: THE MOVIE? Well, Bourne apologized. He had a final exchange with Landy. So how can any nitpicker possibly feel cheated there?Gilroy makes more extensive the use of scenes via flashbacks where Bourne picks up bits and pieces of his memory. Would seem that he set-up this way of telling the future Bourne movies in Identity as flashbacks have been used, but not as blatantly as it is in Supremacy. The cast are all top notch. Hilarious how Gilroy drops a payoff of what a sly sniping assassin Bourne really is in the end 'You look tired, Pam. Have a rest!'Loved how they re-used 'Extreme Ways' as the film's closing track. Hope they use it too in ULTIMATUM. Despite the good cast and the tautly enough written screenplay, I thought Greengrass isn't really a good director. Or is the DP to blame? He couldn't put the camera in proper places that most of the time the action scenes were a waste! We couldn't understand. We couldn't really feel sucked in by the world of the story, and that's not a good thing. Bring back Liman; as he only cheats in the one-on-one action scenes, but when he does, we do understand the scenes, he cheats. But we couldn't tell. The 'cheating' that Greengrass uses didn't amount to great effect. As was the first one, has those generic action, but not overblown, which is good. 7/10 Grade C+",Null,0,1,23 September 2004
V for Vendetta," A writer uses lies to tell the truth. Politicians use them to bury it.
","'A writer uses lies to tell the truth while a politician uses them to cover it up.' 'A man after my own heart', then replies Codename V after Natalie Portman tells her of a principle that her father once revealed...My friend told me that Mr. Weaving was a replacement for a previous actor who did not find it good for his ability as the leading man to hide his face all through-out, well maybe Weaving even replaced someone who refused to take second-billing! But this movie was a surprise. Portman does very well, as she always does except for George Lucas's moves (I love the prequels but that man is NOT an actor's director), Portman plays a British character who has witnessed violence as a child and develops a rapport with Codename V.The movie explores a lot of socio, econo, and geopolitical themes all done in comic-book flavor as what is expected from a movie scribed by the Wachowskis. Even first time helmer McTeigue hints at using the brother's style in slo-mo violence, which surprisingly works well in here as it is something NOT to my taste all the time. I hated slo-mo in John Woo's movies and in The 3rd Matrix film, I thought it became just too overwrought styling. The movie opens with action scenes that expose the grace and adeptness of Codename V as a vigilante? Or antihero? Whatever. And there is a surprise in the middle that draws denouement to the subplot of Evey (Portman) being captured, and tortured and being basically left for dead.John Hurt does an excellent job as the movie's antagonist, he displays an imposing persona, arrogant and full of conviction - whom we would then witness seeing a reversal in character in the end by the way. The film flash backs the character's past, from the trauma Evey has witnessed from childhood, to the incident that made Codename V who he was, thus revealing the driving force of the movie's title character. In one of the scenes preceding a flashback, we see the slyness of his methods of assassination when he speaks to a coroner who has bore witness to V's wrathful rebirth. The movie has a recurring theme of fate versus coincidence and pays off what is foreshadowed in the beginning. Listen to V's speech as he invades television and see the symbolic chain reaction of collapsing dominoes, a visual metaphor that precedes the film's climax. There is denouement between V and Evey, where Evey even takes on totally the ideals that Codename V has upheld. A symbol is nothing without the people.This is a very good piece of cinema, worth watching if you have the time and does have gravitas in it. The 3rd film of the Wachowski's trilogy may NOT have clicked because it was an attempt at making something intellectual in a genre for dumbs. VENDETTA is of that same genre, and like Revolutions, efforts of the scribes pay off and they do well in the fact that this movie even surpasses anything good or redeeming that 3rd film of the Matrix trilogy had. Vendetta is a better and more exciting watch. And very impressive for first time captain of the boat, James McTeigue who has worked alongside the brothers in their movies as a second-unit man.Grade B+",9,5,11,15 March 2006
