Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Perfect sequel
","I wrote in my review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 that perhaps in the second film there would be an explanation as to how the Black Mamba became so skilled and what really was the root of her deep hatred and anger towards Bill. Well, in the first we can easily deduce that because Bill and his crew shot up the wedding and left Beatrix in a coma that she was more than entitled to her revenge. I found it profound how much we learned about Budd and how unworthy he is to be part of the DVAS. Honestly, I wonder how the hell he earned his place. What was his specialty other than being a greedy smart alec? I digress. Kill Bill Vol. 2 wraps everything up near-perfectly. The Bride already has a couple names checked off on her list as we come into the second film. Budd, Elle, and Bill are all that remain and let's just say Copperhead and Cottonmouth were like the warm-up laps before the race, the real competition. Each of the remaining DVAS members have unique challenges to offer Beatrix. I don't know how to put into words how perfect this film is. From beginning to end you're wondering what's going to happen next. And everything that does happen is so well thought out and fits the characters so perfectly that it adds so much more depth and appreciation for the movie. The ending may or not be what you're expecting. I'll just say it was both for me. It was a beautiful ending. These two films taught me a lot about honor. Obviously it's all fiction, but just like in Kill Bill Vol. 1 when Copperhead and Black Mamba are fighting in the house and the school bus pulls up, Black Mamba chooses not to fight in front of the little girl. She knew her beef was between the girls mother and that the little girl wasn't aware of how deadly and evil Copperhead truly was. That is just a very mild example of how, despite the overwhelming hatred Black Mamba harbors towards the rest of the squad, she still has the ability to be better than a mindless killing machine. Her enemies are highly-trained fighters. Each confrontation is like the beginning of a symphony and all you can do is sit back and let the melody of the swords carry you to the final heartbeat of either Beatrix or her foe. I look forward to a possible third installment!",9,5,9,21 September 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's Masterpiece
","Quentin himself considers this film to be his masterpiece, his Magnum Opus. Being written over several years' time, Tarantino manages to create an alternate Universe in which history takes a dramatic opposite turn from the reality we know. Christoph Waltz's character, Hans Landa, is a creepy dude but he's also a genius. All throughout the movie, whenever he came on screen, I found myself tensing up worried what he was about to do next because just when you thought you knew what was going on, he was right there to smash your reality. The Basterd's were a fantastic bunch with vibrant personalities that made them so easy to fall in love with. Some may be disgusted with themselves once they find themselves falling in love with these brutish killers. Others, like me, will feel a sense of validation by these brave men who are performing a special duty that takes a great amount of courage. This truly is Quentin Tarantino's best film to date. Pulp Fiction will forever remain as his trademark, but Inglourious Basterds is what made him a legend.",10,2,7,21 September 2013
Shutter Island," Mind-bending thriller!
","Just wow. This movie was so great I had to watch it a second time. Then a few days later a third. And every now and then I would watch it just for fun. I even went out to get the book, read it, and was able to play pictures in my head from the film at certain parts of the book. The film didn't leave much out. Leonardo played his character, Teddy, so well that it was almost heart- breaking. Personally, it made me pretty emotional to witness everything his character goes through. Shutter Island is a tragic, dark, violent story that takes you down the rabbit hole to a deep layer of madness. The score for this movie was also brilliant. This Bitter Earth was my favorite and I encourage you to look it up. Especially the one with Dinah Washington; heartbreaking.",9,1,3,21 September 2013
American Psycho," White collar spotted with blood
","Christian Bale... Ahhh, what an actor! And BOY does he sell his psychopathic persona in this film. It was downright chilling how cold he became and how much he despised the people around him. Something I never understood about this film, though, was figuring out exactly what started or when his homicidal thoughts began. What was the medication he was on?I'm sure I could find answers to my questions from a quick Google search. Despite whatever reservations I had for this film, it's so brilliant in so many other ways. It's comical how Patrick Bateman turns from big time CEO of his father's company to a strung-out psychopathic killer with no hope of being helped. The film also did an excellent job portraying the ridiculously superficial America of the time (and still mostly to this day). I highly recommend this film for everyone, man and child. Okay, maybe not children because there are quite a few murder scenes as well as sex scenes.Overall, this movie proved to be a great piece of cinema and I hope it's forever loved and appreciated by generations to come.",10,0,0,22 September 2013
No Country for Old Men," A chilling, memorable piece of cinema
","Javier Bardem is wonderfully creepy as Anton Chigurh; the most sinister villain to hit the screen. Tommy Lee Jones portrays a somewhat old-timer cop who, despite his best efforts, discovers he no longer belongs in a time where criminals like Anton Chigurh roam free. Anton is so evil, Tommy Lee Jones has a hard time dealing with it head on. What he first thought to be a normal criminal investigation turned into a frightening, violent game of cat and mouse between Anton Chigurh and Llewelyn Davis. Josh Brolin who played Llewelyn, finds a large quantity of money in the desert while he's out hunting. Unfortunately for him, that pile of cash belonged to a very high profile individual who practically summons the most badass hit-man, Anton Chigurh, to recover the lost goods. This is an almost certain death wish for anyway in the crosshairs of Antoine.",8,2,2,22 November 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A unique piece of art
","The Grand Budapest Hotel is part of a dreamy landscape. You will meet the most interesting characters clad in the most striking outfits with personalities to match. Every shot is like a photograph, visually moving and full of depth. There are several parts of this film that appear to be shot like a play; clever titles and transition credits cause for the viewer to prepare themselves for the next act.Every single character has an interesting role and or story. From the lobby boy to the several socialites who frequent the hotel, they all tell compelling stories. The cinematography combined with the superb acting are really what made this film the great piece of art that it is. Every shot describes the scene without using words. Camera movement follows various actors making the experience so much more magical.",10,0,9,2 April 2014
Django Unchained," Must See
","I don't even know how to review this title. First of all, I absolutely loved this film. The casting was perfect. Christoph Schultz delivers another earth-shattering performance as well as his co-star Jamie Foxx. Of course, DiCaprio delivered a solid performance so realistic that, at times, it seemed all to real and could be frightening (in a good way) to some viewers. Apparently there was controversy over Tarantino's decision to have the 'N' word spoken so many times throughout the film. This baffles me as I wonder what one would expect to hear during times of slavery and severe inequality. What, you want to hide the fact that it ever happened? Are you embarrassed that this is the tragic reality of our country? Whatever the case may be, the use of the 'N' word in this movie should not be a debated so much as it takes away from the more important messages of the film. Then again, Tarantino has stated that he was glad there was so much controversy over it since it caused a national dialogue about slavery different than any before. I loved the fact that there were a few sub-plots withing the main plot. Each character was important. There was no room for tedious objects to be added nor was there any reason to given the substance of Django Unchained. The movie, like all of Tarantino's movies, is pretty dang violent. It's probably just shy of being his most violent film as I believe Inglourious Bastards to be number one. The emotion in Django Unchained is so strong it's almost palpable. I found my muscles tensing up several times. By the end of the movie I extremely moved and touched by Quentin's genius. This is truly a must-see film of the 21st century.",10,1,5,21 September 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Another Favorite from Tarantino
","This was the film that got me on the trail that I've been on for a few years now. And that's understanding how Tarantino comes up with such clever dialogue and crafting villains that we both despise and cheer for. I found myself sympathizing with O-Ren. Her story was a sad one. Even more tragic that she was dragged into the whole fiasco with the Bride. If it wasn't for that O-Ren Ishii would still be ruling over the Crazy 88's. Then again, that would totally change the story and interrupt the purpose of the film. Considering there are two Kill Bill films, I felt this one set the stage perfectly for the second. In this film, we really get to know The Bride and discover the atrocities committed against her. As an audience, we discover why she is on such a blood-thirsty rampage. You will find yourself at the edge of your seat cheering for the woman in the bright yellow track suit. Her exceptional skills with the blade are left unexplained--which should make you more curious. Do they reveal that in the second? What is her past with Bill? Back to Kill Bill Vol. 1... Watch as the warrior within grows and the attitude goes cold towards killing. The Bride is out for blood. And she'll be damned if anyone gets in the way of her revenge.",8,1,3,21 September 2013
Prometheus," Gave me chills
","I'm sensitive to films that feature humans in a highly technologically advanced world. It makes me pretty emotional since I want nothing more than our species to travel into space and possess technology capable of further adding to the well-being of humanity. Having said this, Prometheus spoke to me personally. It reminded me of the very possible reality of deep space exploration and discovering technology more advanced than our own. I loved this movie. All the characters had their own unique quirks that made you appreciate them all the more. The only thing that disappointed me was the lack of information regarding the engineers. I wanted so bad for there to be more in that regard but I was left slightly disappointed. Nonetheless, what the film did deliver was a thrilling science fiction film bringing complex questions of our origins as a species and the potential power an engineer of species may have over all others. These Engineers are practically Gods. They are capable of creating the most complex of organisms and release them on planets and just watch from thousands, millions of light years away. I see that Prometheus 2 is listed on IMDb and I have faith it will come to fruition.",10,2,8,22 September 2013
Paths of Glory," Emotional, timeless, beautiful
","What can I say? The film was beautiful both in picture quality and story. I'm not a huge war movie fan, but I loved this. I might also add that I've seen very few war films, maybe 10 or so, and Paths of Glory became an instant classic. I found myself losing focus ever so slightly in the beginning as it took just a little bit to gain momentum. But that's perfectly fine as it's Kubrick's style to take his time. It's worth it. Once you reach a certain point of the story you're holding on with all your strength, swimming in the trenches with the soldiers. The deeper meanings carried throughout the film such as hypocrisy, the weaknesses of bureaucracy, and the travesty's of war are clearly depicted. After doing some further reading, I learned there is some truth to specific events that take place in the film. I'm sparing the spoilers so I don't have to tag this review as such. If you're a war film buff, I think you'll love this movie. From the mouth of Martin Scorsese, 'My friends and I were war movie buffs. We had seen nothing quite like Paths of Glory.' Personally, I was so intrigued by this movie that I will make it my duty to watch more war films. I never realized how powerful they could be. The cast is also fantastic. Each actor portraying their character with extreme accuracy, not allowing the viewer to question its authenticity for a second.",8,0,1,27 October 2013
Sin City," Gripping, surreal, fantastic
","Where to begin... Well, I LOVED this movie. It was one of those films I played night after night to fall asleep to. The use of black, white, and red was so brilliant. I found myself sympathizing with several characters. It especially broke my heart to see my darling Brittany Murphy perform so perfectly knowing she's gone. R.I.P. princess. Basin City is a stinking, rotting, malevolent cesspool of filth and darkness. There are three story lines each containing a generous amount of violence, wit, and raw human emotion. Then again, the characters of Basin City seem almost emotionally exhausted. Perhaps what I mean to say is the portrayal of humans who have hit rock bottom is spot on in this film. Each main character has a very dark past and their current mission is one of pure revenge while some may view it as retribution. Personally, I was fully engaged in this movie from start to finish. I can almost guarantee you wont fully comprehend every aspect of this film from one viewing. This is one of those flicks that you'll find yourself going back to more than twice.",9,0,1,21 September 2013
The Great Gatsby," Just as I expected
","The trailer had me hyped up for this movie more than you can imagine. I had no idea what the story of Gatsby was, nor had I read any of Fitzgerald's work save for a few pages from one of his books that I can't even remember. Visually, this film is stunning in every way. The bright colors of the city, the fireworks, and the sounds made it feel like you were there right next to Gatsby. The love story between Daisy and Gatsby was a bit odd for my taste. Maybe odd isn't the right word but rather confusing. The characters were well developed and genuine and each had their own unique contributions to an overall exhilarating film. The creators of the film adaptation chose to use a selection of modern music which, in my opinion, fits perfectly for the newer generation. However, for those who are heavily invested in the book you may not appreciate the choice of music included in the film. I mean, it's the 1950s and they're blaring Jay-Z in one of the clubs. Overall, I felt the movie was fantastic. Gatsby is such a wild, mysterious character. Tobey Maguire portrayed Nick Carraway as a sheepish young man. And again, I haven't read the book so I don't know how accurate the film is to the actual story. But if you're like me and enjoy movies, this is one that you're likely going to enjoy from beginning to end.",9,2,4,21 September 2013
