It," A weak film adapted from a weak novel.
","I urge viewers to re-examine this picture- the narrative is nothing more than vignettes stacked awkwardly on top of each other. It comes across more like scenes from a bad sketch comedy show, lazily slapped together at the last minute. Furthermore, there's no mystery or anxiety regarding the exposure of the villain; he's hopping around, yodeling like an ostrich from the beginning. This is a horror film for people who know nothing about storytelling.",1,1,3,30 October 2019
The Conjuring," A masterpiece of contemporary horror.
","'The Conjuring' is perfectly seamless, it hits every mark.",10,0,1,30 October 2019
