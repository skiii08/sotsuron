Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Masterpiece.
","Having read some of the comments on here I can honestly say that some people just don't get it. Kill Bill Vol 2 was the best movie released so far this year, QT is a genius that makes movies that he likes to watch, he doesn't care if we like them or not, but the fact is we do, and there are reasons for this.Seems to me that the detractors have probably never seen a spaghetti western, let me recommend one to you.A Fistful of Dollars, see this movie and then watch Kill Bill again and you will see exactly were QT is coming from, his use of silence is as breathtaking as anything Sergio Leone ever did. This is where QT comes into his own, he uses other film makers methods but improves upon them. He is the ultimate fan, and because he knows and loves the genres he pays homage to, we are brought back to these excellent films, and we are left in no doubt that we are seeing one mans love for them.I can honestly say that Kill Bill vol 1 & 2 are probably going to be around a long time, these are movies that will be held as benchmarks for film-makers in the future, in these movies we see how it should be done. QT has his share of problems in life, but directing wonderful movies is not one of them.*****/*****",10,2,4,21 April 2004
