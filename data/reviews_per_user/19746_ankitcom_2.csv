Airlift," Authentic and a simple flick, that focuses only on storyline
","http://maggyreviews.com/2016/01/22/airlift/Director: Raja Menon Actors: Akshay Kumar, Nimrat KaurRating: 3 / 5Pictorially this movie felt like last year's film Baby, but it certainly is different in all senses. Less in cinematography, it has no heroic angles at all. One of the most simplistic and genuine movie in recent times. It focuses heavily on story and sticks to it throughout its running time. It has a great scenic creation of Kuwait Iraq war sight.Akshay Kumar blends himself as a soul of this whole storyline. He has perfectly underplayed his character without any starry effects. The way movie wanted its leading actor to be, he has set himself entirely like that. Nimrat Kaur is a decent support and has played her role effectively.Raja Menon frankly hasn't done anything to raise movie standards. The good part is that he made sure nothing is out of place. Doing nothing bad and supporting the storyline authentically is a good experiment that he has done.Overall, a genuine and a simple flick that focuses only on the storyline.",7,1,13,22 January 2016
Dangal," Now this is the perfect example of how casting should be done. Not the best of the sports lot by all means, but certainly the way how these type of movies should be made.
","Now this is the perfect example of how casting should be done. Amazing performances by all the 4 girls where Zaira Wasim (Young Geeta) has by far ruled the charts. Aamir's effort as an actor and producer are marvelous. Not the best of the sports lot by all means, but certainly the way how these type of movies should be made.Storyline Rating: 3Acting Rating: 4 Zaira Wasim: 4 Suhani Bhatnagar: 3 Aamir Khan: 4 Fatima Sana Shaikh: 3 Sanya Malhotra: 3Direction Rating: 3Music Rating: 4Cinematography: 3Editing: 4",8,7,18,23 December 2016
