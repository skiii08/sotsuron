Blade Runner 2049," Excellent
","One more truly epic and deeply human story.The 'child' from this sequel is the proof that truly human potential - which replicants re-present - is not the fiction but the fact, which of course will be hunted.The Story and ambient/atmosphere in the movie are really ingeniously mastered by Denis Villeneuve. (I am very big fan of the Blade Runner - it is my favorite movie - but when I heard that Denis will be the Director, I was sure that it is going to 'work' again).Music is great, ...the masterpiece,...with clear reminiscence to the original, ...but simplified, with strong details which - in correspondence with certain parts of the screenplay - has blown me away.Congratulations, respect and appreciation to complete cast and crew.",10,1,8,9 October 2017
