Blade Runner 2049," Visually Spectacular and Artfully done
","Blade Runner 2049 is a Sci-Fi thriller directed by Dennis Villeneuve. The movie is set in a dystopian Los Angeles in the year 2049 succeeding the events of the original Blade Runner (1982). The film features Ryan Gosling as 'Officer K' a police officer and 'Blade Runner' who's job is to find and destroy replicants (artificial humans). In his journey he discovers things about the world he lives in and himself that he could have never imagined. The film features a short spoken yet badass protagonist, spectacular visuals, and a compelling story that remains true to the original while being its own standalone film.I have seen the original Blade Runner only once in my life, and I didn't know what to expect coming into this movie. After watching it two times it has made me feel some type of way emotionally. i really like this film. Ryan Gosling kills it as 'Officer K' a blade runner who is also a replicant himself. His main job as a blade runner is to kill off all remaining older model replicants who are dangerous and disobedient. Officer K does not talk much, and he does as hes told (at first). K has an artificial companion that goes by the name of 'Joi.' Joi interacts with K as if shes a completely sentient being. I think some of the most poignant moments in this film are the scenes where Officer K and Joi interact with each other. Even though they are not human they still possess the capability to act human and 'love' so to say. Whenever Officer K is with Joi is really the only time he shows any human like emotion. The relationship between K and Joi really made me root for them, and care about them as characters. When it comes to danger Officer K is no stranger. In every altercation he gets in he appears to be very skilled in martial arts, and using a gun. He also appears to be very skilled in taking a beating as he is severely beaten many times throughout this movie. Officer K isn't just a brute though; even if he is a replicant programmed to do certain things he has the ability to think for himself, and put others before him. Unfortunately Officer K's intelligence and ability to question reality becomes his tragic flaw.The visuals...where do I even start? Amazing! Growing up CGI has always been a technology that has been widely used, and It's just something i'm used to seeing in virtually every movie. Having visual effects really wow me is very rare since it is so common. The visual effects in Blade Runner 2049 are beautiful! Every shot, and every sequence just seems so authentic. The visual perfection of this movie will engross you in whats going on for the entirety of this movie. From the opening shot, to the flight to LAPD, we as the audience can tell that Officer K is living in a dark and oppressive future. The common people live in close proximity in housing that looks reminiscent of the favelas in present day Brazil. The sun is never seen in the movie and it is always cloudy during the day, and pouring rain at night. The dark imagery combined with the neon lighting, and the cyberpunk soundtrack really evoked strong emotions in me. I was disgusted by the beauty of this terrible world.The visuals are great, and I believe the plot is great too. The main conflict of the movie is when Officer K and the LAPD find the remains of a deceased replicant that died by giving birth to a child. In the Blade Runner universe this is seemingly impossible since replicants are essentially just machines that have no ability to procreate. Officer K is sent on the mission to find this child before the main Antagonist 'Niander Wallace' finds it. I like the mystery aspect of the plot it had me questioning who the child was. Was it Officer K? or was it somebody else? I can't go into much detail about it without spoiling it but I liked that Villeneuve didn't try to make it a big epic spectacle with a giant battle of replicants vs humans at the end. He kept it simple and thought provoking which I think is the route to go with this film without completely crapping on the original.I think Blade Runner 2049 in many ways is better than the original. It has all the right ingredients to make for an entertaining and beautiful film, and Villenueve uses those ingredients correctly. I never thought I would leave this movie in love with what I had just experienced. Blade Runner 2049 will make you reflect on your own self and the world you're living in, and what your world could be. This movie is not just for your average movie goer looking to get a little entertainment for the night, it is a long movie that requires a lot of thought and patience to understand. Overall I think this movie can be appreciated by those who love great cinema.",9,0,2,13 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," A cataclysm of garbage
","Genuinely the most depressing movie experience of my life, this movie sucked the magic and life out of Star Wars for good. Nothing in this movie makes sense or even attempts to make sense. A slow speed chase in space...glorious just what we all wanted and expected from a Star Wars movie.",1,10,14,15 November 2019
