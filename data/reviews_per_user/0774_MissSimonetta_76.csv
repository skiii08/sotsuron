Vertigo," Obsession and death in dreamlike Technicolor
","Vertigo (1958) has haunted me since I first saw it. Its dreamlike atmosphere and twisted tale of obsessive passion have made it a classic for all time. It's a film that gets better and richer with every viewing. You appreciate the first half of the film more as well as Novak's cool and later heartrending performance. And this is no doubt Hitchcock's best directorial work; he may have made more suspenseful and wittier films, but few get as poignant and creepy as Vertigo.People often complain that it's too slow and that James Stewart is miscast. On the first criticism, I say the film's slow pace is one of its biggest strengths; it gives us time to know the characters and appreciate the atmosphere, something Hollywood's modern blockbusters cannot manage since all viewers want is sensory overload and story whiplash.On the second criticism, I must disagree; Scottie is not a romantic lead. That he's played by a graying, older James Stewart makes his obsession with the young Madeline and the fantasy romance she represents all the more understandable and poignant; this is a man who desperately wants out of his dull, everyday world and is willing to go dangerously over the edge to possess a woman too good to be true. That this is classic Hollywood everyman James Stewart playing this disturbed character adds a level of creepiness to the character too.A true classic, an essential piece of cinema.",10,3,5,2 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why do I keep doing this to myself?
","No other trilogy has received as much good will from me as the Star Wars prequel trilogy. The Hobbit movies I despise and will not revisit, but every few years, I come back to the SW prequels, wanting them to be the finely crafted tragedies their fans claim they are over and over. After the soulless incoherence of the Disney SW, I wanted to go back and see if THE PHANTOM MENACE is much of an improvement.Well, it certainly has more imagination. Say what you will, Lucas wanted to expand the setting and try new things. He didn't just repeat the same scenes from the OT over and over, even if he did make certain scenes and characters 'rhyme' as he infamously stated. The problem is all of these characters are so flat, their interactions lacking anything like heart or charisma. Wooden puppets are more expressive than these dead-eyed, monotone marionettes, existing solely to move this wrecked, rambling screenplay along.I cannot decide what is TPM's fatal flaw: the vague characterizations or that awful story. I have seen this movie about five times over the years and I still cannot make heads or tails of Sidious's evil plot. I get he wants to create a crisis on Naboo to make himself chancellor, but the amount of coincidence that the plot hinges upon just... it makes fridge logic an art form. The queen and her decoys also make little sense, though I feel that particular element of the plot was inserted in there as an homage to Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, not as an essential part of the narrative proper.I mean, yeah, I'd watch what is essentially a big-budgeted Saturday morning cartoon over the disrespectful annoyance that was THE LAST JEDI-- but to be honest, TPM isn't that much better a movie. Just because Disney SW is awful and corporate to a fault does not make the prequels suddenly masterpiece-level cinema.",5,2,2,19 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't blame the negative reception on nostalgia
","I have come across people who claim everyone just doesn't like the Star Wars prequels because it's cool to hate them or that the Red Letter Media reviews conditioned them to or that they're too blinded by their nostalgia of the original trilogy to give them a chance. Well, when I grew up in the 1990s/early 2000s, I never saw the original trilogy. In fact, my first Star Wars film was The Phantom Menace (1999), now the most infamous of the entire saga. My younger sister bought the DVD and we sat down to watch it.Even at age nine, it was one of the most boring experiences of my movie-going existence and killed all of my interest in Star Wars until I saw the original trilogy in high school. Watching TPM once again at age twenty, it's even more painful than I remembered.The accusations made against this film are 100 percent true. The actors never emote, the effects are over-the-top (and have dated worse than the models and matte paintings in the original trilogy, I may add), and the script is laughably bad. The whole thing is more spectacle than story. And while that's not a terrible thing in and of itself (the spectacle-heavy Metropolis (1927) wasn't exactly Shakespeare), the fact that the characters are so boring, the writing so uninspired- it's such a chore to sit through!Most importantly, it's just no fun. I admit the original trilogy is not perfect, not at all. The acting could be hokey, some of the light sabers fights were poorly choreographed, the writing was sometimes weak, and Return of the Jedi (1983) was a lackluster conclusion. But you know what? At least the actors expressed emotions and felt like people. At least the light saber fights and X-wing battles didn't last three hours and wear out their welcome. At least there was heart in the stories, even if plot elements like Leia being Luke's sister were left undeveloped or characters like Boba Fett wasted. I can forgive all that, because I have an emotional attachment to the characters and the movies are ultimately a blast to watch.If you like the prequels or TPM, then that's okay. I'm actually happy you were able to enjoy them, because I wish I could have too. But don't accuse the people who dislike them of doing so because of nostalgia or it's supposedly fashionable. I disliked this one before I ever watched the older films and fell in love with them, and I still don't care whether it's cool to like or dislike certain movies.",5,2,4,5 August 2014
Marie Antoinette," Sensuous and offbeat character study
","Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (2006) has had a mixed reception since its release almost a decade ago. Those expecting your typical, 100 percent historically accurate period drama/biopic will no doubt harbor a distaste for this movie. To be honest, MA is more of a character study than a biopic detailing the rise and fall of a queen.Coppola presents Marie Antoinette as she was when she came to the French court as a teenage bride-to-be: a culturally-alienated, flighty girl who finds solace in shopping and partying. It is a fascinating portrait of the woman and her world, a portrait that both criticizes and delights in the excess of the French elite. The whole picture is an exercise in sensual detail, reveling in silk dresses and decadent pastries and all the intricacies of 18th century European architecture, all done in candy colors and pastels.The 1980s soundtrack usually comes under fire for being anachronistic, but I thought it was inspired to link the excess of the 1980s with the indulgent French court. Kirsten Dunst's performance is also a little more 21st century than 18th at times, but it all comes down to humanizing the character, making the audience realize that Marie Antoinette was a real human being, not just some dusty, distant entity relegated to historical texts and sumptuous paintings.An underrated film and one of Coppola's finest. I think it will have a rich critical afterlife in the decades to come.",9,1,2,2 September 2015
Hereditary," Only the first 100 minutes are the great material everyone's describing
","I loved the first 100 minutes of HEREDITARY. Psychological anguish brilliantly acted by a superb cast. Visuals that feel like Wes Anderson gone wrong. An atmosphere of dread and despair that recalls the great psychological horror classics like ROSEMARY'S BABY.And then, we get to the 'twist.' And what a lame twist it is. The moment Collette starts climbing the walls like Spiderman and gliding about like a Scooby-Doo ghost, the atmosphere was broken.HEREDITARY is most compelling when the horror comes from the awful tragedy of the young girl's death or the emotional hell the family goes through in the aftermath, blaming one another. I spent much of the movie terrified the mother would break down completely and kill her own son.The twist is such a conventional letdown. It felt so, so boilerplate, something you'd get from THE CONJURING.The only reason this isn't lower than a 7/10 from me is because the first half was just so great. Too bad it couldn't make the landing...",7,65,93,15 September 2019
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Lightning in a bottle
","That WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT was made at all is a marvel to me-- I'm sure getting all the studios that owned these characters to agree to let them all on the screen was a real feat-- but I have no doubt it was made at just the right time in movie history. The 80s saw an upswing in interest in the classic Hollywood animations of the 30s and 40s, and the 70s nostalgia for classic noir was still lingering, leading to classics like BODY HEAT. Somehow, this led to a perfect combination of ideas. The special effects technology of the 1980s also allowed the fusion of live action and animation to be done in a manner far more sophisticated than past decades.So yeah, I consider ROGER RABBIT a great film. The story is both a spoof of noir conventions and a dramatic story you can take just seriously enough, populated by memorable and endearing characters. Everyone does great work, but you have to give it to Bob Hoskins, who toes the line between comedy and hardboiled drama well. It's often described as a kid's movie, though with the sheer amount of sexual jokes and extreme cartoon violence, I am shocked some moral watchdog has yet to complain (at least, I've never heard of anyone complaining about this movie's content, not even from those who think things like HAPPY FEET and HARRY POTTER were directed by Satan himself).The idea of a sequel was in talks for a few years, but to be real, I am glad they never came to be. In our age of rehashes and reboots and sequels twenty to thirty years after the fact, it's been proven repeatedly that you just can't re-catch lightning in a bottle.",10,0,0,14 June 2020
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," I forgot how good this movie is!
","I watched this one relatively often as a kid and remembered enjoying it, but as an adult, it's much easier to appreciate how great a movie this is. It's very funny, yes, but also quite suspenseful. The 'scratchy' animation style and the backgrounds are well-paired. The dogs and their owners are sympathetic characters, but it's Cruella who dominates the movie. She is pretty freaking scary and designed to perfection.",9,2,2,7 June 2019
Mulan," A girl worth fighting for
","MULAN is one of those movies that I don't count among my favorites, but I still enjoy watching it now and then. It's a pleasant movie, a gem from late in the Disney Renaissance that benefits from its mostly understated strengths: Mulan is a great heroine, the art style evokes Chinese watercolor painting, and the songs are lovely. The 'girl power' theme is presented in a non-preachy manner too, a rarity in current Hollywood movies which feel the need to hammer their points home. Mulan doesn't need to give speeches about why she's badass-- we see it in her actions, courage, and intelligence. About the only element I dislike is Mushu, but even he gets a good line in now and then.",8,0,0,16 June 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," No good characters means little emotional investment
","While some might claim a movie about the theft of the Death Star plans is pointless, it need not be if we can get involved with the characters. Rouge One (2016) was a nice enough theater experience, but I am shocked by just how bland the cast is, particularly Jyn.There is no reason why Jyn should be such a dull character. This is a young woman who shuns political activism because of what it cost her family, who feels abandoned and bitter. Her journey from passive to active rebel should have been moving, but it isn't. What is she like outside of the line of duty? I have no idea! It's much the same with the other rebels, who are one dimensional: spiritual monk, cynical gunner, reluctant pilot, the rebel dedicated to the cause. We don't know much about anyone's past in a movie where the past seems to hang heavy over our heroes and gives them additional emotional fuel to fight the Empire; they don't have any inter-team chemistry. This lack of a memorable cast really dragged the movie down and I admit I was bored for the whole first half. When the characters met their tragic ends, I cared little. This movie was a wasted opportunity and it makes me skeptical about the SW spin-offs to come.",6,4,11,18 May 2017
Captain Marvel," Felt more like an obligation than a story that needed to be told
","I'd put CAPTAIN MARVEL down there with THOR: THE DARK WORLD as a poorly paced, dull entry in the MCU, which has been for the most part solid and fun. I don't even care that much about the alleged controversy regarding feminism or whatever-- the movie is just boring, slapping on lackluster Joss Wheddonisms, the expected 1990s pop culture references, and stock character beats, and hoping we'll eat up this warmed-over blockbuster material with no complaints.I don't know if Brie Larson was miscast or not (her main mode of acting is to alternate between stone-faced sense of purpose and condescending smirks), but I can't see any actress doing very well as Carol, as her characterization is quite uneven throughout the movie. Is she a stoic warrior or a quippy mischief-maker? The movie hammers home at the end that her persistence is her defining trait, but by then, I felt she was a bit of an overpowered, Superman-like bore who doesn't really have to do much soul-searching.Now you might argue since this movie is about a woman trying to remember who she was and trying to fight against the roles others try to mold her into, this inconsistency is a stylistic choice, but that's a stretch considering she remains this same mish-mash of personality from the first frame to the last.I also rather disliked how Nick Fury was treated. I could get him being a little bumbling if we were seeing a 20-something Nick Fury just learning the ropes, but considering he is already a seasoned agent of SHIELD at this point, his stumbling around just to make Carol look better was rather irritating.The fight scenes are competent, like you'd expect from Marvel after a decade-plus of making movies, but it is a shame this competence did not extend to the screenplay, which lacks any real meat or originality. To be honest, I was relieved when it was over, not my typical reaction to most MCU movies.",5,4,11,17 March 2019
Zootopia," So far, the best animated Disney film of this decade
","Zootopia (2016) is quite a surprise: a Disney movie which tackles modern social strife head on. Zootopia is about prejudice and bigotry, reflecting how people are othered by their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, social background, etc. in the real world, even in a post-civil rights world. Both main characters suffer from prejudice in that they are victims and perpetrators. Nick Wilde is seen as a thug by nature due to his species, but he looks down on Judy for her size and her social background as a farmer from the country. Judy is seen as weak and foolish for those previously mentioned things; she claims to be 'enlightened,' but even she has to struggle with preconceived notions about 'predators.' Many times, movies about prejudice ignore how EVERYONE has stereotypical ideas about people, how bigotry can exist even in people who don't burn crosses or hold up nasty signs about who God allegedly hates on the side of the road. Most people have bigotry that is subtle and these can be easily manipulated by fear-mongers, which is what happens in this film. The movie asks us to look at ourselves and question our perceptions of those who are different from us.Of course, Zootopia is also a fun film, an exciting mystery-comedy that is re-watchable indeed. The voice actors are excellent in their roles and the animation is top of the line, as is usual for most Disney projects. It is ultimately optimistic about the possibility of respect and understanding overcoming fear of the unknown and the other, and it calls us to do what we can to hold fast to these qualities in our own lives. And that is a fine achievement.",9,4,7,9 May 2017
Beauty and the Beast," The greatest film of the Disney Renaissance
","The Disney Renaissance (1989-1999) was in many ways the studio's second golden age (the first being from 1937-1942), where experimentation and sublime artistry where the rule rather than the exception. Most of my generation grew up with these movies, so everyone has a favorite. The most popular seems to be The Lion King (1994), but for me the true masterpiece of the era is Beauty and the Beast (1991), arguably the most romantic Disney flick of them all.All the characters are perfect. I think the only cast I like better than this one is from Pinocchio (1940). Belle is an appealing heroine: she has a compassionate and dreamy nature, but she won't let herself be walked over by anyone (notice she doesn't fall for the Beast until he starts acting like a decent person). The Beast has excellent character development, evolving from a selfish brat into a kind, passionate fellow. The enchanted objects are both fun comic relief and interesting characters in their own right. Gaston is one of Disney's best villains, walking the fine line between comic and menacing with ease.BatB boasts the greatest soundtrack of all the Disney canon. Howard Ashman and Alan Mencken outdid themselves here. The choreography is magnificent too, especially the Busby Berkely inspired 'Be Our Guest' and the superbly animated 'Beauty and the Beast'. The incidental music is lush and romantic, a pleasure to listen to in its own right.That's not to say the film doesn't have flaws. The animation on Belle goes off-model at times and the CG in the ballroom sequence is dated. And then there's that plot hole concerning how long Belle was at the castle. None of these issues diminish the greatness of the picture. This is one of the most beautiful and adult love stories ever put put on screen. Absolutely essential.",10,4,5,1 September 2013
Us," Enjoyable movie undercut by poorly-conceived plot twists
","I haven't seen GET OUT yet, so I cannot make comparisons, but I find I have similar problems with US as a lot of disappointed fans of the 2017 horror hit do.US fires on all cylinders when it's being an exceptional horror-thriller. The home invasion scenes and the dark comedy are brilliant. The characters are enjoyable and the dialogue between them is well-written. Much of the movie felt like a 1980s family comedy like THE GREAT OUTDOORS turned into a nightmare, actually. It was quirky but enjoyable.However, once the twists and explanations for the bumps in the night come in, the movie starts losing my interest. I think the filmmakers try to overexplain too much and too often. Keeping the dopplegangers' identities more mysterious seems a better option than opening the whole can of worms of their existence and their rather convoluted plan to get revenge on the upper world.I also agree with the high-rated review which argues that the last twist regarding the mother's identity undermines so much of the movie. It felt like it wanted to shock just for a cheap gasp, not because it was a logical conclusion.",7,0,1,25 August 2019
Elizabeth," Pretty but the script is too stupid for words
","On one hand, the technical aspects of Elizabeth (1998) are marvelous. Gorgeous cinematography and costumes. Cate Blanchett is a great Elizabeth, so great that at times it felt like she could salvage the picture.Too bad the script is junk. I'm not even going into the realm of historical accuracy because next to none of the details here are true to reality. The sexual stuff in particular is obnoxious (like Elizabeth's maids peeping on her copulating with Robert Dudley-- what was that?). What they did to the Duke of Anjou, Mary Tudor, and Mary de Guise is just so far into the realm of dumb, turning actual people into caricatures.And that's the problem: the whole thing feels juvenile. And unlike a juvenile historical drama offering like Reign, Elizabeth has no camp value to make it entertaining. I would not call the film an entire failure-- my sister and I had a pleasant enough time watching it-- but I would not watch it again and would not recommend it.",5,1,1,23 January 2017
The Great Dictator," Flawed but sincere and still compelling
","As acclaimed as it is, I find The Great Dictator (1940) elicits mixed responses from movie geeks. Some count it as Chaplin's greatest triumph, while others feel it is preachy noise, proof that his brand of film-making was only effective in silence.I'm in the middle on the matter. TGD is a flawed work, sure. It's too long and its political commentary is heavy-handed. Some of the jokes are too corny for their own good. But there are some great comic sequences, mostly involving the temperamental dictator Hynkel. His antics with the Mussolini stand-in are worth the two hour run time.Many have criticized the ending speech, saying it feels tacked on or that the barber character was not eloquent enough to make up something like that, let alone on the spot the way he did. It's never felt that discordant to me, though. The speech is so humane and brilliant; my suspension of disbelief isn't stretched too much when those ideas come from the little barber.This isn't Chaplin's masterpiece (Modern Times (1936) was his last great film, in my opinion), but its messages of peace and tolerance have kept it relevant through the decades.",8,0,2,19 August 2014
Home Alone," Nostalgia-proofed holiday classic
","Like many other people of my vintage, HOME ALONE has been a staple of the holidays for as long as I can remember. The story is essentially a kid's fantasy: not just staying home alone and getting to play by one's own rules for a while, but also inflicting comical pain upon very obvious bad guys. The Christmas-y mise en scene and clever use of low camera angles complete this nostalgic, feel-good comedy's sense of festive atmosphere.As an adult, the contrivances that cause the plot to occur are more apparent, of course. And the slapstick climax is shockingly violent-- it never occurred to me just how brain-damaged or DEAD the Wet Bandits would be. However, none of these things bother me in the least. Maybe it's nostalgia. Maybe the movie's strengths are so potent as to cancel anything else out. I don't know. All I know is the movie still makes me laugh in my 20s as much as it did when I was a child.",8,1,1,23 December 2019
Catch-22," Amazing adaptation
","I read the book before seeing the movie and assumed there was no way you could translate the style of the book to film. I figured I would agree with the film's many detractors. Instead, I ended up loving this film very much! It definitely isn't a mere translation of the book to cinema-- but it GETS Heller's message and nails the almost cartoonish insanity of the novel's events and characterizations.Beautifully shot. Perfect casting and performances. The editing is brilliant too. Just, I do not get the hate at all.",10,1,1,8 June 2019
"I, Tonya"," Entertaining enough but overrated
","Considering all the critical gushing that surrounded this movie back in 2017, it is possible that I came in with too high expectations, but I found I, TONYA disappointing in almost every category. Reviews would have you believe this is a pitch-black satire of media circuses and class privilege, but it's just your standard Oscarbait biopic, paying lip service to its themes while never really exploring them in an interesting way.Of all the actors, Allison Janey came off the best as the mother from hell. Maybe a bit one-note, but generally entertaining. I enjoy Margot Robbie as an actress and she does credible work here, though there are a few scenes where you can tell she's self-consciously swinging for that coveted Oscar gold rather than inhabiting a character. The other actors are pretty good, though they never really feel 'real' to me-- considering the whole 'unreliable narrator' schtick the movie insists it has going on, this might be the point (people exaggerating events and behavior in retelling a story), but even in the 'mockumentary' sections, the acting felt off.The movie fires on all cylinders when it's doing its best Coen Brothers imitation. The dark comedy generally works, especially in regards to the criminal antics of Shawn, Tonya's hapless bodyguard. However, the dramatic scenes work less so and feel like they're from another movie altogether. These scenes are more conventional, hitting the usual 'biopic' beats we've seen hundreds of times in other movies. Even the unreliable narrator conceit falls apart: the movie is pretty firm in its ideas regarding what the 'truth' of the situation is, even if the Harding character claims there is no such thing as the ultimate truth.It's funny-- I saw this movie just last night and my opinion of it plummets the more I think about it. Another case where I like what the movie is trying to do more than its execution of those ideas.",6,0,0,31 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Meh ending to a great trilogy
","Return of the Jedi (1983) is often cited as being the weakest of the original Star Wars trilogy and I would be inclined to agree. It's not that it's a bad film (God knows it's Citizen Kane compared to the badly written and lifeless prequels), but compared to Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980) it does not stand as well on its own.ROTJ is also marred by writing problems. Though the rescue sequence at the beginning is iconic, it goes on way too long and kills the flow. Luke's plan to rescue Han is full of holes. The relationship between Han and Leia seems to have regressed from the last film, with Han suspecting Leia's affections have transferred from him to Luke even though they confessed their feelings before he was frozen in carbonite (Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher also look like they're bored most of the time, but seeing how little they're given to do, can you blame them?). The revelation that Luke and Leia are siblings is unexploited and goes nowhere narrative-wise, aside from Vader threatening to convert Leia to the dark side toward the end. And while I don't like the cutesy Ewoks, I could have stomached them if their antics didn't eat up so much of the screen time.Still, what works is great. The battle scenes are tense and full of spectacle, sporting some of the best special effects in the entire original trilogy. Mark Hamill portrays Luke's new-found maturity well while still retaining his character's youthful idealism and emotional nature. The confrontation between Luke, Darth Vader, and the Emperor is full of well-realized dramatic intensity. Vader's ultimate fate is cathartic and still moves me to tears. Perhaps the ending is a bit too happy, but after all the sacrifices and suffering our heroes went through, I feel they deserve it.I cannot help but be disappointed by ROTJ, but by no means is it a train wreck. It's an adequate ending to a fantastic trilogy and though I wish it measured up to its illustrious predecessors, I am grateful that it wasn't the nightmare that Episodes I-III turned out to be.",8,2,5,3 August 2014
Lost in Translation," Great film about the modern condition
","After falling in love with Sofia Coppola's stylized character study Marie Antoinette (2006), I was hungry for more of her films. I admit I found The Bling Ring (2013) disappointing, but Lost in Translation (2003) was as amazing as I had been led to believe. Few contemporary films so acutely depict modern alienation as this little romantic drama.Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are the unlikely friends who find themselves at a crossroads in their lives. Murray's washed up movie star has hit a midlife crisis and a low point in his strained marriage; Johansson is fresh out of college, unsure about where to go from there, and to top it all off unhappily married. Coppola throws the two lonely Americans into 21st century Tokyo, turning the city into a modern Wonderland of electric lights and fleeting pleasures in the forms of arcades and night clubs. Disconnected from themselves and unable to understand Japanese, Murray and Johansson find their alienation made manifest and cling to one another for solace. A few scenes focus on Buddhist priests and the natural beauty of Japan, denoting an elegiac longing for an older world, but as the melancholy ending shows, there is slight chance for escape, though it is left ambiguous as to whether or not the characters will ever be able to find peace. We leave them at the crossroads, unsure of which road they will take.About the only flaw this film has is the occasionally troublesome depiction of the Japanese characters. I can see where some critics were coming from when they called LIT a spectacle of Otherness for westerners. Aside from this problematic element, the film really is a masterpiece, Coppola's best to date, though I would argue Marie Antoinette is really close.",10,1,2,27 February 2016
Barry Lyndon," The Kubrick movie that made me a fan
","I was introduced to the work of Stanley Kubrick at a college screening of 2001, a film I appreciated but did not love. Years later, a chance viewing of BARRY LYNDON on TCM, motivated by my interest in the 18th century, reintroduced me to Kubrick and got me totally obsessed with the man's films. I have seen all Kubrick's movies and out of all his features, I only love A CLOCKWORK ORANGE more than BARRY LYNDON, which, on an objective level, might be his most perfect movie.That BARRY LYNDON is gorgeous, no one will contest, not even the film's fiercest detractors. However, for me, the film's story, with its sense of irony and dark humor, make it a classic. And despite the claims that Kubrick movies are all cold, there are a few moments that really hit you in the gut. I even confess that one scene in particular made me weep and continues to make me weep every time I revisit this masterpiece.",10,1,2,24 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Sound and fury
","Does this even qualify as a movie? Yes, the images move at twenty-four frames a second, but as a story, this is the biggest mess I have ever seen, a mishmash of Macguffins, convenient idiocy to move the plot along, and new flashy Force powers to comb away problems when they arise and the writer cannot come up with a more clever resolution. All the actors seem checked out and I cannot blame them: it's like every movie in this misbegotten trilogy, rather than building on the movie before it, just wants to press the reset button over and over. How can you play a character that way?Just avoid. I should not have watched it but I did.",1,17,21,19 May 2020
Romeo + Juliet," Visually bold and very 1990s take on R&J
","I'll admit it: the first time I saw this film in high school I despised it. I found it so ridiculous, so over-the-top that I could barely believe that anyone could take it seriously. I wondered how anyone could think this film was even close to touching the greatness of the 1968 Romeo and Juliet, which is one of the most beautiful films ever made. I'm in college now, and for my Shakespeare on Film class, I had to watch this again. And this time I found myself enjoying it! Not that I still don't have issues with it, but it's much more striking and moving than I remember.The film's style is very over-the-top. Scenes such as the Capulet and Montague boys at the gas station or Lady Capulet conversing with Juliet about checking out Paris at the ball are played to almost cartoonish extremes. Every image on screen pops with color. The first time I saw the film I found it all garish and much too 1990s, but now I find there's a strange beauty to it. It's as far from the lush Italian setting of the 1968 film as you could get, but it's cool in its own way and there's a ton of motifs, such as the constant use of religious images which contrast with the violent acts committed by the characters. The music is pretty good too, especially 'Kissing You'.The acting is mostly competent. Claire Danes makes a radiant Juliet, girlish and passionate. Other highlights are Harold Perrineau as Mercutio (the scene where he's performing in drag kills me every time) and Pete Postelthwaite as Friar Laurence. The only actor I had any problem with was our Romeo. Leonardo DiCaprio is handsome and passionate, but the way he delivers a lot of his lines bothers me. His delivery doesn't do the words justice at all.I still think the 1968 version is the superior film, but I'm glad I saw this again. It's a beautiful film, if only a little-- okay, very over-the-top. But still, it's worth checking out.",8,1,2,13 March 2013
"Monsters, Inc."," Becomes even better when you watch it as an adult
","Looking back on Pixar in the 2000s, it's clear to me that was their golden age. MONSTERS INC is one of the finest efforts of that period, a comedy both humane and thrilling. The design of the characters and the world is like something out of a child's imagination, while the story is well-plotted and engaging.As a child, I recall being most interested in the buddy comedy elements and the chase scene through the colorful warehouse filled with bedroom doors. As an adult, I've come to better appreciate how the movie works as a parable about becoming a parent. Sully is initially interested in his own glory and the petty goal of being the best. When Boo comes into his life, everything changes-- everything he believed was important turns out to be nothing compared to the fatherly love he feels for her. It's sweet without rotting your teeth and the ending... oh God, it still makes me cry.One of Pixar's best, without a doubt.",10,1,2,23 March 2020
The Lego Movie," Like being ten years old again
","The Lego Movie (2014) is something that could have easily been a quick, uninspired cash-in, but much to my surprise it took my breath away with how unique, quirky, funny, and even touching it was.The animation is unique: though it's pure CG, it evokes stop motion and creatively utilizes its Lego world. Though I'm always skeptical of celebrity voice acting, all the actors do a great job here, especially Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, and Will Ferrell.The story riffs on the oft-used 'chosen one saves the world' plot and comes across as something a child would make up as they went along. It is this quality that transports the viewer back to his or her own childhood. I didn't much play with Legos as a kid, but I do remember using my dolls and whatever else was around to create crazy characters and adventures.A wonderful flick. Do make sure to see it in a packed theater, because the mirth and laughter are absolutely infectious.",8,1,5,15 February 2014
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," What video game movies should be, and it's not even based on a video game!
","By nature, I do not care for rom-coms in the least, but for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, I'll make a rare exception. It's unique, funny, and oddly romantic in parts, mixing your traditional romantic comedy with video game and comic book elements.While calling a movie a video game is usually a derogatory thing, here it's part of what makes Scott Pilgrim so much fun. The fight scenes are what a video game movie should be: colorful and completely over the top in every way. Imagine if the Super Mario Bros movie from the early 1990s had been shot like Scott Pilgrim-- or most any video game adaptations which try way too hard to cram their sources into realistic and traditional cinematic narratives. Another plus is the way this movie subverts rom-com clichés, from the character types seen in these pictures to the way the plot goes.I had to borrow the DVD from a friend, but I totally need to get this one as soon as possible. Lots of fun!",7,0,0,25 March 2015
Inside Out," The melancholy and joy in life
","One thing which fascinates me with the general Pixar output is the streak of melancholy in so many of their films: Woody and Buzz's awareness of the ephemeral nature of life, Mr. Incredible's mid-life crisis, Wall-E's post-apocalyptic world, and the loneliness of Carl Frederickson quickly spring to mind. Inside Out (2015) continues this tradition with its examination of the inherent melancholy in life.The commercials and trailers show off the bright colors and sparkling comedy, but there is so much more beneath the candy colored surface. This is a story about the pain and alienation that comes with growing up. In a society where we want to push past unpleasant aspects of life without reflecting, where we want to rush as fast as possible, this film gives us an important lesson: sadness is necessary, grief is essential, and whenever we confront pain in our lives, we must not try to brave the path by ourselves. It's extraordinary and moving, proof that Pixar is back on track giving us modern classics and not tripe.",9,18,49,22 June 2015
Avengers: Endgame," I cannot overstate my disappointment
","To clarify, I am not an MCU fangirl. I enjoy these movies a little more than the casual moviegoer but I definitely do not fit into the diehard category. I enjoy watching most of the films, but would only list the GOTG movies and THOR: RAGNAROK as personal favorites.So just know, this isn't coming from the perspective of some unpleasable geek. It's coming from someone who was emotionally invested in these movies, enjoys most of them, and prizes solid storytelling.And let me tell you, as a story, ENDGAME is a mess.Character development? Forget it! Thor's arc from selfish braggart to responsible king is thrown away so he can be Lebowski 2.0, complete with sunglasses and sweater. The Hulk and Peter Quill are pretty much jokes. Tony Stark gets one of the cheapest deaths in modern cinema-- it feels less like a natural culmination of the character's growth and more like RDJ wanted to make sure he wasn't shoehorned into more movies through 2050.And don't get me started on how the events of this film are going to wreck GOTG 3. Let's just say all Gamora's character development is in the trash now. I know plenty of people who love the GOTG movies but have no interest in any other Marvel property and they'll be confused as hell come 2021. (I really do not get people who claim these MCU films work as self-alone pictures. 9.5 times out of 10, they really don't at all.)ENDGAME continues the trend of CAPTAIN MARVEL in throwing continuity to the winds. What happened to Thor's hammer NOT being the source of his power? Now, Steve Rogers can use it to toss lighting everywhere like a rogue Pikachu. Peter Parker goes back to high school in 2023 and somehow Ned is still a teen attending--- even though he was one of the confirmed not-deaths after INFINITY WAR. Steve Roger's wild time travel ride at the end will also screw future timeline continuity up in ways I shudder to contemplate. I pity the screenwriters is all I gotta say.I won't say this movie is the worst. Compared to something like, say, THE LAST JEDI, which had the most formless, meandering plot, ENDGAME moves quickly and does not overstay its welcome. There are some truly fun fight scenes and one-liners. The final battle in particular is marvelous, giving me some of the most fun I've had in a theater in a while (though it could have just been the enthusiasm of the crowd working its magic on me).But I'm not going to pretend this is an epic finale. It was so unsatisfying a conclusion for the original Avengers team that it kind of taints what came before. What enthusiasm I had for the MCU to come wasn't exactly high (nothing good lasts forever, as many a former successful franchise has shown Hollywood time and time again), but now, my hopes are nil.EDIT: I found out that Thor's hammer does allow worthy wielders his power, so I rescind my 'rogue Pikachu' complaint. The movie is still frustrating though.",6,12,21,27 April 2019
Gone with the Wind," Dated in some ways, timeless in others
","There is no doubt that some aspects of this mammoth 1939 production of Gone with the Wind have dated badly. The portrayal of black Americans is rubbish and the second half of the film is less dramatically compelling than the first, going into full Victorian melodrama mode.Yet it cannot be denied that this film's popularity has not waned much in the seventy-plus years since its release. It remains the highest grossing film of all time when adjusted for inflation and even young people like my preteen sister (who insists she dislikes old movies) have become big fans. What's the appeal? Well, the beautiful Technicolor photography and the sheer size of the production figure big time, as do the tempestuous central romance and themes of strength in the face of adversary and calamity.However, the most enduring thing about GWTW is its heroine, the immortal Scarlett O'Hara. Love her or loathe her, she is a fascinating creature and no one could ever deny she is a strong female character. Vivien Leigh is perfect in the role; while some 1930s performances come off as too affected for the taste of modern audiences, Leigh is natural and truly seems to be channeling the character from the book. I'd say her portrayal is my second favorite movie performance ever, after Maria Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928).While the problematic elements have made my love for this movie more reserved than they would be otherwise, I still check it out every fall. It's beautiful and anytime someone insists strong movie heroines did not exist until the 1970s, give the poor soul a referral to Miss O'Hara.",8,1,2,19 August 2014
Mamma Mia!," Puts the noxious in obnoxious
","Good God, what were the filmmakers thinking? I have never seen the stage show on which this nightmare of a film is based, but watching this thing, I have to wonder if it's really any better, even with people who can actually sing.The plot and characters are nonexistent, and the songs often have little to do with what little is actually going on in the story, but those are not the reasons why this film is so terrible. It's the obnoxiousness and utter lack of charm and humor. Every moment is cluttered with screeching, laughing, screaming, and terrible singing. It's enough to make a lover of musicals abandon the genre forever.Just stay away from your own health.",6,3,3,25 March 2015
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Nightmarish and awful
","I am not much of a Tolkein fan, but I saw the original LOTR film trilogy and read The Hobbit, and enjoyed all of it. The first Hobbit film was weak, but tolerable and full of atmosphere, but The Desolation of Smaug is downright awful.I am not against making changes to a film's source material, that is, if it benefits the film or makes for a solid, entertaining story. The screenplay here is a big mess, with too many conflicting subplots which take away from the central story about the dwarfs making their way to the mountain. Why do we need that subplot with Azog? Or a bunch of needless tie-ins to the original trilogy? Or a silly love triangle which does little to contribute to anything? It's a shame that so much screen time is taken away from Martin Freeman, who without doubt gives the best performance.The CG is especially horrendous and had me laughing aloud at several moments. The action sequences are so overblown and cartoonish. And why does Legolas' horse need to be CG?? Really? Does everything need to be a special effect? You cannot tell me they could not afford a real horse for just that one tiny shot! It's ridiculous.At least this film wasn't Star Wars prequel bad, but that's about it.",4,7,9,25 May 2014
Toy Story 4," The six rating is generous because deep down I hated this
","Three good things: the animation is drop-dead gorgeous (seeing young Andy in this movie, it's amazing how much CG animation has evolved in the last quarter of a century), Forky is not as annoying as he could have been, and the gags are generally funny. That being said...What did they do to Buzz? Why is he suddenly dumb? I know he was never the most cerebral space ranger in the ship, but now he's so dumb he uses his randomly generated voice options to make crucial decisions? I'll tell you why: A) his stupidity moves the plot along in ways it would not have if he was still intelligent and B) the writers have no clue to do with the characters that are not Woody and Bo Peep.Why is Woody going through the same identity crisis about not being needed AGAIN?Why are the supporting cast-- from Jessie on down to the Potato Heads-- essentially given nothing to do? This hurts the movie more than you might think: the ending has this 'Woody saying goodbye to the gang' shot that might have worked in TS3 where all of the characters were integral to the story, but not here, where their presence feels more like an extended cameo.On a related note, the toys all splitting up is just.... wrong in so many ways. The last three movies, beyond their allegorical treatment of acceptance of mortality and the transience of life, emphasized the importance of community and friendship. Andy might grow up but the toys would stick together and find meaning in their bonds with one another. Not now, I guess.Also, the script is a mess. While the main plot is 'get Forky back to Bonnie because she needs him for comfort,' the writers introduce a myriad of subplots and one-note characters for us to keep track of-- this is a messy, messy story, a far cry from the simple, elegant structures of the first three movies.TS4 might not sink to the lowest levels of your average cash grab, but do not be fooled: this is a cash grab. There is no reason for it to exist. The first three movies were as perfect a movie trilogy as one could have wished for-- like THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL, this is better off ignored.",6,1,1,15 March 2020
Wreck-It Ralph," Miraculously less popular than Frozen
","While Disney's Frozen (2013) is still being shoved in our faces almost two years after its release, Wreck-It-Ralph (2012) has been shamefully tossed aside. A great shame, since this is one of the finest films of Disney's so-called 'Revival Period.' The animation is so creative in how it emulates a multitude of video game aesthetic styles, from the colorful and block-like 8-bit to the high-definition games of today. Everything is vibrant and pleasing to the eye. The many settings run the gamut of video game history: the arcade game, kart racing, first-person shooters, among others. I do so hope they make a sequel, because there's just so much more they could explore with this world.The cast make up one of the most memorable casts in Disney history. Ralph's character development is excellent; he goes from being a sullen outcast to a selfless hero, while still possessing charisma and pathos throughout. Vanellope, at first annoying, is fleshed out through the revelation of her back story and her growing friendship with Ralph. Felix and Calhoun are both unlikely sources of comic relief and romance. The villain is revealed via plot twist, and let me tell you, it's much better handled than a similar twist in Frozen.The resolution is happy with a touch of bitter sweetness, unexpected from what seems to be just another family comedy. I admit I cried, something I thought no modern Disney film could ever prompt me to do.Seriously Disney, I rarely ask this but make a sequel! This is a great concept with great characters. If you've not seen it, then don't miss out!",8,2,4,24 February 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," I think I have a new favorite Tarantino movie
","As someone who likes but has never really loved Tarantino's style, I was blown away by this movie. It's more than a nostalgic trip back to 1960s Hollywood; it's a weird statement on movies and escapism themselves. It is every bit the fairy tale the title ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD implies, with its second chances and bizarre happy ending, though even these are tempered with little reminders of painful realities.Those looking for hard plot will be disappointed. This is a very laid back movie, just following the daily lives of a handful of characters in 1969 LA. Cinephiles and those fond of the 1960s will likely get the most out of it-- if you walk in not having some familiarity with the Tate murders or the Manson family, you might get a bit lost.The lack of plot hardly matters, as the characters are fun to watch. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are both hilarious and touching in their roles. Margot Robbie was a fabulous Sharon Tate and I'm honestly a bit bummed her role wasn't larger. That scene with her in the movie theater was just classic.The long run-time initially daunted me-- part of my problem with so many mainstream Hollywood movies these days is that they're often too long (especially superhero movies), but the three hours here flew right by. I was enjoying myself so much that I was loathe to leave these characters once the credits rolled at last.",10,26,37,3 August 2019
Frozen," Don't get the mad love it inspires, but not bad
","Frozen (2013) is by no means a train wreck, but I found the Beauty and the Beast (1991) comparisons ludicrous. The films of the early Disney Renaissanze like The Little Mermaid (1989) and BatB were films that broke the mold and revolutionized feature animation. Frozen is an entertaining film, but it does nothing new: we've seen strong female protagonists in a Disney film before, the Prince Charming/love at first sight idea has been lampooned/satirized better in other films such as Enchanted (2007), Princess and the Frog (2008), and Shrek 2 (2004), and there are Disney films with vastly superior music.The story is serviceable, but messy, a case of too many cooks in the kitchen. Interesting ideas are brought up but never developed to their full potential. The relationship between the sisters gets lost in the midst of romance and comedy. While Elsa is a magnificent character, it is unfortunate that she is not our protagonist. Instead we get Anna, who is much like a thousand other modern animated heroes and heroines: spazzy and optimistic, though her desire for love gives her some depth. Not a bad character, but I still feel like I've seen her like before. The Hans character is cool, but I wish he and his secret had been used for another film.The animation is beautiful, especially the effects animation on the snow and Elsa's ice magic. I've never been keen on the character designs, which are too doll-like for my tastes.While much praise has been heaped upon the music, I found it almost all of it forgettable. It's also much too modern sounding, which takes one out of the 19th century setting and will no doubt date the movie much the same way the operetta styled love songs in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) tether that film to the 1930s.In the end, a pretty film, but I don't think it will prove to be the enduring classic many have labelled it as.",7,3,5,15 February 2014
The Game," 'A Christmas Carol' sans Christmas and with more creepy clowns and chase scenes
","The Game (1997) is one of the all-time great thrillers, a sort of action-packed version of 'A Christmas Carol,' really. Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances as a miserable millionaire who gets sent on the craziest adventure imaginable. Faced with multiple horrors, thrills, and narrative twists and turns, he eventually undergoes a transformation much like Dickens' miser.Fincher makes the film stylish and atmospheric; The Game is certainly among his most underrated directorial efforts. The screenplay is just brilliant. Having studied this film for a class, I have had to view it multiple times and despite its two hour length, it never becomes dull or gets old. It's one of those rare films which becomes even more brilliant with each new viewing.One of my professors claimed this was the perfect movie, not because it is groundbreaking in any way, but because it puts everything together so well. I have to agree wholeheartedly.",9,2,4,2 April 2015
Shrek the Third," They should have just stopped after Shrek 2
","Even if this movie was decent, it would have been near impossible to top Shrek 2 (2004), a funny, well-paced comedy-adventure that eclipsed the original Shrek in terms of quality. Shrek the Third (2007) is just embarrassing.The jokes are uninspired at best and painful to watch at worst. The story had some potential, but it's so badly developed and feels as though it had been quickly slapped together because, hey, we need more money.What really kills Shrek the Third is its heartlessness. A heartless film is okay if the humor compensates, but seeing as this film is about as funny as an episode of Full House, that is not the case. It's a waste of time, even for those who like/love the Shrek series.",4,1,3,10 August 2014
Moulin Rouge!," I mean, I do get the hate... but....
","I really enjoyed this movie. Despite its flaws (and boy, does it have them!), I still walked away satisfied with the experience. I only wish I could have seen it in a theater and not merely on my television at home! It is not subtle at all. Neither the costumes, characterizations, or editing are unstated whatsoever. The plot is basically Camille meets La Boheme, with big doses of farce comedy interspersed with tragic romance. Yet somehow it all works-- well, for the most part.I will admit, I prefer the comical scenes to the more emotional ones. The hyperkinetic cinematography, bright colors, and animated performances generally jibe better when it's all played for laughs. Still, this is an enjoyable film if you don't mind your movies being style over substance once in a while.",8,0,0,15 April 2017
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," More than a rough draft for Princess Mononoke
","Yes, we get it: this film does not have the depth of the original manga, which is to be expected as Hayao Miyazaki's epic would not be completed for another decade. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about how this film stands on its own merits.Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984) marks a turning point in the career of Hayao Miyazaki. His previous work in television was marked by lightweight adventure and slapstick. In his feature directorial debut, The Castle of Cagliostro (1979) we can see signs of the melancholy and maturity which would arise in his later work, but it is in Nausicaa that this vision erupts in full bloom.As great as this film is as a sci-fi adventure, at its heart it is a drama about the tense relationship between man and nature. This is no preachy after-school special in the vein of Captain Planet; Nausicaa eradicates black-and-white morality by portraying characters with both virtues and uglier sides. And this includes the titular heroine herself.Often criticized by anime fans for being too 'perfect,' Nausicaa is actually a complex figure whose ideals of peace and understanding are put to the test when foreign soldiers murder her bedridden father. The pacifistic, gentle princess reacts to this atrocity by murdering all the men in the room in a fit of rage which is stopped when the mentor character Yupa steps in. It's a great scene, one of my favorites in any movie ever, because it shows how even the most kind-hearted of people have a dark side, and it is a moment which gives this film a greater depth than it would have otherwise.The man-nature relationship and gray morality would be explored to greater success in Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke (1997), but this is still one of Miyazaki's finest films. And despite Mononoke being technically better, I still prefer this movie, with its magnificent heroine and that haunting final shot.",10,1,2,7 August 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I'll never mock those people who were in denial about THE PHANTOM MENACE sucking back in 1999 ever again
","My keenest memory of seeing this in the theater back in 2017 was during one of the 'Force skype' scenes between Rey and Kylo. A kid in front of me leaned over to his father and asked in a tone of weary exasperation, 'Is the movie gonna be over soon?'That's THE LAST JEDI in a nutshell. Beyond the infuriating character assassination of Luke Skywalker, massive plot holes, the repetition of Finn's character arc from the first movie, the idiotic plot thread with Holdo and Poe,and Rey being perhaps one of the blandest, most overpowered leads in a blockbuster I have ever seen, this movie is boring. Two and a half hours of moping, psuedo-philosophy, and pretty pew-pew space battles that go nowhere.After seeing this movie in the theater, I tried to convince myself I was not disappointed. I tried to convince myself I enjoyed it, that it was deep, that I was somehow in the wrong for not enjoying a second of it. I read reviews. I read hot takes. Then after a long discussion with friends and some exposure to those who disliked the film, I finally accepted that I hated it and that it had killed any interest in seeing the rest of the Disney sequel trilogy.Judging from the synopsis of RISE OF SKYWALKER, I haven't missed a thing.",3,7,9,15 April 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," More of the same
","Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is without doubt a fun movie. The characters are entertaining, the blend of action and comedy is good, the use of 70s pop music on the soundtrack is brilliant, and there is enough story to keep you involved in what's going on. However, the Indiana Jones and Star Wars comparisons? I don't fully buy into those after actually watching the movie.For me, GOTG was a more entertaining version of The Avengers (2012), but it's still your run-of-the-mill comic book blockbuster. It's all banter and overblown action moving at terrible speed. The villain Ronin was bland and the plot was all based around an all-powerful MacGuffin orb. It takes visuals from Star Wars and has some of the fun action you would see in an older Indiana Jones movie, but I would not put any of it in the same league. The movie starts losing steam about an hour and a half in.In conclusion, this is like any other comic book movie from the past five years. It's fun for one watch, but I have no desire to go back to it or see the sequel.",8,3,8,15 August 2014
Shrek 2," One of Dreamworks' best to date
","I love Shrek 2 now just as much as I did when I was a kid. Much superior to the first entry in the franchise in both comedy and heart (let's pretend the third film never happened), this is possibly the funniest Dreamworks movie at the present. I've seen it dozens of times in the past ten years since it was released and it never gets old, even though I know most of the dialogue by heart at this point.To be honest, this movie does have a few drawbacks for me personally. The use of pop music in the background proves distracting and cheap at times. Some of the pop culture references will no doubt date. The human characters look vaguely uncanny and occasionally downright ugly, even ones who are meant to be attractive. Then again, the Shrek series was never about looking super appealing in the classic Disney vein, and that suits the film's irreverent universe.Still, I adore this film and it always makes me laugh. Whether you have kids or not, this is good stuff for an evening viewing or if you just need a laugh.",8,0,1,2 June 2014
2001: A Space Odyssey," Thought provoking and beautiful
","This definitely requires more than one viewing. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) not only boasts some of the most stunning cinematography and timeless special effects on film, but it has a story with so many layers that a revisit or two is mandatory if you even want to begin to understand it. The ending alone has been baffling people for over forty-five years. Another hundred could pass and there will still be discussions about this film.Just do yourself a favor, relax, and watch this. Don't expect lots of action or dialogue, or the sort of roller-coaster rides that science fiction movies have become. This is a film you are meant to reflect on and mull over in your mind hours afterward. It's not for everybody, but for those who are willing to go for something a bit more thoughtful, give it a whirl. The two hours and forty minutes are worth it.",10,5,8,7 November 2013
Toy Story," All the things that truly matter about the movie have not aged a day
","TOY STORY is a movie I tend to only revisit now and then, but man, is it truly a modern classic! Though the textures and human characters are quite dated by our standards, the story and film-making craft remain timeless. The comedy and suspense play off one another well, and rarely has a domestic setting like this ever felt so epic in scope. Like Disney's debut feature SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, Pixar's TOY STORY is imbued with a sense of playful discovery, innocence, and joy that lets it stand apart from the studio's later output. While they would go on to make more sophisticated films, TOY STORY's strength is in its simplicity and youthful spirit-- just a perfect movie in all the ways that matter.",10,1,1,2 March 2020
Singin' in the Rain," The ultimate feel-good movie
","Though my inner silent film nerd is annoyed by the historical inaccuracies and slight contempt for the medium in this film, in the end the infectious joy permeated by the characters and music cancel any negative impressions out. Singin' in the Rain (1952) is among the finest, if not the finest, of all Hollywood musicals. It's a beautifully shot, beautifully choreographed film with tons of humor and warmth.It's the cinematic equivalent of a bowl of chocolate ice cream; no matter how upset or tired you may be, this film will always perk you up. I cannot think of much else to say, because many more eloquent than I have analyzed this picture to the moon. But whether you dig film criticism or no, you're bound to love Singin' in the Rain.",10,0,1,21 April 2014
Toy Story 2," Better than it's reputation implies
","I was once among the many who considered Toy Story 2 (1999) to be the weakest of the Toy Story trilogy. But re-watching it once more, I think it may even surpass the original in terms of sheer heart.Though the first Toy Story (1995) was a technical milestone and a masterpiece in its own right, this is the first entry in the trilogy to introduce the themes which would become prominent in the third film: mortality, growing up, and loneliness. Who hasn't cried at Jessie's song, 'When She Loved Me'? Who hasn't related to that kind of alienation or the feeling of growing apart from an old friend? Stinky Pete's ideas on aging and death, and the opposition he receives from Woody and friends gives the film an almost philosophical edge.In some ways, one could argue that TS2 is superior to its sequel in that there is less unabashed sentiment. While I still love TS3 the most of the series, this is still a fine film and one that deserves more appreciation.",9,1,3,7 August 2014
Up," More than its famous opening montage
","I roll my eyes every time someone claims the first fifteen minutes of this film are all it has going for it, that after the silent montage it's just a banal kids' film about talking dogs and giant birds. For me, the greatest moments of Up (2009) happen long after the montage, for its power does not come from those five minutes, but from Carl Fredericksen's emotional journey.Carl has lost his wife Ellie, whom he promised to one day take to Paradise Falls in South America. Life got in the way and he was never able to grant this wish during her lifetime. The whole film is about him getting past his guilt and grief, and learning to live again. The image of Carl dragging his floating house by the hose says everything about his inner state. Russell is not only there so the kids will have a character they can closely relate to; he's there to get Carl to come out and live again, to connect with people again. (He's also a lot like the young Ellie in terms of personality, just a touch less hyperactive.) To those who argue Muntz was a needless villain, I must also disagree. Muntz is a mirror image of Carl in that he is a bitter old man unable to let go of the past and live. Like Carl, he is a recluse, but to a much greater degree, and he is so disconnected from humanity that he sees every other person as a threat.Yes, the scene with the dogs flying the fighter planes is silly, but guess what fellas: this is not gritty realism. This is a film where a man can use balloons to make his house fly to South America. Are we really going to loose it over a Star Wars homage that lasts less than five minutes? I feel this was more of a defense than a review and I apologize for not going over the gorgeous and vibrant animation, and the score. But I think this is one of Pixar's most powerful films and it deserves every ounce of praise it gets, no matter what the haters say.",10,1,3,1 July 2014
A Clockwork Orange," We are all victims of the modern age
","I have seen A Clockwork Orange almost twenty times and every time it remains astonishing viewing. Though there have been gorier films with more surface-level shocks, ACO is still a provocative film almost fifty years onward. It is still capable of actually making people angry about its violence and its ambivalence toward human nature. Some people still find it sickening; I cannot say I blame them. The gang rape scene alone is still scary (I had nightmares about it after first seeing the movie), even if you never see any penetration. It's isn't scary because it's graphic-- it's the gleeful, unwarranted cruelty of Alex Delarge which is unnerving, how the thought of tormenting innocents is enough to send him singing and dancing in-between kicks to an old man's chest. Even more unnerving are the character's charm and humor which render him likable despite his savagery and sadism.I think that's what is most disturbing about Clockwork-- not the violence, but the controversial statements on the duality of mankind. A rapist/murderer can be pitiable once he's rendered less than human by a government as power-hungry as he. A tenderhearted journalist can become a bloodthirsty monster who goes against his own ideals when faced with the man who violated his poor wife or when faced with an indifferent public he must 'push' into freedom by any means necessary! The world of A Clockwork Orange only seems like an outlandish future nightmare on the surface with the kitschy 70s fashions and the surreal angles with which Kubrick films his English locations. Really, once you examine it closely enough-- the struggle between being safe but controlled by the state or free but vulnerable to the evil of unbridled individualism of people like Alex and his droogs-- you realize this movie from 1971 remains frighteningly relevant in the 21st century.",10,1,2,26 March 2016
Where Eagles Dare," Excellent action film
","Where Eagles Dare (1968) is not the sort of film I usually watch, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. It was a great action film with epic set pieces and a script which remembers its audience has brains.Sure, there are a lot of explosions and gun fire, but unlike so many contemporary Hollywood films, WED has fleshed out characters and, gasp, a plot with plenty of twists to keep things interesting. It remembers the audience needs to be invested in a story in order for all the action to be more than empty spectacle. Yeah, I'm pretty sure there's more than a few anachronisms, but still, this is a fun adventure.",8,1,3,25 May 2014
How to Train Your Dragon," Dreamworks' best film to date
","Though it's only been four years since the release of How to Train Your Dragon (2010), I'll bet money it has a better chance of aging gracefully than most of Hollywood's animated output from the past fifteen years.Heartwarming and funny, the story is full of memorable characters, and themes about friendship and prejudice. Yes, the story itself is familiar, but the magic is in the interactions of the characters and their emotional journeys, not in the narrative itinerary. Also, unlike most of Dreamworks' current output, there is a delightful lack of pop culture references and bathroom jokes. The animation is beautiful and lush, from the characters themselves to the lighting and textures.This will likely be an animated classic. It certainly has more of a chance of being so than the serviceable but weakly written Frozen (2013).",9,1,1,30 May 2014
Don't Breathe," Don't Bother
","I only gave this movie a 6 instead of a 5 because the first half has some fine set-pieces, and the use of interiors is pretty solid and engaging. Otherwise, I was heavily disappointed by this one. If this is the best horror movie in twenty years as the critics so claim, then that means horror is in a worse place than I could have ever imagined. Mediocrity should not be considered exceptional.The biggest problem is that the main characters are just plain unlikable and the filmmakers clearly want us to root for them, particularly Rocky. However, I found her motivation far too shallow and flimsy, and her willingness to steal from a poor old blind man (before she knows about the rape dungeon in his basement) just so she and her kid sister can get to California to be, well, not justifiable given what she does know.This would not be a problem if DON'T BREATHE was content to be a sleazy, fast-paced shocker, but it wants our hearts too and I just could not get invested in these people. Either make this more morally ambiguous, or make both the thieves and the blind man awful. The film tries to have both and it just fails dramatically.By the end, the movie is just a shallow series of haunted-house bumps in the night and I just wanted it over. Yes, it's paced well, the cinematography is impressive, but when I don't care about a single thing happening onscreen, then what's the point?",6,9,12,1 April 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," Hardly worthy of the scorn still heaped on it
","Having only been a little girl in 1999, I was not aware of the sheer disdain heaped upon this film. Many of the people I know who were old enough to remember its release only wrinkled their noses when I expressed my interest in watching it. My film professor (who admittedly is not a Kubrick fan anyway) claimed it was too bizarre for him and that he barely knew anyone who even liked it. My mother (who has never even seen it) claimed the critics 'hated it at the time' and that 'the sex scenes are supposed to be boring and the plot looks stu-pid!' Many on IMDb have already expressed their boredom and estrangement. Nevertheless I went in with an open mind.Eyes Wide Shut (1999) is nothing but a masterpiece; maybe not the best of Kubrick's films, but a gem in his oeuvre nevertheless. If you are looking for smut or an erotic thriller, then this is not for you. Eyes Wide Shut is more interested in examining the link between sex, love, and fidelity than supplying smutty material in any form. The sex and nudity in particular are portrayed in the coldest, most clinical manner, so hardly any of it is arousing anyway. The whole films is uncomfortable yes; the hazy colors and moody score often lend it the feel of a strange, slow nightmare.Like A Clockwork Orange or 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film brings up big questions about the human condition and never supplies answers. I was not even sure if Bill and Alice's marriage would even survive for much longer by the end of the film. The ambiguity is just brilliant. It's the kind of movie that will have you discussing it for a long time afterward, long after lesser movies have been forgotten. By the time the credits were finished, I was left with a great sense of sadness because after this, we have no more Stanley Kubrick films to look forward to. What a tragedy for film lovers! Still I am grateful for the thirteen movies he did give us and this one is no exception.",9,1,2,22 April 2016
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," 'I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!'
","I liked the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie. It was fun and flashy, a good summer movie. However, Volume 2 is just marvelous, a blockbuster that does more than just entertain you for two hours; this movie is character-driven, even philosophical. It touches on themes of family, love, and altruism. Like Empire Strikes Back, it is a sequel which includes everything we loved about the first installment while also upping the emotional stakes and putting the heroes we've come to love through hell and back.A lot of summer movies come and go. You spend eight bucks, have fun for two hours, and then forget what you saw days afterward. But this movie gives you something more than a few one-liners and cool fight scenes: it's emotionally engaging. I'm more excited than ever to see what the filmmakers bring to the table in the next movie!",8,5,9,14 May 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," One of the weaker Potter films
","Though I enjoy the novels, the Harry Potter film adaptations have always been hit and miss affairs for me. Outside of about two of them, most of the entries in the movie franchise are either charmless and bland or stylish but incomprehensible to people who have not read the books. Sorcerer's Stone is in the former category.Chris Columbus' 'whimsical' direction is lifeless. The overly lit visuals are boring and the whole thing just feels like an exposition dump. The child actors give stiff performances (not coming into their own until about the third installment). The adults are a touch better but cannot do much with the awkward book to screen treatment. The only excellent aspect of the film is John Williams' score, which evokes the wonder, mystery, and warmth of the original book more than the actual movie does.",6,0,1,29 October 2013
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Rushed and ridiculous
","I am not a big fan of the HP film adaptations. My problem is not so much that they cut a lot of material from the books or that they change things, it's that they fall into two categories: either they're slow-moving and preoccupied with every little detail from the books to the point of tedium (the first two films) or they go through the story so fast that those who have not read the books have no clue what is what and what is going on. Goblet of Fire falls into the latter category. It rushes over so much of the book, explains big concepts at mach speed, and refuses to spend time on character moments to help us connect to the heroes better.It's also totally over-the-top, almost impossible to take seriously. I know many who adore Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, but for me, he goes so overboard that he comes across as goofy. In the books, Voldemort is mostly soft-spoken, quietly menacing. Here, he has all the subtlety of a mustachioed villain out of second-rate Victorian melodrama. Michael Gambon's Dumbledore has silly moments too, like when he near throttles Harry, screaming, 'Didjya put your name in the Goblet of Fire!!?' So out of character... Then the chase with the dragon was ridiculous, obviously there to show off the CG effects, which have not dated that well. And don't get me started on the scene where the Durmstrang students start doing acrobatics in the Great Hall. The fellow doing the effects on that gem of a scene must have had a field day with the blur tool, which just makes it cheesier.At least Daniel Radcliffe's acting improved in this film; even his weakest moments are not as laughable as the 'HE WAS THEIR FRIEND' bit in The Prisoner of Azkaban. The music was melancholy and dark, as it should be. GoF is the turning point of the series, where the HP stories become less child-friendly and more of a Young Adult series dealing with social oppression, death, and loss.Overall, this is not a strong movie, even on its own terms. It's too rushed and silly to be comprehensible or taken seriously.",6,0,0,6 June 2014
Castle in the Sky," A great kickoff for Studio Ghibli
","The story and characters of Castle in the Sky (1986) are not wholly original: Miyazaki had already told a story of a plucky boy and a girl with mysterious power against a corrupt villain out to resurrect ancient, apocalyptic technology in his TV series, Future Boy Conan (1978). However, both the world and the characters of CitS are more fleshed out than their TV counterparts.The world-building is phenomenal, a fantastical 19th century world of giant airships and floating islands. It would not surprise me if this film has inspired many a steampunk novel or movie.The animation and backgrounds are superb. The music is equally haunting and whimsical. The characters are so likable, the themes of technology and corruption still relevant. The film is fun and full of action, but there are also meditative moments and poignancy.Overall, Studio Ghibli could not have gotten a better start than with this charming fantasy-adventure.",10,1,1,27 July 2014
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Better than Sorcerer's Stone
","Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) suffers from many of the same flaws as the first movie: it's trying so hard to be faithful to every detail that it slows down the pacing, the child actors are awkward and stiff, and the direction is overall uninspired.However, this is undoubtedly more watchable than Sorcerer's Stone. For one thing, it has more atmosphere. Like the novel, it's Gothic and mysterious. Details such as the echo of the basilisk slithering throughout the castle, the ominous Chamber of Secrets, and the enigmatic depiction of Tom Riddle are all well-realized. The climactic battle between Harry and the basilisk still gives me chills after all this time.Luckily, Chris Columbus was outed once the producers got to the next film. They put in an accomplished director, Alfonso Cuaron, and the movie franchise was all the better for it.",7,0,2,12 July 2014
Hercules," A watered down Aladdin set in ancient Greece
","No, it's not accurate to the original Greek myth of Heracles, but that isn't what keeps this film from being much good.Hercules (1997) is a part of the second half of the oft-praised Disney Renaissance, a second golden age which ran from the release of The Little Mermaid in 1989 roughly until the release of Tarzan in 1999. Fans usually split this period into two parts: we have the Big Four from 1989 to 1994 (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King), called such because they not only innovated and revitalized Disney animation after the roughly two decade dark age following Walt Disney's death in 1966, but they were also major hits at the box office. The second half starts with the artistic misfire that was Pocahontas, a visually stunning but soulless film obviously made with the Academy Awards in mind. It was at this point that the 'renaissance formula' began to become more obvious and stale. Yes, a few of the films were good (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Mulan), but most were bland and safe wastes of time.Hercules is as safe as these films got. I think only Fantasia 2000 (1999) was more of a disappointment in taking chances. The main character, his 'I Want' song, and the supporting characters are all dull. The color scheme is wretched, just a potpourri of clashing neon colors competing for your attention. The whole movie feels like a less entertaining version of Aladdin (1992) honestly. The only redeeming elements are the hilarious villain Hades and the love interest Meg's song, 'I Won't Say I'm in Love.'I'm glad others find merit in it, but for me, it's only a mildly pleasant mess.",6,10,23,15 May 2014
Joker," Still thinking about it a month later
","While part of me is annoyed that a gritty, socially-concerned drama like this only made over a billion dollars because of its superhero connections (seriously, without the Batman connection, I doubt at least 3/4 of the audience would have bothered to show up), I was still impressed with JOKER. It's stylish and atmospheric, both bleakly comedic and heartbreaking. Joaquin Phoenix does outstanding work representing his character's plummet into bitterness and insanity-- I cannot wait to watch the movie again, just to catch more nuances in his performance.",8,2,3,13 November 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Over-the-top but fun
","I don't think anyone's ever made an accurate adaptation of Bram Stoker's vampire novel, though this one comes close. Honestly, this Dracula (1992) feels more like a remake of the basic story of The Mummy (1932) in that the villain is a centuries old undead creature who has damned his own soul once he loses the woman he loves, and his main goal is to reunite and possess her reincarnation in the modern world.The film is hindered by poor supporting performances and downright silly moments. Keanu Reeves is shockingly bad as Johnathan Harker, making the oft-criticized David Manners in the 1931 version look like Laurence Olivier in comparison. Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, and Sadie Frost have their share of both serviceable and cringe-worthy moments.I found the lack of subtlety in the handling of the story's themes of sexuality to be laughable. For example, I know Lucy's supposed to be more openly sexual and man-hungry, but when she started spitting out those ridiculous double entendres that only a sixth grader would giggle at, I could not help but think it was a little overboard.The film is saved from total mediocrity by the spooky atmosphere, its haunting and romantic musical score, and most of all, through Gary Oldman's performance as Dracula. He's not the evil creature from the novel, but he does succeed in being simultaneously threatening and sympathetic, no easy task.Once again, don't expect a perfect recreation of the novel, but it is an entertaining, if flawed, vampire film. I'd certainly watch it over the 1931 Browning version, and this is coming from someone who loves 1930s horror.",8,1,3,20 May 2014
Dark Shadows," Bad script saved by fleeting moments
","I feel even a six rating might be too high for what is essentially an uninspired, not that clever comedy. However, I was never bored and some of the jokes did make me laugh (often in spite of myself), so I cannot claim it's flaming trash.The big problem is the script. It lacks focus. The opening is heavy on exposition and low on establishing characters-- and by establishing characters, I mean presenting Barnabas Collins as anything other than a poor sap subject to the cruelties of the plot. The love subplot is so underdeveloped that the filmmakers could have cut it with no problem. The family bonds are given lip service rather than exhibited through character action, dialogue, or ANYTHING.Can't really recommend it, yet it's not as rank as its reputation would suggest. Some of the jokes are funny and you can tell Depp is trying to do something with the material here.",6,0,1,3 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Better than the first two, but equally as soulless and bad
","We can all agree that out of the Star Wars prequels, Revenge of the Sith (2005) was the best. That's kind of like agreeing being quickly decapitated is better than the hours-long ordeal of crucifixion.Revenge of the Sith may have more going on than the first two, but it still shares the core problems which plague the prequel films: the acting is nonexistent, the pacing is bad, and the filmmakers used overblown fight scenes and special effects to compensate for lack of emotional involvement. (It's funny how the filmmakers put so much thought into those overlong light saber battles, but they can't even make Natalie Portman look like a convincing pregnant woman!)The beloved opening shot is overrated. You cannot tell one ship from another, nor can you really understand what's going on or which side is winning. It gets worse when actual flesh-and-blood actors enter the scene, since no one has gotten any better at portraying characters with any soul. Anakin's reaction to slaying Count Dooku is laughable; instead of reacting with horror, Christensen utilizes his customary monotone: 'Oh. I shouldn't have done that...' Like he cut a pizza wrong or something similarly trivial.Speaking of the central figure of the prequels, Anakin comes off as a total nimrod who is easily manipulated rather than the tragic figure he is supposed to be. His conversion to the dark side does not come off as a seduction; it's more of a trick by Palpatine. Really, there was little reason for him to become evil. In fact, all the characters come off as major dolts and do not seem to possess a shred of humanity.What makes me angriest about this film is that pandering final shot of Beru, Owen, and newborn Luke staring at Tatooine's binary moons. These films are so bad that I cannot accept them as having any connection to the original trilogy, which while not perfect, had heart and imagination to spare. I've honest-to-God-above read better fan fiction than this and you know how terrible that can be.I will give credit where it's due and say there is one moment in this film which impresses me. It's a short sequence where we cut between anxiety-stricken Padme and Anakin staring out windows, pensive as they sadly look into a sunset. A single tear falls down Anakin's face and that small gesture had more humanity in it than the comical 'NOOOO!' he utters after finding out Padme has died in childbirth. It gives one a glimpse of what could have been a moving story about a flawed man whose lust for control and power gets the better of him.Man, even the misfire that was Return of the Jedi was a more satisfying conclusion than this 'darker' story. The events before the older films were better left to our imaginations, because even a child could come up with a more satisfying back story than what we were ultimately given.",6,3,7,6 August 2014
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Still fair
","For all its historical importance, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) is not treated well by most Disney fans. It is tolerated, but not respected or loved. Common complaints fall upon the heroine being too passive, the music being too dated, too much padding, etc. No film is perfect, even great films, but my God, people are too harsh on this one.No other Disney film possesses the innocence of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. It has a freshness, an excitement to it. It's as though you could feel the animators' joy in every frame. There is no hip irony or cynicism on display, no need to be subversive or cool. The whole thing is a fairy tale played straight and with tons of heart. It isn't hard to see why weary Depression audiences so readily took it to their hearts and declared it 'the happiest thing since Armistice'.Snow White is not complex or super interesting as a character, but she has more of a personality than she is given credit for. She is also tougher than you'd think: she's a young teenage girl from an abusive home, yet she still believes she should keep a positive view of life and tries her best to stay optimistic through all her troubles. That's admirable. As for her warbling soprano, many will not favor it and yes, it is dated. However, don't be too harsh there. After all, I doubt the modern pop hit 'Let It Go' in Frozen (2013) will gracefully age either.Of course, the dwarfs are all lovable and entertaining. The Queen/Witch is chilling, one of the finest Disney villains. The Prince... well, he's rather dull. Honestly, I don't get the criticism of Snow's supposed lack of personality; she has it all over her prince.The animation is still beautiful, even if there are a few awkward moments due to rotorscoping and experimentation. The muted color scheme is lovely, a great contrast to the exhausting bright colors which saturate modern animation (I mainly think of the garish Hercules (1997) or The Lorax (2012)). The backgrounds give one the impression of a children's storybook come to life.Overall, this is a great film and we are still feeling its influence (for better or worse, since American animation is rarely allowed to leave the Snow White model). Without a doubt, it deserves more respect from modern audiences.",10,6,6,5 March 2014
Parasite," Crossing the line
","PARASITE is that rare movie that works for both cinephiles and an audience seeking nothing more than an entertaining two hours. For me, this is the best sort of movie, giving the audience both food for thought and a great time. Twisty, intelligent, and often laugh-out-loud funny, PARASITE is a movie that mixes and matches every genre from comedy to horror. It's beautifully shot and acted, definitely one of the best films to come out of 2019. Though it deals with South Korean society, its themes regarding the widening socioeconomic gap and the class-based prejudices which linger in our modern world are universal.",10,0,0,5 May 2020
The Emperor's New Groove," One of Disney's trinity of cult animated movies
","Along with 1985's The Black Cauldron and 2001's Atlantis: The Lost Empire, The Emperor's New Groove (2000) is the closest thing Disney has ever come to making a cult movie. It is unlike any other film they've ever made: it's an outright comedy. Their Aladdin was as well; however, unlike Aladdin, TENG is wackier, faster, and features a hero who is borderline unlikable in his vanity and selfishness. The style is angular and bold, a bit of a departure from the usually rounded Disney style, one that would be brought to its greatest extreme in Disney's Atlantis.In tone, the movie feels a lot like a classic Looney Tunes short, but it does not forget the heart so common to Disney's work. It gets much better every time I rewatch it; it is one of those rare movies where I know the dialogue by heart. I think about anyone in my generation can quote it. If you haven't seen it, then you're in for a good time!",9,1,2,2 May 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," The comedy is excellent; the drama less so
","Yes, this film is a highly fictionalized account of what went on behind-the-scenes of the making of Mary Poppins (1964), but on its own terms, it is a delightful, witty comedy. Well, most of the time anyway.The 1960s atmosphere is well-portrayed and all of the acting is above average. Emma Thompson in particular does a brilliant job. I especially loved B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers. Their facial expressions and interaction with Thompson were hilarious, really the highlight of the movie for me.The film's main issue is not the way it improves P.L. Travers' opinion of the finished film (in real life, she loathed the 1964 adaptation until her last breath), but the way the pacing is shot down every time we fade into the flashbacks of Travers' traumatic childhood. While they do help give us a clearer image of the woman and why she turned out to be so joyless and cold, they stop the film dead every time they appear. I feel her back story could have been incorporated into the film in a much more natural manner, perhaps through some dialogue or just less flashbacks.Overall, not a bad film. It's amusing and touching, but nothing that will be considered a great classic decades from now.",7,2,4,6 April 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Has character and a sense of fun, but needs its own voice
","The amount of one star reviews on here are baffling, though not surprising. Of course, this film was never going to live up to everyone's impossible standards and ridiculous expectations, especially considering that not everyone was pleased with Disney buying out Star Wars or J.J. Abrams's involvement to begin with; however, what we got was a marvelously entertaining and emotional, if a little too safe, film.The plot does appropriate a lot from the original 1977 Star Wars: a droid carries plans that the good and bad guys want, the heroine is a dreamer on a crummy desert planet, the main villain is a fallen Jedi in a cloak and mask, and there is another huge doomsday device which must be taken out of commission in a space battle. I admit it disappointed me a little, all this familiarity, especially the resurrection of the Death Star concept, which was terrible back in 1983, let alone in 2015. The moment when the Resistance explains that THIS Death Star is planet rather than moon sized, I groaned aloud in the theater. The movie needed to make its own iconic moments instead of appropriating images and lines from the older films.Aside from a sometimes too fast pace (I really do miss the slower pacing of the original, which gave us forty minutes to set up its universe and main character, though I suppose that is not fashionable these days), this blatant fan servicing is really the film's biggest problem, lingering on nostalgia imagery for much too long; however, is this enough reason to claim the film sucks and should only have one star? Of course not, for the film's greatest strengths are its sense of fun, chemistry between actors, and mythic resonances. The new heroes, Finn, Rey, and Poe, are all likable and flawed, given much more depth than even the Golden Trio in Episode IV were allowed back in 1977. When Harrison Ford isn't on screen, John Boyega and Daisy Ridley steal the show as Finn and Rey, earnest and vulnerable, plus sharing palpable romantic chemistry. Basically, they're the sort of heroes you love watching and cannot wait to watch more of in the next two movies. I was also relieved that Harrison Ford didn't phone his performance in and that he and Carrie Fisher still had a great deal of chemistry.If there's anything weak with the story, then it's the villains. While Kylo Ren gets more depth and interest as the film goes on, lifting him up from being another uninspired Darth Vader stand-in, the 'Big Bad' Snoke is not so interesting. I know no one would ever be able to be as memorable as Emperor Palpatine, who was both threatening and gleefully wicked, but Snoke is just dull, as dull as any ominous, humorless villain in modern Hollywood cinema. There's an overabundance of action scenes as well, but at least writers Abrams and Kasdan allow for character moments in between them. Plus there is genuine tension in them and the light saber fights are emotional and natural-looking again, thank the Lord above.Overall, the movie does have a little too much fan service, but it is a loving and entertaining flick, with humor that arises from character and not flatulence or blatant theft from masters like Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd, romance that is sweet and understated, and action that never forgets it isn't worth a thing unless we care about the people involved in the chases and big battles. Here's hoping the next film will continue to focus on character and swashbuckling, while also finding its own voice.",5,3,15,20 December 2015
Cinderella," The weakest of the Walt-era princess films
","Cinderella (1950) was my favorite movie as a child. I would re-enact scenes as I watched it, dressed up like the titular character, and almost wore the VHS out. Watching it as an adult, I still get warm feelings of nostalgia; however, it is certainly the most bland of the Walt-era princess films.Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Sleeping Beauty (1959) are both more ambitious and visually interesting. Cinderella was made at a time when the studio was (not for the first nor last time) on the verge of bankruptcy and they were starving for a hit film. As a result, Cinderella was made in the Snow White model and feels much safer. The songs are memorable and the characters are fine, though not terribly interesting. Unlike many, I find the mice grating comic relief. Fortunately, they are balanced out by the cold-hearted stepmother, among the greatest Disney villains.In conclusion, an entertaining film, but not entirely deserving of the amount of celebration it receives.",8,2,3,15 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Cinematic mythology
","As it is inevitably with all movies, Star Wars (1977) has dated. But how could anyone think that the passing of the years has made it any less fun to watch?Sure, it can be cheesy and the acting is not always top-notch. The effects may not dazzle as they once did (though the 1970s miniatures and puppets have held up much better than the wretched 90s CG added in the infamous special editions).But there is a giddy energy to the whole thing, the way it takes old myths and archetypes and breathes new life into them, the way it evokes 1930s science-fiction serials that makes it so unique.Though SW helped usher in an era of endless blockbusters, few of its successors have managed to be as fun or iconic. And even fewer have held up as well.",10,0,1,27 July 2014
Ran," Everyone has their reasons - Kurosawa revisits Shakespeare
","It is not uncommon for an artist's output to wane a little in age. Not so with Akira Kurosawa. Even in his late period, his work continued to be inspired and masterful. Ran (1985) is the most regarded of these late works, a ravishingly beautiful and yet bleak adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear.The Noh-influenced performances and choice to transpose Willy Shakes to 16th century Japan recall Kurosawa's earlier Throne of Blood (1958), which told the story of Macbeth; however, this film is far more downbeat. In Throne of Blood, the tyrant-protagonist is taken down by the people. Though the cycle of violence will go on as long as greed and ambition live within mankind, there is hope that they will always be taken down. But here? Ran is so much more tragic in its view of people and the human condition.As Renoir once said, everyone has their reasons. Here, there really aren't any white or black hats. The treacherous Lady Kaede is a victim of Lord Hideotara, who had killed her entire family. The tragic Hideotora has killed many innocents in his quest for power, yet we still pity his fate and ultimate inability to live peacefully with his sons in his advanced years.From the boar hunt in the beginning to the film's haunting closing image of the blind man on the edge of a cliff, Ran is a nearly three hour movie that doesn't feel its length for a moment. It is perhaps Kurosawa's final bonafide masterpiece, but that is arguable. It's much harder to argue this one is anything less than great.",10,1,3,7 February 2016
Tarzan," A film still in my heart
","I find films that mark the end of an era quite interesting. Such categorization largely applies to TARZAN, often considered the penultimate entry of the Disney Renaissance. TARZAN is among the more dramatic movies of this period, along with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST or MULAN, though it has unobtrusive comedy as well. Like many of the Renaissance films, it features a protagonist who yearns for something more out of their life. Like many Renaissance films, the visuals are gorgeous.Undoubtedly, it is a beautiful film: the backgrounds and character animation are jaw-dropping in how gorgeous they are. When I was rewatching TARZAN the other day, my heart ached for the days of traditional animation at Disney. CG animation can be very lovely, but it's hard to imagine these visuals having comparable impact. I love the character designs here, particularly Jane: her face is not the traditional Disney Princess look. She looks very unique.However, TARZAN is not only the end of an era, but a liminal film, suggesting the strange (sometimes great, sometimes not) movies which were to come out of Disney in the early 2000s. The Phil Collins music, easily the most divisive aspect of this film, replaces the Broadway style musical numbers of the previous Renaissance films, and this sort of musical accompaniment style would be used in several of the films to come such as LILO AND STITCH (where Elvis music accompanies montages), BROTHER BEAR, and TREASURE PLANET. Overall, I like the music-- I think the music fits the story well and they're catchy.TARZAN is not the best of the Renaissance films, but it is damn good and I enjoy rewatching it every few years. I actually remembered a great deal of shots and dialogue too-- I must have watched it more times as a kid than I remembered. It strikes me as a beautiful movie from the twilight of one of Disney's golden ages and it's weathered the years well.",8,0,0,3 July 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter
","Why is The Empire Strikes Back (1980) such a beloved movie? Star Wars (1977) is more fun, but Empire marks the point where the story gained more emotional depth and the matinÃ©e serial black-and-white morality of the original becomes less defined.Howard Hawks once said a great movie has a few great scenes and no bad ones. If that is the case, then Empire is without doubt a great film, as one cannot find a bad scene in the bunch. As for great scenes, just take your pick: the battle on Hoth, Luke's training in Dagobah, the X-wing rising from the swampy muck, Lando's reluctant betrayal, Han and Leia's poignant farewell in the carbon chamber.Undoubtedly, the most iconic moment in this film is the climactic confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader, when our hero discovers his much-idealized father is a fallen Jedi who has lost much of his conscience and humanity. Though Luke's reaction to this reveal is often mocked and even I cannot help but chuckle sometimes, I think it's entirely appropriate. Hamill's big 'noooo' is not forced or phony; the way his face contorts and his voice cracks makes it feel raw and heartbreaking.This is one of few films that gets better every time you watch it. It also makes me keenly aware how the series declined in quality afterward (Return of the Jedi is okay, but it feels a bit too derivative of the first and a bit too juvenile for an epic conclusion). Out of all the SW films, this one is the closest to perfection.",10,3,5,7 August 2014
Aladdin," A great comedy
","Aladdin (1992) is one of the finest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Not only is it brightly colored, well-animated eye candy, but it's a fun ride, a comic interlude of sorts in-between the grand romance that was Beauty and the Beast (1991) and the epic The Lion King (1994).Some of the pop culture-based gags have dated, but luckily, this classification of joke does not dominate the film. The humor is well-paced and timed, and no matter how many times you see this film, they never grow stale. The voice-acting is top notch and the songs are all memorable, magnificent, and at times, touching.After The Emperor's New Groove (2000), I would say this is the funniest Disney film of them all, certainly among the best of the Disney Renaissance of 1989-1999.",8,1,2,12 July 2014
Pocahontas," Disney Oscar bait
","Pocahontas (1995) is popularly regarded as the film which led to the death of the Disney Renaissance. While I am of the opinion that this period reached its peak with Beauty and the Beast (1991), I do agree that this misfire marked the beginning of the end of Disney's second golden age.While the animation and color palette are gorgeous, and the musical numbers are classic, the character design is overall unexpressive. The story is recycled and dull, and the characters are all one-dimensional. Pocahontas and John Smith may be the most uninspired lovers in the Disney canon, generating little chemistry.Then there's the historical inaccuracy. The real Pocahontas' life was nothing at all like what is depicted here and I feel it was insensitive of Disney to turn such a painful and bloody part of history into an animated fairy tale for the family crowd. Altering an adult novel like The Hunchback of Notre Dame is no big deal, in my view, but whitewashing over history is much more problematic.Of course, this movie is also pretentious, trying to be so much more epic and important than it is, trying its best to top the maturity of Beauty and the Beast and nab another Best Picture nomination. It failed miserably and only started the beginning of the end for one of Disney's most triumphant decades.",5,0,1,10 October 2014
The Great Gatsby," Not great but still pretty good
","I have come to terms with the fact that we will likely never see a perfect film adaptation of The Great Gatsby. It may not be as unfilmable as, say, The Catcher in the Rye, but it's still a difficult one to pull off. Baz Luhrmann does a good job with his reimagining of the source material, staying faithful to the letter of the novel while taking away some of its thematic depth.The visuals are fantastic: it really brings the fast-paced, excessive world of the book to life. The costumes are gorgeous as well. The music did nothing for me, but then again I don't like rap or most modern music anyway, so I won't hold that against the film. The performances are mostly adequate, the only standouts being Leonardo DiCaprio as the title character and Elizabeth Debicki as the woefully underused Jordan Baker. DiCaprio is marvelous in the lead; I usually find him merely passable as an actor but here he really shines and brings a lot of passion to the role. Debicki is sexy and cold as Jordan, and it makes me so sad that she isn't given more screen time.This adaptation focuses on the relationship between Gatsby and Daisy a little too much. They make TGG out to be a love story, when the main point in the book was that Daisy was a shallow woman not worth the effort Gatsby is making to obtain her heart. The many themes concerning the death of the American Dream and the moral decay of the 1920s are not elaborated upon, but I suppose that is to be expected.So is this worth your time? I would say so. It's visually gorgeous and what is left of the story is still effective. And it may be controversial to say this, but this is miles ahead of the dull 1974 version.",8,0,2,21 May 2013
The Birds," A brilliant technical exercise, but not that compelling a story
","I consider THE BIRDS to be the start of Hitchcock's late career slump. All his post-PSYCHO films just seem to lack the same amount of passion and intrigue of his earlier work. THE BIRDS is by far the best of the bunch I have seen (I've yet to see TOPAZ or FAMILY PLOT), but for all its brilliant thriller set-pieces and occasions of striking horror imagery, it always leaves me cold. I just don't care about the characters, who tend to strike me as annoying or underdeveloped compared to Hitchcock's classics. The effects show their age too, making the bird attacks seem a bit silly at times. However, the ending is wonderful, about as apocalyptic as Hitchcock ever got.",7,1,1,8 May 2020
