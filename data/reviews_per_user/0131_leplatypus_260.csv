The Devil's Advocate," The Writer's advocate (dvd)
","With nearly 500 reviews behind me now, i have a good view of how Hollywood deals with book adaptation: it just picks the resume of the cover and rewrite all the content. As I have just finished the Neiderman's book, my opinion is still verified today: The movie doesn't tell the same story than the book. The book was great showing the motive of a criminal lawyer (it's not about guiltiness but winning a case with law) and moving from country life to NYC. On the other hand, the book was weak with the devil, or at least, it lurks in the background. In the movie, those points have been switched: the supernatural is everywhere and the criminal law is forgotten: in fact, the 'movie' Kevin is a fusion of the 'book' Kevin and another advocate (the one whose wife goes crazy). What's funny is that both book and movie are unintelligible with the devil's desire to have babies and above all, the role of devil: His mission is to make us do what is forbidden or not do what is ordered. Nothing in the book or in the movie illustrates this: the devil is just depicted as a seducer, a hedonist and a godfather that protects his family. At last, the movie is good on its visual nature: it has good shots of NYC and has a fine cast: Theron is believable as she gets from white to black, Al is playful because I think he is a epicurean in his life too and Reeves is totally convincing especially his last scene of husband. In conclusion, i think that an adaptation should adapt what's written and not rewrite.",4,1,5,12 February 2012
The Blair Witch Project," an unbelievable word of mouth (screen)
","This movie is actually a stroke of genius.I heard it from my brother who had a friend who was terrified by it!At this time, i was in Strasbourg studying Human Rights and befriended a greek student. I was excited by this kind of experience and for a date, i propose her to go watch it together and i sold it to her with the same argument: ' i heard it's really frightening !'.Honestly i don't remember to have been scared maybe because i already known the context but my friend liked it so i suppose it's OK!",7,0,1,18 March 2020
The Avengers," Average assemble (tv)
","Sure, the special effects are amazing: if you remember the 'FF' movies that are just a decade old, they appear now totally outmoded. If you compare with the 'Transformers' that are more recent, sure, the movie is better visualized: it isn't a change of shoot each second, it's more focused about the characters and less on pure crazy action thus you can follow what happens. Sure, the casting is experimented and it was cool to see that Johnny Storm has become Steve Rogers as the actor was really cool in the aforementioned 'FF' movies. Sure, it has some good lines (about Legolas), a real understanding of those icons (example: Hulk trying to move Thor's hammer), original new mysteries (who are the shadow people?). Sure, it adapts one of the best comics stories (the super hero who turns bad and destroys a Shielb base was Millar's 'enemy of the state'). And all this for only '4' ?Yes, because the first hour is totally boring: i have even slept in this black night. Also, because the screenwriter of super heroes lacks the talent of the comics writer. Stan the man who invented the Avengers could tell the same story in 22 pages: it was fast, easy to understand: Here, the plot is unintelligible, uses and abuses of scientific concepts and stupid name (tesserac?). Also, because i have the feeling to have missed a movie (what about the story about Black Widow and Hawkeye?). Also because the alien invasion is just destroy for destroy so the last hour is an astounding but hollow action scene. In conclusion, it's finally better than 'Daredevil' but faraway of the classic Raimi's Spiderman!",4,3,7,12 January 2014
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," National indoctrination and the book of propaganda (dad)
","This franchise is a rip-off clone of 'Indiana Jones' and Dan Brown's mysteries but void of any soul or spiritual philosophy and plagued by materialist American civilization: babe, Ferrari, money and even Potus now.Uncle Disney isn't the cousin artist of Spielberg and Lucas but the good son of America: A good faith is a gold chase and its priest is Potus. This aren't the kind of values i would like to give my children. The only good thing here is the cast: Cage is always a sincere actor (in spite of his bad choices of scripts) and Kruger is an attractive and dynamic woman. However, Voight is always boring and inept at playing and I conclude that Angelina draws rather from her mother! I don't even talk about Potus unless to say it's a fiction and Potus place is out there! Unlike Indy, Gates seeks his treasure in iconic (and not exotic) places like Congress, White house or Buckingham, which is totally unbelievable but has the merit to get us a tour in those places.In conclusion, it's a faithful sequel of the first nationalist movie with all the crap becoming worse!",4,0,0,24 May 2012
Angels & Demons," Faithful but sometimes unbelievable!
","Still haven't read a single Dan Brown book, but I watched all his movies adaptations. I won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same: actually, this one is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles.The plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I never been a great fan of Hanks but he delivers well. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one spilled with blood) because I search for one like this in vain! The Italian searcher is a brilliant newcomer for me but I really applauded Ewan MacGregor portrayal: his inner faith and calm is really impressive.I really like the debate between science and religion. The action taking place in the Vatican, it felt like vacation. At last, I am not sure it helps to add new converts into Christianism. With all the gold and man presence displayed, any one would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed of the church life whereas they stand for half or more the believers.",7,4,7,21 June 2009
Black Swan," This swan sings all my dislikes (tv)
","From my subjective point of view, this is an awful movie because it accomplishes the unusual feat to reunite a lot of things that I can't stand: * dance: I have never connected with this art. The only emotion a ballet gives me is boredom and also repulsion as the body as shown in the movie suffers too much. * psychotic character: I don't like this kind of story because I just don't like losing control for real or with a surrogate screen. * authoritative parents: mine are like that so it's already enough! * stupid attitude to have fun: I have never understand why booze, drugs and sex are considered as the ultimate experience as they are either dangerous or premature. * porn action in mainstream movies: I agree with Nathalie's father being upset at her lesbian scene. The problem isn't that this scene is gratuitous because it was due to happen in regards to the story but it's too much graphic. In other words, I can't tell the difference between how this scene has been directed and a simple porn movie: we have the same kisses, the same moans, the same lickings,  * modern art: here, black and white are everywhere. It's bleak, sad, depressing.In conclusion, if Natalie was a marvelous pick for a fragile, hardworking and sincere young woman who aspire to realize herself, watching her suffering is just not my definition of a good time.",4,3,4,31 January 2015
Changeling," I should have changed the movie ! (Screen)
","The last time I went out to movies with my friend was 10 months ago. As it isn't often, we have to choose a damned good movie!When I first heard about this one, I thought i had discoverded this pearl: I had been deeply moved by 'Iwo Jima' Angelina ranks among my top list of actress! In addition, it was about a courageous single mother like my friend! That's why I said to my friend 'You are gonna like it! She is like you!' Well, I should have read the story better: the mother losts her child, is given a 'false' one, is sent to asylum and finally discovers that her child has been the victim of a madman! Thus, I didn't really pay attention to the movie, except all the intense scenes that got me further down! And there are a lot Eastwood don't close his eyes or miss a thing! Finally, my friend says it was a good movie but sad, and we promised to see a comedy next time!",1,9,56,29 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Exactly like the tour! Unfortunately, it's a movie! (Screen)
","As I went recently to Disneyland with my nephews, we took the tour and this movie is the same: dark, misty, with filthy pirates, great for the eyes but lacking of a story.This was actually my first Pirates movie i saw (and the last, i think) and was taken aback at the start with the characters. They seem to know each other but nothing is explained.The coming of Penelope is a waste because she does nothing here except walking. If she was so pregnant, why cast her? The story of the youth fountain is a rip-off from the 'Last Crusade'.The character of Deep doesn't make me laugh. The only funny moment was with the swinging ship and it's not enough.I even slept between the escape from London and the attack of the mermaid: what's the fun of being in the hold of a ship by night? At last, Hook has better taste and as it's another Spielberg reference, you can understand the difference of levels and vision between the two. I chose Steven and those damn pirates have indeed robbed me of my money!",1,5,10,25 June 2011
Scarface," The aggressive side of snow white (DVD)
","At last, I saw it. This movie is one of the most talked of Paccino's movies but so far, it was just reviews for me. Now, I can understand why it remains a reference in the 80's movies.I was very surprised by its violence. Even for today, the bathroom scene is really vivid and all the subsequent killings are violent. Then, Paccino's character is unusual because he is totally driven (or nuts or stoned as you wish). He knows what he wants (liberty, power, money, woman) and he goes on even if it leads him to big troubles. At first, I was a bit shocked by all his macho attitude but under the skin, you can still find the good old Al. His scenes with Pfeiffer are great and he really know how to win a woman with his smile. It was also funny to see actually big names 20 years younger and I dare everyone to recognize 'young maid Marian' as she really look like terribly different. I would conclude that this movie could really be viewed as a prequel for 'Carlito's Way'. I like the similar Hawaiian beach poster, but the latter is really a masterpiece because all the team have mastered their skills with the time.",4,0,2,2 January 2010
Frost_Nixon," And the winner is ... (Screen)
","With 3 free tickets to use before 12 April, i had to go to movies for 3 consecutive evenings. My first choice was this movie. Why ?1 - Because Nixon left the White house just 2 days before my brother and I were born. So i was intrigued to capture the mood of this special time. For those who are interested, our parents don't recall something in particular: our mother was in hospital since 1 week and our father has memories of this event but don't remember the timing with our births!2 – because I never clearly understood what the Watergate really was! I know there were burglars, but can't link it with the missing tapes or Nixon. I should see my classics ('Nixon', 'All the President's Man') instead!3 – because if JFK has become a respected icon, Nixon is depicted for many as the evil himself. So, hearing the real man would be interesting, even thought i can't really say if the debate is 100% accurate.This movie doesn't wash my enthusiasm.It caught my attention from the beginning up to the final credits. The 70s are well portrayed with bright colors. The debate is edited as a sport event, especially a boxing match. I didn't know so far the actor playing the host but he is really talented. I really like how he took strong punches by Nixon while he is a bit carefree and how he start to bite too as he becomes studious. But finally, i am really amazed how America can speak freely about politics and makes movies on that topic while my country is shy or more exactly less tolerant. Like everyone else, everyday, we hear about the political class, on TV, radio, newspapers but french producers don't want to tell their 'real' story in movies. We never complain about them, never tells a critic. I really wonder where is the real democracy thus?",4,0,11,16 April 2009
Alien 3," Fed up (tv)
","I thought Space was unlimited but those aliens keep worrying Ripley! Honestly, reaching the 3rd round of such a fight, there is nothing new to enjoy, no more to say and it's just squeezing the money pulp to the last drop! It's a bit like making a movie about someone who breaks a leg: do you really believe in an 3rd exact accident in a row? This is exactly the big nonsense this movie tries to make us believe! So we got exactly the same ingredients than the other movies (as usual, the alien munches all of them, one by one) and if it would not be enough, the added ingredients are awful: the special effects are pretty bad, the idea of monks-prisoners who are free but in captivity is stupid and full of contradictions! The plot is poorly told as the DVD screens are much explicit and clear than the edited movie! And finally, I'm just very tired of those female heroes who kills, punches, shoots like soldiers! I'm even more tired of that rusty, decaying, bleak future and all those big climax finale in factories (T2, Freddy, LW, etc).",4,1,3,1 January 2017
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Only Holmes could have understood a story such convoluted (web)
","In short, everything was good ... except the story, which is a bit annoying for a character that lives for that. In other words, the cast was good (a unusual time when Law is watchable), the production has stunning visual as we take a European tour in XiXth , and Zimmer's score was perfect but all those efforts fail to produce something really captivating. Unlike SH1, this sequel has a very dull and long beginning and really no direction: it's a succession of events not really tied together. For a genius detective, Holmes appears finally like a sort of Robocop, always programming fights with tugs and not really solving cases. However it was funny to see that like the video game, Holmes used red lines to have deduction. Then, it's an endless babbling interlude about Watson's wedding and an useless train fight! The Parisian adventure is plagued by absurdity as the bad Moriarty (that lacks the charisma of Marc Strong in SH1) has to kill someone in a room that he makes explode! The German passage is another boring fight session and I had to wait the final in Switzerland to get at last a tense criminal thriller. It's not a surprise thus that Noomi hasn't really the opportunity to shine: her best moment is her introduction because the way she says ''i'm Madame Zimza' is really charming!By expanding the scope of an European playground and run after a big conspiracy, Holmes loses his originality all along and this sequel appears more like a James Bond movie done by gaslight!",4,1,2,12 October 2013
Gremlins," I am not a Movie ! I am a Cartoon !! (screen) (vhs) (DVD)
","The opposite is more frequent: the cartoons would like to be movies, either with a realistic art ('Final Fantasy'),or with real live actors ('Who framed Roger Rabbit ?' or 'Looney Tunes Back in Action' from the same director).Here you got first a really lively setting: a small American town in the 80's. Then, it turns into an horror movie (the symbolic fight of the desperate housewife in her kitchen), and when it could have been a bloody nightmare, the monsters suffer from 'gremlins madness' and it becomes a hilarious, funny horror movie: I think that with 'Ghostbusters' (seen both in theaters for Christmas 84 at 10 years old), it was the first ones of this kind.In addition to the nostalgia, the enjoyment comes from a lot of merit (the name of Spielberg as producer may not be fortuitous): - Christmas time. It gives a good contrast to the horror<ul><li>Jerry Goldsmith music: two great theme: the romantic mogwai song &amp; the frenzy gremlins theme </li></ul><ul><li>Joe Dante as a director: he has the sense to make fun as well as to frighten</li></ul><ul><li>A great collection of characters greatly interpreted: from the failed inventor and father, the nationalist neighbor, to an horrible 'Mrs. Deagle' and so on Well, all of them bring theirs personal stories to the story</li></ul><ul><li>The metaphoric script: the gentle Gizmo is 'the nature gift' (as said from the old Chinese) and the gremlins are what happens when responsibility fails. Spiderman or Plato should agree with this. And as it is funny, every one accept to see the bad sides of human nature. </li></ul><ul><li>Finally, the special effects are top: without any digital help, Gizmo &amp; his pals seem truly alive.</li></ul>A must seen movie !",10,0,2,24 March 2007
Requiem for a Dream," # 03 : Requiem for traditional filmmaking (DVD)
","As soon as the movie begins, you understand this is an UFO in today movies: split screen, fast editing, forward play and strange close- ups. I didn't know the director but he is very talented and he is among the ones that deserve watching for! As for the story, i'm torn: i don't really care about the fate of the young junkies because i can't stand movies ('Blow', 'Gia') that depict dope as fun, flashy and drug dealers as startup business men. Sure, Jenny is a sexy girlfriend but she doesn't deliver the same intense play as her boyfriend or the mother.For me, this character is the heart of the movie and her actress would have been worthy of an Oscar! It's unusual to have a movie about elderly people and their loneliness. As being alone is a fundamental pain, it's easy at this age to take the path to craziness. Here, the movie doesn't spare details. It's truth that TV is often the only social experience for loners but it can be very harmful. This threat and her madness is so brilliantly told that the last half-hour of the movie is nearly unbearable to watch. It's really like a bad trip, reminiscent of a Lynch movie, all the more than the mother looks like Grace Zabrisky (Laura Palmer's mother).In conclusion, this movie ranks second, behind 'Cruising' as the most provoking and stunning movies I have seen.",7,1,2,4 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The phantom story (screen) (vhs)
","It's funny to write those lines in the zenith of hype for Episode VII! OK, i'm honest : back to its release in 1999, it was really wonderful to have Lucas doing another star wars : the best proof is that I was at the midnight screening and that i have a lot of stuff about it (maybe the strangest would be the CD-ROM « insider's guide »)! Also watching it again, it's indeed pure entertainment, a lot of fun and action with a little wisdom and emotion. It's visually stunning, with never seen before sets like this and it has a incredible cast as Lucas confirms he really knows how to pick up : Natalie, Neeson, Mcgregor, McDiarmid, August, Loyd is a fun kid and it stars also Keira Knightley as Amidala's help! However, the movie has 3 major failures for me : 1) all the aliens are ugly : Gungans, Nemodians, Watto, Sebulba! I can't understand why making non humans means doing snots ! Back to first trilogy, the aliens were most original !! 2) I can't understand Jedi violence and strict philosophy : Instead of delivering a universal and friendly message that comes from the heart, the way those Jedi are violent, fundamentalist rank them to the level of stormtroopers « from a certain point of view »! And what about Yoda heartless analysis of a poor kid who has left his mother behind : too much suffering ! With all this, i can't say that Jedi can be an healthy inspiration ! 3) the story lacks polish : in the first trilogy, Lucas has deepened his stories, especially with the help of Kasdan ! Here, it's like a first draft: there is too much useless characters, too obscure story lines and stupid choices ! What's the point to introduce a new deadly menace with Darth Maul if he had to be eliminated after five minutes ! That quick fate suppose he was only a simple, fragile cheep so ? The same with Qui-Jonn : it's a waste he had to be wipe off after one movie ! I'm sure that if the story would have been more revised, it would have been better and the later episodes with their stupid continuous changing of dull, boring cast would have been more interesting at the end !! So the phantom menace is thus this very incomplete, disappointing script !",7,1,4,20 December 2015
Catch Me If You Can," Catch the audience like Spielberg if you can (tv)
","Spielberg is a real movieteller and his movies are always little jewels. Yes, he isn't alone and have excellent collaborators (actors, music, cinematography, editing,...) but others with the same starpower (no names for my safety...) do raspberries movies. As in warfare, a good general is first of all, a good leader of men.Beginning 'Catch me' with original credits very stylized & 60's, it is winning decision because you are always in the mood. Being a reader of the American Ads art-book, I feel all the flavors of this era, in the firework of colors, and the carefree spirit of the people.And this is what I remember of this movie: the strength of freedom.With courage, you can do everything, like Frank Jr. And if you are caught but the intention is pure, the fate would recognize it. And this justice is the same value for Spielberg from his first movie to its last: the family, the kids. On the fun side, everyone knows the love of Spielberg for planes, thus the choice for this particular story must have been evident for him.That's why Spielberg is great: The fundamental philosophic message is always delivered with impeccable techniques and a sincere humanity. The circle is closed...",7,1,3,4 April 2006
Ghost," How to send this movie to heaven ? (dvd)
","This movie looks like the thoughts I had the day we buried my grandmother one year ago. I nearly shouted to her with my heart and soul but nothing happens in front of me. If she was there, how can explain we can't communicate. The best conclusion I had was that as she can't move things, she was really in an other plane, explaining we can't speak to each other.Thus it was great that a movie tries to answer the same existential question and meeting the same paradox: how does Sam the ghost can pass thought everything but can sit on a real chair: well, it's about experience and mind. Beyond this, the movie offers really great scenes about being a ghost and it's strange nobody does it like this since Shakespeare. It's more about sharing your lover sorrow, being her shadow than doing poltergeist.Another good thing is that it's not only paranormal and romance, it's also a thriller and a comedy. Swayze (who sadly turns into a real one now) and Demi was really a fine couple but this movie hasn't changed my opinion about Goldberg: she was irritating me before and she is after.Another weak point is the dark spirits: if they are here to punish bad people, they are rather good spirits. But talking about the devil would be a new discussion in another movie. So i conclude for those who like the 'Unchained Melody', urging them to listen to U2's cover because it's simply surreal!",7,1,1,28 August 2011
Iron Man 3," Iron man : the new lethal weapon ? (web)
","The first movie was close to a classic. The second was totally ridiculous and this one is just offensive ! First, Iron Man don't do politics ! Iron Man is not the toy of POTUS and is not in charge of diplomacy. OK : Moore took this angle with Watchmen and his Dr. Manhattan but Marvel comics were never about this ! Second, Mandarin is a Chinese ! Whatever his motives are, you can't change that he is Chinese ! So picking « Gandhi » to do the part is just close to racism ! Not one Chinese was available ? Third, at first, i thought it was again Favreau behind the camera. When i noticed it was happening on Christmas season, i thought it was cool as except « Lethal Weapon » not a lot of blockbuster choose this period. Then, with his Malibu mansion destroyed and falling, it was again more « Lethal Weapon » again. Next, the finale happens inside the deck of big boats, again as « Lethal Weapon ». So when i saw Shane Black as director and writer, I was surprised but not very much ! In fact, he has transplanted all the trademarks of his franchise for this movie : white crazy / black serious buddy talk, the lame bad guy (Guy Pearce as bad as usual) and ultra-violence ! So I say stop : As a teen, reading Iron Man was not counting the dead toll ! Here, Stark kills, pulverizes as much as enemies as he can and it's not the Marvel way, it's not the character ! Now, Marvel lines up a lot great disappointing movies and franchise : Thor, Iron Man, X-men, Avengers, Spider-man ! It's time they return to their first movies and read as well a lot of their own comics to understand what's is Marvel and what's crap ! Excelsior !",1,3,6,6 August 2014
Marie Antoinette," Between the Caucescus & Duchess Kate (dad)
","I'm French and for sure Republican. My fellow citizens have annihilated Monarchy and if nobody deserves death, you understand that I don't really enjoy movies that focus about the Royals and that wrongly put them as icons! This one has in addition a special statute being directed by the daughter of one the biggest name in cinema history: so it's again about families, reproduction of blood, well everything that was condemned by my Revolution (and here, this famous historical quote is even erased). If I analyze her level forgetting her name, I would say that she doesn't seem really inspired: the movie is flat, not dynamic, as linear and repetitive as the court life and at the end, I don't see gripping moments The only thing that makes the movie alive is the vitality of Kirsten Dunst and for sure the real (or rebuilt) locations of Versailles. So the movie depicts really how golden this cage was.. Maybe the desire to be a mother is sincere but to be blind to the needs of the people while getting well stuffed everyday can't lead to respect and interest from this same people, yesterday, today or tomorrow",4,0,0,13 October 2017
Child 44," Child 01 (screen)
","Another stinker from Noomi! Finally, except « Prometheus », all the Hollywood movies she done are very disappointing and never match the quality of her Scandinavian works. I really wonder why she chooses such projects except to be another time with Hardy ! Here, what annoys me first is that as i'm not naive anymore i rank this movie as mere propaganda. It's very easy for western production to do a movie illustrating the abuses of their « opponents » when there are so much abuse in western countries that are still waiting a movie ! Thus, even before the movie starts, i know that the good guys will be very good and the bad guys really bad and that the first victim of this movie would be the simple truth ! Next, the movie is totally gloomy, dark, depressive with its plot (totalitarian state, serial killer of children) and its production (Russia looks like « Blade runner » LA and the Grey art from Bilal). The story is difficult to follow because I didn't understand why this case was so important. If the cast is rather good, their acting is also ridiculous as every one speaks English with a Russian accent.",1,16,44,8 May 2015
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Raiders of the lost entertainment (DVD)
","Movies are strange: This Indy set the tone for all action/adventure movies for now 30 years and beyond while it gets its roots in the old serials of Saturday matinée! I don't know if they were good but they inspire and make the best modern filmmakers (Spielberg, Lucas).It's also true those first born 'blockbusters' are a family legacy as Leboeuf said because they first draw our parents and we, kids, we just followed them.In all cases, this first adventure is really incredible and it's deeply rich: funny, spiritual, historic, exotic, and filled everywhere with the crop in filmmaking: Ford is an outstanding actor because he shows as bravery as fragility! Williams is a top composer and the raiders March is in our ears forever! And Spielberg really knows how to tell and visualize a story with attention to details and great shots! It was fun to watch the on-set production gallery included as extra because i got the feeling that movies aren't made like this today, which maybe explains why there's no more classic like this one.",10,0,1,19 February 2011
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," SweET thirty (cinematheque)
","This is my third viewing of 'ET' after its first broadcasting in French TV (canal +) and its release in theater on Christmas time in my grandparents' city. At this time, I haven't been able to appreciate it because everybody said it make cry and so while watching it, I was always telling me 'don't cry, don't cry'. I know how much we can be fool as kid. Now as an adult, i am mature and it's indeed a movie with great emotions. I still don't cry because instead I feel good. In fact, it's funny to see Spielberg tells a story from the point of view of a child and now as an adult, I can notice it. When I was a child, the movie wasn't so surprising. Actually, it's great to live again those days alone at home, the false colds, the garden from outer space, the first crush... It was also a good lesson of truth that an open heart as Elliot means total acceptance and sharing. He doesn't ask anything from ET but welcomes him as he is and offers him all his toys. If adults behave this way, the world would be a better place. Beyond, the movie is full of surprises: Star wars is everywhere, MacQuarrie designs the ship, there's a future Baywatch star and William's score is among his best ones. I'm agree with Splielberg when he says that Williams make him better. For those who desire to follow the adventure, they can read the book 'ET and the green planet' which is a fine sequel.Pairing: 'Close encounters'. Of course: what ET did before meeting Eliot.",10,0,1,26 March 2012
Casablanca," It's true that Barb Wire is its rip-off (dad)
","Well, maybe it's not the expected way to talk about this movie but at last, it's objective and it's not the one-sided opinion about classic, cult, magic. In addition, it's great way to analyze movies evolution : so in the two movies, we have a frontier neutral town before liberty, bad guys and rebels, a saloon-keeper who doesn't take side, a police officer who is not very clean, a fat guy managing black market, two tickets for a plane and for sure an old love getting hot again ! With that, i would say that the most recent movie shows more but as it's silly contents (nakedness, violence), the effect to the movie is useless. Here, we just have the characters speaking and interacting in a civilized way, so the old movie is thousand more thrilling because it's only psychological ! So those old movies in black and white and using out-of-date technology are not finally boring but are rather more punchy than the actual ones because they cut to the essential : humans feelings and relationships ! Anyway, this old one has indeed a fabulous cast : as said by Lynch, it's true that Isabella looks like her mother, Bogart shows than less is more but for me, the magic lies with the black and white : it's so full, so complementary in costumes, the white saloon, the black night, the shadows that it was like seeing a color movie ! For sure as a french, i really appreciated when our hymn mutes Nazis songs and regarding to the date of production, i keep in mind the line « Even Nazi can't kill so fast », which was proved totally worst a few months later !!",7,0,1,16 October 2016
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A true masterpiece doomed to ignorance (screen) (vhs)
","Except « ice age », it's the only animation with which I remember to laugh so much and so hard : the opening cartoon ranks among the most funny ever done and this Roger Rabbit is really a wonderful character, goofy, crazy, with a good heart ! The idea to mix real world with Toon world is original and the production is astounding in both situations and it's even done when digital effects weren't there ! There is a real story, worthy of a film noir and this Golden age Hollywood is nicely done. The cast is excellent with late Hoskins totally believable and an amazing dark side « Doc » ! Silvestri delivers a jazzy, upbeat soundtrack as good as « BTF » and for sure « Looney Tunes » meeting Disney is a dream come true ! However, all this is lost as tears in the rain because it's totally old-fashioned ! For a movie aimed to a young audience, it's a total failure because it has nothing that the new generation likes ! As it means a lot for me, i offered it to the kid years ago and he didn't smile a lot : old Disney, Looney Tunes, Hollywood, jazz means nothing to him and watching a dusty, drinking private investigator really didn't appeal to him. So in fact, this a animation for old adults or more accurately for old movies aficionados so there are are a few of them in the world.",10,1,4,14 April 2016

I will not enter the empty debate to decide if it's the best PKD adaptation (just because PKD must be read than watched) but there were a lot of good ideas and inspired filmmaking here. The first pre-crime reminds you that Spielberg is really good at thriller and it's a shame that he doesn't do more, above all that he started here (see 'Night Gallery'). At first, the blue filtering didn't convince me here it's fine because this future is really bleak. It reminds me of 'Robocop': a future not too futurist but with us, common people having become hollow shells and identified data: thoughts, eyes, body warm, localization. What can the 'government' ask more the moment we can't get any privacy thus identity. This all-seeing eye is well depicted here all the more than PKD is an intelligent rebel: the loss of our liberties would be pernicious, hidden behind the 'it's for your own good'. Tomorrow, it will be casual crimes, but today it's already terrorism, fundamentalism and states debts. But PKD is also a true writer because it's his delicious idea to have a pre-crime cop witnessing his own pre-crime! With Spielberg on command, you can find that the bragging Farrell is decent actor and fresh newcomers (like Morton) as well. It's really fast paced as for the mind or the eyes and as with the story, I still have questions (how the minority report really works, why two balls, why no records from Agatha for her mother's pre-murderer).",10,0,1,6 November 2011
Finding Neverland," Never ever again (dad)
","I'm honest I had prejudice against this movie: 1) I'm bored with Deep 2) making a movie about an author is the ground zero of a story: Barrie wrote « peter pan » : here's the story ! how he got his ideas is not a story ! But as Kate was in it, I forced myself to watch it. Unfortunately i just hold on a couple of minutes : Barrie is dangerously cheating his wife and that's not an attitude i like ! I have saw the kid in the awful « Spiderwick » and he is as bad as previously ! Kate is ill throughout the movie and there is nothing entertaining for me ! I push « forward » most of the time : i watched the opening of the play but it feels so weak to watch that in the movie that i just zap it to the end ! In conclusion, just prefer « hook » or Disney animation and you will find fun and magic about childhood ! As for me, i long to reach my 1000th review as i will stop to write about those bad movies and lose twice my time!!!",1,1,3,27 May 2016
G.I. Jane," Top « big'uns » (tv)
","For Al Bundy, chicks comes from the « big (g)uns » magazine. « Top Gun » is the famous movie with Cruise joining the military. So, my title should be clear now as « GI Jane » is about a woman enlisting. As the actress is Demi, it's funny to see that she has explored all the scale of her femininity : to the extreme low here as being a soldier to the extreme high when she played a striper in « striptease ». It would be interesting to hear her feelings about those experiences but as a GI, she was more stunning as she dressed with the uniform instead of doing push up. Beyond this fashion note, the movie is a terrible tool for the cause of feminism : the explanation for her opportunity is totally lame as the arguments are drowned under a poor political scheme and they miss the target every time (her period, the lesbian threat ,). Worst, this angle isn't used to dynamite the old, usual, unsurprising evolution of those military school movies : at first, the recruits suffer, then, some of them oppose, but at the end, they prove their value during an operation. Indeed, this movie is just drills after drills, with instructors shouting in megaphone. Finally, it's a propaganda for uncle Sam's military and never is questioned why the so-called first democracy in the world needs a such big army. Nobody wonders the legitimacy of their operation faraway of their coast and the fact that they are the first to kill in the desert state (wasn't it so an aggression ?). Thus, it made me realize that Ridley Scott is far away to have the credibility of a Spielberg or a Coppola. He is just an aesthete that sells his art to corporations and as long they pay for it, he doesn't ask questions (see also his « body of lies »). The only good surprise here was Viggo Mortensen as the instructor. He is excellent to depict authority with a certain heart so he was indeed at the right place here.",4,2,5,25 December 2013
Star Trek," They are back! (screen)
","This is true for the original Star Trek cast as well for my team-up with the kid (our first movie since 4 months). Although he is 6 years old and discovered the Star Trek universe with this movie, he liked it and it was funny to see that he had understood the colors code for the clothes: he doesn't like the 'blue' and was worried for the 'yellow'.For me, I was happy by the choices made by the movie: The young cast is talented and I am amazed how they catch their models traits. The story is an intelligent mix of action and emotions and benefits from the 'beginning' effect which unveils untold moments so far: how the characters met, what did they do before. And for sure, i was deeply moved by the two guest stars: one in true light, the other a bit in shadow. It was a great joy to see finally the original cast on a big screen because time makes every one older and this unexpected opportunity was thus a kind of tribute for the good memories they gave me on TV when i was younger.The Star Trek philosophy meant so much for me that i have always think about a definitive fan fiction which is, to my great surprise, very similar to this actual movie: I toy also with the classic characters, time travel and an alternate reality. But instead of a mere second starfleet career, my ending focus on their sentimental lives. If the iconic trio, Kirk-Spock-McCoy (God bless him!) shared together some unforgettable moment, they have sacrificed the most beautiful gift of live: love ! So, the old trio gather together one last time and go back in time before their meeting to find their love-mate. And cautiously, as in the movie, each one helps the romance of another one: Old Kirk manages it for young Spock, Old Spock for young McCoy, Old Mccoy for young Kirk....Long live and prosper, juniors!",7,0,8,1 June 2009
Akira," Tetsuo, Kaneda, Tetsuo, Kaneda, Akira, -kira, -kira, -kira (web)
","In fact, Akira was the thing of my twin brother and as it was his, it was crap. (I know how much we can be dumb when we are kids but that's what adulthood is about). Well, I watched him collect all the books and above all, I heard a lot the rhythmic score in our parent's car! I remember to watch a few minutes years ago but it was senseless with Tetsuo calling 'Kaneda', Kaneda calling 'Tetsuo' and that was all.One week ago, I started to read the comic and it was hard to put it down: Contrary to traditional comics, the text is minimal so the pace is really dynamic and matches the story: as it deals with devastations, technology and mysticism, it's really Japanese at heart. The characters (Kaneda, Kei, Tetsuo, Kaori, the kids, the Colonel) are well studied and all the emotions are rich: humor, romance, courage, madness, faith, friendship... Otomo is a stunning artist too and the numerous devastations of Tokyo are among the best pages of comic ever. If there is a big slump between volumes 17 and 27, the last volumes are visually fascinating! Now, comes the movie: actually, it's 20 years old but it's not very outdated. At its release, it surely rocked the animation because there weren't a lot of productions like this. As for the adaptation, it's a good thing that Otomo was at the helm: The movie looks like the comic and vice versa. The story has been drastically cut for the screen but the core is still here(in fact, it's indeed the big slump mentioned that has been left). In addition, a lot of ideas have been rewritten so it's nearly like a special edition. Finally, the comic is so explosive that this animation is nonetheless less powerful. In other words, if you like the movie, read the comic because it's a thousand more epic and read 'Domu' as well (it's a good prequel!).",10,8,16,7 December 2011
Citizen Kane," CFK (rental)
","It looks like Oliver Stone JFK and for me there are real parrallels between the two authors: the beginning of Citizen with his new reels was surely an edit never seen in movies before that: it's dynamic, informative and really cool. Then, the two are really into America and its untold story and deconstructing thee myth of the american dream: they focus on the wealthy and for sure their results is not the sweet tale told by medias! At last, they have a documentary and historical value because we really know better this country: Here, with CFK, we have a amazing look of the famous tycoons between 1871 and 1940 so the time when they were nearly lawless and they amass an incredible wealth without any limits!
But Welles leaves Stone behind because Welles is also highly skilled in drama: Kane private life as an husband is amazingly told: the outstanding Xanadu mansion/castle is used like a Disney animation and really enhances the tension and the visual: it's dark, gothic almost like a Bruce Wayne without the heroics! This slow, nearly total fall of the richest man in America is thus a moving lesson that money can't buy the essential!",10,1,1,29 March 2018
The Birth of a Nation," Definitely against : Part 2 (rental)
","Decidedly, this WWI Americas is very conservative: after a War propaganda (Lusitania), an anti-abortion eugenic pamphlet (My children), here we have an Aryan movie, in which old white enemies during the Secession War become new allies to fight the new Black Power!
What's upsetting is that the movie opens very differently as maybe the only good movie that brings together Lincoln and a family around the war. Usually, we have movie about Lincoln or about the war but never the 2 scales at the same time. Here it's done and it's quite brilliant in production and in cast.
The second part is interesting because previous movies stop at the end of the war (Victory, Emancipation, ...) when all seems good and right while in fact it wasn't this peaceful and empowering road.
But here the change is drastic because it's indeed a KKK propaganda: it's maybe the first movie in which i see indeed black people harassing, threatening, humiliating white people, their children, their vote... It's strange and as a citizen, i would be interested if the facts told in the movie are true or not. So that's why it's a good historical piece because you have a lot of things in it to think and that's explain why this is the last DVD in my french for old movies. So the first 20 years of cinema was just experiments to give this first benchmark... we will see...",7,1,4,14 July 2018
Underworld," UselessWorld (dvd)
","This movie had got all to be a hit: A Hollywood icon (Beckinsale), mythic fantasy characters (vampire & werewolf), and appropriate locations (Romania)....However, the result is a disaster: I watched the DVD with the director's comments, and even though i was surely tired by other reasons, I confess that i slept in front of this.Why ? What i have seen was just senseless gunfights 'à la 'Matrix'. Then, the actualization of the mythology of those fantasy figures is sometimes 'too much': the werewolves have to be to be more 'CAT' like! Atlast, the atmosphere is killed by the colorization of the screen. Everything, every one is tinged from blue.... Ah Technicolor.....As there is a sequel scheduled in 2006, I know already one movie i won't see. In conclusion, Prefer 'Van Helsing' for a hit with the same ingredients: Beckinsale, Romania & vampires....",1,3,8,8 January 2006
Amistad," Schindler's list for Amerika (cinematheque)
","As someone said it in the movie, the slaves had nothing to fear from their masters because as they work for them, they wouldn't be killed. So for me the only difference between slavery and holocaust is the lack of genocide. Besides this, it's the same oppression, the same racism: just see the way of how slaves were treated during the crossing and they are similar to the future extermination camps. But it's true that somewhere condemnation of slavery isn't as known as holocaust. Maybe the unfortunate explanation is that the masters are not beaten ones like Germany but as the movie shows the entire enlightened nations. As Tocqueville wrote, slavery was a shameful thorn in America democracy and Spielberg as a humanist American filmmaker couldn't avoid the subject. And he did in his own way, the same than in 'Schindler's', that is to say showing that courage and hope are more powerful that the darkest time, the worst atrocities. Foretelling his later 'Minority reports' or 'Munich', he throws a very critic look at authorities and for the first apparition of POTUS in his work (a real plague in a lot of American movies) and whispers critics that could have pleased his colleague Stone. But his optimism is also visually contagious: compare the first terrifying look of Cinque and his latter appearances and you can see an happy hand. The only flaw of the movie is finally his title because it's doesn't tell very much what's about: 'Amistad vs the people of America' would have been better...Pairing: 'Schindler's list': before it, the allies were also evil forces...",7,0,2,2 April 2012
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Indolent Mandolin (Dvd)
","This adaptation of a famous book tells at the time of WWII, and in the island of Kefalonia, the love triangle between a Greek resistant, his fiancée and a Italian melomane fighter.Saying this, i say it all: The story runs after too many plots and never convinces in one area: A war movie ? hardly,... One big fight and that's all... So is it maybe a subtle tale about occupation & resistance ? No luck... Troops are sunbathing, flirting and playing music... Would i tell more about that, my review would be politic and that's not the point...So, do the live locations of Kefalonia inspire vacations ? Well, the beach, mountains are beautiful and crystal-clear. Unfortunately, my way of life is so opposite that finally the island gave me cabin (or island) fever. On a small island, you can't run forever and i got the feeling of being stuck in the house or in the village or at the creek...Finally, is the love story is moving ? All the 3 actors are top: Bale is wild enough, Cage is totally credible in his music, and Cruz is funny with her accent. But my beliefs make ununderstable the fact that one actual love can vanish in front of another new one. So i don't really care about the events.In conclusion, i am not maybe the target for this movie and my negative review must be relativised.",4,2,4,16 February 2006
Iron Man 2," A crack in the shell (IMAX)
","From a private point of view, this is our first 'family' trip since 'Iron Man 1' and if the first had been a honeymoon, this second is rather an Odysseus. What will happen with the third movie? From a comic fan, I have been hugely disappointed by this sequel.When they cast Rourke as villain, my expectations were low and the actual watching even in Imax didn't get them up. He may be OK for 'Sin City' but not the marvel way. In addition, the choice for his character Whiplash is dumb because it's like directing a Robocop movie delivering tickets! When you want an amazing movie, you find an amazing bad guy: remember Dark Vador, Terminator or Green Goblin! Then I discovered the second villain: Hammer. Well, it's a crooked businessman so this isn't a choice for action. In addition, his cast is terrible because Sam Rockwell hasn't got any charisma and is always weening.Scarlett Johansson is a fine Black Widow but her involvement is mishandled.Sure, Robert Downey is still the perfect Tony Stark and there are some good moments (the movie with his father, the new armors) but I didn't find the fun I had two years ago! I think Mr. Theroux is a better actor than writer and that he should have stayed on Mulholland drive.In conclusion, it's Iron Man washed and void that you see and it will be the result as long as you give the screenplay to people who are not reading comics as hobbies. Adaptation = No filter!",4,2,5,19 May 2010
Two for the Money," 4 for Al: Terrific actor in a terrible character (DVD)
","Al is a great actor so it's very annoying to see movies where he's a bad guy. It's like a dear friend turning into an enemy! You know all his capacities but sadly he uses them in a bad way! There, he plays a cynic and Machiavellian boss of a sports counseling firm. His motto is to turn his collaborators into money vacuum by all means. In a great scene of collective therapy, you understand that he is really ill.Beyond Al, the cast isn't really interesting (McConaughey is a masculine Playmate, never missing an occasion to show his body, Russo not much convincing) and the story a bit obscure: if sports bets are illegal, how can they advise freely? Why do they say it is tax-free?",4,0,1,3 June 2008
Alien: Resurrection," Alien 4 = Alien 2 shot like Alien 3 (dad)
","Here the aliens are once again in large numbers and act like a species, on a trail of bad-ass veterans in a gloomy and dark spaceships! For sure, and against all scientific data, we find again Ripley! So as you can expect, everything has already been seen, told and done and with the special effects the weakest of the films, you are very close to a stinker! Fortunately, Wynona adds something fresh and the aliens training come from the pages of the best Dark Horse comics (painted by Beauvais)! Our fellow Jeunet has better understood this franchise as Fincher but he has to deal with a very awful script (motherly love, a baby Alien???). At the end, you understand that making movies (and sequels particularly) is producing commercial things to gain money and not art piece and it's indisputable that the franchise has very low standards!!!",4,0,1,1 April 2017
12 Monkeys," 2 monkeys for me (vhs) (dad)
","Willis & Pitt : 2 actors without much talent, limited expressions and all for the look and dashing attitude ! Honestly, the movie may have been better with a different pair all the more than Willis is always hurt, limping and drooling while Pitt kept doing silly signs and rolling eyes Having criticized Greist in Brazil, I wish Gilliam chose Stowe because she is as limited as her male partners and doesn't show a real talent This time travel story is interesting at first (it's 2012 14 years before) but finally crumbles into its incoherence : it's not the 1st time that the future makes the past happens (terminator) but here there is too much good timing to be believable ! Gilliam proves he is inspired as a director : like no other, he can show us the world from a psycho view, an awful future and the underbelly of America cities while finding some dreamlike and fantasy moments However this rusty light is awful, the production seems to have no money and limited to slumps and in addition, my copy is just blurry and dirty At the end, it's a minor Gilliam movie that fails to be particularly endearing because of heroes and worlds that I don't care about ...",4,1,9,2 September 2017
Mississippi Burning," and our memories with it (tv)
","I'm always surprised to see that America boasts to be the biggest democracy in the world while it may be the most cancerous one in fact: the only one country in the world to have used atomic bombs against civilians, covert or armed operations to change governments (its own or the others as well), citizens surveillance, exploding poverty and incarceration, millionaires representatives and for sure, racial state less than an half-century ago! This movie is thus exceptional as it tells the truth a bit forgotten now that a few decades ago, America was just a second Apartheid: « Equal but separated » wasn't the motto of KKK but was indeed the law of this country ! Sure, KKK was the most visible racist but discrimination was endorsed by every one else : police, justice, white citizens In a way, this movie kicks where it hurts as i'm sure that this past threatens our amnesia ! To wake us, we have a great cop duo : for one time, the buddy team isn't called for fun but to be serious. It's cool to see Dafoe playing a good character for once and as an FBI agent, his uncompromising will for truth should lead him to the « X-files ». Hackman plays it more like Dale Cooper, friendly with the locals. Among them, Frances is just a extraordinary newcomer : she plays an abused wife, not very bright but lucid and ready to dream as well.",10,1,2,30 July 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Always sleepy for sure ! (dad)
","3 movies of those pirates and 3 movies while i felt asleep ! There's no better proof of the limited quality of this franchise ! Sure the production is visually stunning and original ; sure the effects and action sequences are done with taste and it's not big headache « transformers » ! But a good movie is telling a good story for good characters ! Here the director brakes everything in a slow, slow pace and visits all possible corners ! Next, the characters are limited : Deep is totally irritating with his mime Captain, Keira has just vanished in the sequel and the others aren't worth a mention ! and above all, where is the story ? i didn't understand it : why the cannibals ? why the compass ? why the father's ghost ? why the bayou, the chest, the key, the heart, . Well as i slept between the reappearance of the commodore and the wheel fight on the Island, maybe it's explained easily but right now it means nothing ! And as the movie doesn't even finish because a trilogy is always good for money, so i quit definitely those mates and sail free to another port !!",1,1,1,16 May 2016
Rocky V," The last round for  Adrian (payTV)
","I think that this 5th movie in the franchise is less appreciated than the others because it marks the beginning of a new era : Bye- bye the electric 80s and welcome to the gritty 90s : now rock hits or glorious soundtrack become rap music ; Downtown Philadelphia looks like Haiti ! Money perverts sports and violence becomes the way to deal personal problems. In that light, there's no reason that Rocky would be different. It's true that when i saw it on screen back in 1990, i was not very convinced. Today, i don't really mind because the soap stories are rather interesting and offer us to enjoy for the last time Talia and for sure Stallone's kid. According to his late fate, his difficult but close relationship with his father is rather moving. If the movie has less punch than before, it's also because Rocky loses a lot : the mansion, his son, his pupil, his health But the scene in which he fights in front of his TV is rather inspired. Honestly, the alternative ending fight doesn't bring much and don't change the conclusion. If i reviewed Rocky 6, i still haven't watched Rocky 7 and i'm not really motivated as for me Adrian was half of the soul of the saga so without her, things are not what they used to be ! NB : To add something funny, we can also notice that the Russian airspace has an gate for an alternative earth as coming back from there, Rocky finds a older son and a totally new mansion !",10,1,1,10 October 2016

Now it's the second (!) time i try to watch this DVD because of Keira and it happens again ! even if the production is baroque and visually stunning, the pace of the movie is terribly dull and its attraction wagon moves faster and is more exciting ! Sure there is efforts to have a dense story and there are strong characters and funny back roles as well, but the way it's told and filmed isn't dynamic : so it's a pure Disney movie as every age can follow what happens on screen, old or young ! The action sequences are quite boring and repetitive, Deep gets irritating with his pantomimes, Pryce with his usual dandy manner (he is not John Cleese !) and getting aboard and out of ships isn't really exciting at the end ! With this dragging ambiance, i felt again asleep when Keira was abducted ! At least she was here because she is really the revelation of this movie as well as the fighting skeletons by moonlight ! Withtout them, i couldn't have sustain such a long movie for which i have the big feeling to have seen it already before !",4,3,5,14 May 2016
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," And then Disney goes into War Child (dad)
","I wonder what would say old Walt about what his company has become: it wants to be the reference of entertainment, magic, dreams family values and child happiness and what they sell at the end is war, blood, violence, soldiers Here the movie starts like a escapist fantasy, a bit cold with this snow Queen but funny with those talking beavers and then it turns into an army recruitment: a sort of Santa Claus brings guns to the kid, they must hail to the old lion king before going to the killing field fighting the usual ugly dark forces! It's a shame! I'm appalled! You will see a happy, courageous 8 years old girl with a knife and nobody reacts! Her siblings have swords, arrows and it's the same apathy! Where is the old, sweet, compassionate Disney ??? I always thought that using kids in a war was a crime against humanity but now, because it's Disney and the pal of Tolkien is become fun and entertainment! I wish audience could wake up and think AGAIN!... In a bizarre way, America keeps on putting good values on the package but the inside message is totally twisted (no democracy, no tolerance, enemy everywhere, massive weapons,...). I found the young team rather good and the siblings rivalry interesting but at the end i can't support such brainwashing and violations!

The Notebook," Sparks is on fire (DVD)
","This my second unintentional adaptation of this writer. After the wonderful 'Walk to remember', it is a confirmation of his talent for true love story...The key of the movie is so true that every body will recognize its simplicity of genius: Lovers write the story of the passion to leave a testimony against the time and their loss of memory (a bit like my motivation behind my IMDb reviews...) If the idea is brilliant, remain for a movie to find the best actors and a real chemistry between them. For that, the cast is excellent. The young couple is unknown people (but future breakout...) whereas the old couple is Hollywood stars. It is one of few movies where i can find the same intensity & passion in same characters played by different people. And if there are 'clichés' or 'deja-vu' situations, they appear close to truth...So, as in 'Walk to remember', you just follow those incredible characters in their so simple and so moving story. When the guy asks what the girl does for herself, for freedom, well, this is for me like he has touched the very sense of life...As the locations and the reconstitution of the 40's are opulent, there's absolutely nothing wrong in this movie.So, make you a moment of freedom: watch this movie, go read a Sparks' novel and write the story of your love for your soul-mate....",7,0,0,25 November 2005
The Other Boleyn Girl," It's Natalie (Anne) for sure and not Scarlet (Mary) (dvd)
","It was a good idea to cast those young actresses to play sisters but there's a huge gap of talent between them: Scarlet seems pale and sometimes a bit dumb in comparison to the bright sun of Natalie. With this movie, Natalie really proves that she is an extraordinary actress: her face tells her mind and even without speaking, you can tell if she's happy, sad, afraid or mad.Hadn't she been there, the movie would have been duller because it's a closed-doors drama about wealthy, mighty and revolting people. Sure, it has also a historic and social value and the production is lavish. With this, you'll learn that the Church of England has been founded by sex and not faith, you'll discover how the families were built before the invention of wedding by love. But it's above all life at the court and finally, it's very far away of my convictions.NB: Morrissey should stop playing bastards because now, every time I saw him, he irritates me!",4,2,3,28 September 2011
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Nice Age Too (screen)
","Well, sorry to be so subjective with this movie, but sometimes you don't remember a movie for what it is, but because of the moment. This is what happens for me with this one: I see it with company of dear ones and this changes everything. The day with those friends was so pleasant and unforgettable that this movie is colored the same way. To be more objective:* First, watching together the new adventures of Scratch,... was not fortuitous but a deliberate choice for a good family movie... And it is: There's a story, told with humor more universal than parodic. So kids have fun as well as parents.* Then, maybe, it is not as funny as the first one, but only because you already know the characters. So maybe you have not the fun of the surprise, but you got the pleasure to meet again old friends and follow them in their journey.

Spider-Man 2," Peter Parker: the Spectacular Spiderman (dvd)
","This sequel ranks at 2nd in my best séances ever: I have seen it on its release, in my first trip to London and after visiting the British museum and having tea with my old Greek friend next door. In other words, it was the ideal movie to conclude an amazing day.As I said before, Spidey is maybe my oldest passion because i was offered his comics at 6 years old and was totally swept by the bright colors and realistic art. Spidey wakes me up of the boring French comics and since, i have never let him down. In thirty years, I read thousand Spidey's stories, some bad but some unforgettable (the Ditko, Romita Sr and Jr, MacFarlane) and to watch him live and on screen was his second earthquake. I think the Raimi's movies have totally captured the soul and heart of the characters. He succeeds putting in his movies all the trademarks of Spidey that the other Dynamic Concurent has never been able to deliver (in its comics as well an in its movies): a NYC icon, a soap opera, a big heart and a lot of laughs! It's hard to distinguish between all the movies because it's about an evolution but what i really appreciate in this second movie was:1) the opening credits: it's a terrific idea to have a talented artist (Ross?) have drawn the first movie because it's a cool homage. 2) The songs: there are only two songs in the movie: 'hold on' and 'raindrops' and if they can be listened for themselves because they are really good, they are also perfectly in harmony with the mood of Peter 3) The fire rescue: Raimi has always found the perfect person to every character, big or small, and this little Asian kid was excellent as a mini-hero! 4) Doc Ock birth was really scary and violent and it was funny to see 'Evil Dead' coming into Spidey!Well, i could go on a long time like this. When you have a movie with such depth and details, you can be sure that's a hit and this trilogy won't never catch web in my bookcase!",10,4,6,11 December 2011
Batman Returns," the body-snatcher of batman returns (screen) (cinematheque)
","It has the same director, the same actor, same batmobile, same butler, albeit the flavor is totally different. I can't name another sequel being so different of the original. But if you read the comics, the batman of 1939 isn't the same than the one of 1989 or more accurately, frank miller's 'DK' is far away from his 'DK2'.Maybe the choice for Xmas period isn't very adapted to superheroes because here, the feel is a bit cold and doesn't help a rather boring script: Batman is again sidelined and a bit stiff glued in action. funnily, the two movies taken together, Bruce appears a bit like a pervert and not because he dresses like a bat at night. In fact, each time, all he is doing is seduce a woman, get her in his bed and feel compelled to reveal his secret identity. The villains gets an inflation (three instead of one) but Schreck and Penguin are irritating. That's left Catwoman who is truly the best thing here. Pfeiffer did an amazing job, getting totally in that crazy part. She reveals a wonderful ethic for her craft and a very sexy side of her personality.The sets and visual are beautiful and Danny's score matches and maybe is better than his previous one.Finally, my feelings is a bit mixed but this Catwoman and her haunting presence wins me over. Miaow !",7,0,1,11 May 2012
The Great Dictator," Just insupportable (dad)
","Sure the project is honorable and courageous to kick dictators and alert about the oppressed but a movie is not a political work but an artistic one: honestly i tried to watch it but after 20 minutes of unfunny jokes, heavy pantomimes and silly grimaces, i had enough... The production looks cheap or the sets are really badly build, the scenes are tedious, endless, ... so that's really not my kind of fun and it's really discourages me of watching any Charlot movie after that! For the same subject, prefer the comics Maus!",1,2,18,13 April 2017
Alexander," As Great As His Name (DVD)
","Trailers don't make movies: how many times good trailers are related to bad movies or, as this one, bad trailers concern excellent movies: As I watched the trailer, I got a feeling of 'Birdcage' in Ancient Greece. But it is indeed the 1st historic, epic & spiritual movie I have seen for a long time ! It is a condensed biography of King Alexander, who conquers at an early age from Macedonia to India! So, when you know that his trip passed by Babylon, that is to say that the West conquered then the future Irak, you got new perspectives for this past world and our actual one as well! Next, the locations are really culturally alike between Greece, Persia, India & artistically beautiful. This movie beats here several blockbusters! At last, the character is himself an outstanding one: his drive for the other (-land, people, relationships,) can be an inspiration! But, I watched the DVD with the director, Oliver Stone's commentary: He delivers such brilliant speeches about history, philosophy, film-making than it is more a voice-over for the movie than an casual commentary. The only minor flaw would be that if his dialog are so needful, the movie is somewhere incomplete! In conclusion, as this experience was truly remarkable, maybe I should see 'World Trade Center' because I think the trailer is worst !",7,1,2,6 August 2007
Dead Poets Society," what everybody misses (rental)
","Around me, everybody in high school was moved about this movie : we talked about it in classroom. Then, I didn't get along as i didn't go to theater to watch it. Later, I can't remember how i finally picked it but what's sure is that it inspired my love for college and give me a helpful hand when i did my « charlie ». Now that i watch it as a adult, what strikes me is we all agree that Keating is a wonderful teacher but that's the problem indeed : for me, education is not about content, facts, data but about values, tools, feelings ! in other ways, education isn't standardized cloning but planting software. So in a way, Keating's teaching is the expected program and in that light, he shouldn't be so extraordinary just plain normal! But when i see what happens with my nephews or more generally in France where government tells about « re-foundation » without never putting kids at the center of the values, tools, feelings, I sadly understand that this movie has decades of inspiration left !",10,0,0,17 May 2016
Ed Wood," Edwood candor-hands (cinematheque) (vhs)
","Well, a movie about movies, it's always a bit narcissus for me. Speaking about his art is the easiest project that a lazy author can imagine. Here, i can make an exception because the real Wood was so goofy that it's funny after all. Above all, he is a passionate man and his fire is contagious.Beyond this, the movie is foremost a story about an extraordinary friendship between Wood and the old Bela. Martin Landau is totally moving playing this waned star and it's totally right he won the Oscar for this. I was surprised to see that his daughter is playing along him too but even without this, the talent of Tim is to impulse a familial mood to his cast. I would also give a very honorable to her then girlfriend, Lisa Marie, because as Vampira, she vampirises the part!I really don't know what could have brought Danny but it's certain that Shore is an excellent substitute and his Wood's theme is really good.Finally, i wonder if Wood was so a disastrous director. For example, i find it was really a stroke of a genius to have the cast printed over the tombstones at the beginning and in fact, the original idea comes from Wood himself. His 'Plan 9 from outer space' opens like this but in the same time, i admit i didn't have the desire to go further !",4,1,2,9 May 2012
Home Alone," A true Christmas Gift (DVD)
","The kid is fan of kid movies so I think to those movies because I count them as masterworks: they knew how to blend a lot of strong elements and are unique for that: they mix the best holidays (Christmas) and its wonderful spirit, the values of family, the cartoon fun (with the thieves) and a great soundtrack (magical score from John Williams as well as Christmas songs)! My preference however goes to the first movie: the setting in this huge mansion with snow outside is what everyone can dream for Christmas! And it's true that when you are a kid you fantasize about being home alone. A lot have been said about Culkin but he was truly good for the job: not a spoiled brat but a kind and witty kid. Beyond the cast was really great from the mother to the exceptional Joe Pesci (and don't forget Heather!).The kid was under the spell right away: as soon as we watched it, he recognized the sound of John Williams ('It's like Harry Potter) and I realize why the pair was chosen on this adaptation. As soon as it was finished, he wanted to see the sequel! It's a must-have for all homes because it brings joy every time!",10,0,1,12 June 2010
Terminator Salvation," If you can read this, you are among the rebellion (TV)
","Actually, i think this franchise is maybe the only one (with at least 4 movies) that I have seen continuously (From 1 to 4). Unfortunately, it's not the best.The first Terminator was excellent, the second was good but not original, the third was an unnecessary crap and this final element is better than its predecessor but faraway from the Cameron's movies.The choice for the future setting is a good (and logic) idea and some sequences are great: the opening battles, the devastated LA, the isolated gas station are really visions that we waited for. On the other hand, the addition of green filter is not welcomed because it's such a lazy trick: Those rebels (and machines) see their world without it thus why can't the audience? Second, I really like the trip to Skynet, this is to say, inside the 'monster'. For John Connor, it's the most dangerous place in the world but he goes there and he gives us thrills! It's again a good idea to see what the machines do to humans and the built-in line of the T-800 (with a good surprise too!). However, we got again the melting iron background for the battle and that's enough! Third, the script is hard to understand: I don't remember the previous movies so well to know if we know if John Connor is winning the war after all and above all, how? But here, his only big mission is to meet and save Kyle Reese, his future father. It's a bit disappointing, in so far as, his only help is a human/machine breed who (that) isn't really convincing (Sam Worhthington).In conclusion, except a few good minutes, the movie isn't the definitive Terminator story. For those who look for it, read the Robocop/Terminator comics by Frank Miller and Simonson because they really understand what those characters means!",4,0,3,20 November 2010
Insomnia," Twin stars: who killed Hap Elkhart? (dvd)
","A young woman killed in a small town located in the northwest. She has deep secrets. An experimented detective helps the local police. No, it isn't 'Twin Peaks' but 'Insomnia'. If the beginning is the same, the story has a surprising twist that leads to a very original plot: it's also bit reminiscent of a later Pacino ('Law and order') but 'Insomnia» beats it clearly: the locations are superb and most of all, Nolan is a better director to show the best when Al is surrounded by terrific stars: maybe Hillary is a bit underused but she blends accurately her young age and motivation. Robin as a bad guy is really convincing. The more the film advances, the more it's become tense, because Al has to do much planning for his version while fighting insomnia makes him being very sloppy. The extra has also a fine feature: a 15 mn of chat between Al and Nolan, really interesting to listen. NB: I failed to put it in the plot but you will notice that the first meeting between Al and Robin on the boat, has the hotel tenant sitting in front of them: strange?",10,0,1,5 February 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," Will it be like the disastrous 10,5 or rather like the excellent War of the Worlds ? (dad)
","The difference is simple : the first tells apocalypse through President, agencies, military so with boring characters that we don't give a S..t about while the second tells the same story trough an ordinary family. Well, i would say that this one begins like the first and finishes like the second. More accurately, i watched everything at the start but after 30 minutes of this dreadful politician and experts talks, i skip all the institutional, governmental scenes and the movie had more punch then, at least during the coming of the storm in NYC and what happens to Emmy and friends inside the library. Indeed the plot is totally unbelievable (twister, tornadoes, blizzard coming by surprise), the characters are pretty lame (a bum with his dog, a nerd, a ill child, etc..). In fact, sometimes i had the feeling to watch ID4 again, aliens switched for climate. Anyway the mission of Quaid to save his son is just a white cold trip with incoherence (coming from Miss Liberty ?). Except the good acting from Emmy and her boyfriend and some stunning visuals, there is not really much beyond.",4,0,3,26 October 2016
X-Men," X-tra (screen) (dvd)
","Adapting X-Men (XM) is a hard task because there are so many teams and so many visions. Here, the production chooses its own path and comes to a great result: if the movie is original, they have captured the soul of XM and the flavor of hundred comics! XM is really that: evolution, political issue with humans, outcast and the dream of Professor X. Say like this it's seems very serious but the strength of Marvel (unlike the Direct Concurent) is that the philosophy is mixed with humor. Here, thanks Wolvie to be so funnily rebellious! Next, if Spiderman could only goes for the red and blue suit, it was more difficult with XM. Thus, the futuristic and uncluttered design of the movie is a good idea. I like how the X motif appeared throughout the sets and props, especially the wheels of Pr. X. Locating the showdown at the statue of liberty is brilliantly symbolic.Next, the cast is extraordinary: they are really like their penciled parts and the mix between newcomers (Jackman, Paquin) and old crew (Stewart, Jansen, McKellen) blends totally.In conclusion,it's great to realize that all the movies we make reading those comics have also been shared by a true filmmaker. The movie was so good that the feedback happens and this movie becomes an inspiration for the comics, especially the Ultimate line.",10,0,1,3 August 2011
Spider-Man 3," Ultimate Spiderman (Screen)
","This Spidey Trilogy is actually the only movies which make me feel happy when the show is over. They 'clean' my mind and I feel fresh again.With those characters, it is a reunion with 27 years friends (I am 32 years old), who were always here in my good and bad times and who inspire me for great values (thanks to the talent of numerous writers & artists). It is also New-York, a great old city, which suffers a lot in 2001 but keeps on having the 'pulse' Because the 'spirit' of the work is all around, it is a sensational comics adaptation, but in addition, the movies medium brings all the pleasure to a new level ! Surprisingly, the Spidey parts are amazing: they really add something to the comics. The narrow space between buildings, the sense of up/down, swing are really accurate.The difficult life of Peter Parker isn't forgotten: Sure, for this part, the Spidey universe is brought intensely: Sandman, the black suit, Venom, the Stacy family, the 'burglar'. While the events are rather independent in the comics, now, all the story lines are tangled together, so the die-hard fans may be deceived, but who cares? They got only 150 minutes to tell decennials of events! So, even if the black suit doesn't create clothes by mind, the dark side effect is a imaginative addition to the classic tale. It is a great valuable symbol for teenagers! Finally, behind all this money, all those fights, you can leave with a philosophy message, which labeled 'authors' movies fail a lot of times. Spidey speaks about choice, and for me, this word couldn't come more in time. This is the same question I am running after (see my previous review of 'The Reaping' for a proof'), and it's a great gift for me to having Spidey help me in that sense! For the few who ask the meaning of life and look for their role, the good choice is the hardest one, because you know it doesn't serve your own selfish needs. 'Enough said!'",10,39,60,8 May 2007
Milk," I have been recruited (Screen)
","With 3 free tickets to use before 12 April, i had to go to movies for 3 consecutive evenings. My third choice was this movie. Why ?1- It was the rare US non-action movie playing at the theater. 2- It takes place in the 70's, a period that I like. 3- It also takes place in San-Franscisco, a special town for my best writer Philip K. Dick. 4- Danny Elfman scores the soundtrack even if it didn't make a deep impression.As soon as the movie started, I realized that I forgotten one fundamental thing of this story that it's about gay life, too. I don't mind and I will always support those who are fighting for their rights! I never know that the gay faced so much attacks and contempt in America and that Milk's engagement had been crucial for their recognition. For me, it is symbolic that he has been assassinated by a crazy straight and out of any sexual content. It's a case of the biter bit: They have told so monstrous things about gays, that they totally forgotten the 'monsters' among themselves. Another thing that stroked me: In America, people can say what they want, and those who are oppressed can make a stand. In my country, it is the ever-lasting peace: I don't remember to have a gay debate there nor any big demonstrations! Like at my screening of 'Frost/Nixon', I can only wonder where is the best democracy?Sadly, I found the directing a rather flat, unable to support the drama told.",4,7,14,19 April 2009
The Prestige," Industrial light & magic (rental)
","Well, i was reluctant to rent this movie as the story didn't appeal very much to my tastes : however, now, after watching it, i found it good, not exceptional or prestigious but better than the actual trend : Nolan is indeed a great director as he knew how to grasp my attention since the first minutes : The art direction is rather excellent with big theaters, stages and all the feel of the « Victorian » era. All the cast is at the same level : Wolvie, Batman, black widow Even the second parts are well filled : Perabo, Gollum, David Bowie, Michael Caine and for sure Rebecca Hall! The story is not as linear and simple as i feared : it's full of twists and flashbacks so we better pay attention and this competition between those two is rather violent, absolute and in a way, sad and tragic...",7,0,0,26 August 2015
Sleepy Hollow," A bit sleepy a bit hollow (cinematheque)
","I watched it just after a my work day and getting into dark woods like this made me sleep. It was all the more hard to resist as Depp isn't a first class actor at my eyes: he acts rather like C3PO: stiff, not much expressive or warmful. Then, the crime story is a bit hard to follow, all the more than the names are too much alike. In addition, the original angle told at the beginning (science and reason vs lore and magic) isn't really used after.At least, it's a Burton's movie so you can find very good things as well: the sets and production are wonderful if you like new england, mist and Gothic. Danny's score is a good one. By then, you could still find Lisa Marie in fantasy clips, not really useful to the story but cool.",4,0,1,17 May 2012
Silent Hill," Silent Chill (Screen)
","I got a deception and wanted to see a 'dark' movie to exorcise it. Being the only movie of that kind at this time, I didn't have the choice and bought my ticket. Already a famous video game & directed by an intelligent director, I didn't feel desesperate too...Maybe 2 hours later, my deception has become worse because the movie wasn't what I have expected.Cast, locations, direction, special effects are correct. The atmosphere is sometimes chilling (in this kind of movie, my test is the 'Feel-alone-rama' (the more the characters feel alone = the more you are afraid ), but all those sincere intentions are killed by a crap story & shocking situations.A first little disappointment was t(o feel the rigidity of a video game story: you need to find a tool ... TO meet a person ..TO.. etc,etc,. Maybe it's cool for die-hard gamers, but i am not.But, above all, I see no point in this movie: If that's a new way of entertainment, then I lack something: Gore, sadism, torture are shown without message. Sure, the fundamentalism of religions is evocated, but this world is god-empty: there are only the devil and poor humans, so it is useless to fight because devil always wins. The end of the movie is particularly evident.In conclusion, this kind of no-hope movie is rather subversive, dangerous for soft minds and don't gain my vote of confidence. So, feel free & brave: save your 2 hours to better thing!!!",1,1,4,27 May 2006
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Smiley is not smiling (tv)
","This is a pure LeCarré adaptation as this spook movie is only about agents and not high technology! Those agents work on the ground, gather papers, search motives and explanations. So it's more like a detective case and it's highly cerebral! It's even more complicated that there are a lot of names and the nature of intelligence is to hide the truth very well. So we have a very slow movie, with no action at all, happening in a gloom 70s England (deduced from the psychedelic fashion and furniture)! Sure we have an all star team of British actors but honestly, at the end, the movie is a bit confusing and it lacks energy and tension to be riveting!",4,1,5,7 September 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," Tintindiana 4,5 (dad)
","It begins and ends like the Tintin comics i used to read long ago before comics: a gentle mystery story, set in Europe and with real cardboard characters: the blank curious reporter, his ingenious dog (the best thing here) and his grumpy friend. But, between, it becomes a non-stop action extravaganza going from boat to desert to opera to port. It is just too much and the final fight with cranes looks like 'Transformers'. It's above all the Spielberg of 'Indy 4' who focus only speed that commands the camera, in spite of his old self taking a few shots: the duel about the fuse is a bit 'Hook'ish and maybe the best sequence. This CGI picture isn't wonderful: if the actors have indeed been shot live, it would have been better to keep the original shot. Finally, this Tintin gives a distorted view of the comics and the original cartoon is much true to this.",4,1,2,22 May 2012
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Courageous and acid (rental)
","In a cold war time and right after JFK assassination, what does Kubrick is indeed original: it's like if today we did a comedy about terrorism and while America keeps tight, only France did it so far with Youn and Vive la France.
Here the premise recalls what happens in Wargames (the human element to launch a nuclear attack) but in a reverse way (the attack is launched!): It's funny (and comforting) that the path to the actual detonation is very complicated and not limited as a single red button to push like we are told. The military sets and equipment looks very accurate and in this cold, serious world, it's very unusual to find indeed comedy: I remember Hot Shots but here there's no really patriot feeling but frightening humans behavior: the military mind to look for an enemy to attack, the amoral and amnesic use of Nazi scientists for the arms race... There is also a lot of hidden things to notice: I like the army tagline Peace is our profession because it parallels our french name of military forces: Defense Ministry while in fact we keep attacking!
Scott is really good as a obsessional general (wilder than Patton) and Sellers is indeed a master of disguise because I didn't get he was also playing the President (that's explain why I found this character a bit soft!). Watching him is a bit like watching another comedy genius, our french Les Nuls: he acts like Chabat with the look of late Bruno Carette.",7,1,1,6 February 2018
The Beach," I don't like Paradise (dvd)
","This movie illustrates brilliantly the idea that i came with my spiritual reading: while revealed books speak about paradise as ultimate reward, with gold, women, my concern was about the one I love down there and who could be sentenced to hell! How could i be happy to be in Paradise if they weren't? Here the dilemma may be different but the anguish is the same: Heaven can turn into Hell, and as the movie intelligently points out, where do you go then if you want to leave Paradise? Another good testimony here is the numbness and delusion of modern life: actually, we experience a lot of virtual pleasure (as reading this web screen now) and we have lost touch with what is real! Thus, we have all inside us this yearning for a simpler life, communicating with people that we can actually touch! The global village is just a mirage because our body is attached to one location at one time.At last, the movie offers another great truth about ultimate freedom and doing whatever we want. This isn't paradise because it's indeed the pathway to hell, the right journey to madness! With all those subversive ideas, Boyle delivers a great movie, a modern parable that he explains with his commentary. The Leo we see here is the Leo i don't like: conquering, arrogant, liar, cheater and worse. But it's a intelligent trick to pose him as the hero, all the more he is not more the 'King of the world'. At last, being french, it's funny to see my fellows (Ledoyen, Canet, De Fougerolles) in a international movie!",7,1,2,10 July 2011

","Last Friday morning, the electrical company cut off our building. We were without energy for 6 hours. Sunday night, the moment Wicket discovers Leia, the company cut it off again and this time for 3 long days. While i live in Left bank Paris, i had a taste of an Ewok life, left to tools and no energy! Finally, I watched the end yesterday !This final movie of the classic trilogy had been always fun for me : back in 1983, this movie was like a big event, full of gifts : a sticker album, new Kenner toys As a forest and desert lover, i found the new locations to be very enjoyable in spite of a very weak script :<ul><li>Maybe there is a new death star and the special effects have been amazingly upgraded but at the end, it's another huge battle finale with the same mission Lucas explains well how he brings this idea to Episode IV as he lacked then an idea to end it. In addition, the Empire, contrary to Vader feeling, is pretty fast to build such a big, ultimate weapon while it took 20 years to build the original! </li></ul><ul><li>Episode V was Luke forbidden to leave Dagobah because he had to finish his training. And now when he comes back, Yoda tells him that he doesn't need anymore training : Never been clear to me ! </li></ul><ul><li>It's true that Leia has nothing to do : she barely speaks and as dear late Carrie told us, she spends her time firing guns ! On the other hand, Harrison is really good here. </li></ul>At last, this special edition leaves me angry : the new footage of Christensen as Anakin is totally failed : why pick his age ? why he seems so grumpy while Ben, Yoda and previous old Anakin was smiling ??? It's like he has indeed no good for him !!! Next, all the universe (Tatoine, Bespin, Coruscant) celebrates the defeat of the Empire but Episode VII explains us that : the sinister FIRST ORDER will not rest until the last Jedi, has been destroyed and General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE !!!

Begin Again," Flop 50 (rental)
","I pick this one for Keira and it was a good opportunity to test my theory that actual American movies are totally disconnected with their audience (explaining that they are so bad!) In short, the American movies offer today a restricted choice of characters: either Law, either Criminals, Either Vigilante, Either prestigious elite (doctors, lawyers, and entertainment). So this one belongs to the last category being a meeting about a new artist and an old famous producer, and it's not even a biopic! So who's really care about that? How many relatives of friends have you got with an album career? Zero, like me, so really I can't enter this movie and I'm already bored since the beginning!After, we have the complete track: the writing session, the session, the recording, the video, the live performance, all this with the same really poor songs and it's just excruciating! If that was not enough, the movie adds the usual rebel teen because the parents split (see JP3 for example) and as expected, it's poor drama, fake feelings and lost time At last, the movie shows clearly how America evolves for the worst: teen dress like prostitutes, parents look like bums, young wear beards and don't want to work much and homes are slums!! In a way, I have never found NYC so bad and so decadent Compare to old movies from 70s or even 80s and this generation looks totally without tasteIndubitably, one of the worst movie for Keira!",1,2,6,28 October 2017
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sondheim is the real barber: he cutthroats the score (cinematheque)
","For one time Tim had a decent story with great twists, a amazing cast (with flavor of Potterverse & his only production where the pairing of Depp & Bonhamn isn't boring!) and an inspiring setting. Unfortunately, the movie is killed by the score. I remember that Sondheim was excellent in 'Dick Tracy' but here he falls miserably: no cues, no themes, not even poetic lyrics. It reminds me of Allen's musical 'Everyone says I love you' where fine actors sang horrible songs! Thus, the entire movie was like a tour in a Russian wheel: fun when it's was speeched and very tedious when the songs came in. They completely stalled and blow up the narrative. This huge failure from Sondheim is all the more seen in comparison to any other Gothic musical (see Loyd Webber's 'phantom of opera') and of course Danny and his amazing and eternal work on 'Nightmare'!",4,1,3,19 May 2012
Horrible Bosses," Not a horrible movie (screen)
","I saw this movie with my old colleague and it was fun because he really laughs all along. From my side, I also laughed and I was the first surprised because I never imagined that I would ever watch a movie starring Farrell + Spacey + Foxx. Fortunately, they don't have much screen time and it's really about the crazy plans of those three buddies. For one time, the ideas are here and that's a labeled comedy that is indeed funny. The power of the movie is that we can all relate to odious bosses as well in our life and thus the movie acts like a catharsis. Jennifer was cute in this movie with her black hair and the three buddies, albeit unknown to me were excellent in their goofiness. The funnier for me was that Bateman looks really like another old colleague who like him was very decent with our old octopus boss. I have even nicknamed him 'Kai-Kai' for all the punches she slapped on his nose thus this movie was a great mirror and I dedicate this review to him!",7,1,2,17 September 2011

Was it Bob Gale so ?I remember to have tried it month ago but then, I wasn't convinced by the dull and slow beginning. Now, pumped by Christmas spirit, I tried the whole bottle and it's worst !it's definitely not a Christmas tale but a reeducation camp: incredulous kids are abducted to accept the one and only truth. 'Learn', 'Leader', 'Believe', that's what the camp warden says to them as a goodbye. During the trip, he asked for billets, make line and respect time! The pole looks like a huge factory, filled with anonymous slaves and Big bother is here to watch all naughty kids. Santa needs his crowd cheering like the best of dictator and it's the one movie about him in which he actually whips his deers!The production is sharp for nothing: the kids haven't characters and the story is just about going up and down, too slow or too fast on strange vehicles! If JK Rowling didn't stop Harry's adventures in the Hogwarts express, there a reason: nothing can indeed come out of a train trip! Now, you have been warned: If you look for true magic and poetry about Santa, prefer 'the nightmare before Christmas' because here it's rather Satan Klauss !",1,5,10,23 December 2012
Closer," ... to the bottom of the French drama movies (dvd)
","Maybe I got a spider-sense, but as soon as I saw the boring opening credits with that dull song, I awaited a stinker and I wasn't proved wrong.This four stars big Hollywood production is worthy of our best French specialty, the 'art house cinema': the recipe goes like this: shoot the cast talking, babbling endlessly, putting the audience to sleep with silly, hollow lines, with no visual directing, just a close-up of them sitting in a spare room. That's the thing here: multiply this by 10 (the number of sequences here because they are quite long during about 9 minutes each) and you got the full story. I hoped to take a tour in London but with this movie, you stay indoor.Beyond this poor visual, the substance is painfully lacking: it's A who is in love with B but who prefers finally C that likes D. For sure, B and D meet 'by accident' (no kidding, in a city big as London) while A and C cheats together. Then, all of them split to rejoice as if nothing ever happened! Wow: that's interesting: for the amateur, you have the usual 'I love you', 'It will be hard but I love her', 'Was it better', 'I really love you' (after the come-back), bla-bla and bla-bla... If you like that, fine for you but it's not my case. As it's a play, maybe some will find the lines and the psychological studies of characters interesting, but in my opinion, if you catch your partner cheating, it's broken and it's time to leave: in other words, there's nothing to say about it.The only good thing here is Natalie (as always) who tries to be more assertive with her intimate life with her character that seems to be Mathilda (from 'Léon') a few later.In conclusion, how can it be that the sex stories of swingers and cheaters make always disastrous movies whereas romantic, pure, sincere love stories make classics?",1,3,6,17 October 2011

About the production, it's a shame : like nowadays movie, it's ugly colorized : for the heat and sun, it's golden filter ; for the night, it's blue and inside the casino, it's red !

","I liked so much this movie that i watched it two times on screen (my last back-to-back was 'Indi 4'): one with my nephews and the other alone but in 3D and as usual, 3D ins't the ultimate experience (Imax is better) because eyes get used quickly and the colors are darker.I was nearly tempted to name it my movie of 2010 but i prefer a movie with real people instead. Nevertheless, this Rapunzel is the best female character that Disney gives us since Princess Jasmin. To be honest, as much as it's disturbing, i found her very sexy and i wonder if her genes aren't not rated (look for a C. S.). But, looks don't make soul and her personality is as well very engaging: she dreams, she smiles and she cares! I don't know the original fairy tale but i really appreciate the lessons of rebellion and emancipation depicted here: As teens, we are torn between fear of parents and joy of disobeying and the solution is to learn how to say 'no' to our parents. Here, those moments are showed with wisdom and talent.Finally, my niece was happy because she was lifted by this beautiful pink princess (almost a sister for her) while my nephew got bored because the movie was lacking action and fights! In a decade, i am sure he will change his opinion!",10,23,26,15 January 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," a pure wrath juice mixed with a lot of cries (rental)
","This remarkable movie is among the best ever done for emotional content and in spite of its old age, it confirms me 3 facts:1) I have always heard John ford about open fields, distant horizons and that's true here: the unlikely journey of the family offers us stunning visuals about the wild, dangerous and yet beautiful american landscape and yes, it's maybe even more gripping in black and white!2) This old movie is an eye opener about exploitation of men by men and it's much more essential than the today cries about skin, gender, sex or arms. The last prejudices are just like toys for babies, bones for dogs, something easy and inoffensive to focus the attention while the main, big attack is left untouched and unchallenged! In a way, those old american movies were thus more intelligent, assertive and free back then than today because i can't name a single recent movie about the poor, the exploited and the left-over of the American Dream while crisis and inequalities have never been so strong! 3) This old movie is like Missisipi Burning a precious proof for the case prosecuting America! So this country genocides natives, crushed workers rights, corrupts its politicians, makes war all over the globe, practiced slavery and segragation but ends up considered like the worldwide light of freedoom! Just unbelievable (and excellent propaganda)! Here the case is clear: money is the only value, reference to deal with people life, law is made for the rich and powerful and that's all! Thus destroying farms is lawful, mourning relatives and memories is a waste of time... In the same period, Soviets were into collective farming and they are the only bad guys! Honestly, in America, lands is owned by a few tycoons so i don't see a fundamental difference. In Germany, labor camps were built and those that we watched in sunny free California seems to be like them: workers behind barb wire, in barracks with the minimum of comfort and exploited to their death!And for sure, Ma Joad is an exceptional angel, a unforgettable ray of light in this world of terrible darkness: a must see if you have human feelings!",10,2,4,29 March 2018
Empire of the Sun," Baleman begins (cinematheque)
","I really like this movie for the same reasons that most people despise it: First, they say that Spielberg's choice to present wartime like a park game is inappropriate. Well, as the story is about a teen, I think that this angle is particularly accurate. When we were kids, we don't see the same world as adults and sometimes they can be joyful in the darkest hours. Next, they say that Williams score is too much. For me, this is one of his best score and he excels as much with the songs than with the music. How many score do you whistle leaving the theater? In conclusion, 'Empire' is one of my favorite because with all this and more: emotion is everywhere and that's precisely what those critics ignore: at the end, the only question is how we feel? Here, i feel excellent, having touched the core of humanity as Jim touched the planes. And i can add more if you want: Bale is an extraordinary beginner and he really carries the picture all by himself. Then, we discover the world and the history of the Far East and it's cool to have a good epic nowadays. Again ? Well, Spielberg was particularly fit and inventive here because he really knew how to put together in the same frame, war, innocence, upper classes and people. If a lot of great directors have a favorite genre (Burton, Lynch), Spielberg is the only great with all: romance, SF, comedy, action.... Maybe people dislike the movie because they focus too much on Malkovich's character, which is indeed a very dark soul, completely driven by his self-seeking survival. He really haunts the movie and it's the black hole of this empire of the sun...Pairing: 'Schindler's list': another hopeful message from a war camp.",10,3,7,27 March 2012
The Devil Wears Prada," Mine wore Tati (DVD)
","A past colleague told me to watch this movie as we worked also with a sadistic, awful female boss. However, Octopus (my nickname for her) wasn't in fashion and wore stained and ridiculous clothes (a big pink coat that makes her look like a sweet!). The other differences between those devils that mine was always saying malevolent things instead of Meryl who never falls into this. But yes, they knew how to ask to do multiple tasks immediately and didn't understand that time can't be created! Unlike Anne who doesn't stay a good girl except at the beginning, i just kept fighting for a fair treatment from the start to my departure for a better job 3 years later. Thus, this movie fails quickly to be interesting because Anne turns finally into the dark side and prefers her career to her friends and family. As a boyfriend says wisely, keeping answering her phone is the relation that she chooses. Losing one's soul is a painful and sad moment and it's worse when it happens in the superficial and lavish world of fashion.",4,1,2,14 May 2011
Rocky II," Nostalgia knocks me (tv)
","You can see right once that this movie is from the past century as the focus is about hard working, simple people trying to get an happy life and sticking for that to a body of values! For me, this philosophy is indeed the true heart of Rocky and it's really not important if Rocky wins or not. For that, Sly is perfect as he seems to act naturally : big but loving mouth, small but well-educated brain. Talia Shire is his perfect wife as she is this sweet shy mouse who becomes a mother and finally a support in his boxing career. Maybe i turn into a old grouch, but those late 70s movies were also cooler than 2K10 : no CGI, no mobiles and colored fashion as well. Next, whereas actual movies always happen in NYC or LA, this one was shot live in Philadelphia. In conclusion, it's an interesting sequel and at least, a movie that can't be done anymore.",10,0,0,31 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The best is in the middle (screen) (dvd)
","I discovered Star Wars at 6 years old with 'The Empire Strikes Back', already an 'middle piece' of the first trilogy. Dark Vador got me fever then but I became addicted maybe less by the movies than by the toys.22 years after, it's the opposite (good proof of maturity, I suppose): the toys are stored for my future children and I pay more attention to the new trilogy. What hooks me now, is the ability of those Star Wars movies to bring me peace of mind every time I feel down (more & more as the years pass).I first saw this new 'middle piece' in Bruxelles but the DVD made this experience even more enjoyable.With all the very interesting bonuses, I really share the dedication, motivation, enthusiasm & teamwork of all people involved in its conception, from George Lucas to the mere extra. I admire their creative process because they have to imagine & built everything, and their management style is a model because it is their job & they have fun: a big change from my office life (one of my many cares).Then, 'Attack of the Clones' speaks about universal values: from democracy to romance & their failures (tyranny & loneliness), the fundamental aspirations of every one are told. This chapter is a bit unique in all the trilogies because it is the only one which deals with the difficulty of building a relationship: Lucas conveys truths about 'attachment', 'the wave of feelings to contain',... . It helps to make sense for anyone facing the same problems (my major cares) The minor problem is that this deepness is only evident if you listen to the commentary. Otherwise, you are likely to only see fights, droids, planets,  So the paradox of having this mega-super-blockbuster speaking about so personal traits are never seen in others movies. That's maybe one of many keys to the magic of Star Wars, explaining why people cherish to work for & why audience loves to attend !",7,0,1,29 December 2006
Corpse Bride," Too Dark to become an enjoyable memory (Screen)
","Even it's my 2nd Tim Burton's of the year, proving that he is one of the finest director, Corpse's Bride is a major disappointment.Its flaws are its very dark mood and the lack of funny moments. Unlike 'Nightmare before Christmas', which is its unavoidable reference, nothing here to balance the Gothic: a lavished town, greedy characters, a cold forest in the night, a chilly church, a sad love story... If the hope of the world of after life could bring more light, I don't find it poetic but ridiculous, tidy and boring (i don't like big band jazz). The exceptional fairy spirit of Jack Skelllington is dead, as well as the humor of the Bettlegeuse, Joker or martians....Well, except for a great score of the little Mozart (as always, and this time with a simple piano theme...), my only memory is all this sadness. As i am not depressive or Gothic, I don't think I will see it again.....",1,4,12,21 November 2005
The Godfather: Part II," More God, Less Father! Godfather Marathon  28/12/08  17H00 (Screen)
","This second part was projected after a short pause of 30 min. If the movie is the longest and I never felt it dull, it's the weakest of the trilogy in my opinion.The 60's trip into the Cuban revolution was too far away from the italo-American roots of the family. Maybe the drive of Michael Corleone to build his empire makes him too cold? But it was a pleasure to see Al playing with his mentor (Lee Strasberg) and watch their complicity.The great moment of this movie was the story of the Don played by De Niro. He speaks little but when he said something, you'd better listen. The life of immigrants in little Italia around 1900 was very well depicted. Except those flashbacks, it's really about the criminal life thus putting aside the family content which is the heart of those movies. Happily, there's a part III.",4,11,26,12 January 2009
Fargo," Far good (tv)
","I like very much Frances and that was my motivation to see this movie. It was a great surprise to see that William « Frank » Macy stars also, all the more than his character could be the sober twin of the Gallagers family patriarch. On the other hand, it was a disappointment to notice Stormare as this actor really cringes me with his too much attitude verified as always in this movie. As i have written in my review for « Arizona Junior », the Cohen brothers are the movies cousin of Stephen King as they are really share this taste for the rural America. Here, the country land is all the more put in relief as it's winter time. The story is interesting because it's a true drama that is chilly as it's unbelievable that the husband found such a stupid idea and such bums to help him ! In this strange world, Frances is totally exceptional : i can't really explain but she has the gift to put me at rest, to make me happy and her character is really like this : she smiles to everyone, she is respected by her friends, her co-workers, she has a caring husband and will be soon a mother. It's a really change from the today cops as violent as the criminals they arrest. This Frances recalls Columbo, Dale Cooper, Fox Mulder, the strong arm of the law but with a big heart. She worths truly her Oscar and the movie is really good !",10,1,1,5 February 2015
The Aviator," Industrial crash (dad)
","I got prejudices against this movie, even before I watched it! First of all, it's a Biopic and so far the Hollywood ones proved to be inept: 1) they reorganize the fact to be like they want them to be and not like they are in reality 2) An artist exists by his artistic creation and the process to get them is irrelevant. Due to the title (aviator) I expected the movie to be just a rich hobby about flying that could only appeal to rich: I don't see why as a simple citizen, I could be interested in such child-play So I put the DVD and start the movie with Scorcese comments: as soon as I understand it's also a movie about (old) Hollywood, my tiny little interest for it just got totally extinguished as for me, movies about movies are the ground-zero of filmmaking: I just don't understand how such movies can be produced except to please the navel-gazing ego-centrism of this little world! It would be like reading books about writing or listening to album about making music! It's silly, a huge loss of time so I just skip chapters to only watch scenes between DiCaprio and Beckinsale: Sure the production is lavish, every one has fantastic wardrobe but nothing comes of it: later, DiCaprio lives like a hobo in his house and Beckinsale helps him to get ready for a Senate hearing: honestly, why should I care? What's the point to such story? I just don't give it a Sh!t.This quickest 3 hours movie i watched just adds tons to my opinion that Scorcese is a poor director, totally overrated and he finds such support from the establishment because they just need to find a name!",1,1,6,30 September 2017
Léon: The Professional," It's NOEL for Natalie (DVD)
","Funny but Natalie comes from natale, thus the birth of Christ, thus Christmas or Noel in french! Seriously, for her first feature, she got a wonderful gift and was able to give in return a tremendous acting! I don't know for others stars but at her age of 13, she shows that she can cry and laugh and express all the feelings between with an evident talent! That's the kind of interpretation that hooked me for life. Her Mathilda character is very valuable because i find 'beauty' in compassion, fragility and funny spirit. Those give us great moments of movies: the ring at the gateway, the disguise game, ... It was great to see how she can lead Reno (who isn't a soft man), how he can lead her on the final battle and how she is dismissed by Aiello.I think the movie owes a lot to Reno as well and also to Besson. For the legend, it was him who found Natalie and gave her a chance, it was him who nurtured the cast with such grace (and that was him who directed the movie. If i like American movies in France, french movie in America are scarcer and indubitably, Besson has brought his French touch: i have never seen New York like this and his camera is alive, wide open, a mix between De Palma and Lynch! The opening credit is an homage to this 'Big Blue' with the shock of civilization (we even saw the Twin Towers).I don't know if a 'Lolita' vision is acute here but i think that anlecture that links unconsciously the flower as a feminine womb and the milk as a male semen add very powerful sense to the relationship! A unique masterpiece in conclusion all the worth that a sequel seems highly unlikely.",10,5,9,20 September 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The Fellowship of hard work (DVD)
","Visiting Middle Erath is an huge journey: it took 13 years to Tolkien to write it, almost 6 years to Jackson to shoot it. For me, LOTR knocks at my door every decade: I read the first book upon recommendation by a friend in high school in 1991 (without finishing the two others books). Then, i went to see this first adaptation in 2001 but it's only now, in 2010 that i have watched the entire trilogy, taking a day of vacation to do so: first between 7.00 and 10.00, the second between 11.00 to 14.00 and the third between 15.00 and 18.00 just in time to catch my holidays train at 19.40.I really have a like/dislike with this work: As it's fantasy, it's fascinating but Tolkien wrote it like history and it's as boring as school books. Consequently, i don't feel the same intensity of other fiction heroes (Harry Potter, Spiderman, ...). In other words, the story is too much about facts and lacks some passion, especially romances.Nevertheless, this first movie was a good moment and with the first Harry Potter, it made the year 2001, the second best Christmas movies ever, behind 1984 (Ghosbusters + Gremlins).The opening at the Shire really set the tone for the trilogy because it's the warmest and liveliest place in middle earth. After, all the locations goes grimier and grimier up until the dreadful Mordor. The appeal of this first movie, in addition to be the one that exposes the characters and places, is that it's the only one that reunites the fellowship. Thus, we don't find the separate stories that plagues the sequels and it's a harmonious flow. Another strong point of this movie is that we really appreciate the beauty of natural landscapes. Sure, the shoots are digitally enhanced later but at least, at the beginning, it's nature and not blue screen!",7,1,1,8 January 2011
The Village," Very sleepy but not hollow (dad)
","Shamalayan follows the footsteps of Spielberg as the two are really into delivering a story: for sure, this movie has a really mysterious one that catches the attention of the audience. However Shamalayan has not his skills as this movie just crumbles unto itself with its boring, endless dull scenes and terrible lack of pace! We have left with some beautiful Gothic American pastoral landscape (as seen in the movie parodied in my title), a few really tense moment but most of the time, i have been bored and used my remote control to give first aid to this comatose movie! It's funny to notice that in 2017 i just kept watching Hurt in movies and that Phoenix is still unable to give us a character with passion!",4,1,1,28 January 2017
Bridge of Spies," A bridge too far (paytv)
","The 1st thing I noticed is that even Spielberg has turned into this blue/orange grading so that's the proof that things have really turn bad! But his Kaminsky knows at least to compose with lights and for some really brief moments, I thought I was back into the X-files! Next, this movie is clearly divided into 2 parts: the one in US about the trial of the soviet spy and the other in Berlin about the exchange. The 1st one is the best as in Munich, Amistad and Lincoln, Spielberg defends justice for all and punches the security pretext! However, the 2nd part is just awful, filled with candid sugar (Hanks is also responsible) and totally unbelievable! In addition, the movie is much too long because of a lot of useless scenes (U2 mission, the detention, ). At the end, Spielberg is really far of his best: he proves one more time that he is very fragile on political movies but at least, he did them and he has found a great old actor with the soviet spy.",4,3,5,31 December 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Why two movies? (IMAX)
","It's my second IMAX experience with HP after the 'goblet of fire'. This time is better, maybe because i have indeed real all the fabulous books written by Rowling. Thus so far, i have only watched the 1st, 4th and 7th movies because i wait them to be released in a box set to grasp the entire saga.I find this movie enjoyable because it matches my mental pictures i got when i read this volume. There isn't no boring moment even when the characters are lost in their confusion. Two sets really amazed me: The ministry of magic and Godric's hollow.However, the pace is maybe too fast because I got some holes at the narrative. First of all, this kind of movie should begin with a resume of previous movies. I take notes while reading thus i don't understand why the filmmakers don't do this same effort for the audience. If i went there with the kid, i imagine he would have been totally throw back by the beginning because a torture with dark people sitting around a table and a huge snake would appear crazy for the non initiated! Next, i didn't understand the problem that Voldemort has with his wand, how many horcruxes haven already been destructed and how many are left, why have they been followed in London.Beyond those remarks about adaptation, the movie really takes its strength in the fantastic trio of actors. I think it really great to have seen those kids becoming mature, even though the movies get darker and darker and more violent.Now, i must wait almost a year to watch the end: another stupid production decision as the choice to expurgate John William's themes !",7,0,0,22 January 2011
Knowing," 2009-04-08/48-51-44—2-21-3/19-15/10-10
","I give '10' to this sometimes-clumsy movie, which doesn't make me feel good furthermore. That's a proof that it has something big inside.Indeed, I have never seen movies with such brilliant and haunting ideas, which linked together, form something powerful.Here, they are:# Predicability or Fate: Are we free to decide or are we mere puppets? The lecture Cage delivers to his students is excellent because even my grandmother would have understand it# encrypted prophecies: breaking the code is thrilling. Here, film-making is better than a mere book because it brings visual strength to an idea barely explained by words. The google search is thus an excellent idea. Then, knowing what will happen is provocative. How can you prevent it? # Apocalypse: it's one of the rare movies in which 'everyone else' is doomed. You get particularly anxious for the last moments. For Cage, those with his son and his last final heartbeats are really pretty moving. So sadness and love together, it's terrific! Again, the choice of Beethoven 7rd Symphony is pretty astute and it is something a book can't deliver (except if you switch on your Hi-Fi)# E.T. are God(s): Already seen in Indiana Jones and a great debate: it's sure that UFO (if they exist) are the fairy tales of our modern, technological societies, and that would happen like God(s) to the primitive men. It's maybe the weakest part of the movie, because I still don't understand if they are more 'chosen'.In fact, all those questions is one single question, that's 'Is God exist'? If you try to answer this, you will have to answer all those thematic, and backwards, when you deal with any one of this thematic, you ask yourself this fundamental question and you do an act of belief, even if you aren't conscious And the better is that the movie can't answer clearly any of them!All the cast/characters is excellent and moving: Cage as a single but lost father, his son as a mature and witty boy, his girlfriend with her fragility of having a terrible legacy!In my opinion, it would have been the perfect final movie for the 'X-Files'. As a sequel is unlikely, it would have been an unforgettable goodbye, all the more poignant that with Mulder running all his life about UFO and Scully always wondering about God, they would have joined finally but shortly together!",10,1,6,19 April 2009
The Shining," Tsiegretlop ? (dvd)
","I ask the question because the very first thing we hear about the hotel is this shared dramatic roots : the place was a sacred burial ground that has become desecrated for modern life ! There's no doubt that Kubrick was a talented director : The way he shoots this empty, majestic haunted hotel is indeed fabulous ! Usually, when a movie takes place in a single location (ex : « million dollar hotel »), the director pays no attention to it while it's the first character ! Here, we understand the topography, we know the different places so we are really immersed in what happens between the characters. In addition, the sights are totally incredible as well in natural outdoors as sophisticated indoors and i'm really fond of social, collective places becoming desert (ex : a mall like in « career opportunities »)Now, it's hard to tell if the movie is frightening as i'm an adult, i have read the novel and i have watched it a long time ago ! Actually, the way dark forces twist the family is really original because except for very graphic moments, the horror is mostly verbal and psychological : to illustrate those fears and anguish, I found the cast really talented : Danny plays great when we think how young he was ; His mother was really caring for the whole family and shows resources when needed and Jack was indeed a fabulous puppet man driven crazy ! So maybe the flaw was just him as King told : if Jack is perfect when crazy, he is unfit to play the normal guy : at the start of the movie, he doesn't act like the perfect husband, loving father or motivated employee so we lost his unexpected fall and thus a lot of the dark intensity of the movieBut, after 36 years, the movie doesn't look old and senile and with that late 70s fashion and design, it's still pertinent and a must see movie today !!",7,2,6,29 May 2016
"I, Robot"," 4th rule: My review is useful (dvd)
","I can't judge this adaptation as I never read a single book of Asimov. But, first of all, it was great to see Science Fiction on a big screen because it's indeed a great but hard genre. Its basic rule to deal with ideas is respected here because this movie makes think about the robots. I think the modern, bright and chromatic design and cast are excellent: the duo of Will, Mr Cool and Bridget, Miss Cold, works perfectly. Unfortunately, the story is a bit complicated and a lot of the social effects of robots are left over. Worse, the future world is too close to our daily lives and by comparison, the funny and eccentric vision of 'Back to the future Part II' is more interesting. The ending is really reminiscent of 'Ronin', the comic book of Frank Miller. But finally, after watching it, I want to look at Asimov's writings. Thus this movie is successful in that sense.",7,0,1,9 October 2011
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Jungle Fever (Screen)
","As i saw it the 1st January, it was my first movie of the year. If it gives a trend, well the year will be a happy ride. I was in the company of the kid of my friend, who had the luck to see the first part on TV right before. I never see it actually (just heard my old parents telling it was very funny) but after this sequel, I would like very much to take a look.About this one, I just fell 'in love' with the lion Alex: there are a lot of animal characters in animation, but this character has a head above all others! He is really the King! First, he is really well drawn at all ages but he has also a kind personality: He isn't dumb nor too smart too, he loves very much his parents and crave for their acknowledgment. Friendship means a lot for him and he is very brave. It's a deeply rich character who has much to say! That's a change! Sometimes real actors haven't all this!!!In addition, he has a good team around him: the penguins, the monkeys and the hippopotamus, which in her way, is sensual! No kidding! The story isn't really the genius idea but rather serves to expand the growth and interactions between the characters. So you got fun, moving moments and that's nice! The kid & I had good times and we moved it, moved itÂ….A special thought for my ex-colleagues because every time I saw the posters with the tag-line 'Always together, Always lost', I think to them!",7,0,3,20 January 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Back to the present (screen) (vhs)
","Honestly Scharwzie left me cold (I prefer Sly) but his two terminator movies are really great: this one is more action than science- fiction and if the chases are a bit repetitive, the movie is really enhanced by its cast: Hamilton the human mother is hard as a killing cyborg, T1 is a cyborg becoming human, Patrick is sensational as a deadly silent focused new cyborg and Furlong is awesome as the teen geek! Now for sure, some scenes seems a bit old-fashioned (the future) but at least, all the stunts were real and have this density factor! For me this movie is also an amazing game for Gameboy and expected articles from magazines! In fact, i understand that this 80s past has 2 major time paradox: John Connors father comes from the future and also T1 hand/Bio-chip as the foundation of Skynet! So it's a pity that the final is too much like the first one because i would do it more BTTF way: in front of this deadly and unbeatable T1000, i would have T1 plunge into this fire with the hand/Bio-chip and so T1000 would have been erased by this new continuum!! So it's indeed a fun movie that grips you but i would have put a bit less action for a bit more time paradox, great Scott :)",10,0,2,1 April 2017
Salt," Coarse Salt (3 days Screen Marathon)
","A spy thriller with Angelina Jolie seemed promising.But, after the first five minutes of movie, at the time she is released from the Chinese jail, the dialog was stupid: 'No speaking while on bridge' to just murmur 'Your boyfriend is there'. Thus, as the best spy, my instinct warned me that this one would be a huge disappointment.Afterwards, this alarm is confirmed: the script is unbelievable whereas the action is good.Finally, you got a strange movie: the impossible stunts performed by Angie seems likely but a likely devilish plot from Russia seems Science-Fiction: JFK killed by a Russian twin, a threatened president protected by a small squad, a meeting of OTAN at the White House, a video game program for nuclear attack.In some paradoxical way, what's on screen is more believable than what's is told.As i never felt involved in this really bad script, the movie was dull and Angie couldn't save it this time.",4,2,5,24 October 2010
The Patriot," May impure blood water our fields! (dvd)
","I don't know the exact reason but the American Revolution have always interested me (more than mine in 1789). Maybe it's because as a kid i had a wargame called 'Yorktown', that was unfortunately unplayable but with a board and pieces fascinating. Last year, i read the novel 'New York' from Rutherfurd and the years of this war were among the best pages of the book. In movies, i recall only 'Revolution' with Pacino that i sadly rate '1'. Thus, my expectations were high with this movie, all the more that it included my best actor behind Pacino, this is to say Mel Gibson.Mel differs from Al in the sense that Mel is more fatherly but in the meantime more torn by inner madness. Here, his two traits are brilliantly exposed but the movie is far more interesting by the fact that it makes understand how it is to be a civilian victim of war.Today, war is a TV show and we are faraway of any threats. Here, the battle happens in your garden, your house is destroyed by the first belligerent that comes, your community is shot to make up for the lost battles.Next, the movie is a great lesson of history: it recalls that France had really been decisive in helping the colons and that it was the only army before 1950 where whites and blacks were fighting together.With all those facts and a beautiful cinematography, the movie is a very strong drama. On a more trivial note, i only knew Ledger as his Joker part and seeing him naturally and playing a good son was moving.",7,2,12,5 August 2011
Edward Scissorhands," E.T. lands in Frankenweenie (cinematheque)
","My final movie of Tim at the Cinematheque is maybe is best: As 'Nightmare', it results from the collision of two impossible ideas: here, suburbs and fairy tale. The mix is simply funny and deeply romantic as well. The suburban life is indeed the trademark of all the great American filmmakers and all the ones that I like (Tim, Spielberg and Lynch) have the same desire to blow up the boring, calm, peaceful life there. The concept of bored housewives is maybe born here and Tim illustrates it with many characters and outstanding visual concept: the pastel pavilions, the dancing cars, the garden!Strangely, the mess inside comes here not from Poltergeist, lost extraterrestrial or lodge spirits but about welcoming a new neighbor. This first collaboration with Depp is maybe his best because as a bit introvert person, he fits the character like a glove. The second collaboration with Wynona is excellent as well: I prefer her in black but it's funny to learn that blonde is her real color. Her family is a bit particular but they are very tolerant and heart giving and it's a good lesson for today world where our neighbors have become totally strangers. The ice of the cake is the beautiful romance that arises as well and the ice dance is a perfect moment of fairy tale that even Disney never has match. Danny's score sublimates the emotion of the moment and his entire soundtrack is the ultimate proof of the genius of the little maestro and it's really a shame that he never has won so far an Oscar. ******Now that my run at the Cinematheque is over and that I have seen 12 Spielberg's movies and as much of Tim, i can try a comparison between those two: For me, Steven is ahead of Tim because he is most versatile and above all, he is a better storyteller (with a great eye for the camera) and thus can bring big emotions. The biggest lacking of Tim is the persistent use of the same cast: when it's Jeffrey Jones, Micheal Keaton, Wynona or Lisa-Marie, it's good but the pairing of the two introvert Depp and Bonham is just boring and the list of movies that they killed becomes long. Tim's assets are that he has a more artistic side than Steven's and he is above all more open to women. In relationships, romances or strong woman characters, Steven is very shy and a bit cold. Now, if cinematheque should start a new cycle, i would vote for Coppola so wait and see!",10,0,0,21 May 2012
Van Helsing," Fun All Things (DVD)
","Yeah! This movie has got it all: fun, cast, sets and characters ! This super team of Dracula + Wolfman + Frankenstein + Hyde is a great idea and their reunion is built like a sincere homage to those monsters and not a parody.Being shot live in middle Europa, i have the feeling of those old Gothic Hammer movies.The cast is talented: Dracula sounds of noble birth, Anna is a sexy gypsy and Van Helsing is 'wolverinesque'.Sommers is a good director as his movies offers always great colors, action and stunning visuals.In conclusion, this movie like 'Mars Attacks' succeeds in doing a very modern movie while staying faithful to the spirit of those old movies.",7,1,3,14 October 2010
Rocky IV," When Rocky movies will be consider as worthy cult movies ? (payTV)
","The Rocky saga is just among the best ever however a lot of people consider Stallone as an idiot without talent and those sequel movies as just repetitive stupid fights !! But if you take this one, once again, Stalone has a winning one ! The characters gets old, deepen The background is still changed and moves to politics this time with cold war and detente. The soundtrack is incredible with hits like « burning heart », « no easy way out », « living in America » It's filled with essential values about family, friendship, life and there are plenty of very moving moments The directing and acting are wonderful, with great fights choreography and over the top newcomers !! So for 90 minutes it's just total fun and i just miss those kind of movies and for sure Rocky teaches me a lot about life and tons of Hollywood big names can't hold this !!!",10,3,5,28 September 2016
Step Up 2: The Streets," Sexy (!) Dance 2 --- the french title --- (Screen)
","Dancing is my pet-peeve. When i am in a party, i feel like the most miserable person in the world!Why do i buy a ticket for this movie then ?Just because I was the babysitter of a teenager who is fond of dance. And i must say that we took a great time, even thought our fun was different.If i don't dance more now, i admit that the dancers show a lot of creativity and artistic feeling.Then, it's great to see how teens have fun in US 2008, because habits have evolved from my time.Maybe i don't watch the best movies, but it is not often that teens are depicted with such reality, without any fantastic background. It's not about killers, drugs... it is just about a real passion in nowadays life, and it feels good for a time...And don't look for 'sexy' moments as the french title suggests, because the movie could have been produced by any churches so much it is soft.",4,3,4,12 April 2008
Spider-Man," An AMAZING spiderman (dvd)
","Reviewing Spiderman makes me learn about a few simple rules about critics: # 1. Critics are subjective, because it is the result between The story and Our story. So Spiderman being my first big moment of entertainment in my childhood, its movie could only be viewed with tolerant eyes.# 2. Adaptation is a success if the «spirit» of the work has been understands. Thus, the pleasure for the fan is to live again this spirit, in front of a lot of little differences from the original work. In Spiderman, the spirit is indeed there: a loyal nephew and friend, a torn soul between his dreams and his duties. And the cast embodies perfectly the characters.# 3. The key to evaluate an adaptation is that not only the fans loves it but also the new comers. And I have got 2 friends who likes Spiderman whereas they didn't even read comics !!!! So, if the Xmen is too complicated for the non-initiated, if Superman is too perfect, if Batman is too dark, Spidey is really the Number one of the super heroes in comics and in movies!!!",10,1,2,1 January 2005
Dark City," The title is right : it's dark, very really dark (rental)
","and I don't like the dark!This movie has verified my 5 first minutes rule: if the movie fails to get my interest in those five first minutes, it will be a bore for the remaining time. Here, we are stuck by night in a oppressive town with an amnesic character and unintelligible events! The fatal error of the movie is to cast Sewell as the lead actor as it's a newcomer without presence! This way, I never get into this movie and it was like I was helpless against this dark world! Sure visually and in terms of thematic, the movie is interesting because it's a melting-pot of science fiction / fantasy / film noir movies: Batman's Gotham and Superman's Metropolis, Blade Runner, Hellraiser. In a way, it' also very Dickian: false memories, false world. It has even got Jennifer but she can't eradicate alone those definitive failures! In one word, I watched all the movie on « forward » and it was already too much !",1,14,29,14 May 2015
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry and the prisoner of azkaback to the future (dvd)
","Well, as soon as we left the Yate's movies, the Potter movies are rather good. Newell brought a touch of humor and levity while Cuaron has a really naturalistic feeling. If I had understood, it's the one who had been shot the most outside in the Scottish country and it's clear: the cinematography are extraordinary, much, much better than the dark Yate's movies. Next, if the movie is as calm and dull as the book (it's about an invisible threat without attacks contrary to the previous one), Cuaron took the opportunity to put Hogwarts and its grounds on the stage. We have never seen the school like this and the passing of seasons was depicted with poetry. In fact, as the only story Voldemort- less, the characters make a step behind and in this void, Cuaron was a best choice to shoot this stillness. For me, it was almost a lynchian movie because it was deeply rooted in nature and grabbed a lot of abstract or symbolic shots. I didn't count them but the ring, the circle is a motive repeated a lot here. Next, Williams succeeds an amazing task to double the great themes of Potter's score: after the Hedwig's one, the new one with the flute is excellent. At last, to explain my title, the climax of the story is as exciting than one its predecessor: with movies traveling into time, it's always great to see the characters watching themselves. On the extras disc, you got the best interviews session of the cast with a very supportive host. Thus, if all the ingredients were there for this great potion, the mystery is why they throw it away? NB: beyond the Hyppogryph poop, other funnies details: can anybody explain me why Pettigrew can have his clothes when turning into a human and lost them when he comes a rat?",7,0,1,10 March 2012
Ratatouille," If everyone can be a cook, not everyone can be a critic (Screen)
","Ratatouille made me realize that only a hermit, a monk or a wild bear can review sincerely a movie! As soon as you got friends or a family, you don't watch a feature because you live a sweet memory.For me, it's a repeat from 'Ice Age 2' (already reviewed in IMDb): again an animation movie, the same theater, and above all, the same dear friends (+1)! This time, the experience is even more personal because Ratatouille happens in Paris, where we live! Even thought it is the 50s-style Paris, our feelings were here: if New-York is the city that never sleeps, Paris is the city that never changes! Except for the slow beginning with the crazy grandma, the story is imaginative, mixing fun and tenderness, and the characters are cutely drawn!",4,1,3,7 November 2007
The Amazing Spider-Man," The un-amazing reboot: the dark night rises in spidey costume (screen)
","The key to spidey is that's a super hero for kid. Raimi had understood this and his movies were indeed great. Here, it's not more the case and our friendly neighborhood becomes a silly costumed crusader. I really don't understand why the production wanted a such aggressive spiderman: Discovreing his power, peter punches commuters in the subway. His drive to be spidey is to punch endlessly thugs to see their wrists! Finally, when he does Spidey, it's only at night except for a fight in his high school or in an intelligent mirror effect for his 1st appearance. As peter, he shouts to his uncle, his aunt and the father of his girlfriend! His casting reminds me of Christensen in star wars prequels because this Garfield has the same darkside about him.The rest is also pathetic: The Mays are horrible as well in characters or in casting. Lizard might be okay but his ties with Peter is unbelievable. The Stacys are OK but killing Captain is useless: what's the point to develop a character and a tension if it's not meant to last. And if Emma Stone is a good surprise here, it's just because Dunst was always boring and uninspired. To resume, the first hour dragged horribly, the second makes you angry and it's only the final moment that you will find a decent Spidey but it's not enough and too late. Frankly, the only amazing thing in this movie may be Spidey's web because it's true that the new effects is bluffing.In other words, with Raimi and Maguire movies, i was eager to buy the DVD while i won't even bother to download this one on the web!",1,45,103,10 July 2012
Aliens," Starship troopers (rental)
","This is a amazing sequel that compensates the lack of stunning visual from Alien by a exceptionally strong tension. In addition, the story fits perfectly and the characters of Ripley is deeply analyzed! So if it seems strange that the colony was put into Alien hands as quickly and deeply after just one infection, the marines initial deployment is a moment of anthology: the empty and silent base, the sonar, the video link nearly defines what would be later a genre in video game: 1st person shooter! Later when the aliens comes to them, the suspense of their hidden arrival is wonderful and as Cameron says in the documentary, he had only 6 aliens to play with! Another success of Cameron is the mix of high contrasts: they are the best soldiers with the best tools and they lost the fight against the aliens; in such a violent movie, the maternal moments between Ripley and Newt shine like diamonds, all the more than this young actress is totally believable as a terrorized surviving victim The only thing that hurts me is that it's also the movie that invented the concept of bad-ass heroin, in other words, woman fighting with guns like a man! The question there is not about gender equality but the easy acting out to kill: today it's the norm but the idea that the solution to any conflict is to kill the opponent and in addition with the hands of a woman is disturbing OK Aliens are only space bugs and not really enemies but this was the 1st step into the idea of mass killing...At last, the movie appears so good and excellent now that we have discovered the poor quality of all the following sequels!",10,4,7,8 November 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," future adaptation of my past comics (screen)
","I can't understand why comics and movies can't be one and the same nowadays.Here, the divorce starts with the movie poster: for those who have Byrne's cover in mind, the awful art and meaningless composition used for promoting this adaptation is a disappointment: if you can understand what the movie is about, you are then a genius.Logically, the movie is in the same vein as its poster: instead to adapt Claremont's gripping drama (by the way, he has a cameo as a member of the panel!) and put Byrne's drawings in live action, the movie decides to do its own (bad) way by telling a new complicated story and using awful new design (a bit like the disastrous remake of « the earth stood still »). To resume, all the future time-line is crap: sentinels are ugly, Shadowcat is telepathic and worst of all, the X-men are well alive: all the power of the original story was built on the fact that Rachel Summers and Kitty were the only one living so that their mission just couldn't fail. By the way, by changing all those essential parameters, the movie also erases the big paradox of the comics: As the daughter of Scott and Jean, how could the past in which Rachel is sent was one in which she isn't born yet and her mother has been already killed: If you remember Doc Brown's lessons, you know that it can't happen.The present time-line is much better but it's the direct follow-up of the previous movie. So if you don't have seen it (like me), you will be a bit lost as it's a really unexpected team roaster for X-men (Wolvie, Magneto, Xavier, Beast and Mystique). In addition, the finale wasn't really exciting as it was very similar to the finales of all previous movies. In fact, the movie is only good in its first part, from the arrival of Wolvie to the summit in Paris. The 70s were coolly done and Quicksilver was the only one mutant really used to his potential.As I have already written about «Thor », Hollywood really doesn't understand comics: They are poor writers who think that big special effects are visual achievement !",4,4,10,27 July 2014
American History X," American History X / 10 (DVD)
","Definitely one of a few movies that makes me cry: As the protagonists are fascist brothers, you will surely consider me either as a fascist too, either as a stupid man. The truth is that I care a lot for my twin brother, which is also, above all, the exact quality and strength of this movie.If it lifts the veil behind the American Dream, it is by focusing about a 'pissed off' family. The expression is maybe crude (but told) and it means that they face confusion and fragility. If they live in Venice Beach, it isn't 'Baywatch' anymore, but violence, guns, gangs. After a death in the family, the brother feels the duty to be in charge and realizes that if a better life comes with fights, the fight against colored people isn't the right one ! Watching (again) this movie now is a perfect timing because what the fascist told there are the same issues that arise in my country for the presidential election. That's frightening because in the movie, those speech are supported with swastikas, shaved heads, while in France, it is told by white collars in suit !!!! But reducing this movie to racial hate would be an error because it offers great insight about the confusing aspect of 'real life': The big brother is as much physically powerful than he is full of doubts. The more he gets into morals value, the more he gets problems. So, as for every one, the challenge would be: 'What is the most important: a simple life or a moral life ?'. The little brother, as every little brother (like me) belongs to the ghost universe and he only exists in the light of his big brother. 'When people look at me, they see my brother'. I couldn't have said better! My final appreciation would be for the talented cast (all the family, prof Sweeney, the courageous Stacy 'Mike Hammer' Keach) and the director Tony Kayes, who blends the intense material in a artistic & very moving way!And all this to get only one Oscar nomination for best actor (Edward Norton), my motto would be appropriate: 'I don't understand !!!!!!'",10,1,3,18 April 2007
Pearl Harbor," More accurately: the Doolittle Raid (dvd)
","I know this sounds less commercial than 'Pearl Harbor' but it's the truth: the climatic attack happens well before the end of the movie and after it, there is still more than one hour of movie. Thus, this last part turns the movie from classic to average because it's dull. Roosevelt looks like the penguin and his drama told with too much emphasis! The wonderful character we have met so far turn into wrecks: the soldier Betty saves actually operates in this top-secret mission; Worst: imagine that Rafe wait the death of his best friend to tell him he's a father! When you are called into a suicide mission and if you have heart, you tell the truth as soon as possible to motive your partner.So, for me, the movie ends with Pearl Harbor and i must say it's a good one so far. The 40's are recreated like a shiny world and the Japanese aren't seen as inferiors. The romance isn't extraordinary but is rather excellently served by the cast. The movie sounds right when you see the hundreds of Japanese planes fly silently over Hawai, without any reaction from Americans. They were totally taken by surprise, the same way they were hit on 9/11. As the movie was released just before the event, i wonder how the audience have felt then. Unlike 'Transformers' of the same Bay, the attack is well shot in the sense that you understand what happens on the screen.In conclusion, as it's more a fiction, it would have been better to end the movie with Pearl Harbor and to resolve the plot at that day(and cut also the sequence of the dog rescued, worthless and stupid). Maybe it was too much for them!",4,1,2,14 July 2011
No Strings Attached," Not personally attached (web)
","Well, this movie offers to change course of a relationship: usually, the couple meets, discovers each other and finally expresses their communion in an intimate relationship. Here, it's the opposite: they begin with intercourse and they want to achieve more. Well, this idea leaves me completely cold, as I don't want such experience. And what to say about a father and son sharing the same girl? It's a comedy and I'm supposed to laugh? And for sure, all the characters that fall ill go to the hospital where Nathalie works. No way for that BS...Then, the movie is the 8 462 512 same used cliché about i love you – i don't love you – i miss you... No way it happens like this in reality and i really don't understand why Hollywood keeps making such empty, disconnected movies?In addition, the story involves as usual, privileged families that have outstanding occupation: famous college, medical intern, movies assistant! For me, it's the sure choice to suffocate any emotions. At last, the casting is awful: Kuchner is among my list of worst actor ever: he hasn't changed since he ruined 'a lot like love' with Amanda! Not a funny line, close to a slug. Now, Natalie is totally wasted here: when you make a movie about sex, you find the adequate actress (= Sharon Stone in 'basic instinct'). Here, with all the deep intelligence and education Natalie has, i can't believe her drinking, having sex just for sex and saying the big words. She is much more worthy than this kind of character. The ice of the cake was to discover that it was a Reitman's movie! In conclusion, one of his worst and the same for Natalie!",1,7,8,14 October 2013

","It is a perfect fairy tale for kids and parents as well.The story is a melting pot of fairies tale (gentle princess, cute prince, bad-stepmother and more) but happens now in New-York, so I was quickly win over.Don't expect a Roger Rabbit cousin, because, there is more live action than animation: the cartoon occurs only at the beginning and at the end. But the drawing really looks like the cast.The only regret is that relationship feelings seem to be easily changed, which is absolutely out of their nature for me, and 2/3 of the family was absent.",4,3,8,25 January 2008
The Duchess," Excellent Keira in a pitiful movie (tv)
","To resume, Keira plays the free-spirited wife of a royal and we should be moved by the injustices she endures ? Sorry but no way for me : for sure, as movies are done by privileged people, some of them can face hard times and maybe that class is interested and praises such movie ! but myself, as a worker and a citizen in a so-called democracy, i just don't give a s...t to the cries of the upper class ! This movie has the value to get into splendid houses and manors to understand their way of life : they have so much rooms for free and servants, maids to answer all their needs while having an really easy idle life that really i just don't care if they are happy or not ! With such privileges, they should be helpful giving hands instead of hypocritical lessons givers ! So this movie really left me cold and i'm a bit tired to see Keira as an aristocrat crying in period movies. But at least, England knows how to look back at its past because in France, i don't see movies about that time !",1,1,3,9 October 2016
Flashdance," Flashback (web)
","I'm really surprised: i always thought that 'Flashdance' was a cult movie and i see that it's rated at 5,8 on IMDb so close to a stinker!Personally, i watched it last night and even after 30 years, I found it an excellent movie. It's really tied with the 80s and that's its charm: It's about ordinary people, who work hard (for the money), have moral beliefs and have sex in intimacy. So it's the total opposite of nowadays pictures that involves lazy upper classes people, who believes in their own justice and wallows in luxury!So, it was refreshing to see this young woman riding her bicycle, helping her friends, doing a man job for living and pursuing her dreams. I really like the setting in Pittsburgh, as it was not glamor. If you cut all the musical sequences (and there's a lot), you have a very fast movie that goes for the main thing so it's not boring. The dance sequences are enough diverse (classic, street, club) to not be dull as well and they are well directed with good songs: 'what a feeling', 'Maniac' and 'she works hard for the money' are really hits that are still highly audible today! I can't remember any other movies with so much good songs ! Lyne is a good director as he gives excellent frames and deepness and uses new technology (the strobing effect for example).At last, Jennifer was an amazing newcomer: she was really good here and it's a bit a pity that she has such a strange career. She had the right to even refuse the sequel, but with her, it would have been interesting to discover what finally her character has done of her life!For sure, there are some problems: it's a bit unrealistic (her accommodation, the ideal boyfriend driving a Porsche and having a long arm). But there is also a lot of humanity: all her friends failed or died so we really care about her fate!So, i rate the maximum (10) and i hope people will follow me as well!",10,0,0,25 August 2013

Another time, another world.13 years after, the magic is gone unless you got 5 years old, in reference to the happiness of my friend's son! From my point of view, the movie is filled with great action but the story and locations are a deception. It's a sequel of 'Casino Royal' so if you haven't watch it as me, you don't understand the main thing! Gone the spies, the gadgets, it's a Bond with a vengeance! Very much like 'A View To Kill' and at its release, its darkness was the motive of firing Timothy Dalton! Will the thunder strikes again? For those who don't understand the enigmatic title, 'Quantum of Solace' means the littlest amount of solace you must find in a relationship. When you don't find it, you know it's time to turn the page. A good advice in my actual life!",4,2,4,9 November 2008
To Rome With Love," Horribile (web)
","Well, having an handful Allen's movie under my belt now (just because he casts actresses I like like Amanda, Natalie, Monica), i wasn't expected much of this movie. As it's indeed dull, i'm not disappointed.If it's a comedy, it's not funny. If it's a romance, it's not moving. I cannot say either if it's an Italian movie that speaks sometimes English or the contrary, but in the end, the double languages are tiring. The story is nonexistent as it's exploded between 4 separate threads that are as flat as each other. Finally, even the locations are trashy: sure, you explore Roma a lot but the golden cinematography kills everything! Allen even succeeds to give Monica the worst part in her career: she really has nothing to do here! With the recent watching of 'Nine', it's funny to see big American directors failing disastrously to catch 'bella vita'! Coppola should laugh...",1,3,9,8 October 2013

Every review is subjective: * A movie offers you what your personnal story brings into it. * A sequel is like a friend: if you like the first, you will like the following....So I like the first opus, and thus, i am a fan of this movie.Then, the movie analyses the family: wedding, babies education, pregnancy, etc.... Every one can relate to this thema: I am not married, not a father but i have a brother who faces this. So, it is funny to see how the characters live the same events. Sometimes we can think, 'it is true', other times, 'it's funny they try this'....In other words, the movie is interesting because there is a communication between the screenplay & the audience life...But, to make a good communication, you need good medium.

Saving Private Ryan," Shutting up private Ryan (Cinematheque)
","Among all Spielberg's movies that I saw at the festival, this is the only one when I felt nothing leaving out except being disappointed and angry. Worst, I felt like this as soon as the first scene. Seeing this old man walking alone with his wife and family trotting behind was like a slap at my face. At this old age and having survived the war, it was extremely selfish for him to act like this. Having watched buddies killed and thus never experienced their family life, it was like he haven't learn anything of this trauma, for him or for them.Next, we are thrown at D-Day. It's the more interesting part of the movie: the value of any single soldier's life is dramatically visualized: those poor guys who got killed as soon as they opened the door of their boats are the true noble and courageous ones. They were sent to slaughter but they stick to their orders. For that matter, during WWI, a relative of my grand mother died the same way: In spite of being terribly myopic, he was among the first to be sent at the front and as it's above all rabbles, he lost his glasses and was killed immediately. Personally, I would never have behaved like them because I would have gone awol as much to not be killed as to not kill. At this moment, Spielberg's takes you in the guts and he may be the first director to show how bloody and stupid the war is. But as his trademark and sensibility lead him to find hope in this complete darkness, the story becomes a rescue mission. It could have been moving but the characters of this platoon is rather a band of capricious and lunatic soldiers: one wants to hang on with a child, the other left a German alive, the one that killed them later and finally, we met again with Mr. Ego who doesn't want to leave because he has a bridge to defend. Sure, as they stay there, they got all killed. Well, it was too much for me: I don't understand how Spielberg wanted the audience to relate with such stupidity . A life later, this private Ryan remains totally shameful as he rejects his family and I really wonder if he should have been left behind instead.Pairing: '1941' a good laugh at WWII but not for the same reasons.",1,3,11,4 April 2012
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Between Syldavia and Borduria (screen)
","For the Tintin fans, those names would be familiar as they are, like Zubrowska, all Central European imaginary states. If i have never read Zweig and my Hergé memories a bit foggy as well now, i think the two authors share the same passion for folklore, history and fun. At first, the movie is rather serious and sluggish : it's about a young girl reading the tale of a author who recalls the tale of the hotel owner. The atmosphere in this luxury but empty place looks like Bilal's « Bunker Palace Hotel » : if i was a bit bored, i could enjoy however the stunning visual and production of this movie and the real talent of the director with his camera. Then, the story reaches its point with the inheritance problem and the movie becomes great : it's really funny, crazy, filled with absurdity, black humor and Benny-Hill style gags. The cast reunites a all-star team with phlegmatic Fienes, impressive Brody, frightening Dafoe and amazing newcomer for me Saoirse Ronan, as i have got the feeling to know her for a long time. In a way, it finishes close to a Burton's movie, except not having Elfman doing the score. In short, this movie is again the proof that Americans have really talent to do movies about my old Europa !",7,0,4,18 April 2014
1941," Japs attacks (cinematheque)
","One more time, Spielberg proves that he is an all around director because his first try at comedy is indeed funny. Faraway of today comedy based a lot on spoofs, here's the humor comes from the situation and the characters. If you add that the production and sets are really top notch, this movie seems to be to Spielberg's what 'Mars attacks' is to Tim Burton: a big expensive toy that's also a severe punch to role models: all soldiers, Japanese or American, are crazy, their command is stupid and the average people not very bright either. Thus it was interesting to see who were behind this and I was surprised to see that Zemeckis and Gale had written it. In an other hand, it's as fast and past loving as their other production. But what I remember most of that movie, it's his nostalgic power, almost like turning the pages of a family album: Sure there are a lot of young faces that will become more famous in the 80. But, the plane romance takes me back to my teens fantasy and beyond i got stuck with Dianne Kay's casting. I was certain that i had seen her before but was unable to pick up the production. Back home, IMDb told me that she was a daughter in the 'Eight and a half' show that I watched indeed as a kid. Now, i have absolutely no idea of any episodes but seeing the pics, all the members of that family is familiar. Pairing: 'Saving Private Ryan': two sides of the same coin: war",7,0,2,29 March 2012
Revolutionary Road," Awful all the more than Kate and Leo don't make a second Atlantic cruise (web)
","Well, after a half hour, i was wondering what this movie was about: babbles, nothing happens. So if the goal was to depict a boring couple life, at least, it's accurate. I was just about to stop it as Kate has a terrific moment: it was about being free, doing what we would have decided and not lose our life in a dull monotony. It strikes me as reaching 40, I feel exactly the same than this Leo at 30: Funnily, we live in different country, fifty years apart and nothing has changed: taking train to job, surfing into a wave of grey suits clones, tied to a desk... So i was really excited to see this family come to Paris and i was already happy to see Kate and Leo embark on a Cunard ship this time and maybe it will the same deep emotions as 'Hideous Kinky' ! But my joy was short-lived: they never make the trip! They are stuck in their suburb, babbling, ... I can't say more because if i haven't stop it, i just keep forwarding to the end! So the director has done the most successful James Bond after: hope he gives him more punch !",1,5,7,6 October 2013
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Lost Movie (vhs) (DVD)
","If Phil Jackson can leave coaching with a sweep, thus Spielberg can also go from excellence to crap. This sequel is painful to watch because all the things that makes JP such a masterpiece has been torn to shred by the raptors here. and i am not speaking about the concept because i do find that the testing island is good.But casting: Moore, the acrobat girl, the new boss of Ingen and the terrible hunter?? At last they got Vince Vaughn to counterbalance!Soundtrack: Williams has done really better: where are the themes?Ambiance: maybe it's routine but the dinosaurs aren't stunning here even if they double the dose: sticking to night and rain doesn't help too! The only good piece to chew is the raptors attack because they have been deadly improved but the sequence closed dumbly by acrobatics.And what to say about T-Rex in town? an innovation from the novel but dumbly written: the crash of the boast is never explained but we can suppose from the cut hand in the cabin that raptors were on board but nobody cares, even Spielberg. Shocking !",4,1,5,21 May 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," And when i think Tim's movie was considered as a failure ! (tv)
","The franchise (at first, a book by french writer !) was SF classic as it indeed lies upon a fantastic idea : what if Apes uses humankind as humankind uses Apes ? Thus, a prequel should be interesting as well.However, the movie doesn't match my expectations : As a blockbuster from 2K10s, the production is just destroyed by color grading between blue and orange. Skins looks ugly and props get very limited. Coupled with this poor visual, the story is full of incoherences and silly characterizations : We jump 8 years as if nothing happened ; Franco is very attentive when he steals the ooze but can't see it had been stolen later ; he is motivated to do the tests but gets angry when the tests are done ; he has a silly obsession (« take Caesar home »). Lightgow is crap playing a senile father. The communication with apes and between apes is confusing (sometimes, sign language is needed, other times, a conversation is OK ; A Zoo monkey can use sign language) ; The apes multiply like gremlins and I don't really understand why they had to destroy everything and attack everyone is their only goal was to reach the forest ! And i don't expand the unbelievable fact this ooze is the miracle potion for apes and a deadly virus for mankind !Sure, there's some interesting facts : the blind science, the abuse of animals (very convincing Drago for instance) but making extraordinary ape expression faces for pain, doubt, despair or anger doesn't mean you got a story.",1,14,28,29 April 2014
JFK," Just Flagrant Konspiracy (DVD)
","I think that our personal history can only make sense when we blend it with the global history. And as I said with another historic movie, facts are the bricks for getting into the events. Conclusions, hypothesis, commentaries are maybe useful but they can't replace the facts. This method is rewarding concerning this dramatic event of our previous century because it shocked a world while just a handful was present on this famous Dealey Plaza, November 1963. Above all, a movie make you see things as they were, thus you just call for your best judgment. So, let's take a look at what happened:1) The supposed lone gunman (HLO) fired at the most difficult time to aim: when the presidential car moved away and not while it was right in front of him. Strange? 2) The place of the shooting is the best for a trap: you see the famous grassy knoll and just behind a huge parking and nothing else except railroads. Coincidence? 3) The definitive visual proof: the Zapruder movie: if JFK fell left and behind with the head gunshot, thus that means that someone behind him and at his right, as HLO, could have been the killer. Nonsense!That's why I just loved this movie because it's like living this dreadful day right from where it happened. So when you heard a past (awful) president, involved in the Agency and making dollars with blood, saying 'it's a crap', well, you know that the movie kicked where it hurts!While watching it, I read the 1968 book 'The Plot' which amazed me because I think it's the quickest book to reach the same conspiracy conclusion. Together, they make me understand the motive for the killing: JFK was a pacifist and as he would have been surely reelected for a second and finale mandate, he would have then his hands free to do what he wanted. And peace wasn't what the military-industrial complex wanted, as warned by his predecessor Eisenhower, himself coming from this corporation.So, this movie is a powerful testimony for truth and in addition, a truly artistic masterpiece: the editing, the cinematography with fictional shooting and real footage makes a nearly virtual experience. It's not only talks because for each opinion, you see immediately the actual and real proof. We must thank Stone for his great cast and his attention to profile it as the real people. I have never been a great fan of Costner but for a actor labeled 'action', he was just amazing portraying the attorney. He delivers a great incarnation of courage and dedication. If you add a great score from one of the best, John Williams, you got the ultimate movie of 1991: a story that you can't forget told by excellent artists! In spite of its high quality, the winner for 'Best Movie' at the academy awards was 'Silence of the lambs'. Bullshit! If you don't want to die dumb and oppressed, then watch this one instead and think!",10,0,10,29 May 2010
Ghost Rider," He was running away from Miss Mendes ! (TV)
","I must thank the kid for having suggested this movie. It's funny because he has seen the end on TV and wanted to discover the beginning. So we watched it together and back home, I watched the end. I remember that at its release, critics were bad and they make fun of Cage's hairstyle (was it a wig?). As a Marvel fan, I add that the character isn't among my favorites and I only know him for being on the cover of the first Wizard magazine. So it's a super hero whose fame is changing and I suppose the movie won't help, even thought I had fun. The look of the ghost rider is really terrific and there aren't dull moments. I really appreciate the feeling of this road movie in the West and finally, this movie gives an excellent modernization of the western genre: the old town, the lone ranger, the bad guys, the gun fights, the horses. Everything is here but depicted in a new way and it's cool! Cage is fine with his faustian character on the contrary of Eva Mendes who plays like a tart! She never convinced me one second as a poor lover! Maybe with Penelope Cruz, this movie could have been a classic!",7,4,5,2 April 2010
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-men 3: the last stand ..... in the comic-shop for a good adaptation...
","X-men is a comics book, so the visual is essential to the 'brand'.I felt it in X1 (perfect), not in X2 (a failure for me), and X3 is in the middle: some respectful & worthy moments (a sentinel in a Terminator beginning, added characters like Colossus, Shadowcat, the eternal Wolverine, the Golden Gate) but the list falls short with a lot of flat sequences: the house battle, the forest hiding, the final battle... Well, any talented artist could have done it better in a book!!! The story supports the same vision: some interesting plots: the underlying political & discrimination thematic, the no-mutation mutant, but we find also some silly stories: the lake with Cyclops and the stupid killing of Phoenix... Why wolverine doesn't use the anti-mutation serum on her in the same way he did on Magneto a few minutes before? In conclusion, give the script to the original authors, give the camera to the artists, and goddammit give us a real X-men! Sin city is a success, because the easy formula has been used: Just take a existent story & film each panel with dedication.... No more interpretation or originality by people who aren't fans....",1,0,1,10 June 2006
P.S. I Love You," PS: i don't like you very much (dvd)
","Well, the movie begins well with an incredible scene of domestic quarrel between Hilary and her husband. Then, come the credits, next the grieving. That was tastefully done because we know that they are deeply in love and we don't have to live the dreadful period of his illness and death. Then, the letters arrive and i found that it was a very original idea that a terminally ill could plan his support. To my knowledge, it was the first story of this kind. The moments Hilary shares with his 'ghost' are moving and i thought it would be a great movie.Unfortunately, the cast is not great: Bates is a dull mother, Kudrow is a pathetic man-eater, Hilary's future landlord plays too much the playboy. Only Connick is funny but their relationship is a bit absurd. Furthermore, the story drags a lot and the letters lead to nothing fundamental. The Ireland journey is exotic for the colors (i understand why it's called the Emerald Island) but nothing really happens! And the 'coup de grace' for such an Irish movie is the absence of a U2 song, especially when the title song of Blunt copies their chorus of 'in a little while'. Aoo, Aoo, Aoooooooooo....",4,1,2,8 July 2011
Good Will Hunting," the cousin of Lip Gallagher (rental)
","Actually, it's the same plot : a math genius from a poor neighborhood who needs help to have a meaningful life and get out of heavy relatives ! In six seasons of « shameless », we didn't have a resolution while here in two hours, we close the story. The movie has a lot of things that i like : Boston, campus, Danny Elfman, Robin Williams and for sure an extraordinary trio of newcomers with Damon, Affleck and Minnie Driver (at least in an American production)! Actually i didn't put Minnie in my 12 best actresses list but i think i will do it as her English class is unique! She should have won the Oscar because she illuminates a rather transparent part (the serious student girlfriend) with original and personal input ! Robin is good as a humanist shrink but i won't go ahead as i can't really support a movie that supports psychological help : what says Robin can be found in any good philosophical book : life is about experiences, getting to know others and abuse victims aren't culprits. In other way, Affleck says it as good as Robin and without the qualifications: Will has everything to get a life so he must move his ass !",7,1,3,20 May 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The Two hours too much (DVD)
","In a trilogy, the second part is always the most difficult to create because it loses the charm of the discovery and lacks the thrill of the conclusion. The goal is to develop the characters and conclude with a solid cliffhanger that will be resolved in the last part. Thus, it's not just passing by.Unfortunately, this movie is this kind. It fails to reach classics as 'Star Wars V' or 'BTTF 2' and it's as dull as 'Star Trek 3'. Nothing really fundamental happens here: it's just another steps in the journey. Moreover, the fluidity of the first movie is lost because the characters are now split into three groups. I dozed two times watching it: in the Rohan country and during the Helm's Deep battle.But the responsibility goes to Tolkien because LOTR aren't really three stories but a huge, colossal single story divided in three parts by the editor. And a night rainy battle will be always more exciting on a paper than on screen.To leave on a happier note, i must say that the extra are interesting and really help to understand all the passion that people have put in this trilogy. That's why the chain-maker is so funny: With his desperate and weary voice, he explains that armors needs thousands of rings, that rings come in three models and that in a day of work, he can chains as much as a big scarf!",4,3,5,9 January 2011
Schindler's List," German's list is shamefully short (cinematheque)
","This movie is about ordinary people showing the best of humanity or unfortunately the worse. As my favorite writer, PKD, said holocaust wasn't only Hitler and his pals but began foremost with those thousands of anonymous Germans, Polish, Ukrainians, French that operated the camps, the trains, opened the doors and close them, brought the lethal gas and so on. Everyone would contribute even small in the process was as guilty as their original planners. Shoah is about individual morals and value and it was up to every one to choose the path to be a killer or a righteous. The movie is brilliant for that because you see that thousands of anonymous killers and one brave soul who repents. Sure, it's greed that leads Oskar to those families but it's their suffering that makes him change. From that point of view, i don't think that the girl who wore red is an error as other people think because she symbolizes his borderline. From this moment, Oskar is touched and is on duty: Liam becomes really irresistible of empathy and courage. Next, some french media consider a bigger flaw that the women's convoy is only lead to shower and not death chambers. Well, that's the proof that they haven't understood Spielberg's sensibility: he doesn't direct a documentary but as always, a movie about hope, about this little flame that still burns in the darkest hours. So he didn't have to show those woman dying as well as he could mix a lot of atrocities that surely hasn't all happened in the real Schindler's story but happens really during the war: killing disabled, killing for fun, etc... In that way, Fiennes and Liam delivers unforgettable performances, the one as an unforgettable pit of darkness and the other as a force of life. That's why my eyes were full of tears at the end because to see this strong oak finally crumble was too much. Pairing: 'Empire of the sun': another war, another tragedy, another hope....",10,16,25,31 March 2012
I Am Legend," From the legendary writer Richard Matheson (DVD)
","I knew the story even before the release of this movie because it is originally a novel from Matheson, the same good writer of 'The Skrinking Man' and 'Duel'. But I never read it and I always wondered how to explain the title: How can the last man among vampires be a legend? Now I understand! The twist has been unveiled in a mesmerizing way: I don't see lately a movie with such loneliness, grief. Will Smith is a surprise here because he tries a new suit for him: he leaves the smiles, the fun for the darkness and pain. The entire movie, he lifts alone a sad life and when everything falls apart, he fights every second. Smith is really good and he should do more drama! The vision of an empty New York is surreal and as attracting as scary! Between 'the Stand' and 'War of the Worlds', the terror is never so high when it takes root in our daily life. 'Dracula' is maybe frightening but as Pennsylvania is far away, it is also baroque. Not here. The reality is cold, uncompromising. Sometimes we wished to be all alone and this movie as the french 'Seuls Two' brings an haunting visual and emotional experience.In conclusion, a brilliant movie that hurts consequently the vampires!",7,0,0,5 July 2010
Dog Day Afternoon," Another masterpiece from Al Pacino (DVD)
","As in each of his great performances, there's a always great story , a great director behind and amazing co-stars (look at John Cazale in his ghostly role!!!) So if Pacino seems lately to repeat in bad guy roles in second zone movies, blame his choices of scripts & directors but not his talent of acting.'DDA' is really the kind of movie I like, because it is: - anti-conformist - deeply humanthe bad guys are maybe not models but they show sensitivity. The police are depicted as blind, cold and Machiavellian. It is the only movie I recall in which the gangsters seem to appear as victims.As it's happening in New-York at summer, it's a Brooklynian precursor of 'Do the right thing' 10 years before.In conclusion, a must-see !",7,3,4,18 July 2008
Cars 2," Gran Turismo undercover (screen)
","It was my first experience of 'Cars' and I find the idea of personalizing cars original and funny. Moreover, it's a change from the always, eternal, speaking animals! Sure it may be deeply industrial but those cars looks like the ones we played with as kids. Next, the clear characterization of the friends, a dumb and an extrovert is helpful to build a plot, gags and a morality.Unfortunately, the production didn't manage to write a decent story around. As I watched the movie with my 6 years old nephews, i have got the feeling after the Japanese round to be in Transformers or Toy Story 3: guns, violence and the villain's scheme is totally beyond understanding.A spy story is already difficult to follow but if in the same time, the bad guy wears a mask, the targeted audience is totally lost: ask my nephews about it and they can't tell what the movie is about. That's why it will disappear quickly from our memories. So producers: stop making brilliant stories and just make it simple!",4,3,7,7 August 2011
Kick-Ass," Mine was nearly kicked (screen)
","Just before the start of the movie, some young idiots tried to make me change my seat because they were a band, but I stand up and they had to split! In fact, this helps to understand what the movie is about: not really superheroes because in the real world, they don't exist but about courage because all of us can show it we wanted. That's why courage was perceived by my favorite writer (PKD) as the finest quality because without it, all the others qualities are useless. If you let bad things happens and do nothing, you are as guilty as the actual wrong doer. This movie is great telling this lesson because you see that there are only a few people awake and aware of their duties while all the others are passive. This movie is also a funny and accurate testimony about teens in the third millennium: Girls, wanking, comics-books are still present but now Internet, cellulars, social groups are part of the life and change it forever. Every moment in life becomes faster and as Bill Gates said, the world is right at the tip of your finger. As a comic fan, I particularly liked the sketches of JRJR (John Romita JR, the actual artist of the comic) that can be seen at the Big Daddy Hideout and in the comic montage even if his story was difficult to understand. I can't judge if this is a faithful adaptation or not because I don't have read the original comics yet. I can only say that it was great up to the online beating. The stroboscopic light was great and I think it would have been a terrific grand finale. But, the movie adds another reel after this and it was not 'Kick Ass' anymore but a Bond movie with a lot of gadgets. But, I had fun overall and this new and cool cast worths paying attention!",7,1,5,31 May 2010
Unknown," I know his parents : « frantic » and « XIII » (tv)
","I decided to watch this movie because it had Liam, the Harrison ford of the second millennium, the cute Kruger and a change of locations with Berlin. In addition, the story sounded like a mystery. Now, the result is average, not totally awful but not worthy of a second watch. I have never went there and maybe it's due to winter time but this Berlin looks a cold, industrial city that surely don't have the beauty of Paris or London Then, i didn't understand why Kruger doesn't play a German girl ?? About the plot, it's a sort of reboot of « frantic » : same professor, same hunt in a foreign country, same companies game, same help from a young woman, same little flat Maybe the difference is the twist but there, there is a lot of inspiration from « XIII ». The action sequences are maybe well orchestrated but they are totally unbelievable, especially the car chase ! At the end, my last question is why it's a french movie when everything and everyone aren't not french ???",4,0,1,12 September 2015
Ghostbusters," They saved also my life (screen) (vhs)
","Even on a bad tape and 30 years after, this movie stays incredible ! When it was released for Christmas 1984 in France, i remember to have been a bit afraid to see it because as i was very impressionable then! But we went for new year's eve with all the family and it was an incredible time as the movie has everything an audience can ask: an original idea, a respect for paranormal even we don't stop laughing, amazing special effects, staying score and songs and for sure, deep, well defined characters played by an incredible cast ! Maybe my love for America started here for good because as i said for « tootsie », it was the time when the nobody could work to achieve greatness and NYC was indeed this city dreams where everything can happen! As a kid, it was the most fantastic way to enter the paranormal because with this team of buddies, we feel courageous to face ghosts, spirits, demons ! As a result, my brother and I kept drawing the logo and with friends at school, we became also young investigators ! The movie is so simple, direct, true that even now, i can lip-sync the lines as they were all memorable ! As we saw « gremlins » for Christmas day at my grands-parents, this 84 season remains the best forever and those movies were indeed a benchmark in my life for movies, literature, places and fun !!",10,5,8,7 January 2016
Coyote Ugly," Not ugly and definitively not a bar movie as well (DVD)
","The cover with all the girls having fun in a bar isn't accurate because the bar intrigue and the friends are really a subplot. The story focuses really of the life of Violet and as a 'dreams come true' movie, this one is really superior to 'Honey'. The reason is that even as a newcomer, Piper Parabo is definitely a better actress than Jessica Alba! She is really moving with her feelings and i like the way she manages her relationship with her father and her boyfriend. The final moments are maybe a bit rushed but i have enjoyed the journey. And what about the coyotes then? Well, they are in the back: the dance and drinks aren't so many and it's a good thing because getting drunk in a bar while peeping girls isn't my habit. Now i understand why it's a Disney production because it focuses on dreams and not booze and if the girls get loose, there is nothing scandalous.",7,3,5,29 May 2011
K-19: The Widowmaker," This K19 sinks at deadly knots (tv)
","First, my binary mind just don't support this kind of American movies that applause the bravery of defeated enemies. Like 'Iwo Jiwa', I found them inappropriate: the history of Russia should be told by Russians and if Americans wants to refresh war movies, they should start by telling us battles they have lost! Next, this movie is just dreadfully boring: Maybe I suffer from cabin's fever, but a whole movie in a submarine isn't my kind of entertainment! This is surely not 'red October' and here, the action is very limited: preparation, drills and accident! At last, there is Harrison and Liam at the helm because without them, it would have been just unwatchable! But this extraordinary meeting just turns out a big disappointment. The movie is badly directed, without rhythm, scope or score! It's paying too much attention on technological details that I had to fast-forward a lot of times! Now, with this horrible movie, I just wait for the Russian version of that story and at least, I'm sure that it can't be more boring!",1,5,10,12 December 2014
Back to the Future Part III," « I would like to go to the old west » (dvd) (vhs) (screen)
","Dixit Micheal J. Fox, circa 1985, during BTF promotion.In the numerous and very informative documentaries of this 4 DVD collection, there's this premonitory pearl, funny as it's about time travel. If BTF was a comedy, BTF2 is science fiction, BTF3 is an adventure movie: With the time (no pun intended), this final part is like good wine and gets better! As I'm not a western fan, I underrate this while it's in fact very good: the characters really develop, Steenburgen is a nice addition and unlike BTF2, there's really a new universe to discover with the old west! The 2 Bobs prove once again how talented they are as they succeed to put all the western clichés and blend them nicely with their franchise! It's good that the franchise ends on a full circle (great idea the picture of the clock!) and gives full hope for the future! Like the predecessors, this movie has also paradoxes that die-hard fans notice easily: If not the wish of the production, Emma Thompson shouldn't have been part of the movie as she is another branch of the family! Personally, I don't understand the Clayton Paradox: if Marty heard about the canyon, that means Doc didn't save her thus she can't write a line for his tombstone???",10,0,0,3 August 2013
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A great evening for the Fantastic Four: my friend, her two kids and me (Screen)
","This movie concluded a 'family' moment at the time of the coming back to school. After a Italian meal and shopping, we arrived in the projection room right for the opening credits.For my friends, who are outside comic-books, they find it cool, especially the 'Rose' brick man and his famous expression to 'give five'.For me, a comics-fan for 21 years, I rate it better than X-Men #2 and #3 but far behind Spiderman Trilogy: Good because their family spirit is here, the design, story, effects are positive.Deceiving because Jane is depicted like a spoiled and jealous wife and because Galactus is too cheap! I haven't watched so far FF #1 but if it is not the world famous movie right now, it is not the worst also !",4,2,4,7 November 2007
Transformers," Transform my TV (DVD)
","Transformers are really big robots but my TV has a small little screen. So I am sure I miss all the fun because the robots seem like wrecked garbage whereas they are nicely designed seen on a theater screen! In spite of this handicap, the movie is still great, not exceptional but great. It's true that the suburbia feeling is a great door to plunge into this robotic world. Another good point is the talented cast: for me, Labeouf and Fox are newcomers but they are promised to a brilliant future (see Indy IV).I remember to have seen trailers but they didn't appeal me. So, another time, you got the proof that trailers aren't trustworthy because a bad one can make you miss a good movie.I am not a die hard fan of transformers so I can't judge the storyline, but it's a pity that is too much militarized. They are not the friendly neighbor anymore! But in a way, like someone said, it changes from suits, boots and wings! The big final action sequence is very well directed so I keep a good memory finally! NB: and yes, as a kid, I dreamed to have a lot of transformers toys but I remember to play with only a green harrier plane and it belongs to their concurrency, the GOBOTS!",7,1,2,18 September 2008
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," An indigestible appetizer for X-mas dinner (tv)
","I saw it with my nephews waiting for Santa Claus: They appreciate it the time they watched it, laughing a bit while I snoozed deeply. This is the archetype of the hollow creativity of actual animation.In the XX century, Disney was alone but he knew how to make dream. Now, there are a lot of studios but they stock stinker after stinker. Sure, the animation is bright, colored, full of details but the characters are rather ugly: the heroes are realistic and cute while the others are caricatures: short legs, explosive belly, enormous eyebrows. Worst, the story is dumb: it's about a food storm! Where do they find their ideas? Maybe it's better than a poop tempest but falling steaks, swimming in cream is finally disgusting. It's nearly Ferriri's Big Feast for kids but there wasn't a lot of funny moments. I forget the philosophic message that is to be yourself! What a revolution! In conclusion, to be a responsible parent, order something else!",1,6,14,28 December 2011
Lincoln," Bye bye slavery, welcome segregation and wage earning (screen)
","Before the screening: I'm deeply intrigued by this Spielberg's choice. For 40 years, Spielberg was the filmmaker of the simple people and avoided to deal face to face with politics. Today, he forgets his trademark and gives us a biopic of a past Potus. If he proves always his versatility, he takes a big risk to deliver an insipid propaganda. Why? Just because citizens aren't dumb to believe that a politic can be a savior. History shows that liberty and human rights was the result of people revolutions. They were conquered from governments not given by them. In addition, a true democracy is a government of the people for the people by the people. So dealing with slavery, my expectations are to see if Lincoln has ever met slaves, talked with them or if his decision is just 'brilliant' philosophy indoors with members of his cabinet?After the screening: In a way, i got what i expected, that is to say? a weak Spielberg movie but it's not after all propaganda. Sure Lincoln is put under the spotlight with his determination to get this abolitionist amendment. But, on the other hand, Spielberg opens the underbelly of American democracy and its guts are rather cancerous: it wasn't idealism, enlightenment and beautiful convictions (in the spirit of 'Amistad' trial) that win the vote but party discipline and corruption of opponents! Furthermore, it's not real equality that's pursued but the simplest formal equality! Thus, calling Lincoln a hero, a myth is maybe a bit overrated because this kind of democracy is a bit shameful! In movie term, the production is rather good. Without electricity and happening in winter, the picture is incredibly dark, gloomy and grey. Spielberg still manages to deliver some great scenes: his opening stunned me as it was exactly what I wanted: the chief talking with the people, hearing their needs and dreams! His final appearance is dramatically shot also (his black servant is chilled to see him leaving). To see black people taking seats for the vote was also very symbolic. Maybe the best character was the one played by Tommy Lee Jones and Spielberg is facetious with his final shot!In conclusion, this movie sinks some more my illusions because it's a depiction of a make believe democracy. In a way, Marx was right: this American civil war was indeed a bourgeoisie revolution that Capitalism needed to erase the previous slavery world and build another era of exploitation. As in 'Munich', Spielberg intends to awake our citizens' consciousness and don't take our old democracy for granted! For example, in France, my country, slavery was abolished in 1848 by a simple government decreed (no vote!) that was in addition totally hypocrite (colonies were exempted!). Today, we hear talks about constitutional reform but our President shelves the project because he thinks that he doesn't have the special majority in parliament to vote it! Go see 'Lincoln' dude and you'll know then what to do!",4,2,5,24 February 2013
Million Dollar Baby," I saw this movie the day after the Pope died (screen)
","Some people can think that reality & movies are two worlds apart. I advise for the contrary. Philosophy for our personal life can be found in the two.So it was easy to associate this movie with the news event of Jean Paul II, because the both heroes have the strength and courage to choose for the last decision of their life. They know that their choices are only a 'one way ticket' and there is no come back. But they stick to it, and in a strange sense, they find happiness and serenity.Having the same ending than 'Boys don't cry' (the same actress, the same Oscar), this movie is thus radically different. But, in the same time, the character/actress shows also the exact state of mind: determination, an insatiability for happiness, and a will that never goes down even in the worst time. I find those movies to give me the 'peach'.This movie isn't only its last 30 minutes. For one hour before, it talks about boxing, and it was quite interesting. The locations (either, the club or the ring), the lightning of this movie (close to black and white) give a sense of intemporality in a sense that this story could happen in the 20s, the 50s, or in the XXI. As there is no distraction from the settings, the message of this sport, and the long development of the relationship between Swank & Eastwood are more clearly evident.At last, the music is perfect: tragically beautiful 'à la' Badalamenti. And my big surprise was to see that the composer is . Eastwood himself!!! In conclusion, a film that will knock you down !",4,1,3,6 April 2005
Garden State," The ideal flirt (DVD)
","My habit is to watch first the movie with the audio commentary. The good thing is that when I will watch it again, I will be much aware of everything. The bad thing is that actually I don't know what's really about and just fathom the story.It seems that Natalie Portman falls in love with an introverted young guy who has difficult relationship with his father. It's just the dream of millions teenagers: you are at odds with yourself and your family and then, an angel says you are the one! Ah, movies are cool! It happens in New Jersey, a really unknown state except that it is close to New-York! I had to check maps to see the big cities here. Sure, you can call it a 'Garden State' because it is open to nature and the movie shows it well with its green atmosphere.The commentary is helpful but it looks all the same: For every little detail, it's like a state of art for the speakers whereas for the audience, it's just dull.The main character is a bit irritating with his silent attitude and it just seems unlikely that Nathalie can have a crush for him. Finally, this romance lacks passion. Will it be better with the dialogs?",4,1,2,10 April 2010
Donnie Brasco," From Don to the the « biggest f.....g mutt in the history of Maffia » (DVD)
","The saying is that a great actor can play every one, from the most powerful to the most humble. Pacino proves it here and that's explains why he is my favorite actor as he is the only one who can does this feat. Thus, after gaining fame playing a Maffia Don, he plays now a pathetic door gun, who has spent all his life obeying his bosses, killing for them and getting nothing in return except exploitation and a broken family.Then, Deep arrives in his life and against all evidences that he is a 'rat', they develop a father-son relationship. Both actors excel but Pacino moved me deeply with his interpretation. It's just great to see how he can show what a broken man is: funnily giving money and taking it back just after, being a couch potato at home, speaking about his dreams and admitting his exploitation. Even now, i can't say if he was lucid concerning Deep: did he guess the truth and reject it or was he really bluffed? In all cases, his last scenes are remarkable: the last speech with Deep in the car and his final leaving at home.Deep is also good because his gradual descent into doubt is painful to watch: for a moral man, he is disgusted to see that the law enforcers are deceiving and that crooks can have big hearts.In addition to this wonderful drama, the movie offers a brilliant travel back in time, with an 80's Brooklyn setting teamed with flashing suits and cars.The only failures of the movie are the soundtrack (not transcending) and the casting of Heche for Deep's wife because she lacks something.In conclusion, a fantastic and original movie about a total loser becoming a true winner right in time, just the opposite of 'Godfather' where a 'winner' becomes a loser!",10,3,4,2 April 2011
The Nightmare Before Christmas," What's this? The dream about Christmas (cinematheque) (vhs) (screen)
","As 'Hook', this is a movie that i have discovered first by its soundtrack, having bought the import during a family trip to Paris in 1993 (the same where we have seen 'Schindler'). After opening it, I was surprised to see a booklet of songs, having just expected a score from Danny. At the listening, I find it wonderful, all the more than Danny is a great singer as well. Frankly, i don't remember my feelings when I watched it at its release, except than i bought the VHS later. Now, this is the movie that opens the Burton's festival at the Cinematheque, thus i can tell today.For me, it stands as a unique and inventive piece of imagination, sublimated by the score, an incredible art and an astounding craft. It's dark but funny as well (I love the one-eyed mummy), frightening and tender. The characters show a lot of soul and it's such amazing for just plastic ones. I still don't understand why Danny's musical effort has been snubbed at Oscars because he delivers such great themes and lyrics! The story is a jewel because the idea of a magic place made of holidays is just totally fairy tale. If the action is sometimes a bit vague (what's is the secret of X-Mas?), the screen is so full of details that it's a non-stop feast for the eyes. At last, the movie is paired with 'Vincent' (a bit too sad) and with the 'Frankenweenie' that is maybe the best short I have ever seen: as in 'Nightmare', it's filled of emotion and it has all the themes that Tim would film in his long career!My conclusion is that Tim and Danny should have done a 'Nightmare 2' instead of 'Corpse Bride' where the alchemy doesn't repeat.",10,1,1,4 May 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The man who liked the Wasp (dvd)
","Noomi is such a great actress that she's the only one to make me break my promise of not buying anymore DVD as long as I haven't finished to watch all my collection. That's why I can review it now in the middle of my TV shows DVD. What i knew about 'Millenium' was nothing but it reached my radar by a past colleague who has read the books. I remember also to see the poster in the subway and it made me think about the singer of the group rock Indochine. But, it's only with 'Prometheus' that I have discovered Noomi as a very promising young actress. Thus, she gave me a ticket for a noir trip in Sweden and it's good. Living in the so-called European Union, i have always wondered why in France, we never have the movies from our cousins. Thus, it's a miracle to have a Swedish blockbuster, all the more than in our all-visual society, it's again a book that has started it. Going to Stockholm was a come-back for me because i used to visit a friend there and i think i have been in a few locations. In all cases, the movie is a fine production with beautiful landscapes and great insight about Swedish way of life. The investigation is interesting because it mixes old past with brand new technology and if you pay attention, you can understand what happens, which is not the case in a lot of movies. Sure, some moments are a bit flat (the abuse, the family reaction, the pursuit, the flowers gifts) but at last, the tension and the mystery is ever present. About the cast, this Swedish team is excellent and proves that there's a life outside Hollywood, which is paradoxically what Noomi is actually seeking. There, she was perfectly cast because as i have seen in 'Prometheus', she exudes an inner rage, a survival instinct, a raw sensibility that made me think to the young De Niro. This wasp character is also interesting to discover because she isn't really into talks. You really have to be patient to reach her and as the film ends, you really want to follow this strange couple into their next adventures!",10,4,6,13 July 2012
Mulholland Drive," My 10 clues (dvd)
","1) Who sleeps tonight ? The first part of the movie is a dream: Betty/Diane is dreaming her perfect life by mixing in a positive way all her experiences even if her subconscious, her guiltiness can't make her forget her real life.2) Wake Up! The second part is the reality: Betty/Diane has a sad life: she is just an extra in Hollywood and her lover rejects her. For revenge, she hired a killer.3) The land of illusion! Lynch portrays a great vision of Hollywood, the two-sided city: a mythic place made up with dreams and artistic faith but where finally corporations and sex govern: in fact, it's a mirage! 4) City slickers: It's good to have Lynch visit a great urban town and leaves country and rural town for a while. I don't like very much LA but Lynch finds great spots (the hills, the palm trees, Dinkies) to glamor it.5) Even better than the real thing: What I like with Lynch is that the fantastic, dream world seems normal and warm whereas the everyday life seems surreal and painful.6) the eye of the tiger: as the best painter or photographer, he pays attention to the sets, props and cinematography and always delivers stunning framed visions: the phones, the ranch, ....7) Who's who: His cast is always excellent: the newcomers to me, Watts, Harring Theroux were refreshing.8) There's always music in the air: Badalamenti is a genius to always catch some heart-ripping melodies (and he's also a funny extra) albeit this isn't his best score for Lynch.9) Elementary my dear Watson: The clues Lynch gave were a good idea to make the film interactive and this way is far better than 3D.10) Sappho is crying: I am nevertheless disappointed with the love story because its lesbianism seems here a mere toy, a gadget to appeal to the audience.",7,1,3,4 September 2011
The Imitation Game," Apple of discord (screen)
","Well, this was the choice of my ex-colleague and he did well : this movie offers a lot of universes that I like and that are a bit unexpected: first, i have always an interest on computers and Turing was a name that I heard of in my readings. Here, to see his work on screen was really educative : it was helpful to his machine running, even if mathematics are really light. Next, i have always like British academic (as also seen in Harry Potter) and here this setting happened when the movie is about his teen years. Next, it was a original war movie because it's the first time i saw WWII with this angle ! And if it's really the Reich salute that won the war for the allies, it would be a particular factor. At last, it was an unexpected good romance : Turing had indeed a strange temperament but it's true that when we want to be left alone, we can appear like cold and abrupt. Keira was a discovery for me and she was really great as a willing and caring girlfriend. And unlike « Harvey milk » which claims its cause, this movie is a subtle, quiet tale for tolerance. I have however two big disappointments : first, as we follow Turing all along his life, the movie forbids to see his late decision. Second, his legacy for Apple is really, really subliminal.",10,1,6,17 February 2015
Caddyshack," A comedy about golfers, gofers & gophers (web)
","And also one in which Murray has already problems with small, kind furry burrowers I pick this one thinking that having in the same picture, Chevy, Murray and Ramis should be great and if it's indeed the result, the previous meeting is a bit disappointing and Chevy is not that funny here! On the other hand, Murray is really good playing a bit the future groundskeeper Willie from the Simpsons! In addition, I'm amazed to see that his brother looks then like his twin, as much physically as with his attitudes! Beyond the duo, this is a fine comedy that actually makes laugh, a genre that has disappeared from today American screens and this movie is easy to understand why While America has always denied social classes, claiming that everyone is equal but some are motivated (the rich) while others are lazy (the poor), this movie clearly illustrates that there are indeed 2 different worlds: the privileged one and the one of the common people.. So here the entire movie is about a very select, elitist golf club and while the rich play or fight as hobbies, the poor are actually working as their helping hands So because there is no better sharp contrast that this one, the movie sure finds a lot of interesting characters and things to do! In addition, the movie has still the look, the coolness of the 70s and again, the difference with today is clear! Maybe the movie loses a bit of its quality during the last holes, but it's still refreshing and fun to watch!",7,0,2,16 October 2017
The Piano," « Ada or Ardor » (tv)
","This title from a Nabokov's novel (poetic but nearly unreadable) fits well to the movie as in a way, it's also poetic and nearly unwatchable.For those who have the desire to be hermit, this is a sure recommendation but for the others (like me), it's rather the nightmare : i really felt trapped in this muddy jungle in New Zealand ! Worst, the director isn't fit to the task : highly (and ugly !) colorization, too much close-ups and not a good eye for the sets ! When a movie wants to stick us on a place, the minimum is to shoot it : how looks the house, how is the interior, how circulate in it : here, you have no idea and you can't really plunge into the movie ! About the story, it was an unoriginal triangle love story ! I'm not a clairvoyant, but you can easily predict all the movie. About the cast, the Oscar for Paquin and Holly are really unjustified ! If Paquin won it, why not Heather O'Rourke (« Poltergeist »), Culkin (« Home Alone »)! And giving an Oscar to Holly is just the bland idiotic award for disabled characters (« king speech », « ray », « shine », « Forrest Gump », « Philadelphia », « scent of a woman », « my left foot », « rain man », ...). However, as i dislike Keitel, i admit he is the one who should have get a nomination as he is rather likable here !",1,6,13,29 March 2014
Shrek 2," Berk !!!!! (TV)
","I don't understand how this animation can be the third success in the all-time box office.Sure, all the design is wonderful and the research has asked a lot of attention. Sure, the cat & the donkey, the piggies are funny characters, but the movie fails in all its intentions.A comedy which laughs at fairy tales: Well, except two brilliant scenes (the speeches at the arrival, and the following super), all humor is based on the American way of life. The magic castle is here, but it's look like Hollywood, even MacDonald, Pop Idol are present. This is the worst kind of humor: references. There is no surprise in it.Next, behind the smiles, the authors try to deliver a educational message, as any classic fairy tale. The problem is the choice of the subject: Is look important in life ? This question, again a typical American attitude, couldn't have been the greatest treason made to the spirit of fairy tale. Indeed, beauty is always the necessary (and shadowed) support of true basic educational messages (independence, curiosity, etc.). The look, glamorous or frightening is only the more visible sign for young children to learn the good feelings (friendship, honesty --- characterised by 'nice' people) from the bad feelings (cruelty, liar, temper --- characterised by 'ugly' people).So, Shrek keeps asking if 'ugly' people can love 'nice' princess, and finally, concludes that :YES !! 2 long hours to demonstrate an evidence (because, in his heart, he has good feelings) with an humor often not funny.That explains my bad recommendation of this sequel..",1,9,27,7 August 2005
The Last Emperor," What a hard job to be emperor (dad)
","I don't know one who finished the job quietly and this Chinese one got the luck to not be killed at least! The movie doesn't make him an amazing person but his fate to live locked and as a puppet is rather sad: it's true that the production is really sumptuous all the more than it's the real locations. The pace is rather fluid and clear so you keep interested in the events: It helps too that we can recognize a lot of faces (O'Toole, the two Gremlins, Twin Peaks, Palanquin) and this kind of huge historical production was always useful to better understand the world we live in! In all cases, it's much better than the awful biopic we got today!",7,0,0,16 April 2017
The Big Blue," It's not man that takes the sea, but the sea that takes the man (dvd)
","I was 14 years when this movie engulfed a generation and I was left ashore. One year later, I tried to embark but I fainted in front of the theater desk, too much pushed by the crowd of a free movie day. A bit later, the VHS box-set was a gift to my father: all the family watched it on New Year's Day and I didn't get it except for a scene. Years later, I discovered it again and it finally talks to me.I am just totally hooked by this reunion of lost people, unfit to the real world and fascinated by the nature, the beyond and silent world. Besson depicts with great wisdom the best of friendship and the best of love. When Rosanna pushes the button to his final dive, it's the essential act of love: she doesn't like him for herself and she wants him to be happy, she loves him all, with his good and bad sides. Thus, Besson had a good hand by picking this cast: Reno has a heart as big as his height, Barr is so right being shy and dreamy and Rosanna is just incredible as a passionate lover, very fragile compared to those men but as strong as them as well. It's said that Passion is a fire, that it's pleasure and pain at the same time and each of those characters shares it dangerously. In addition, it's the only movie where nature, sea is depicted with such a gripping, compelling call.With such primitive and powerful feelings and setting, it was a challenge to score it well and Serra delivers a miracle. His soundtrack matches beautifully the frames and can be listened apart. The Peruvian tracks are deeply haunting and say it all: it's about being lost and in love...With 'Titanic', this movie is just another proof that there is enchantment under the sea and i recommend everyone to dive into this big blue.",10,2,4,25 September 2011
Clash of the Titans," Perseus and the Olympians (Screen)
","This one didn't steal the lightning but didn't invent fire as well.Actually there's a renewal of Hellenic thematic but except '300', the movies failed. I saw this one on 3D but it enhances nothing because it just darkens the colors. The production design was disappointing because Olympus and the Gods look like they arrived from the set of 'Excalibur' and the Greek civilization was depicted rather tidy and not luminous. The adventure was boring, uninspired, a faraway reminiscence of Conan adventures. The only good things here are the character of Io (the babe from 'Quantum of Solace') and for a french audience the appearance of (a slim thus unrecognizable) Mouloud! Plus the tiny earth upon the Gods walked on. I wonder how my Greek friends react of such a bad movie!",1,3,3,10 June 2010
Jurassic World," Jurassic Photoshop (paytv)
","You know the feeling of the actual magazines in which all the pictures are enhanced digitally: sure they have no defects but they look terribly fake and at the end, the result is opposite to the one wanted: they inspire no emotion! Here it's the same thing with this movie: Released 22 years after the original Spielberg, you can compare both easily and it gives you an accurate state of filmmaking. So sure the dinosaurs seem real and scary but look at the world they live in: it's either blue (night, inside rooms) or yellow (outside, props, building). So if you have to trade technicolor to have better SFX, I say no! Give me back my colors and my inferior dinosaurs of 1993 because here, after maybe one hour, I was already fed up by this fake world! Now, if I look at the story, it's the same mixed feelings: this is a great thing to discover how the park can actually work, with people and attractions I liked also the wink to the original movie; But, except those few moments, the movie just keep recycling: that is to say doing what has been already done: everything is under tight control except the moment when ; Kids tied to park management in danger; the greedy experts that fails miserably  In addition, there is a lot of pretty stupid stuff: the vanishing dinosaur ? the divorce case ??At the end, the movie is entertaining maybe one hour before becoming totally predictable and fake. As the Star Wars, Alien franchises, I won't look at any quick sequels and just wait another 22 years to take the pulse.. NB: as a french, I feel compelled to add a few words about our most beloved people, the laughable Omar Sy (sadly, his 1st rank is not a joke)! What an American career (translated by our french medias as worldwide notoriety)! After a cameo in X-men, now he just pet raptors and he is as mediocre as ever!",4,3,3,23 July 2017
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A succulent piece (screen)
","This movie is an adaptation from a famous tale for kids, which I didn't read. Then, it was already made into a feature, which I didn't see either. So, it was a total discovery for me and I am unable to tell which deserves to the previous works from what have been brought by Burton or Elfman.The title says it all, except than the visit is conducted by a 'Jackson'-ian figure, Willy Wonka (his relational problem with his father must be very close to the 'disorder' of the famous singer).Maybe because I saw the Imax version, thus paying more attention to details, this movie is a wonderful melting-pot of the universe of Burton. Like all excellent filmmakers (Spielberg,Â…), you got the feeling that Burton is driven by the same motives that he focus movie after movie.First, the attention paid to colors, to stylish props, his unique way of filming buildings and sets will give you the same good vibes you felt watching 'Beetlejuice, Batmans, Edward, NightmareÂ…'.That's for the eyes, but Burton is a real artist, because he addresses also the consciousness. He has a hard teeth against the American middle class, which is shown here in cynic way. Not that he doesn't like these people, but I think he has to make a point against a certain void in their life.At least, the music of Elfman is excellent, as usual. This time, he hits in all styles: Big orchestra, chorus, songs, guitars.. At the second musical show, I was happy because it sounds like the good old days of Oingo Boingo. Thus, I was waited for the next shows with impatience.In conclusion, a very good movie for all the family",7,3,5,11 September 2005
World Trade Center," Ground Zero of Film-making (DVD)
","The time I heard Stone would direct a movie about 9/11, I was excited because it's a director with guts and strong opinions. When I discovered the story deals with two firemen escapees, my interest goes down because his legendary punch would be gone.Now, watching the movie, my deception is even bigger. The tragedy is lived from two very personal point of view, so the big scope of this tragic day is left behind: you barely see the twin towers, the planes, the falls, the fires, the dust fog and the pain of thousands Worst, you got a collection of 'holes', that is the escapees in the darkness unable to move. Even the commentary of Stone is dull.It's a pity: In comparison, Spielberg when facing the holocaust and telling a story of life in an unbelievable tragedy, reaches very deep emotional level and breaks my heart.",1,0,1,5 November 2008
Big Fish," big question (cinematheque)
","This movie asks this fundamental question in an exquisite way: What do we really know about our parents, especially about their love or our birth? Any child thinks about it and maybe only the nearby death can help to actually ask it. (Personnally, our parents met at a dancing and my twin brother and me have been conceived during Christmas and New year Eve 1973).Tim's answer is moving and magic, even thought the movie is uneven. It's really good up to the parents wedding because i can't understand what happens after. After having said that Sandra is his soulmate, the father builds her a house and takes the road. Not very passionate, all the more that he spends a lot of time with the always boring Bonham! Up to that, Ewan was a great young adult that discovers a mysterious America.Tim manages to really bring emotions from the real world and the time stop sequence at the circus or the yellow field are great moment of filmmaking.We must wait for the ending to find back this emotion with Finney mastering all his craft. For one time, Depp isn't involved (and it's good) but he could have been great playing this introvert son.In conclusion, Tim should do more movies about normal families because his big sensibility and vision really enhance the emotion and makes everyday life like a fairy tale.",7,0,0,18 May 2012
The Insider," Don't worry : you can safely watch this movie as it won't absolutely addict you (rental)
","As a hardcore Pacino's fan, i had always highly reservations about this movie as watching two guys phone-talking for two hours isn't my vision of filmmaking. I do all i could do to not see it but today is the day : At the end and to resume, for a 150 minutes movie, i think i pushed « forward » for about 90 minutes. However, for historians, this flick has the value of benchmarking the start of the garbage era for Hollywood ! It has all the indigestible ingredients that i watch for about fifteen years now: color grading using only teal and orange ; story shortened to mobile conversations (« Star Trek » was intelligent to use that only for beaming up, Scotty !); product placements (pay attention to « rice ») ; reconstructed truth just for the sake of drama ; familial values going in the sink (the house is more important than the wedding vow) ; Oscars going crazy (7 nominations for that ?) ; Al is convincing as an upright, true journalist, Plummer, Chambon and the kid from « Beautiful » were good but Crowe is just awful with his boring interpretation of this torn man ! Beyond this, the movie misses really the point and take its audience for small brains: i'm not a scientist, but with millions of smokers who can't stop the habit, i think people has already deduced that cigarettes were addictive ! The only interesting case here is the fact that medias have merged with politics in selling their souls to corporation : The latter tell democracy and do oligarchy, the former investigate truth and publish lies. If i got it right, the « seven dwarfs » having drugged the citizens, they could easily extort colossal money that they use to buy anyone that could be a nuisance against them ! It's a shame that the movie has hired Mann to cloud the issue with a sluggish narration. Did Oliver Stone wasn't available ?",1,1,6,30 March 2014
The Dark Knight," You bet, man !
","At first, I didn't want to see it because the trailer was too much 'realist' for me. I miss the stylization of Burton. But its success at box-office, the positive reviews of my family and colleague make me buy the ticket and finally it's an excellent adaptation! There isn't really anything new under the hood but the treatment is very different. That's the best thing that offer Super-Heroes genre: multiple subjective interpretation. From a shared guidelines, every one can put his own feelings, so the characters evolve, are different. In the comics, you notice that easily, but in movies, it's more usual: the 'Superman' of Singer is really close to the Donner's one. All 'Spiderman' have been done by Raimi. Maybe 'The Hulk' are different but so far I didn't see any of them.Except this 'Dark Knight', which is the best example so far. This time, you got another side of Batman, more dark than grandiose. Opposite to Spiderman who is a fun character in a cool world, Batman is a tragic icon in a cruel world. And this movie is very respectful in that sense because you can see that the character is losing. It's likely to say that the Joker defeats him and it's not happening often, even in a normal movie!The only regret of this movie: Danny Elfman !!!!!!",7,2,6,27 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry reborns from ashes (dvd)
","Before his lame three future movies of HP, Yates delivers at last one good movie! First, the movie benefits from the excellent story of the eponymous book. It's not that i don't like the others but after this one, HP turns into private Potter and wizardry becoming war isn't my cup of tea. Here, they are still students and it's really their last one when they look still childish. Next, there's a great addition of new characters: Evanna is as eerie as Luna and Nat/Tonks directed a very funny making-of in the extras. But only the books will give you a deep view into them because in the movie, they are only fly over. I don't forget Dolores Umbridge who teaches a good lesson for audience: bad, mean people can look sweet and gentle! The trio faces a interesting evolution as well: Harry lacks patience and shows anger while Hermione and Ron are really true friends, accepting him as he is. So, it's really about helping each other and not fighting. The production and sets are beautiful, especially the Ministry. Its gloomy and mazing architecture recalls 'Brazil' and above all, the entire movie is fortunately not salvaged by a poor cinematography. In conclusion, it's a vivid, full-colored phoenix that we got there!",7,1,3,3 March 2012
2001: A Space Odyssey," The proverbial good science-fiction film (tv)
","The quote is from Kubrick himself and it's still totally accurate for this movie. I don't know if any film fan can appreciate it but it's really a must see for all SF fan: we got everything: space, aliens, robots, origin of humanity Beyond this theme, it's a rare movie that mixes brilliantly a challenging script with amazing visuals! Sure as the movie is from 1968, some effects look sometimes a bit out of time but it still has more punch than most SF movies done after! For me, the explanation comes from Kubrick's simple vision: he shots SF like real daily life, with no big things: a big frame and slow pace are just needful as what we see is already extraordinary! I have fun to watch it now as I have picked Clarke's novels as my summer books (proof of the enduring quality of the work) and so I have just finished to read the novel: the two are really variations around the same stories and really help each other. This movie is also a moving memory as I remember to have watch it as a teen  in my grandmother's bedroom! It was all the more difficult as the galactic trip is indeed experimental cinema!!",10,3,6,16 August 2016
The Graduate," Cum Laude (TV)
","This movie is really deep & rich, thus it deserves my big appreciationMy first movie on French TV for a long time; So far the oldest movie I review (1967-forty years ago-I'm not even that old !!); A very young Dustin Hoffman when the last time I saw him was 'Hook' & 'Meet the parents': it is like the perfect youth cure and this movie offers a best trip back into time also; At last, I remember having seen one time only the final five minutes, so I was stuck with a beautiful song 'Sound of silence', and two lovers leaving on a yellow bus! With this new airing, I build the movie like a prequel and it was a good time:First, it is a good comedy: the graduate is sometimes in some silly situations you can wonder how he could have been an Harvard student.Then, the director is brilliant: his angles are unusual but really artistic & symbolic: at this time, it was like pioneering! Casting is perfect: Dustin Hoffman knows how to play a lonely, introvert but passionate lost young man. I am graduate on the subject: it is my life! His partners are excellent and they are faces of childhood memory: Mr Robinson is an actor I remember being in a delicate situation about a thing he doesn't want to be public! (thanks IMDb: it was 'Jaws': my memory is terribly accurate !) Finally, the story is a good testimony of its time and I understand now why it is associated with Flower Power generation; You don't see hippies there because it is high society but the spirit of this time reach this zone: call for freedom! Freedom from family (Mrs Robinson is more a victim than anything else), Freedom for sex, Freedom for wedding, Freedom for career,.. So maybe there was maybe too much Order before but only freedom isn't a solution either: the last frame says it all: they are happy but they go nowhere! Maybe that's why they stop laughing nearly at once ! If a sequel would be interesting (what have they become 40 years after, what did they done of their dreams, do they have new ones ???), right now, just enjoy this movie !",7,0,1,3 July 2007
Singin' in the Rain," The Collection: Musicals (3/6)
","After a trip to Europe, now it's a return to America and the cradle of filmmaking: Hollywood. Usually, I'am not fond of this kind of story (a movie about movies, a TV show about TV, a book about an author) because it's a blow to imagination. Instead of creativity, originality, the camera shoots what happens in front of it so it's not very interesting.Except this movie shows a pivotal moment in the golden age of Hollywood, when sound appears with the pictures so mute movies turn into 'talkies'. I am surprised that the first reactions were to despise this technology and above all that mute 'stars' could have such silly voices or unable to act. The premiere of this new kind of movie is really funny.Another good thing about this movie is that all the songs have subtitles. But, the best thing remains Gene Kelly. Change him for another actor and the magic is gone. It's true that is an affirmation of life because we can share a glorious feeling in the rain whereas it's usually a unhappy moment to be under.In memoriam of my grandmother (1911-2010) who died this day of watching.",7,0,1,8 August 2010
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Total recall for PKD (rental)
","After i watched the first 20 minutes, i would have never imagined that the movie would evolve like this. At first, i thought my DVD player had skipped chapters because it doesn't make sense anymore. That's when i discovered it was labeled science-fiction and so this kind of erasing memory is indeed the right stuff of my favorite writer PKD ! It's all the more close to his work that it features a really nobody, simple couple that we don't see very often in American productions ! For this kind of intimate sci-fi romance, the french touch of the director is really fit and he is really great at filming past collapsing: There's great, poetic visuals and haunting visions of this erasing and this sort of man vs machine keeps awake. It's true that it's maybe one of the best job for Carrey because for one time, he doesn't have fun! Kate is always wonderful, playing a straight, direct girl who is full of energy! However i still regret that the beautiful and moving romance of the start hasn't go on like in the real world because for one time i would have preferred to cry over a romance than to have been thrown into a science fiction story !",7,0,2,9 March 2016

In the evening, I picked the Sin City story called 'Hell and Back' and I was surprised to see that it was about the same criminal activity. Today, as I got up for breakfast, I turn on the satellite mosaic and among all the screens, I noticed someone looking like Famke Jansen. I picked the channel and it was indeed her! With Liam Neeson her ex-husband, they said farewell to their daughter leaving for  Paris ! As American movies about France are my weakness, I just went on watching. As the daughter was abducted, I was indeed taken! I couldn't switch it off until I know her final fate. Then, a great thriller started with an excellent Liam! Sure, he can inspire some security and courage! It's 'funny' to notice how his character and Frank Miller's Wallace are close: the two are hard-boiled, terribly lethal and for achieving their rescue, discover a modern criminality! As CoE states, this activity is hard to notice, makes a lot of money, which explains it has become the great deal of criminals today! It was a great eyes-opener for me all the more than the action happens in my city: for example, the car chase in which he drives full speed against the traffic is the same place when I got stuck with my bike and unable to cross the road with too many cars! So if the movie was a good moment, the only problem was maybe his denial! It's great to have a Superman as father but for all the people who haven't one, the story would be different! For example, Liam is too focused about his daughter that it isn't clear if he took the opportunity to save the other girls by the way! Finally, it's a pity this movie is just action or adrenalin and forgets the real tragedy: it would have been great in the closing credits to have lines about the number of cases of unresolved disappearances, just to have a definitive picture about this terrible drama!",7,0,0,16 May 2009
Alice in Wonderland," I didn't like the tale, the animated and the movie doesn't change this (cinematheque)
","At heart, 'alice' is about a bad trip and in that expression, i underline 'bad'. It's no surprise that she had nightmares because this wonderland is really frightening with all those silly and ugly inhabitants. Worst, it's again a family movie that asks for the hero to kill the bad guy (transformers, potter, star wars ...). Frankly, i wouldn't want my kids to get involved with this loud violence against others. I prefer that movies teach them about breaking their own inner fears. Tim failed to bring something original to the audience, totally drowned by CGI. Danny delivers an uninspired score. Pairing again Depp and Carter is totally boring. The only good thing in this stinker is its lead actress, Mia Wasikowska. I didn't know her yet but her free spirit is refreshing!",1,2,4,7 May 2012
Toy Story 2," Boy toy (tv)
","I really like the concept of this franchise about toys coming alive when kids are away. It's very good to meet again childhood feelings with the playground universe of the bedroom, the mysterious and dangerous but alluring outside world. It's funny, visually amazing with bright colors. However, there are things that disturb me : a kid can be a girl and i think that sometimes the toys are too much tied to gender (barbie dolls act like dumb blonde) ; Likewise i find that for a kid movie, it gives them too much violent and anxious questions : to speak about toys afraid to return to dark box, to say that they will be leftover with the time, it's not a happy way to explain life, all the more than kids are far more brighter that we can expect ! So behind the smiles, i find that the movie lacks a bit of deepness and care : it wants to deliver a message about friendship but it looks like a blow by moment! And i don't even write about the adult toy collector who can't look like Pitt but instead is overweight, with beard, with glasses..",7,0,1,19 November 2015
The Last Samurai," The First Globalization (dvd)
","In other words, as a book I recently read, it's 'McWorld vs Jihad', Modernisation vs Tradition. It's evident in this movie but if this debate is really acute today for America and Europe, this movie helped me to understand that this question was started already a century ago in the countries that have been colonized. Here, it's Japan and the choice is interesting because there, traditions mean honor.From a different point of view, you can see an American idol (Cruise) turning his back at America and giving his soul to fundamentalist warriors. For a movie post 9/11, it's a courageous choice: Some said it was a hidden plea for his church of Scientology but I don't feel a religious message here: on the contrary, this suffering soul have found inner peace with enemies that welcomes him and it's the power of love and not faith that saves him. Another proof of courage comes from the director who doesn't hesitate to depict US Army as racist and savage killing innocent people. But if the side that has technology always have power, it doesn't mean also victory.Despite of this gloomy and violent world, the movie is also a wonderful moment of peace, wisdom and love. A lot of this tenderness comes from the Japanese cast that are much more moving as new faces that a lot of Hollywood stars (fortunately none in this movie). I was totally touched by their non-verbal communication: it's all in glances and they say much more than with words.Last but not least, the score of Zimmer is a masterpiece: it sounds very Japanese, pure and simple and totally emotional as this movie.",10,1,2,16 October 2011
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," A duplicate for the story but also for the good memories (DVD)
","For the inside view of those movies, you can read my review for 'Home alone'. Here, I just want to compare this sequel to the original.I think 'variation' would be a more accurate word than sequel, because you find exactly the same ingredients: the family feud, the fast departure, the lone mysterious figure, the wet bandits,  I can't recall a brand where such a copy happens.In addition, the spirit of Christmas is a bit lost. If New York is a wonderful town, it hasn't the warm of a suburb or a mansion.However, the movie is more fun than the first one. It's one of the few movies that make me laugh till I cry. Really! I'm just fond of the Joe Pesci whom bad temper grows bigger and bigger as the hits he takes! And the soundtrack is just awesome: the score from John Williams, close to 'Hook' written in the same period, is an excellent example of the musical power and how can score is essential to movies (and life)! From my recent watchings, '300' is a great movie but doesn't enter my Pantheon because it lacks THE score. I can't even hum the main theme! That's not the case here and that's why I remember to have bought then the audiotape to listen again and again to it, the Darlene love song, the Christmas Carols! Woof: such cool memories! So it's a pleasure to make them discover to the kid, to hand on the torch",10,2,3,14 June 2010
From Hell," What the hell (TV)
","I watched it on screen at its release and remember having troubles to follow the story and explain the motive behind the murders.Now, I decided to have a second look because I just finished to read the big comics of Moore and Campbell. And I realized how this movie sucks! It's absolutely not an adaptation of the comics but a failed variation on it. So exit some brilliant ideas (the mystic London, the ingenious plot, the royal family scandal, the scapegoat, the false clairvoyant, ...) and welcome stupid innovations (the stoned detective, the Spanish doctor, ). I am sure that if they could, they would have changed London for New York and replaced the ripper by a butcher! Now, the beginning of the movie and the murders appear more stupid than my first viewing! In addition, the sets look cheap and really pasteboard and the cast is really funny: all the hookers are ugly except Heather Graham who wears a ridiculous red hairstyle! I understand why Johnny Deep needs to shoot opium and why Moore feels betrayed by Hollywood!",1,4,7,12 May 2010
Groundhog Day," An eternal movie.... (DVD)
","I thought at first that it was only a concept movie: a 'what-if' story; an unbelievable story in reality but a very funny & rich one in the philosophical reflexion, like only arts can offer. Another example of this free creativity would be for me 'Back to the future'... You can't go back in your past, but your imagination does! Here's the bottled-up feeling of eternity is excellently considered: the assets (you have time to learn, you know everything & every one...) and the pitfalls (a final boredom, the sadness of losing people without preventing it,...)Then, I realised that this movie is closer to every one's life than many others.... The revelation occurred while the chat between Bill Murray & 2 buddies at the bar:<ul><li>'What would you do if you were stuck in one place, every day was exactly the same, nothing you did mattered ?'</li></ul><ul><li>'That about sums it up for me;'</li></ul>It's my life: I always complain about today is like yesterday & as tomorrow! Getting up tired, taking crowded subways, managing different kind of people with a perverse boss, back to the home to eat nearly the eternal same supper, complicated relationship..... Well, same day over, over & over....That's me, maybe you, and you or you..... This movie appeals to every one: Fantastic! And it offers in addition a solution: being socially generous.... Smile, help as much as you can & you will have the payback: your life will improve!!!! Zen, philosophy, psychology, religion says the same thing but in hundred years, thousand pages of writing..... Here's what a 2 hours movie can do!!!But that's not all: all this would have been impossible without this superb duo of Bill Murray & Andie MacDowell: I am a fan of both and they excel in this movie: I think they never have been closer than their true self: Murray has really two faces: the cynic & the kind... MacDowell: well, she smiles, she laughs, she plays, she is kind, romantic, honorable, trustful... the perfect soulmate for every one...And the final touch: the Director: Harold Ramis.. I was a fan of National lampoon, Ghostbusters and with his DVD commentary, I discover a great man: sympathetic, spiritual. He shares his enthusiasm with success and gives great insights for his movie (the symbolic & funny thanks of all the town as his motivation to direct...)So, if you have infinite time, enjoy this one as much.. And if you don't have time, give yourself a little to view it !!!!!",10,11,15,19 July 2006
National Treasure," All this for that (DVD)
","As with 'Ghost rider' (also with Cage), this is a movie i watched partly with the kid and now i take the time to see it all. I loved the fast-paced beginning and the historic background: in about 40 minutes, Cage and his buddy manage to steal the most heavily guarded national treasure: Then, if the story allows us to visit some great places in Philadelphia and NY, the enigma becomes too long and complicated to be riveting. Also, the party runs after a treasure and this isn't the same emotional involvement than with 'Da Vinci', the real inspiration for this movie. It's a Disney's feature so it's a family entertainment, thus non-religious or spiritual. Linking Templars and Freemasons is a bit loose and as the big secret, treasure, kept hidden for centuries is only material and gold, the disappointment is huge.",4,0,1,15 May 2011
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Shoots & Shots (Screen)
","If the drama is better handled in other movies, the historical value is rather really interesting: For one time, the brutal European soldiers don't wear 'swastika'. In other words, even the proud European democracies have some skeleton in their closets.Then, in our time when wars look like video-games, this not so ancient guerrilla (in the 30s) seems archaic: the Irish wear suits, their priority is to get guns. But, if the message is clear 'British out of the land!', the democratic debate is dull. I got the feeling they renounce their ideals and in addition, it's too macho world: the story is void of any feminine influence.So too many deceptions to become a cult 'Palme d'or' war movie as 'Apocalypse Now'....",1,3,13,12 November 2006
Total Recall," I can remember it (TV) (screen) (vhs)
","In the year 1990, I was reading the action, paranormal, fantasy, sci-fi french movies magazine Mad Movies and that's surely how I picked this movie and later discovered PKD works! If the screenplay is a bit different from the short story, it's however a excellent story about identity, space colonization and the movie is totally gripping with talent everywhere: Goldsmith's soundtrack is extraordinary, Stone new coming is remarkable, Ironside is the definition of hard-boiled and as in Robocop, the big boss is really this dirty CEO. For sure, the visuals of this future and Mars is realistic and Verhoeven knows how to give a really fast pace while not losing the audience in a complicated script! Here, it's clear, clean and well cut. Maybe there is too much blood and bodies count but at the end, that's among the finest example of what's sci-fi: a never seen experience as much for the eyes than for the brain!",10,0,3,3 September 2016
Rocky," Rocky, the « fist » one (TV)
","Sometimes, memories and the spirit of a movie are better than the movie itself. This is the case with this Rocky. I was a teenager in the 80's, in which Stallone's movies are archetypal: Rambos, Rockys. In regard to the boxer saga, I was fascinated with its symbolization of America (the star spangled shorts, Us vs CCCP) and the prime value of America, which Apollo Creed, its rival in this movie, announces clearly: 'America is the land where every one can go to the top if he takes the chance at hand'. In the hard times of maturing into an adult, these speech is a big help: 'believe in you, fight and you win'.Maybe Rocky isn't the only movie with this message, but Stallone gives a very moving interpretation: he doesn't abuse others with his strength, he sticks with his values, he always gives an hand, and the romance with 'Adriannn' is admirable by its simplicity & sincerity. A great applause for Talia Shire for playing with such talent, a blooming introvert's wise woman.Rocky also makes a difference with the score, which is unforgettable, and later with the great songs ('eye of the tiger').So, you remember very easily all that & you care about, but, I don't find the pleasure to see this first part again and again. On the other hand, this is also the 1st movie I saw on TV from a very long time, and I wanted to catch this airing after having seen at screen 'Rocky VI', which I prefer (maybe because Rocky has aged as well as me.)I leave you with two speeches in connection to Rocky:1/ the Oscar winning speech of Forest Whitaker, which is a real but similar story to Rocky (why not make a movie about his life so?? (ah-ah): 'It wasn't my reality to think I would be acting in movies - so receiving this honour tonight tells me it is possible. It is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in south central LA and Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen.' 2/ the dialog with the crook Gazzo, because it is the exact painful dilemma I face everyday at work (even thought my job isn't to collect money for mob (ah-ah bis)), so it was fun to hear it in a movie: 'Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't do it like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.' 'I figured...' 'Yeah, well don't figure - Let me do the figurin', okay, Rock? From here on in, just let me do the figurin', you know? From here on in, do what I tell you to do, because it's bad for my reputation, you understand? You got - you got it, Rock?'",10,0,1,28 February 2007
Some Like It Hot," Nobody is perfect but the trio is close to that (dvd)
","At first, i was surprised to see that the movie is in black and white but it's true that it fits well with the period (prohibition) and it helps the subject (transvestism). Contrary of recent movies, the movie is slow paced and takes time in locations (Snowy Chicago, the train, Coronado hotel), which dynamizes the story. If the idea of men playing women is usual today, I think this one is the grandfather of all of them. Its originality is the multiple transvestites and their distinct personalities. Lemon is wonderful as he loses his identity and Curtis is funny as a stiffer lady (and he has something to add belong his TV work in 'The Persuaders').At last, I see now a complete movie with Marilyn: i think indeed that as she gets older, she wins in appeal. But it's rather her fragile sensibility that opens her the gate of movies pantheon. In all cases, she was really an all-around performer and an excellent singer as well!I don't really think it's the number one comedy of all time because I don't laugh continuously (as in 'Pee Wee') but it's a timeless classic. A century after, the sincere enthusiasm of the cast is still contagious.A funny thing i discovered with the bonus DVD is that all the promotional pics are fake: it's only Marilyn's head on a double body's but it's expected as she is indeed the 'late' Marilyn Monroe.",7,0,2,28 April 2012
The Da Vinci Code," A movie that motivates ...A RED GIN (Screen)
","The 'Da Vinci Code' has a lot of things the others haven't, thus giving an unique flavor:<ul><li>a complex story: it isn't usual to have your 'grey matter' working in a movie. My last time was 'JFK' (another big conspiracy...?). Human nature likes to ponder, solve questions, so thanks for the authors to offer such pleasure...</li></ul><ul><li>the American blockbuster effect to a french set: I am french &amp; lives in Paris, have visited the Louvres museum... So it was great to see my neighborhood directed in a new &amp; speedy way.. The same feeling applies to the cast: Tautou &amp; Reno are very famous here, and hearing them speak fluently English was fun... And Hanks, as excellent wines, ages very well...</li></ul><ul><li>the subject, now.... ah!.... well, i don't think a movie (or a book) can erase questions, traditions, beliefs from about 2000 years. Personally, i can watch this movie and read a book from Pope Pie XVI, offered by a friend...</li></ul>Finally, a essential question: is the movie better than the book ? Well, I am maybe the last human on earth, but I haven't read it. The movie was my first experience of this Da Vinci mania... The only opinion I can give is the basic truth of film-making: pictures have strength than words haven't & vice-versa: The beginning of the story is thus masterly, and the Valette stage is revealing...NB: 'a red gin' is a puzzle: solution is 'reading'.....",7,1,4,25 June 2006
Titanic," *** 500th review / 100th Anniversary *** A night to remember (vhs) (screen)
","Well, as the Titanic's wreck, i never planned to a night like this. Titanic was released in 1997 and i didn't watch it in theater then. I think i must have said something like this: 'what's the point to see it as we already know how it ends!'. Not very bright but as shown in the movie, that's what life is about: to change for the better. Then, I caught it on TV at its maiden broadcast (in 1999) and i found it great indeed. But, seven years after, when i began writing reviews for IMDb in 2004, it wasn't still on my list because my first task was to review all my DVDs. So now, seven years later, i finally watched and reviewed them all and i intended that my 500th review marks my last ones (to discover what they are, just wait and read my 501th review coming next...).But, yesterday, Saturday 14th April 2012, exactly 100th year after its wreck, i admit that Titanic was heavy on my mind. For us westerners, Titanic was symbolic: the biggest machine man built never made it. I can't say if it's Babel Tower all over again but all its story leads to the unavoidable meeting of this ship and this iceberg. Its thousand victims are the first ranking peacetime tragedy in humankind. Indeed Titanic was indeed the summit because western civilization never got higher later. However, i still didn't want to see it that day on 3D screen because i planned to see it with my family next week when we will be again together (don't worry: i will travel by train!). But, as my fridge was empty and i had to go out, my idea was to go in a bookshop before and buy one good book about Titanic and keep the ticket as well. But there wasn't any special offers at the biggest one in Paris. Hopefully, i could try another one at Champs-Elysées that was also close to a food-store ... and a theater.incidentally, i just took a look at the programing and see that 'Titanic 3d' was on screen one hour later at 20h40. So, if i would watch it now, it will be nearly at the same time that it sank one hundred years before! It was like all the victims resonated in me and i just bought the ticket and stepped into my first screen viewing of this titan!I think all the names the Titanic had can be also given to this movie. Wonderful, Modern, Outstanding and unsinkable as well! It's one of the best movie ever released and i'm sure it will be celebrated even a century away!I can't name another movie that blends so much history, romance and technology! Cameron and his crew gives so much to get us on the boat and in the same time crafts a powerful love story. If a lot have been said about DiCaprio, Winslet is phenomenal as well. In all cases, it's moving to see a such strong love and what they shared for hours in this flamboyant daylight before the wreck worths lifetime. But the story is also a sincere classes critic and it's good to have a writer/director to give voices to the poors or the women conditions. It's also a formidable testimony of courage for all those braves who stayed on board to help and to finally wait for death (her captain, her designer, Gugenheim, ...)Well, there's a lot to experience in such compartmentalized place and it has been anointed with a last grace: Horner's score is one of the best heard ever and really gives a beating heart to the movie.The final reunion with Jack waiting Rose at the staircase, surrounded with all those brave souls is a definitive moment of filmmaking and it's another memory of a vibrant final moment that I keep in mind (among 'Blade Runner','Godfather III', 'Knowing' and 'Blood Diamonds').Well, i take a look at the hour: 2h20 in the morning on 15 April 2012. At this time, Titanic went exactly deep under and actually, i must say that i'm all frozen as well because i wanted to write that review windows open to let the chilly April night enter my room and experience a bit the cold that they faced a century ago...Well, i suppose i wouldn't be there for her 200th birthday but i hope that my heart will go on for hundred reviews like those...RIP",10,1,4,14 April 2012
Rocky III," A real challenger ! (payTV)
","Here in France we consider Sly as a gentle dumb but watching this 3rd round I think he is really underrated ! I discovered Rocky as a teen so at the start of the 90s and the movies really punched me then ! But now i realize that those movies were much older and if we watch them with contemporary eyes, we see that they are really forerunner of the modern American movies ! First of all, if Sly hasn't invented sequels, he is among the first authors to believe in it : back then, we had only Coppola (Godfather), Lucas (Star Wars) and a few others Next, he is also the first author to illustrate scenes with just a song and no dialogues, and what a song : « eye of the tiger ». Still today, it's a rock classic and this song editing is used by everyone now ! Next, as a director, i found Sly has great inspirations with striking angles, close-up, news editing, all things that we see everyday now but back then were original. As an author, we can say whatever but Rocky has a special place in our heart as the movies are true to deep values : efforts, getting up after a blow, friendship, marital life, education, citizenship Here, Rocky is still bound to Philly, he spends some nice time with his son, he has to deal even more with celebrities and fame, and for sure, the punching winner is also a crying man ! But we got also minorities friendship and one more time, there is not a lot movies with that question ! As for acting, all the cast is wonderful as they are totally into their characters and if they don't have much to do, they always achieve to be real ! Talia is fantastic as a supportive wife and newcomer Mr. T spills fury forever ! Finally, i didn't write about the fights and that's why Rocky movies are important and true classic because they tell us so much in addition to boxing !",10,2,4,18 September 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Pure magic (dvd)
","It's the best movie of the best book. It has everything: a original story, an incredible cast, a talented production. It's a really breath of air, compared to today blockbuster where CGI is indigent and to later Potter movies (the Yates period) where everything turns darks. Watching those first steps makes me understand two things: First, when a movie involves kid, their credibility lies upon the creativity of the director. Indeed, Columbus was the finest choice for the job after what he has done in 'Home alone'. Here, he gives his young cast the perfect suggestions. I believed a lot of people find the movie too much eye-candy but it's what the book is about: stepping into a new universe filled with magical things and with kids. So, the crucial thing was to have this feeling of amazement.Next, Potter is the best piece of fantasy since 'Star Wars'. I really don't see others fiction works that can make dream kids and adult as well in the 1990 and 2000. The only regret we can get is that the first stories are really educational for kids whereas the last stories, starting with HPATOFP, are too much about violence, death, war and killings. I really can't accept the high dose of violence the young generation is exposed today because life is above all about fighting inner demons than bad people! How can they discover what courage means when the only solution they see is to punch, kick, kill the one who are against them. our actual societies are becoming like Sparta and thus, in those earlier movies of Potter and in this one, particularly, there was at least still place for innocence.",10,0,1,23 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Saved by the Imax (screen)
","I saw this movie in Imax, and this format really helped me to have a good time. Not my goal to say this movie is bad but it is surely not unforgettable.Maybe I'm too old, but nor the story, nor the characters inspire me. Harry is a bit dumb, not very focused on his schoolwork & has only his courage to admire. In that way, he's not such a good role model for young people. In addition, this 4th chapter has the usual scheme of the previous three and i feel a bit alienated of having to get back to school again.On the other hand, the visual is stunning and it's a stroke of magic to have imagine such a coherent and intriguing universe.In conclusion, the movie is more interesting than the book because the pictures deserves best visual things (a castle, a dragon) and in the same time less interesting because words are what make alive a character....(Having seen the Yates' period, Newell was good in injecting a lot of humor and funny things and above all was better at directing the cast: for one time, Harry and his peers seems alive with their lines!)",4,0,0,7 February 2006
Thor," This Thor won't go into Valhalla (tv)
","As soon as the movie starts, I could feel this adaptation was another Marvel failure (following the Spidey reboot, Daredevil, Hulk, the Xmen or Iron man sequels). It's a pity because they had everything needed for a great movie (an original character, a solid cast). They just couldn't grasp the vision of Nordic mythology and Stan Lee's genius. Here, the CGI production is disastrous as they stupidly enhance the Asgard sets with highly golden colorization to pass for gold! Next, as the heroes goes into the frozen realm, the effects are rather bad. Then, as Thor arrives to earth, his landing isn't NYC but American southwest, thus that is to say nothing except rock and desert landscapes. His Midgard adventure has no deepness except a good fight against his nemesis, the Destructor. This disappointment is also felt with Natalie's performance (who was my main motivation to watch this flick) as she just brought her friendly smile to an empty character. I don't know what other Marvel fans think about it but we are very far away here from Simonson's, Claremont or Romita's territories. In conclusion, Marvel has always the nose to get the real man or woman for the role but they never understand that a comic adaptation needs more. Instead of having Stan the man doing funny cameos in each movie, they should give him the script as well as his ideas totally revolution the medium!",1,7,13,23 June 2013
The Happening," The Review (Screen)
","This is only my first Shyamalan movie after a lot of acclaimed movies.The plot of this one is interesting and recalls the 70's fantasy & political thematic. The nature strikes back against human kind and it can be deadly: personally, i find the natural twist a bit rude and disturbing for a young audience. When you see only the poster, you don't think to this violence. Maybe the trailer is more explicit? As a horror movie, be sure to find the isolation feeling. As usual, the heroes first live in a crowded city and find progressively themselves alone. You can draw a parallel with 'the War of the World', especially the Spielberg movie. From New-York to the country filled with lunatic people, the plot is the same. It allows a good comparison between the two talents (for me, Spielberg is better).The crazy credits consist in a final sequence in a park in Paris. Living there, I suppose this last warning is maybe adjusted for all the worldwide megalopolis.",4,0,1,30 July 2008
The Untouchables," Touched (tv)
","This is an upper class cop movie that shines in all areas: an exciting class with great newcomers (Costner, Garcia) and powerful old ones (Connery, De Niro); great outdoors locations disguised to look like the 30s, a moving script in which we really understand the dramatic lives of law enforcers, an amazing score to illustrate this urban western and for sure, a talented director who is among the best to understand that movies are about frames! I'm really happy that Sean (I have always thought it was De Niro!) has won the Oscar for his part as old age makes him a perfect father figure! Costner was also good as like in JFK, he knows how to show his inner struggles! Finally, watching this movie, I start to think that this old society was much better than the actual days: family, values, fashion was clean, neat",10,2,4,12 September 2016
The Godfather: Part III," Less God, More Father! Godfather Marathon  28/12/08  21H00 (Screen)
","This final part was projected after a short pause of 30 min and closed my marathon.A lot of people dislike it: it's even not among the IMDb top 100. In addition, the movie failed for Oscar and paid his dues to the Hollywood life, with a missing Robert Duvall! Nevertheless, for me it's the best! I have already seen it years ago at its release and the spell is always there! All the great thing that makes the Godftaher are here and updated for the 90's: the family, the desire for clean business, the unforgiven criminal roots, Sicilia, the Christian faith, the scandals and  the music: Coppola chooses to close his trilogy with an opera and he has fine taste: 'Cavalleria Rusticana' by Mascagni! Really, really great music and closely tied with the frames It took 2 movies for Al to be under the flashlight with his acting, but this time, it's really him who steals the show: You see that he has gained a lot of experience under his belt: amused and serious with his affairs, lovestruck for his ex-wife, and deeply caring for his children.His reaction on the red carpet after the show is my most moving scene of all time: never seen a pain so big in another movie! Just for that single moment, Al deserves my eternal gratitude! Right after, you have the biggest love montage on the opera Intermezzo and you finish with a deep lesson of philosophy: In 2 minutes, Coppola said it all about life and it's an amazing feat! Thanks!",10,1,2,13 January 2009
It's a Wonderful Life," Beyond my expectations (rental)
","I have always heard about this movie as a Xmas classic (maybe because a clip is shown in Gremlins) and having watching it now, i agree: a bit like Scrooge, it's about a salvation in the holiday but unlike him, the guy is pure good while Scrooge is evil. For a movie fan, you will be happy because the movie has the same feeling as Spielberg comedies, it begins like Stand by me and ends like BTTF2: the nightmarish small town V2 is really well done. James Stewart looks like very much David Lynch and he is a true fine actor! The story is full of good values, hope and in addition is aware in punching greedy capitalism! So today you won't find a comedy so deep, so social while the situation would need urgently so have fun and a education with this one while you can!",10,3,5,19 March 2018
A Beautiful Mind," A beautiful revisionism (dvd)
","My cinema hobby is an escapist one, searching values in movies that our actual world ignores. So there's nothing worst for me that a movie that tramples morality and beauty. In this genre, this one ranks among high.It begins with the extras: 30 minutes of deleted scenes with Howard saying that they are all beautiful, perfect but it had to cut them because of the time. Where's the rule that says that this biopic must run 130 minutes exactly? The length is never fixed, it depends of the story.Then, he proposes a scene with his real father: 'cut for show business'. What are his values? Money over Family? One of the finest French director (Richard Berry) always finds a part (big or small) for his daughter in all his movies! Next, the movie starts and it's the carnival of Horror: To depict that the story happened in the 50's, Howard uses very strong golden colorization! Then, we have to believe that Crowe is a 22 years student! And ice on the cake: his delusions are 'real', which is total nonsense. In other words, the director found brilliant to embody his delusions like normal people. I didn't know that mental illness was a fairy tale! All the power of this drama is killed at birth and it's a shame. It reminds me of the french movie 'l'adversaire' that stars also a psychotic. This one cheats all his family for years and it's his ultimate moment that reveals his madness. With that climax, our french 'Howard' thought also brilliantly to start the movie by the end! Well, the great error of this biopic is to treat illness like a thriller, a spy movie. Others much talented directors (Lynch) can really depict what is madness and a dangerous reality.Sadly, Jennifer isn't acting so wonderful to earn her Oscar instead of Crowe, who is really convincing as a big man becoming very fragile. If you add that the story eludes his first child, his homosexuality and his divorce (!) and that you saw all the Oscars it won, I conclude that Hollywood has really gone psychotic now! NB: My real anguish with that itself but the fear of the psychosis. Now, i don't see or hear delusions but I'm afraid to face them in the future. So am i already psychotic and i don't know it actually ?",1,10,19,3 November 2011
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," there isn't secrets: it's Colombus + Williams + Harris
","This is for me the best of the series and it goes as well for the book, the game and the movie. It's the quintessential Potter spirit because it has all the goof things I look for: the school year, the wizardry, the friendship and the mystery. I remember the first time I saw it: it was during a Wednesday baby-sitting of the son of a good friend: He was 6 then and we kept playing the scene when the Spider comes up at the car's window. It's true that the production is less baroque (cheaper?) than the later movies but at last, the young trio is still well coached and the visual stays very realistic even if it's about an imaginary universe. If Hermione takes a health leave, Ginny makes a brilliant substitute and it's funny to see that she has always been this same quiet, shy girl. But this movie counts for me because it's the last of the real Dumbledore. Richard Harris was the perfect choice: his weary voice (a bit like Pacino) and his aura makes him a very warm grandfather and a respected headmaster. Gambon never gets into the robe and it's a pity that Mr. Harris couldn't follow the adventure.",10,0,1,12 March 2012
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Mr & Mrs Missed ! (DVD)
","I am a huge fan of Angelina Jolie ; I can't stand Brad Pitt ! This movie won't change my mind ! Pitt has only his cool attitude and charisma to play with while Angelina shows a thousand feelings ! But she can't save a xerox script written from previous movies and a formatted summer blockbuster : If you listen to the commentaries, you'll see that the production restrain itself from doing this or that in order to become a family entertainment.This is a upside-down artistic creation : art is delivering ideas to public and not public to ideas ! For true inspiration, get a a look to the french comedy « La Totale », which is the first link to this chain of weds but hidden spies.One great surprise : Vince Vaughn, who seems to be a really great buddy to have fun with !",4,4,8,27 February 2008
The Departed," Irish copy (dad)
","This movie is similar to Pacino's movie Donnie Brasco but for one time we leave the NYC and Italian underworld for the Irish and Boston! Thus having Damon playing in it is interesting as he deepens his local ties from Will Hunting and in a way, his meeting with DiCaprio is the new generation confrontation of Pacino / De Niro. However, the pleasure doesn't go farther as this movie is just totally unbelievable: the new thug becomes close to the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the police rat, the policeman grows up with the criminal boss and nobody thinks he is the criminal rat. With that, the movie just take fun to tell the most bad words and to show the most blood... All the characters are pathetic, badly played by the ordinary big names who does their same show over and over (Baldwin, Wahlberg, Nicholson who has absolutely no charisma as the boss!). The scenes with the shrink are totally useless and just add minutes to get a long movie! Sure many would praise it as it's a Scorcese but frankly, i won't watch it again while DB is much more engaging!",4,3,4,28 January 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Transforme « d » Too Much (Screen)
","This sequel was on my active list, because the first one was a brilliant mix between comedy, science fiction and intense action. Sadly, I watched it on my TV and lost then nearly all pleasure. So, I wanted to see part 2 on screen, but my bad luck goes on because I missed the Imax version. Having seen it thus on a normal screen, I am sure that the Imax version would have been a terrific experience! I think that this sequel keeps all the great things of the first movie but all the bad things as well.The positive things: the excellent cast with the teens, parents, the agent; the comedy moments; the amazing effects and the incredible tempo of the action: it is 100% adrenaline; the opening sequence at the parents' home or the car abduction left me speechless The negative things: the sound effects too loud, especially the robotic ones which mute the speeches; a fragile story which isn't told simply; the last part of the movie for its length; and above all, the design of the transformers which could have been less detailed. I like the simple, pure design in the cartoons, toys, comics and they should have kept this look instead of this highly mechanic, blurry,confuse design. For example, when they fight, you can't tell what the robots doing.In conclusion, a great movie for fun but in need of polish",4,3,9,11 August 2009
The Holiday," Maybe for the production but nor for the audience ! (rental)
","I was indecisive with this movie as it seems to offer good things (christmas season, Kate, Jack Black) but also rotten ones as well (Diaz, Law) After watching it, i can surely say that it is a real stinker ! First of all, you can't tell this a movie happening between Christmas and New Year and it's surely the worst movie that fails to catch the spirit of this special time ! You can draw the same conclusion for the locations : it should have been an essential factor but the differences between LA and English country-life is badly handled ! Remember NL vacations in Europe for quality!Next, it's again an Hollywood movie talking about Hollywood life and for me, it's ground zero of film-making ! I don't watch movies to have time with producers, writers or composers ! Next, i sincerely tried but Diaz is just a poor actress : she isn't funny or romantic ! In addition, Law is just boring playing his usual handsome widower that i just skip all their scenes so half the movie goes to the trash ! So there's only Kate and Jack Black left : Kate is always great playing this simple, open, emotional reactive girl and Jack Black is cool ! They have good chemistry together ! But that's all : their respective love story is dull as ever and the meeting with old writer is totally useless, pointless and Wallach stays as irritating old as young!So i felt very miserable with this movie announced as Holyday!!! No more!!!",1,1,3,21 March 2016
War of the Worlds," Best Movie of the Year (Screen)
","At least ! A big catastrophe movie WITHOUT the President of United States... It is a good change, for us, the ordinary people. And as it is Spielberg at the helm, the movie is a wonderful moment. He leaves all his colleagues far behind, because he is THE master of storytelling.By sticking to this 'private' perspective, he wins! The audience only knows what the characters know, and the situations have more weight. It's like a Reality movie, or a docu-drama: shoulder-camera, brilliant transition sequences. Beyond the story, it looks like melting-pot of a lot of his past success: 'Jaws', 'Close encounters', 'Schindler's list', 'Hook', 'Jurassic' and it is always enjoyable to see how a great director still dig into his thematic after 20 and more movies: kids, family, individual or mass terror, space,....But, as the movie deals with an invasion of Martians, it is frightening. I literally fall down in this 'war of the worlds' as if it was for real. Feeling real emotions in front of a fake, fictitious world is the ultimate proof of talent.I was tensed, anxious in front of this never ending drama. Psychologically, I got the same reaction as on the '9.11': the world is reduced, the liberty of movement is more and more smaller. You never know what happens next and then, you start to appreciate your life minute after minute.OK, the character of Tim Robbins is maybe not perfect, the Martians are far-fetched, but i got my more memorable movie experience since a long time. In conclusion, a Classic story turns now into a Classic movie.....",10,1,5,13 July 2005
All Quiet on the Western Front," America doing a pacifist movie? there is new on the western front!
","The movie begins like the future documentary Triumph of the Will, with brave German soldiers marching in a German village, with call to courage, motherland, bla, bla, bla... Sure when those rookies finally train and go to the front, it's something really totally different and it's called reality: when you watch your comrades falling, throwing their guts, you find that there is no explanation to such a butchery! You realize that the only winners are firms that sells weapons, politicians who claim war and never do it, safe in their palace and that finally all those young lost lives have been useless... Sure the movie speaks like no other and there is really inspired moments, especially the final scene but honestly, a war or anti-war movie in black and white during the WWI and for 2 hours are however too much for me...",4,0,13,22 May 2018
Wedding Crashers," Scripting Stealers (screen)
","For those who like the 'Meet the Fockers' franchise, this movie should appeal, because it is a clone: the same wedding project, the same meeting with the upper-class family, the same shock of values...The only original idea is that the fun is really trash, a lot centered about the 'thing'. Another difference is that there isn't one protagonist but Two!!! But again no surprise: it is the classic comedy duo, with handsome & sensitive 'brain' & his sympathetic big buddy...In conclusion, there isn't not much inspiration. But as the cast is talented, this movie is enjoyable. It was all the more for me, little french, that I saw it in Sweden with a friend of mine.So, here's a different definition of a good movie: it's one you share with someone you care...",1,2,4,24 October 2005
Ice Age," Best animation of 2K first decade (screen) (DVD)
","This is simple: this feature has all: great characters, original story, excellent design, matching score! A lot of animations try to be funny but fail: here's i laugh from the beginning to the end, thanks to Sid, Scrat and his nut. Next, the other animations want also to move the audience but fail to carry the message in an easy way: here, the friendship between the trio and the family values are depicted simply and directly: no boring dialogs, through painted cavern for example! At last, this animation is superb with his close ties to Nature: the environment is stunning: simple and soft colored! The animals, even the heroes, stay animals: they don't try to fake humans. In conclusion, this animation is a classic and you will be very happy to share it with your kids!",10,1,1,5 June 2011
The Mission," The poster is actually one vivid memory (screen)
","This huge waterfall, crouched between seats, is what i remember of the screening of this movie. I explain: In 1986, i was 12 and our great french teacher took the classroom to watch it in theater: it was exceptional because this kind of lessons outside the school was very rare.So we were kids and like all kids, the wisdom, poetry and humanity left us cold as we prefer to play GI in the dark between ranks!
Later, this movie was an audio tape (google it if you don't know what is it) that my twin brother bought and that my father kept playing in long trip in our family car. Sure Morricone music is beautiful but at the end, i couldn't stand it anymore!
Now, it's OK: as an adult, i could watch it again and fully appreciate this remarkable movie: it's always shameful to understand that my civilization Europe made others bleed in the name of the best theories and is still free of any accounting today ... The wise say: those who don't understand the past are prone to repeat it. So watch this movie and learn!",10,0,0,22 March 2020
The Green Mile," Life Penalty ? (dvd)
","This forced sugar melodrama doesn't really moves me : the prison genre has always left me cold and in this case, a lot of things really blocks me : 1) « old sparky » : i found that using a so long and meticulous process is useless and definitively cruel when a firing squad just suffices. It would be interesting to do historical research for the explanation. 2) the gentle, kind atmosphere of the « mile » : except the needed bad guys, everybody else looks as peaceful as the ones of the retirement home : the inmates for death row are supposed to be the worst criminals, while there they are rather lost souls : in a way, it's almost like we should cry for them ! In this way, Coffey is really boring : the gentle dumb, who cries, who is afraid of the dark but love stars ! The wards act like nurses, full of good intentions 3) the healing power of Coffey : it's pure King's paranormal : good idea but one he has already used before and terribly devised : why the needs for those black bugs ??? 4) poor, pitiful Rockwell & Cromwell who never got it well ! you see those two in a lot of movies, they never play the part right as they do tons when it needs subtlety ! If i forget those flaws and others, the movie is really well done as for one time, we have efforts and dedication in every details. The cast has a real chemistry together and Hanks is perfect as the team leader; the cinematography is one of the best i have seen in ages and the production is full of timely artifacts ! The bonus are detailed but they stupidly cut the best birthday speech from King : when he says that he wish for the best movie award so now it loses it !! « Tooms » is worthy of an extraordinary mention and the late « Kingpin » needs a remembrance as well !",7,0,1,28 May 2016
The Reader," ... of a story very, very lenient about criminals against humanity (web)
","My first impression was to be surprised about the opening credits: Germany in the 60s? What can be interesting to tell at this time? Then, it was a poor love story: the couple only met to have sex or to read. Never we are told they appreciate each other for what they just are. Next, it's the dreadful twist about the holocaust: now that we had time to grow feelings for Kate, we learn that she was a guard in Auschwitz and that she is persecuted. With that dirty trick, the story becomes then a sort of disturbing justification of her crimes, a hypocrite rewriting of history as Americans like it: The point of view argued here is that the Germans who worked in extermination camps weren't killers but just workers. Thus, the real evil was only the famous Austrian and his peers. As my favorite writer, PKD, wrote it and as I have already written for 'Schindler's List', the first criminal in Holocaust is the German people: when you design gas, camps, when you build barracks, chambers, when you put in a train or drive it, select prisoners, when you lock people in a church, you participle in a crime. You can't hide behind work contract, orders, and threats because the humanity in you commands you then to disobey them all. I understand why the original book pleased so much to Germans who lived during WWII: it tells them they are innocent in spite of they have the bloodiest hands in the world. If not, if they aren't responsible, who is? After this shameful argument, the movie reaches more interesting water when it speaks about illiteracy but it's too late and too little. Finally, the movie closes on the traditional clichés of American people: the Jewish family is ultra wealthy and it seems totally inaccurate. With 5 nominations for Oscars, I'm not finally surprised as I learned to understand that the Academy is pretty delirious in their choices (see for example, 'a beautiful mind' for another rewriting of facts that has been awarded)!",4,2,3,5 October 2013
Jaws," The T-Rex of seas (cinematheque)
","Above all, Jaws is two memories of my childhood: first, it's a shark toy. It was big, very look-like and mean, with white hard teethes on a articulated jaws: the game was to retrieve things inside of its jaws, a sort of Dr. Maboul. Then, I have also a Playmobil yacht and with my star wars figurines, it was hours and hours of play. The second is the Benchley's book that I have found in my father's things. I suppose he had bought it in 1976 at a time when my brother and me couldn't speak yet. We were only jaws then. The only difference with the movie i recall is a crude sex scene between Hooper and Brody's wife. I think my father was a fan because we also went to 'Jaws 3D', maybe my first experience of 3D on screen, with the fingers of the body stroking my face. Back to the movie, as a lot Spielberg's, I discovered it on TV and maybe VHS tape so this was my first viewing on screen. Honestly, this time the magic didn't devour me. Sure, it had a great cast, great locations, great score and suspense but in some way, I feel alienated: Maybe it's because i know it by heart, I find it fast, really fast. Then, it was too much a men's hunt. I think that if Spielberg has a weakness, it's that women are often not his focus and Jaws is his best example. In all cases, this movie was the really first to star a killer animal but actually this idea has leave the family and holidays feeling that Spielberg has impulsed to plain gore, blood and blood.Pairing: 'Jurassic Park': another kind of jaws and again a book adaptation...NB: With Google help, I have found the shark toy and I was surprised to see it's actually an official product of the movie: it's the Ideal game and it's just the best piece of merchandising ever. Wish I could find it again and have kids to make them a good gift!",10,1,4,1 April 2012
Dark Shadows," « Just visiting » with a vampire (rental)
","As Hollywood movies get worse and worse, past legends lose as well their brilliance (except Spielberg). Here Tim sure doesn't reach the levels of his 80s – 90s works but it's a bit better than his more recent works I understand that it's a TV show adaptation but the idea of medieval characters getting out of sync with our modern technological time is the idea of our french top movie comedy « Les Visiteurs » ! At least, it's funny and Deep is unusually good with his noble manners ! I really like how the mansion was crazily Gothic, the 70s fashion and songs. With this great soundtrack, it erases the total void of Danny's score (do you remember the main theme ?) 'Rorsaach' and Michelle was astounding all the more it has been ages that I haven't seen her and Green (who looked like Tim's past girlfriend especially when she did the martian girl) was a thousand time more hot there than in the 'Sin City' sequel ! On the contrary, Miller, Carter and above all Moretz are just insipid ! Beyond this, there is really a story problem as it keeps repeating the same idea, the same dialogs (Green wants Deep as a lover and Deep isn't agree) and the violent finale is just a very cheap way to conclude this drama !",7,0,0,29 March 2016
Kingpin," Maybe a strike (vhs)

Hancock," Charlize takes Hancock (DVD)
","As for 'I'm a Legend', this Will Smith movie was my birthday gift for the teen and we watched them the same day while the kid was ill. He liked it so much that he kept watching it after. Personally, I am a bit disappointed by this one.It's like there are 2 movies in one: The first is about a reluctant super hero and it's good and funny. Being lazy, egoistic, the super hero brings more chaos than every thing else. It's great to have a laugh at those icons because x-men, superman and batman are deadly serious! Then, a second movie arrives with the story of twin lover gods and all the fun go away: Theron is very cold as a super woman and the story gets dumb: if they turn simple mortal when they are together, why didn't they die at the hospital? An incomplete movie that is energized nevertheless by the very sympathetic and talented Will Smith!",4,1,5,5 July 2010
Hitch," Don't-B-Hitch ! (DVD)
","Hitch (Will Smith), a relationship counselor, is helping a brave guy in dating her rich & beautiful boss (a new actress to watch for, i hope) while he must face problems with her own girlfriend.Well, with Smith, you always got a nice guy & a lot of humor. The surprise is that the funny moments are with his student and not with his story, which is depicted in a more dramatic (serious) tone.This is a minor deception because this paradox (a man who is best to help others but fail to help himself) is a pit of good opportunities of laughs. In addition, the box cover is written in that spirit.In regards to the dating rules background, well, this movie takes the lead & offers interesting tips. But, I am not supportive of all contents telling 'you must change' (your clothes, your dance style, your listening,....) instead of 'you must have confidence' (in your feelings, in her feelings,...).In conclusion, the DVD proposes several bonus, so you can this movie & enjoy a good moment.",4,2,4,25 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," At least, the end !!!!! (Screen)
","My first star wars movie (and cinema experience) was 'The Empire strikes back'. I was then 6 years old, and Dark Vador (in France) has terrified me and gave me fever. Nonetheless, it was magic and I was very fond of collecting the toys, and inventing tons of stories with them.Then, Lucas decided to show the first trilogy. And, maybe it is my adult consciousness, maybe it is the stories, but I never really get stuck in Episode I, II or now III.Sure, there are great scenes in this last part (ex: The Emperor character, all his seduction of Anakin and his political plotting  I fear the idea the Power can support its own 'fake' adversary to hold on the authority  , the first moments of Darth Vader, the recurring scenes in all the movies.) But, there are dumb character (Grievious), dumb locations (Why Wookies home unless for the vision) and I am fed up with the constant aggressiveness of Jedi/Battles since Episode I. In my opinion, Jedi are spiritual and call on strength and fights only on last solution. Here, as in Episode II, they fight, fight, fight. Sure, the special effects are extraordinary but the movie lacks some soul, depth, in a word: SOME EMOTION.In conclusion, Star wars was a saga of 25 years: maybe my oldest passion. I am glad it is finally over, and if all this first trilogy is a bit less interesting, I will be proud to share it all with my next generation.",7,3,5,10 July 2005
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Funny how the 1st has always everything right (screen) (dad)
","I saw it on screen long ago for Christmas 1983 and my actual watching is still enjoyable: unlike standardized, digitalized, stupid actual comedies about trash talking animals, this first animation has understood what audience wishes: a fairy tale, a story for all ages with an amazing artistic talent behind... Here there is no graphic violence, no bad character to attack, just the need for hard work, the comfort of a cozy home, the help from friends and love above anything! The art is simply stunning and today productions look paradoxically cheap! I wish I had kids to offer them this eternal craftwork of the best talent in humanity!",10,1,1,3 January 2018
Lord of War," A movie about the most dangerous thing for humankind: Nor religion, Nor women, but Weapons ! (DVD)
","My title is cynically shocking but my intention is to arouse consciousness about what really kills: WEAPONS. Not words, not ideas, no differences, but real objects made by humans whose aim is to kill other humans But a weapon is harmless if nobody touches it. So, the 'Thanatos' side of humans (its death pulsion) needs to find somebody who can be the middleman between those who built & those who use.This movies is about this kind of 'lord of war'.From a realistic point of view, the movie is respectful: indeed, Africa is the main consumer because it is the poorest civilization, thus unable to have massive weapons of destruction. In addition, the movie acknowledges the situation of child-soldiers, and the director is honorable to refuse casting 'disabled' child. At least, it denounced the bigger sharks which really pull the strings of those lords of war.From a drama point of view, the story has good dynamics: a brother relationship, an attractive & moralistic wife, western background against natural sets. All the same, as the character of Nicolas Cage compartments his life (his container is a symbolic home for him), the movie is maybe too much rigid, too cut.Cinematography, the director is a good visual one: excellent opening, intelligent frames (the ads of his future wife, the automobile design viewed as target, etc.).But finally, the movie lacks something to motive several viewings but the first one isn't a loss of time also. It has the value of opening a high political issue from the basic level. This debate could go on with the insight of the Philip K. Dick's novel 'the Zap Gun' in which he asked if those who design weapons are kind people, cynic or with a corrupt conscience ???",4,0,4,11 March 2007
Sherlock Holmes," excellent cast + story + production + music = great movie, elementary, my dear Watson (Screen)
","Actually, I got two motivations for this movie: First, RDJR : he got my vote since 'Iron Man' and coming from his painful private life, I like his attitude of having seen the devil and not care! Next: Victorian London: for ages, I am attracted by this city in that time and can't really explain the reason except that my family building has flavor of that. My Christmas experience with 'Scrooge' has been terrible, so I expected much of this one.Besides this, I knew nothing of this movie and for me, Holmes was essentially a boring Japanese cartoon depicted as a fox. That's why I came really surprised by it. Right at the opening credits, I enjoyed it: music, cast, sets, wardrobe, screenplay, everything was amazing. It was great to see again the 'Notebook' heroin and the bad guy is totally convincing with his Andy Garcia look-alike.I haven't keep in mind how he was deductive. Here, his solving skills are a bit robotic but has a tremendous impact. As a detective, the plot he has to solve is really imaginative and Sir Conan Doyle would have approved. But I admit to be a bit dumb being unable to guess the mysterious boss behind all this. I really like the old London because you can see the most incredible wealth being close to tremendous poverty.For the fun, I played Holmes leaving the theater. Near my place, I found a scarf. Remembering the couple sited besides me, I look for them and found them at the toilets. 'I think this belongs to you' 'Sorry but No'. What a shame for Holmes Jr!",7,0,1,27 February 2010
The Terminal," Zen & the art of Spielberg (DVD)
","Thanks for coach Phil Jackson to recommend this enlightening book from mr Pirsig 'Zen & the art of motorcycle maintenance', whom ideas are brilliantly illustrated in that movie.First, it's about being stuck in life due to own value rigidity: Victor Navorsky can be seen in this way. As long as he wishes to enter America as an acceptable traveller, showing honesty to administration & compassion for his fellows, he is stuck in the airport terminal. The word 'terminal' as 'end of everything' is funny in that interpretation.It is also interesting that the character played by Tucci is also very rigid, and his fundamental keys are clearly explained: his passion is 'rules' and Navorsky would be 'stuck' in the terminal as long as he. The escape from this stuckness can be more flexibility, in fact doing 'what is good'. As Victor recognizes that the ultimate goal of his trip is the memory of his father, then his value evolves, and he can be free from his stuckness: He goes to New-York by breaking the law & leaving his friends in difficult situations.Second, Zen is an instant-to-instant practice: the scope is what you see in each moment & you have to deal with that to be happy. In this attitude, Victor excels: he uses every bit, every space of the terminal, and by doing this, he gains a lot of friends. In the opposite, pain is only the experience of not letting go what is lost. His last gaze to Amelia is a perfect reaction: he knows the relationship is sadly dead & accepts it: He gave to Amelia all his best but that wasn't enough for her. He understands that it is useless to add anything else, so he just stares at her.For all those reasons, movies are very helpful to offer advices, wisdom & reflexion to people who must face difficulties but without any family or friends presence. And Spielberg is one of the best filmmaker: his camera is alive (like the spy one at the terminal.. bzzz.. bzzzz) and he always assemble a great team: Tom Hanks (great in dubbing eastern accent & being open-minded), great theme from John Williams, all the world-wide casting & and extraordinary ordinary set of an airport terminal.A movie similar in spirit to 'Groundhog Day' and as enjoyable A recommendation.",7,0,1,26 December 2006
Prometheus," As it's a sequel, you will find which comes first: alien or eggs ? (Imax)
","I totally agree with the Imax promotion saying that you don't watch a Imax movie because in fact, you are in the movie. That's why I wanted to see this space adventure like this and it has been my best Imax screening so far. Staying on board on the ship, watching holograms, exploring this dark mountain for two hours was riveting. Sure, at first, it looks much like a remake of Scott's first movie than a sequel because the basic plot is the same: a space crew, and especially a strong woman and a mysterious android, lands on a isolated planet to face a deadly threat extraterrestrial menace. But, in fact, this universe expands in new topics and this brings more originality and mysteries than the last two boring Alien movies. As Scott even said it, Scifi movies has told so much than the actual releases just retell past stories and indeed it's the case: the two new majors ideas are borrowed: the idea of humankind creation by ET and especially with black goo comes from Indiana Jones, X-files and before from famous comics artist John Byrne (see his run on West Coast Avengers). The other idea of seeking God in space is an old cliché from 2001, Mission to Mars, Star Trek V. In addition, if Alien was a horror movie, this one is more a thriller and a crime story. Indeed, a lot of clues are shown without explanations so the audience must think it over to understand what really happens. If the black goo seems to mutate badly living organisms (the worms) and has mixed with Holloway's semen to become the 'baby' of Shaw, I still don't grasp if the Engineers and Aliens know each other yet. The mural paintings seem to say there are interaction but where are the eggs in this case? And it's strange for those engineers to choose a biological weapon base for meeting. Is this a prophecy then?Finally, for a Scifi movie, i find it interesting that it's also very backward: it's a quest for human origins that happen in a very primitive but also advanced culture. In the spaceship, we feel a lot of nostalgia of old earth (like 'Blade Runner') and the Alien/Engineers biomechanic world looks like antiquity and almost fetishist. In all cases, Scott is a great movie-maker because he doesn't rush the story and when it comes for action, it's something else than the 1 frame by second we see in movies today. Unlike Spielberg, he is interested in portraying strong women and like this, he made me discover an amazing actress. I don't talk about the award winning cold stiff Theron but the cute Noomi! Less salary, no Oscar, but she can play and give emotions thousand times better than her Hollywood pal! Behind her eyes, you can tell that she lived a full life so far in spite of her age! Just for her and her robotic partner, this sequel is a fine movie!",10,4,12,16 June 2012
Halloween," « it's a famous party » (dad)
","This movie is just an amazing benchmark in horror movie ! Maybe i'm wrong as i'm not however a specialist, but as it has been released in 1978, it's thus the first movie involving a slasher ! In other words, Carpenter has invented a new kind of movie by himself and it's not everyday that a director can say the same thing ! It's really astounding to see that he designed all the gimmicks of the genre : subjective camera, oppressing music, the « is-it you – are you there ? » moment It's all the more remarkable that Carpenter is really talented as well and knows how to dose his tools to have the maximum effects ! Instead of today movies which rates terror with the liters of blood, Carpenter just choose the opposite way to show a minimum ! I didn't expect the movie to be also this but it takes place in the famous small town USA that is essential to a lot of famous filmmakers, especially Lynch ! Now, this movie prefigures a lot what would be « twin peaks : fire walk with me » as both movies tell the same story : a country student stalked by evil forces ! I think that Jaimie is perfect here as she seems to be totally natural : a well educated daughter and a cool friend !So, this movie has really written cinema history and with all legitimate reasons so it would be great that Hollywood pays its dues to this master !",10,0,1,2 August 2014
Despicable Me," A lesson for bad dads (Screen)
","This is it.I think this movie was my last screening with the kid due to the choices of his narcissus mother (and my failures to open the talk about this). But for the last movie, the story was symbolic: how a bad man can turn into a great daddy by realizing that kids are the most precious gifts that life can give? I know that the real father of the kid promised him to watch it together but he failed as always to his words (maybe he read the summary and understood clearly that this movie could be a dangerous experience for him).Thus, the 'bragging' friend (this is me) didn't hesitate to offer this opportunity to the kid, all the more than it was his first 3D movie. Remembering him trying to hold the picture between his hands will remain as a fondest memory forever.To be honest, the kid and I didn't know both that the movie was about fatherhood and that's why I found the beginning of the movie a bit slow and dull. But the click happened at the funfair: it was a great idea to put rides on a 3D movie because you can feel similar feelings as the real ones. Then, it was moving to see Gru torn between his duty and his responsibility as a father. This moral lesson was really the heart of the movie and it's far better told than the scary 'Toy Story 3'.Visually, the character design is poor, uninspired and it's unfortunate because it diminishes the power of the story! As for the kid, I don't know if watching a cartoon Dad standing up for his kids wake him questions because this is a territory that i have always forbid me to enter. I just hope that he will get a loving Daddy like Gru soon!",4,1,7,31 December 2010
Back to the Future Part II," Back to back (dvd) (vhs) (screen)
","This one is pure science-fiction and time travel and I will always remember my mother, going out the theater, saying she hasn't understood a single thing! (if I'm right, she has never saw BTTF and I much envy her to discover the franchise at this point). On the contrary, I was totally delighted because it really pushes the time paradox to the limit and it's also a brilliant reflexion about sequels! Actually, movies invent trilogy as a stupid standard and therefore, sequels, reboot are dumb and dumber. This movie has intelligence and offers the ultimate twist of making the sequel inside the first movie! And surprise, unlike the ordinary sequels that looks like the original like a twin, this one opens perspective and reinvent the original movie. Like the first movie, the story is fast, clear. The production is clean, beautiful and the effects are used for a story and are not the story! Thanks to bright fans, we can also discover that the movie has also its bag of inconsistencies: How can the Delorean can reach 88 mph by getting struck by a thunderbolt ? and the best: How can old Biff can come back to 2015 if he has created an alternative time-line?While reading the novelization, I noticed other things: What about Griff's father and Biff's son ? The same father absence exists with Biff 1955. What about Doc 2015? Why Doc 1985 was so unfocused with Marty Jr? Now, if Biff 1955 remembers the Almanach and if Biff 1985 remembers the flying Delorean, how can things really stay the same ? But that's why we like this franchise: the more they have adventures, the less we understand !",10,2,3,2 August 2013
The Queen," A movie that doesn't bend knees (tv)
","Compared to actual movies which are formated to say the expected opinion, this movie is a welcomed change because it tells a personal critical point of view that helps the audience to make its own opinion. I'm not an expert to tell if all the facts are accurate but at least, this movie is courageous!First, it's an open critic of the queen and her family. It clearly shows that they don't understand the people they govern, that they lack of human qualities, that they are so dumbly stuck to etiquette that they forget the reason it has been invented. Next, it's a hidden critic of their way of life: it clearly shows that the royals have an unintelligible wealth, that they don't lack anything, that they have an endless team of lackeys for everything. In short, they don't get tired to work like their people. In a way, they are just expected to do speeches and representation and lead the nation by example and inspiration but for this tragedy, they just failed miserably!Usually, I can't stand Mirren as an actress (remember Benjamin Gates) but here, I recognize she is totally great. The movie is also interesting mixing real footages with fiction (a bit like Oliver Stone) but I would have pushed for more, especially with her speech!",7,0,1,30 April 2015
Blow," Low, very very very Low (DVD)
","I saw this movie in two times: every time, I slept. This is a true sign of its dullness.Maybe the cast is excellent and the director gives good rhythm, but i just can't stand the story! This biography of a dealer doesn't take any stand: The boys could have sell potatoes or chicken, it would have been the sameSorry but not for me: Depicting selling dope as 'cool' is BAD! The commentary offers a lot of 'excuses': it was the 60s the 70s; they were 'young'; they didn't create the 'request'; 'the Colombian are poor peasants', Here, you see dope related to fun: money, parties, girls, etcThe remorse comes with his daughter, but it's not enough and too late! I can't care for his life, because he never cared about the others as well Void of any honor or morality, on the contrary of 'The Godfather' or 'Lord Of War' (reviewed in IMDb), it deserve '1' and basta !!!!!",1,8,17,28 March 2007
Vanilla Sky," We can remember it for you wholesale (dvd)
","This movie has flavor of this excellent story of my favorite writer, PKD, in the sense that we can't distinguish the reality from the imagination. We can also find the same idea to buy memories and have the tech support to come to help. In addition, the multiple ideal lover is a thematic very Dickien as well.This part gives breath to a movie that was rather a bit dull and dragging: the new Quasimodo life of a rich, egoist playboy is laughable: if the biggest challenge he has to face now is to go out and his biggest fear is that his lover would reject his disfigured, well, he knows nothing about life or love as well. As Penelope says, he really has to 'abre los oyos'.Maybe he deserves his fate after having 'stolen' the friend of his best friend. But as i done that myself, i think that no red line is crossed because it's among friends not married couples. Moreover, loves needs courage and implies a connection that needs two people to exist, (except maybe in this movie).This fourth aspect of the movie, love, touched me a lot: This movie was simply the one that gets me into following Penelope's filmography: i remember to have just been struck by the trailer, with her cute accent, her smile, the slam of the door and the song. I always thought it was McCartney but i was surprised to learn that it's actually from his rival, Peter Gabriel and it's called 'Solsburry Hill'. For me, this 'electrical meeting' ranks among the best scene of that kind in movies: the only other examples that come to my mind is 'Lost Highway' with 'Magic Moment' (that is a bit alike) or 'Bluest eyes of Texas' in 'Boys don't cry'. Well, Penelope did such a great performance that she has added at least one more fan with this movie.Actually, I know that this movie is a remake of a Spanish film and as it stars luckily Penelope, i will meet you tomorrow after watching it ! See you ...",10,1,2,15 August 2011
X-Men: First Class," Can achieve better results (tv)
","So, i have watched « XMEN: DOFP » the morning in theater and i was lucky to watch this one on TV the evening after. For me, none of them is better as the two aren't truly « comics adaptation » but rather pale inspirations. Both used name of characters, certain famous moments of X-men history (especially uncanny #150) and then, they cook their own soup. Here, the Hellfire Club becomes a sort of Specter or fit for for « Austin Powers » and the X-Men get tangled in international crisis. This first class has rather boring teammates (Havok, Banshee, Mystique, 'angel Salvadore'?,'Darwin'?, 'Riptide'?). If the sets are however visually stunning, the power of this movie is to have found an incredible young Magnus with Fassbender. As Ridely Scott has noticed in « Prometheus », this actor is just great as he really acts old school!",4,2,3,28 July 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," The dark knight rises as a Power Rangers and falls (screen)
","When i was a kid, there were those Japanese shows with costumed heroes who were fighting very seriously villains in real cities. With this choice of putting Batman in the same vision, i reached the same conclusion: it's unbelievable and funny. This Batman seems totally tiny in a huge Gotham, all the more than he does now his job in plain daylight instead of being a force in darkness. As a batfan, i don't really find my character as well: putting away the hood as his beloved dies is OK but living as an old hermit isn't true to this icon: as Miller felt, the old Bruce is a man who is driven mad by his strong drive to put the hood back. The Batman is bigger than Bruce Wayne: it's an urge, a need that seems totally forgotten here. On the other hand, i haven't read 'Knightfall' or 'No man's land' but those plots were interesting to adapt: The scenes of having the elites assaulted and being put on trial were the more dynamic of the movie but they would have been more impact if this rebellion has a more charismatic leader with a vision (as in 'the cult').Beyond this, the movie doesn't leave the actual trend of blockbusters movies: it's a sequel for followers only because contrary to TV shows, there isn't a few seconds for 'previouly last movies'. The dialogs worth nothing and it's always the far-west in a democracy where it's about fighting opponents with guns and violence. If there's a good cast (Bale, Cain), there's a lot of transparent participation (Hathaway, Cotillard,...).In conclusion, there's nothing Dark in this knight and the movie is totally overrated for its anticipation and Oscar run.",4,4,12,5 August 2012
Any Given Sunday," Just one game for me (DVD)
","I was afraid that this movie would be a disaster: First, sports and movies are clearly opposite because one is pure spontaneity while the other is constant rehearsals. Do you imagine doing again a NBA finals with Jordan, Jackson and the Bulls ? Then, having Pacino as a coach is great but a wonderful waste because the game is played with players, the coach passing the time walking down the line (excuse me Phil!) Last, I just can't stand Jamie Foxx: very arrogant, overconfident.And my fears came true because the story is really short! But..What a director! Stone is amazing and brings us beautiful shots: Ah! The spinning Ave Maria ball! And he has guts: all the sports skeleton are out of the closet: greed, sex, drugs, doping. And above all, he understands the game and offer beautiful thoughts of the spirit of sports: what makes a team, is winning the most precious thing, the gladiator psychology: it's a fight physical as well as mental! And, when you got an 'Al', you got all! As years pass, he is less in action but more in details: a smile, a hand trick, a head down, a strong stare and always the best for speeches! And, finally, when it comes to the last game, I got the same feelings that in real life! Wow! You got me wrong, so you deserve my recommendation! Why in France can't we produce some sports movies like this? All we got is 'Zidane: a XXI portrait', for a boxing shy captain, it's more a video game! And, beware of .. the eye! See it and you'll understand!",4,1,2,10 October 2008
Iron Man," Another secretary saves the Big Boss (Screen)
","It's funny to recall « Iron Man » for this ! But it's true and it's my homage to my mother and my friend, who have the same occupation as Mrs Potts but are sadly taken for little hands while their big hearts are forgotten ! It is all the more important to say this here, that this movie was a kind invitation to my friend's sons.I was a bit anxious about their feelings because the movie is very violent (especially the first 30 minutes) but the armors and sound effects capture all their imagination instead ! They love it ! As a comics fan for 22 years, it is not the first adaptation that I saw but i rank it among the best. Beside the fights, « Iron Man » offers a little philosophy about guns trading, exceptional visual and good suspense. The final armor is long awaited but doesn't deceived ! Between « Robocop II » and « 2001 : a space odyssey » for the inside helmet shots, you got also a top cast with a special mention to an unrecognizable Jeff Bridges ! Ah ! A crossover movie with Spidey, X-Men, FF, IR, Hulk.. ! ! ! ! !",7,1,3,8 May 2008
Blade Runner," One of the best experiences in science fiction and maybe in any movies (dvd)
","Every movie has a Text, a Context, and a Subtext. Blade Runner excels in all.The easy one: the Text. Inspired by a novel of the most humanist of SF author, Philip K. Dick, the story deals with androids banned from Earth, which are tracked by humans . The fantastic idea is that the audience is caught in a constant paradox: you wait the androids to appear like robots. Error, they show the most humanity and it is the humans who act like robots(indeed, a true respect to the core of Dick's Philosophy). The context: Another asset of this movie is the overloading of the senses: majestuous sets, props, wardrobe, cinematography, editing. The director takes the time in every shoot to show how humans have evolved. It is a big change from nowadays movies where in 10 seconds, you see 10 cuts. All this care for the materiality of this fiction world made Dick very enthusiast, even though he didn't see the picture.The subtext: It's the message of the director, or sometimes, what the audience has understood. I always feel deeply moved by this movie, but i can't never explain why. I suppose it acts on a non-literate level. In some way, i'm sure it addresses the collective unconscious that every body share.Nearly 25 years after its release, it is still a date in cinema history. It teaches a lesson to today movies, which, even with the help of digital effects, haven't still produce another milestone (my regard for the prequel Star Wars Movies). And when you think that Scott's previous movie was 'Alien', you got a good idea of his eternal legacy to the genre",10,0,1,24 April 2005
Bruce Almighty," For one time, Devil is missed (TV)
","This movie is about an unlucky loser (Jim Carrey) who blames God for his fate. As a try-out, God gives him his almighty powers for a while. This new god turns his love, his life, his town totally upside down to finally understand what he has to doI admit: this was the movie teaser that motivates me to see the movie. But I was a bit afraid that the good jokes of the teaser could have been 'the best of'. But, surprisingly, the period while Bruce is almighty is the less interesting part of the movie: the jokes are fun but his ambition & egocentrism bite the nail of the enjoyment. In other words, the script lacks here some deep sense. On the opposite, the beginning of his unsuccessful life & his final revelation are more balanced: the jokes are hilarious & I care for his fighting spirit! It was all the more enjoyable than i got the feeling of 'déjà-vu': Believe it or not, last year, on 1st June, St Justin day (!), after a f#ck! day (shootings from my boss, a dear friend hangs up at phone), I came back to my accommodation, saying the same lines of that movie: 'what do you want God ?' 'when did I act so badly to feel such pain!!!' Then, opening my letterbox, I find a printed ad: 'You want help! Ready to help!'. Again like the movie. I didn't phoned the office, just keep the letter as a fetish luck.Lately, my fate get worst but, with the help of a great collaborator, I had a revelation & make sense: bad luck, worries aren't the work of God but the work of the devil. If you believe in God, you can't ignore the devil. So my opinion is the more you stay sincere, honest, honorable, helpful, the more you signal to the bad one. You become then a first in his list of harassment. Life is thus balanced: what God gives you, Devil tries to take it back.The sign that this is a good path for thinking is that my belief (Zen) translates this also: Life changes: Be ready for that!!! So, in spite of all the good fun, this comedy is unable to propose an active thinking. Its almigthy flaw is the side of bad things When Bruce becomes crazy or when people riots, if god is sad, the other one should have a good laugh, because all the pure things (love, compassion) have left Maybe this more profound vision in the sequel.. In all cases, Jim Carrey is an enthusiastic actor. His energy is a great help to clearly understand how the character feel: When he is confused, he is madly furious; when he miss his girlfriend, he really seems pitifulMy conclusion would be from Pope Benoit XVI, who answers the question: 'Has God the sense of fun?' with: 'Absolutely, but he is very subtle, the signs hard to appear, but when the pieces come together, it is a way to return for more humility!!!'",4,1,3,13 March 2007
Monsters University," Maybe too much didactic (tv)
","At least, it's not the dumb, silly violence of « cars 2 » which i have watched horrified with young nephews as it was about cars firing bullets ! This one is more peaceful, with cool characters and some really funny moments but it wasn't the extraordinary familial movie i expected ! First, like « harry potter and the goblet of fire », movies about contest are quickly boring because you have task 1, then task 2, then task 3,. It's very linear and not fit to twists Next, the movie is too much about an elitist education open to « fit » students : if you are not in the mold, you get out ! The problem is to define the mold and the movie is really depressive for that : are the bad students bad because of them or their teachers ! For sure, i didn't appreciate that this team of losers is too much caricatured (the old, the obese, the dingo) and that finally when you are cut from university, you become mop pushers ! So it's indeed a meritocracy and surely not a world when people are considered for what they are, able or not able ! In that context, Mike and Sulley and their fraternity speaks with other words but it's told so loudly, so many times that it lacks magic and fun ! Sure the animation is really well done, this monster universe is also original and wakes up the child inside us but at the end, the mix of friendship, university, tolerance, exams, self-confidence, norms, fun and competition wasn't really enjoyable for the adult I am now !",4,1,3,21 May 2016
Toy Story 3," Escape from Camp Deadly (3 days Screen Marathon)
","I thought i would have fun but this movie is a bit depressive: toys from our childhood discarded, torture camp for them, burning hell! It's very intense for a cartoon and it frightened indeed my five years old nephews. Thus, the people behind it failed their job.As an adult, i don't agree with the starting point: when we grow up, we don't throw away our toys. Personally, those toys have built my identity and if they are actually locked, they are saved for my future children.OK, you will say that this movie is not the point of view of the child but of its toys. But showing that they are discarded is actually a very sad, unhappy way to consider life. That's not the lesson i want to teach my children.Life is a great joy foremost and the opening sequence of the movie is the only good moment I remember: Life is imagination and imagination is all and is best used with happy thoughts!",4,8,19,29 October 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Scratch has become Nuts (Screen)
","The previous sequel seems far away now and I still remember more what happened on this day than the movie itself. Was number 2 a failure? I don't think so but number 3 was much awaited.I saw it in 3D but it doesn't add amazing changes as it is a cartoon with repetitive landscapes (ice or jungle). Furthermore, eye (or brain) adapts very quickly to this vision.It was great to rejoice with this funny trio, which keeps becoming bigger after each movie. In regard to the new delivery, I can't really like Buck, the jungle guide. The story is more oriented this time and fast paced. The gags are funny and even hilarious, especially the Scratch ones! They are really at their best when it comes to glide or fall down! But I fear the extinction is near because the scope is very limited: a 'family' like this is very difficult to write, all the more in prehistoric times! Maybe we will got a 'Jurassic Ice Age Park' with the characters cloned for our third millennium?",7,0,1,17 August 2009
Signs," An anti-Job for Mel (tv)
","So, if I'm right, the illness of his son, the alien invasion, all this was orchestrated to make Mel a believer again after the death of his wife! It's indeed the opposite of the biblical Job who never lost his faith facing some personal disaster. Maybe that's the reason (the sign) why the alien would choose their farm to come because it's so stupid to think otherwise! Sincerely, this is however greatly far-fetched and this movie can't reach the value of the 'X-files' or 'War of the worlds', albeit mixing faith and alien is indeed the right question to ask: if a God create us, what about the aliens so: did he create them also? In that perspective, the offers doesn't bring elements and its only good conclusion is to say that the believer never feels alone! Next, the alien invasion has never been so mistreated in a movie: maybe the beginning with the crop circle is good but the later capture of one alien in a attic is stupid and when we saw them, they look just bad. In addition, the directing is awful as Shamalayan just refuses to do it: he just put down the camera and the movie is about characters watching it. So, it's very static and quickly, it gives headaches.So for the one who was labeled as the next Spielberg, it was a bit too early and this movie and following prove that he hasn't the stuff.",4,3,5,18 January 2014
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody in (s)pain (web)
","Another crap for the so-called master: I really wonder why he has such good praises with having so little values and craft. Maybe his secret is his casting of such big names, attractive actress so they get him untouchable (as it will need a lot of courage to acknowledge that those big names doesn't equal talent!).But first, Allen is really a limited, poor technician: in spite he's filming on locations, in Spain, in summer, he feels obliged to use a awful orange cinematography that really destroy all the colors, all the charm of reality! Next, his use of voice-over is the proof that he can't tell his story or put it visually. If we have to hear this voice to know what happens, to understand the feeling of his characters, it means that his screenplay isn't ready or his directing is lacking.In addition, Allen lives in such a closed, elitist world i that I really wonder what he can tell me about life and love. In other world, his stories lack cruelly of humanity: his characters are always the same stereotypes: rich, privileged families that really don't know what's working (they are artists!) or what's love: they hunger for lust, they confound sex and passion, they are valueless, instead of resolving their problems and respecting commitments, they talk to shrinks and start affairs. They call themselves successful, libertine, free spirit and i call them exploiters, perverts, lecherous. Maybe they crave for art, but it's rather an excuse for drink and sex. In a way, this is the same stupid handle in relationships that Americans know when they want to talk about queer: one day, the straight character wakes up and goes with its gender. Here, it's the soon to be married character who wants another love! So, salvaged locations, empty story and characters: i was just left with what i started writing: big names: i have nothing to say about the pale, lascivious Johansson. Hall seems a bit brighter and benefits the halo effect (she looks like the french TV host that helps me wake up on the morning with her show about babies). Penelope and Javier were interesting as they were playing a couple thus sharing a bit what they can really share.",4,0,5,28 October 2013

One of the best beginning i can remember! Then, when the identity of the secret murderer is revealed, the movie doesn't fall down but gains in depth and resonance.And the surprises aren't over: there's a fundamental difference between the theatrical release and the extended version! I get caught because i couldn't understand why i couldn't find some important frames in the first one! Finally, you get a look of what's going on inside a insane mind ... A sort of 'Lost Highway' without the poetry!",7,3,6,23 March 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Only because it was a prize ticket (Screen)
","I am not a big fan of Willis: Thus, I don't have a motivation to watch a movie by his only name. I did an exception this time because the ticket was a friend's invitation but my opinion remains the same after leaving the theater.If it offers a good start with an interesting thriller, reminiscent of 'Enemies of the State', flaws soon multiply like bullets in the screen.The last part of the movie is the worst because it becomes a personal vendetta ('my girl!') with shocking scenes: McLane kills tugs like flies while the big bad guy is only words and takes useless hostages! It is actually a human 'Terminator', totally boring, because totally unbelievable and it needs more than the private joke about it to make me appreciate this.But, I know it is the concept: he is hard-boiled. But I prefer hard-boiled characters wearing Spandex with claws, spider, or a big 'S', it is more real !!!! (in a way).",1,2,7,15 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," X2 / 3 (tv)

Sure, there are a lot of good things : Wolverine, Prof X, Magneto, Nightcrawler, the attack of the mansion, the escape of Magneto, the game to find other mutants (the new mutants, Colossus, the beast), the mixing of iconic Xmen comics story (the sacrifice of Jean, Count Nefaria). But there were also a lot of garbage : iceman, storm, phoenix effect, Pyro, cyclops If the production is splendid and the effects rather well done, the movie never really takes off. Maybe it's the editing, maybe Stryker is a poor choice of villain, maybe it's much too dark or the fact that their mutants powers are rather invisible but at the end, it was not really enjoyable.",4,1,2,14 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," *** 900th review *** Why i don't want to watch it !
","Each 100 reviews, i try to find a original way of writing them and explaining a no watch makes sense : how often have i feared that the movie was bad and how often i had the sad confirmation of my feeling afterward! So, here come my reasons:1) I was six when i discovered SW with episode V. It was the 80s and I played with the toys. In the 90s, i played the role playing game and read the Zahn's novels. In the 00s, i watched the uneven prequels. So now, leave me alone SW ! I'm stuffed with you, i can't get it anymore ! I get old now and there are so much other wonderful things to discover !2) The sequels have been already done ! the afore mentioned Zahn's novel are amazing and have told what needed to be told : a dying empire, the fate of our heroes, the future of the force, So watching something else can only be a disappointment for me.3) The facts that i can collect about the story are just amazingly stupid : Episode VI : the emperor dies, the second death star explodes, the empire is defeated First words of Episode VII : « the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE ». Uh ? Did i miss Episode 6,5 ? The rebellion won and so becomes resistance ! Nothing have changed so !! dumb, dumb, dumb . and there is more : a map to trace Luke ? it's « treasure island » and sure the first time in history that a map is used to locate a moving individual instead of a still treasure!! Then, the map is put in a droid that escapes and is found by a young adult living a hard life in a desert planet.. now, it's a reboot from Episode IV ! And what about the new villain: it's 'the fly' in space ??? Maybe it's good later but after such a bad start, i just don't want to deepen my exploration!4) Why the hype considering the lack of values, philosophy ? When i see the trailer, i just see battles, violence, fights, This was really disturbing me with the prequels that this Jedi Order was just like a swat team, using the force to kill, destroy the bad guys! We are very far away of a real spirituality, a modern myth! This content is so poor, so Manichean, so like all other movies that it's not worth watching it !For sure, i'm a bit sad to miss my old friends on a big screen and the cute newcomer Daisy but i'm not a sheep either ! So my force awakens and i lead a brave resistance. I hope others will join me !",1,39,50,11 January 2016
Cinderella," For a Toons fan, it's OK (web)
","Let's be clear: a lot of Disney movies are rather oriented for girls: royal romance, love songs, dance and dresses, we boys are not really into that, whatever the feminist and gender extremists would like! If you add the crazy king father, the ugly bad characters (why this link?), the sadistic cat and helpful dog (why this discrimination), the abusive stepmother and stupid henchman, you find finally a universe in which I don't feel happy, in which family love is nonexistent and that's a bit hard!At last, we have those chipmunks-like mice that bring fun and lightness! For me, they are essential to this movie because without them, it would have been simply unwatchable. It's not the speedy, delirious, crazy and funny Sylvester & Tweety but some moments makes me laugh! The other thing i notice is that for that date, this animation was showing the future of the live movies: Colored, powerful visuals and horizon lines, stunning effects, only those things was first delivered then by Disney and it would take 10 years before the gap would be shorten by true movies!If Snow White can appeal to every one, this Cinderella is above all a dream for girls and a honest time for boys!",7,0,0,26 February 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Happy Birthday Harry & Goodbye (screen)
","It's 31 July so it's time to say it, above all it's will be the last opportunity: From now, that's it: no more movies to wait for. For this last movie, I could copy and paste my review from the previous movie: no introduction for beginners, the movie sticks to the book and it's beautifully designed with an amazing cast that we liked to see get mature.However, the final isn't really moving: my best feeling was to watch Hogwart on a big screen and on 3D. Having played the games and thus run for hours in Hogwart, it was like visiting my old school again. In addition, there are also big flaws as well: first of all, the score is a pity: Going from John Williams to Desplat makes a lot of magic disappear. The score pushes no moments and all the drama falls simply flat. Thus, either it's Yates who is a poor director, either it's the screenplay itself that is badly written. I don't know. But here are my arguments: <ul><li>When Harry leaves for the old forest, he has no words for Ron... </li></ul><ul><li>When he meets there his parents, there is no effusion or great lines ... </li></ul><ul><li>After the victory, he is like a ghost because no one pays attention to him... </li></ul><ul><li>When he breaks the stick, he should have throw both sides of the bridge instead of using only one. </li></ul>And I think Voldemort was killed by himself with his spell bouncing back at him (as in his parent's killings) but watching the movie, it isn't clear. Well, my point is to say that a scene can shot on a lot of ways but with Yates, it's always the one with less emphasis that is chosen.Now, at last, i will wait the special collector DVD set to watch the entire story because I have only seen 5 movies so far (stone, chamber, goblet, and the two hallows). And maybe, in 19 years, they will shot again the ending with this same cast: HP was as much important for them than for us thus it will be an happy reunion...(But Emma had a good point: for them, before this fantastic childhood, they were like their children and in a way, this last scene was like a circle completed!)For now, if you are in need of more Potter, i recommend you the excellent HP Wizardry, a brilliantly lavished book about all those adaptations ! 'All is fine'....",7,2,2,31 July 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," My return to the King (DVD)
","Actually, it's my second viewing of this movie. I saw in Spain at its release for Christmas 2003. But i went out before the end because i caught the flu in the plane and above all, having not seen the second one at this time, i felt totally lost then. For me, I had left the fellowship at the Moria gates and now, every one was split in unknown territories. As for the 'Two Towers', Tolkien is only responsible of this alienation because he just wrote a huge single story. Now, with this final act, if you are brave enough to support two hours of babbling, the final hour is rather climatic and exiting because the problems are answered at last! In conclusion of this movies marathon, i wasn't a die-hard LOTR fan before and failed to become one after. But the cast and production shared a sincere and contagious passion! Thus, it must be an happy reward for them to see that this is the only big franchise selling continuously more and more tickets!",7,0,2,10 January 2011
Munich," sabbath bloody sabbath (cinematheque)
","Like the famous U2's song, in this movie 'There's many lost, but tell me who has won? The trenches dug between our hearts. How long, how long must we sing this song ?' Indeed, since my birth, i hear always two things: we face a crisis definitely worse than 1929 and Israelis and Palestinian are fighting. So, that's 40 years at least without peace. One reason that is explained in this movie is that both sides are stuck in their revenge attitude: thus killing make things worse because it exacerbates violence instead of stopping it. This message is all the more powerful here because it's official, state approved assassinations that are executed. Sure, as the title is 'Munich', we expect to see Spielberg's vision of the tragedy. So, I was surprised that Spielberg doesn't show it at first. We see bits all along the movie and we must await the end to see it completely. If the wait has push up the drama, those last moments are mixed with a love scene (maybe as a parallel for life/death) but the sex is too nightmarish.Beyond politics and history, the story is also a existentialistic one when the puppet killers realize that family is as sacred as nation. With such thematic, I think Spielberg has reunited a excellent international team for the cast. If I can't really enjoy the movie because it's about men dedicated to kill (and maybe a bit too long and repetitive), it made me at last ponder loudly. Hopefully, it closes on an appropriate last shoot because as it happens also in NYC, i was also thinking that in regard to the subject, it would be unforgivable if the Twin Towers doesn't appear! Thanks to Spielberg, they are there, looming and dominating as a future warning!Pairing: 'Minority Report': citizens shouldn't trust blindly authority",7,0,2,28 March 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," 1428, Elm Street : i thought it was rather 1963 ??? (Cinematheque)
","Just kidding but Elm Street is the iconic place for JFK assassination and maybe its name stayed in the memory of Wes Craven To tell more certain things, i wanted to do this new retrospective about Freddy's movies because they were great moments in my teens and the opportunity to see them on a big screen can't be missed! I don't remind exactly how i discovered them (maybe on VHS tapes or as multiple viewings on the french pay per view channel Canal +) and it's even more blurry to recall exactly the ones i saw then on TV. One thing is for sure is that i got interested in them with the extraordinary Scifi, horror fantasy french magazine « Mad movies » : i bought it from n° 69 (july 1989) to 83 (may 1993) so i have read detailed reports with lavished pictures about Freddy & Star Trek V, VI, Indy III, Batman I, II, Abyss, T2, Total Recall, Robocop II, III, TMNT, Twin peaks, Stephen King, Dracula With all this, it's funny i can't say if i have ever watched this 1st one : i remember some scenes (in the bath, the long arms, the flames) but on the other hand, a lot of characters are black holes, even young Johnny Deep ! This franchise as put by Craven is interesting as it's a sort of crossover between « Halloween », scary teens slasher and « Poltergeist » scary homes twisted by evil forces ! I expected to see also a sort of horrific « BTTF » for living in a small town in the 80s but unlike it, « NOEM » action focused heavily on the houses, bedrooms, cellars and high school so it's difficult to tell about the town of Springwood itself but it's easy to see the nostalgia of those 80s in fashion, objects, cars I can't tell if the story is sometimes lacking but this battle between reality and dreams is really confusing. It's hard to tell what really happens (especially the last scene ??) but in the same time, Craven is really talented to set a stressful pace So this screening was really great for me and i'm thirsty to follow the sequels !!!NB: and i'm happy to be the 66-7th review and not the dreadful 666th!!!",10,2,3,18 July 2016
Heat," Not a hit (dvd)
","For the moment, the simultaneous pairing of Al & Bob isn't unforgettable. As in 'Law and Order', the movie is boring. If the duo copes well, the fault is on the story and the directing. About the story, this cop/gangster is stupid because the cops find the crew easily when they are planning while they fail when the crew attacks. Worse, all the characters manage easily their jobs while they got problems with their relationships! About the directing, the scenes are slow and there are a lot of useless moments. If Mann forgot to go in editing room, i haven't forgotten my fast forward button on my remote. There are a few good moments (Natalie's scenes, Bob's trap, the last chase) but it's not enough and not worthy of 160 minutes! To close the case, the hair style is particularly hideous from Kilmer, to Bob, to Voight (who stays definitely in the bottom of supporting actors!).",4,6,14,13 February 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Episode IV : a new jihadist (screen) (vhs) (dad)
","It was long, long ago that I haven't watched the classic trilogy while it was indeed key movies in my childhood and teens. What i learn from them, it's that End doesn't mean it's over as the stories keep on coming in a new way. Here my dad DVDs are the Special edition while my VHS are the simple blue box set. The new SFX are less extraordinary than the cleaning of the picture with bright and sharp colors and the Lucas commentary. As the excellent book Secret History of SW tells you, we can catch Lucas telling lies : here it's like he told us that in 1977, everything was fixed and planned while in fact it was making V that he discovered that Vader = Anakin and making VI that Luke + Leia = twins ! Visually and emotionally, it's true still today that the movie is a benchmark in filmmaking and SciFi. Even if the budget was small, the production team had the highest inspiration and talent (respect for Ralph MacQuarrie !). Harrison, Mark and Carrie are really exceptional in their basic parts and make easily forget how the plot is easy (and a bit boring from the moment Falcon leaves the dark star !). As true classics, the movie offers as well endless lectures, interpretation and the one told in my title is not from me but comes from fans in an article from Decider : in a way, nobody can push away the idea that Luke fate has parallels with radicalization : in this episode, we have the lone young man, without family of friends, recruited by old wise, explaining world by a religion (the Force) and ending up doing a cheap suicide mission against fully armed government (dark star attack) while praying (may the force be with you)Â… So it's interesting to see how can everything can be twisted and i really like the irony that the citizens of the biggest country that hunts rebels all over the world happen to praise movies in which the rebels win !",10,0,0,26 August 2017
300," Victory ! (DVD)
","This story was introduced to me by Frank Miller's graphic novel. This creator has a real talent for telling stories about virtuous heroes and in addition is blessed with amazing style that is incredibly enhanced by his wife colorist, Lynn Varley. I remember I collected the comics in Strasbourg (1999) and was absolutely speechless with the art and colors: it really looks like Hellenic art with brown, yellow tones.Now, comes the movie and I was sure it kicks ass as well because the director had delivered a perfect adaptation with 'Watchmen'. This guy really understand what is an adaptation: this isn't about retelling a story, nor adding personal comments about it. As he said in the making-of, there's no place for filter and Miller has been every day on the set because they kept opening and browsing the comics to analyze every frame of it.Fom the opening credits, it's a pleasure to see that Miller's work has been moved 100% on the screen: the colors, the pencils, the wardrobe, everything thing you saw on a panel is alive! Amazing! The cast was unknown so far for me but they are great: Leana Headey is impressive: her formidable charisma helps a strong willed queen and comforting wife. Gerald Butler is terrific as he reminds me of Pacino! Now, we can talk about the story: I remember that there was a huge debate with some readers complaining about Miller's depicting Athenians as boy lovers. This sentence has been kept in the movie and don't make such a fuss. On the opposite, the movie is now seen as a clash of civilization: the west, holder of liberty against the east, decadent and pervert. Well, I got Greek friends who didn't find accurate the Xerces army portrayal. Personally, this story is about courage and bravery and the price to keep liberty, whatever or whoever the threat comes from. In addition, it's great to see that women has naturally a role to play whereas sometimes they are totally forgotten (see 'The winds that shakes the barleys' or 'Angels and Demons').",10,5,7,2 May 2010
Honey," I can bear this Honey (DVD)
","I don't like Hip-Hop, Dance and Choreography! But, nevertheless, I found this movie interesting: Jessica Alba delivers a very sincere interpretation, in which she can express a lot of different feelings.The cast is cool, especially the teens and the close friend of Jessica. For me, Joy Bryant is a new face and I think she steals the show! The story is more about dreams, friendship and dedication than about music, dances! If the bonuses are really boring (the videos, the making-of for videos, an endless deleted scenes), the commentary of Jessica with her then boyfriend-director is fun to listen! Finally, a rather good surprise!",4,0,2,27 February 2009
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Moments (DVD)
","Before this one, I saw maybe this movie 10 times but always the space & Brooklyn bridge sequences. Indeed, the youngest son of my friend loved those scenes and kept play-back them while our Moroccan vacations. With the 'Mr. Bean' show, 'Robin Hood', it was the movie I put in my luggage. Now, things seem to have changed and those are sweet memories.In addition, this is a adaptation of a Marvel comics (my longest hobby) and their more familial title, so I get very emotional.The bonuses are stretched and hot as well, except the music videos, which are definitely Not the marvel way (tattoes guys!). It's a pity that the Fantastic can be marketed like this! The commentary of the cast is really entertaining and shows that they have built a sort of family as well! As a Marvel fan, I still wonder why the writers can't 'xerox' the comics. They always are keen to change the stories, and I am a bit disappointed by the Twin Peaks co-creator, Mark Frost, for his treatment of Dr Doom! A kind of robot, with electrical powers we are very far away for the Lavterian monarch, expert in science and magic!But, the spirit of the FF are here and the cast is perfect! For me, it stands up with the Spidey movies and the first X-Men! If it's the last at the box-office, I suppose the fans were also baffled and don't push it very much! The same things happen with the sequel from a personal & audience point of views!",10,2,3,8 March 2009
Annihilation," Another rising star annihilated (web)
","After the clothes hanger acting talent of Monica Bellucci, now, with those last reviews, i settle the accounts with bourgeois Natalie Portman!In the beginning, Natalie was fresh, kind, strong, tender and had inspired choices to do powerful movies (Anywhere, Heart, V, Goya, ...).But since her oscar, her wedding to a Frenchman, she has fallen into (and not access) the big celebrity Ghota and her career becomes worthless: only Bo-Bo movies (Planetarium, the 2 Malick), hollow ass licking soup about elites (Jackie, Dior ads), harmless pseudo rebellion (Vox, Eating animals), brainless Ubermensche brawls (Thor)...Unlike true activist colleagues (Leonor Varela for example), Natalie has become the parrot of good liberal conscience without much thinking about it! Not a single word about social inequalities and for sure Dior & Jackie can't help her! Vegan crusade: it's bad to eat animals? a chance she doesn't live in Prehistoric time! and how do you nourish an overpopulated earth?But with this movie (at last i come to it), she twists the neck of 2 more fights: guns & timeisup masquerade!Very concerned about guns control in public, she previously did a gun-slinging movie called JANE GOT A GUN! HE, Natalie, be smart & think! either the guns are bad or they are good but you can't do hypocritically a movie like this (with a gun, i kill my problem) and says the contrary after! Here, in this poor sci-fi, it's the same thing in worse: again with a gun on the poster and again a gun to solve the problem!Next, this all women cast is stinking; especially in the military world! Again, in a more wise past, women didn't do military not for discrimination but just because WAR IS UGLY! What do you prove killing other human beings! Bravery, Liberty ??? well, look Weir's Witness and then meditate! And what about this imposed feminine cast? Nobody believes it and this fake belief just bores every one! Humanity is not brave women + stupid men! And for sure, women are discriminated in US, Hollywood? Again an assumption that means nothing: Jews were discriminated by nazis, Blacks were discriminated in Apartheid! Even your own country discriminated blacks with segregation! Your Goya movie was about Christian inquisition which in the name of a loving god, murder innocents! That's discrimination, that's pain, that's suffering! What do you wait to do movies about this ???
So, Natalie, be awake! Get up and stop whining about your billionaires problem and doing stinker after stinker! But sadly, i think the time is up for you too!",1,1,6,29 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," for me it was Episode I (screen) (vhs) (dad)
","Back to summer 80, this was the 2nd movie our parents took us to watch on a big screen and the next day, i got fever because i had been so impressed by this scary bad robot guy ! But things get better soon because i became a avid player of Kenner SW toys and keep making stories with them up to 1987 In a way, this movie (like the 2 others) has imprint my imagination like no others : it was like i got new cells in my brain or 2 more eyes while this universe was as deep inside me as in a galaxy far away And remember, in the 80s, we didn't have the tapes, books, articles and digital things to go on : so the audience was really left alone with its memories ! Maybe it's because this movie has mythological stuff, or a Zen director (Kershner) or a incredible cast (Harrison, Mark & Carrie were the Harry, Ron and Hermione of our time) but at the end, it's a amazing space Odyssey from ice planet, to asteroids, to a swamp forest and a luminous city in the air ! Even today no movie can offer such exotic Scifi and that's why i got always a special vibration watching it, and in addition today, it's the special edition !Like Episode IV, the picture is superb with sharp colors ! The new Wampa left me cold while Cloud city is really beautiful : like my previous reviews, we can catch Lucas in deep lying as he sounds like he had all the details right from the start while he found them all along the way ! Also done last time, the radical hero (Luke) goes on with his brainwashing : On Dagobah, he enrolls in a school to forget all the things he learns so far and accepts the only truth ! For sure, his own feelings are forbidden and he must obey the master ! This Decider article is really twisted but it would be great to hear Lucas comment on this lecture because it seems that SW fans support indeed a sort of fundamentalism against official law...",10,0,0,27 August 2017
Aladdin," In Memoriam Howard Asham (1950-1991) (DVD)
","As my most precious person is Arabian & looks like a twin of Princess Jasmine, I can only rate '10' this Disney. It's totally moving for me to see the one I care in a cartoon: Her appearance, hers colors, her free spirit are there, mixed altogether with splendid flavors from her roots; It is not often those days to see Middle-east as a fairy taleSo, my heart gives '10', but reason would be more harsh because this movie stenches Hollywood business:First, you got again, and again the never-ending Disney plot formula: little sidekick animals & the musical: Hey! Look at those ones: a screaming monkey & lousy parrot! And speaking of music, the songs sound more jazzy American than Arabic melodies.Then, you got big Mr. K who decides than a 'Tom Cruise' clone is better than a nobody Aladdin: But for what? Dollars or teaching kids wisdom, bravery, etc Then, the Genie of this movie (pun intended!) is treated like garbage.But it is not the worst:I want now to put shame on Disney executives (again Mr K. ?) for their short memories: Their loyal & awards winning musician, Howard Asham, writes to death his final songs with this movie and there's no remembrances for him in the credits. AIDS is such a shameful disease? Well, shame on you, Disney: Hopefully, it was a great emotion to see his friends nearly crying about him, so my title says it all",10,2,3,22 July 2007
A Walk to Remember," A Movie to remember! When simplicity is all! (dvd)
","This movie is so good, that it made me live its exact story while watching it.Indeed, it talks about how a bad feeling can turn into something beautiful & unforgettable by the power of love.So, when I picked the DVD, I thought 'Another boring teen movie!'. But, when I put it on my player, the title song (Cry) struck me. It is all I asked for music: easy listening & moving, so I can't put it outside my head. Then, I watched the bonuses (I know: every people tells I should invert my habit). I found Mandy Moore to be a lively actress, as well as Shane West (a good Anakin he may have been). Then, I watched it. And frankly, it didn't caught me until it answered two of my questions:1.Will the gift of his pink shirt be used in the continuity of the storyline? 2. How this storyline could evolve as it kept going stronger & happier? The answers I received was so respectful & surprising, that I was won over. At this moment, I liked this movie and couldn't put it down until I watched its end!Now, with a little time, its simplicity gave me a feeling of my 'Must Do Dreams'. Those families live in a community, they lead simple life, express simple feelings, which are for me all definitions of Happiness.In conclusion, one of the few 'adaptation' which gave me the desire to read the original book!",7,0,0,14 March 2005
Sin City," Best comics adaptation so far BUT not for kids (screen)
","This is the proof that the author's intention (Frank Miller) has been respected.The diverse comics of Sin City are for mature readers and the movie is the same. Whatever the reason of Miller for very hardcore violence (fighting for freedom of expression ? and the difficulties tied with this-an unconscious appeal for sadism ?), the Hollywood interest has not turned down the subject. Worse, the violence going from pencils to live action with real people, what was left to the imagination of the reader is now totally watched: So, even if i knew what would happen, i felt a bit shocked to see what was the reality of the drawings...But, Sin City is a lot more than violence. The 'heroes' believe in honor, strong code of value (and cynicism...), so you can't be disgusted. This morality surely explains why so-much Hollywood stars (Alba, Willis...) gave their will to do it. Mickey Rourke does an amazing performance. His mimetism with the comic character is evident. In conclusion, every feeling of the comic book is truly present in the movie: the play with the black & white, the rare touch of colors (blue eyes baby, yellow bastard, babe wearing red), the dark atmosphere of the city,....If i gave a very positive review of 'Spiderman', I must admit that Sin city surpasses it, watching a wall-crawler can be entertaining, but watching a torrent of violence is educational ......A movie with depth & forms deserves an award: ah Cannes, Maybe Oscar...",10,3,4,12 July 2005
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Too much for the eyes, too less for the brain (screen)
","Those are the two great defects of this movie and they don't leave anything else to praise: For my eyes, i maintain my objection from the previous two movies, that is to say the robots aren't not well designed because they are too much designed. Next, the filming doesn't match up because the abuse of close-up, cuts make the action unintelligible. There are precedents with big characters and Spielberg ('Jurassic Park') or Jackson ('King Kong') have more talent than Bay for the big size! For my brain, after now two sequels, i still can't name the robots except the truck, the yellow car and the bad leader. How can the writers skip those basics? Here, like the two previous movie, it's about getting a lost artifact that would end the war forever. That's recycling. To be more precise, it would be hard because as usual, i lost the trail of the story. Worst, if the previous movies could be balanced between action and comedy, here the story of Shia is terminated in half hour.The climax of the movie (attack in Chicago) is better handled than the terrible gunfight of the last movie in Pyramids but it feels bitter: The scene of the building collapse is really riveting but as everyone kills everyone it's hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys.",4,3,8,15 July 2011
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Another Cup Winner (DVD)
","The spiritual or archaeological concept for this third Indy movie is too close of the first one and thus lacks the originality of the second. It's again Bible, Desert and Nazis! To not discriminate, after Judaism and Christianity, the fifth movie should deal about Islam! It would be a perilous journey but an interesting one (read 'Last Patriot' from Brad Thor for a try!).Fortunately, Spielberg saves the movie first by incorporating a father-son relationship and second by choosing Sean Connery to play the father!. On top of this, you have a delicious femme fatal, a really lunatic Marcus Brody and a colossal soundtrack from John Williams! If my memories are accurate, it was this summer of 1989 that rooted my passion (=autonomy) for movies and soundtracks with such parallel releases of Batman, Abyss, ST5, Ghosbusters2, BTF2! It was tied with my passion with comics too and i remember to read the black and white adaptation of this Indy with the K7 of the score! Thus, Internet and DVD aren't the ultimate entertainment and it's the proof that imagination is the most vital ingredient! If i don't write it now and here, i will never write it anywhere else: i have always found that my father looks like and behaves like Sean Connery. I'm sure he would be like the comparison but i doubt that someday I will tell it or that he will read this review. On my side, i'am not a Junior as well, despite like Indy, I get into troubles to stand for what seems right and to communicate with my father! And as a son, this particular movie speaks a lot to me.",10,1,2,21 February 2011
Back to the Future," Great Scott ! That's a heavy trilogy (dvd) (vhs)
","This is the 3rd time I watch a franchise in 1 single day after LOTR and Spiderman. I started BTTF at 16'o clock and finish around 23 and it's the only trilogy that I get stuck from the beginning up to the end. In comparison to the next ones, this first movie is indeed a pure comedy and its appeal comes from the playground being the two decades most iconic in America: the 50s and the 80s. For whatever reason too long too explain, this theme is repeated over and over into American entertainment: read 'IT' by Stephen King or watch 'Twin Peaks' by David Lynch for examplesThe next great thing is the exceptional reunion of talent. Silvestri found a simple, fun main title that is easily recalled and played even today. The cast is wonderful: sure, Marty, Doc are big names but Georges, Biff and Lorraine should have a mention too. As for a fox, don't think to Michael J but rather to Lea as she is the best ticket ever to a night prom.The famous Bobs (Gale & Zemeckis) are totally complementary as they know first how to find ideas and then to realize them. The thing that was clear during this first movie is that it had a plot and that the audience was followed it without pause. In today movies, the story is often too obscure and the storytelling can be tedious with nothing else to offer except than big visual effects! A last note to say that I have never seen this one in a theater. In 1985, it was our parents that made the list. My first time on TV, I have to leave for an appointment before the end and when I asked my brother to tell me, I was really perplexed by his details (Marty rejoices his family turned wealthy and then goes to the future with Doc to save their children!). It was a bit hard to really figure what happened, the same way my mother would be after seeing part 2 !",10,2,2,31 July 2013
Goodfellas," Outstanding screenplay (or novel) but flat directing (rental)
","When i read the book, i was illuminated by the way it sticks to the golden rule of great stories: unusual character in a unusual place - -- so at the core it's about a teen telling that becoming a criminal is the best occupation in the world at a time when those Goodfellas owned indeed the city... It was an extraordinary inside view of the underworld during the years that follows what was depicted in the Godfather... About the movie, it's a good thing that the author worked on the screenplay and it's true that the narrator comments are nearly what was written... However i found that Scorcese fails to bring a visual punch in his scenes... sometimes it looks like an illustrated tale, other times, the key moments are plain because key facts have been omitted (essentially that they were always on the run to invent new scheme, that they were powerful because they corrupt a lot and that JFK was their store..) and honestly, he fails to properly build a tension! The cast is good and those background team found there the part of their career but in no way, RDN can pass for a Irish man... So the movie exists only by its original screenplay and its talented cast but if you look for a real punch, prefer the book instead!",7,0,3,30 April 2017
Jurassic Park," Worthy of the 65 millions years of production (DVD)
","This is the great joke of Spielberg seeing the famous stick of Hammond and its mosquito trapped in the sap! Beyond the special effects, this movie remains for me a essential milestone: it speaks about the power of nature, the childish ingenuity of man, human relationships. I forget that it is also funny with the boy character and lines. John William's score is another masterpiece from him because it rejoices ancestral, primitive melody with powerful and peaceful theme.There are also a lot of remarkable ideas: dealing with dinosaurs today is fascinating but mixing them with the theme park and locating all this on a remote island is a great chain of genius. And the best thing is the parallelism between the technology resurrecting extinct animals and the same technology making extinct the traditional craft of special effects. In this field, there is a before and after JP and the first attack of the T-Rex will be on pantheon of filmmaking! However, the extras of the DVD offer a glimpse of puppets velociraptors (made by Tipett) and they are surprisingly cool as well.Having finishing reading the book, I can say that novel and movie are very close: it's like the same story told by two witnesses even if there are some changes. Having the author writing the script seems to be the golden rule of a decent adaptation. But you can understand also the strength of each medium: 'T-Rex roars and attacks the jeep' is better seen than read. On the opposite, all the remarkable speeches of Malcom about chaos and science are better read than heard!",10,3,4,19 May 2011
Beetlejuice," Beetlemania (cinematheque)
","This is a perfect movie because it combines everything: First, the idea of Death as a public administration is original and inventive and it's just delicious to have laughs in such dramatic times. The thematic of the haunted house is also well played because the movie brings a fresh air to this classic tale.Then, the production is visually stunning: it's colorful, playful, weird, modern and once again, we never expected such things with the thematic. As always, Danny's score really complements Tim's filming and is among his best. A mention about the two songs of Belafonte: once again, totally unexpected, totally crazy thus excellent picks for the movie.The cast is really good: for one time, Baldwin appears like a kind guy, O'Hara and Jones are sympathetic parents and Winona makes a groundbreaking debut. Keaton shows he can be a truly funny guy: compared to his brooding batman, Beetlejuice is over excited and he can delivers all his crazy lines being alone most of the time.In conclusion, nothing is dead here. It's a surprising and funny vision of horror classics and it's always good when Tim makes us laugh like this!",10,1,2,12 May 2012
Valkyrie," F...ing thick wooden leg table! (Screen)
","The 3 days History student is very pleased by this movie and remembers why I have chosen this education at first before taking a Law course: History makes me become one with the world: my little life becomes nothing in comparison of the thousands, and help me delete my false conceptions for the truth.I heard about this attack in my class book and without any more data, I imagined that Stauffenberg was an individual but courageous lunatic. I never guessed that the coup was much bigger and there were so much involved in top levels. It's dramatic to see how those men evolved from shyness to dedication to kill the Furher at any cost, because with the end coming, they must have to try anything to avoid their heroism to remain unknown for ever.Maybe because Third Reich means pure evil, his seduction is heavy and Singer helps it: sets, wardrobe are beautiful all the more this movie was actually shot in Germany. The only flaw is the Fuhrer portraying which lacks of charisma! I have seen Z-movies about WWII with more daunting Fuhrer.I would finish by wondering why we have to wait so long for such a story? Why my french cinema which considers itself for the best of the world, didn't adapt it so far? And I stick with my 'Iwo Jima' feeling, that if American movies show that their past adversaries have dignity, I am still waiting for a American war movie saying that they have behave shamefully!",7,2,5,12 February 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Longer is Better (Screen)
","If this movie has been a family feud for me, it is above all a really fun cartoon.The TV show, close to its 20 years, had become quickly boring for me because of the effect of frozen time in Springfield, which makes every situation addressed.So as this new meeting occurs after a few years, and on big screen, new ideas arrive: the family getting out of the town, almost every characters has a part and if there is still parody or private jokes, I could also laugh at some silly moments! Finally, for me, it is one of a few shows that is better on screen than on TV!",7,0,0,7 November 2007
Alien: Covenant," Episode II : attacks of the clones (screen)
","Ah ! The new Alien from Ridley after 5 years of waiting ! Prometheus was such a incredible screening for me (notably due to my discovery of Noomi) that i did again exactly the same ritual: the Imax screening, on a cloudy Sunday morning, in Paris industrial zone However, this time, the magic wasn't there and i came back home disappointed and bored ! Bored because it's always the same content repeated over and over for 6 movies now : an human crew beyond stupidity, played by a totally second zone cast, quickly expandable except for the inspired woman ; the planets are hostile and communications cut ; the synthetic are paranoid and for sure the aliens (and whatever their names or origins) are deadly !Disappointed because there is no effort to tell a clear story : there are so missing pieces in the puzzle that it's no more funny to try to do it. And for sure the fact that those prequels walk in the dark not knowing how many are left is stupid In a way, the franchise goes into the same degeneracy as Star Wars : movies pill up but without any sufficient ideas ; so the stories have poor, thin and stretched content As for Ridley, now i can pinpoint him better : he is only interested in making sumptuous, striking visuals whatever the meaning (the shower, the eugenic experiments,the genocide,) As i stop Star Wars, i will leave this franchise too if the next movie is not the FINAL one !",4,4,7,9 June 2017
All the President's Men," Reality bores ! (DVD)
","This movie ends my Nixon trilogy after having seen 'Frost/Nixon' and 'Nixon'. Among the tree, it is the most accurate movie thus being the weakest.There isn't any drama: it's the facts, all the facts but only the facts. And as it deals with Watergate, the facts are very complicated, very hard to follow and if I haven't seen the other movies before or browsed Internet while this watching, I would have feel terribly lost.In addition, as Oliver Stone cleverly recalls, the Post crusade didn't give birth to the Watergate scandal, just kept it to the attention of the American people. The really stars in the Watergate are the judges, who decided to open this case. That's why the movie stops where the press has stopped and ends abruptly without any senate testimonies or anything. So, it's not really about the Nixon cover-up but about the dirty tricks he and his men did with their 'plumbers' team.But, as the movies was released in 1976, you have the best mood of this period: the clothes, the cars, the society: just look at Redford's suit, being the same color as his blonde hairs. It's a pity that we don't dress like that anymore.",4,2,9,2 May 2009
Atonement," Farmily secrets (rental)
","It begins like a BBC period drama with a high-society family taking vacation in their isolated country mansion. Then, it turns into a sort of English « saving private Ryan » and then it closes at old age. So it's really about a life testimony and this scope is well suited to the plot : fallout of a shameful act. I imagine the pain it is to drag such a weight endlessly and to be unable to correct things. What's is well done here, it's that the facts are told from different points of views and we can't say if it's true or fiction ! Beyond this, the feminine cast is really exceptional : young Saoirse, her mature version who looks like Natalie Imbruglia and for sure, Keira who proves with this movie she is an actress of amazing talent !",7,0,0,28 October 2015
V for Vendetta," V for Variables Values.. (DVD)
","Someone who tortures a young woman: a pervert ? No, here, a savior...Someone who bombs official buildings: a terrorist ? No. A resistant, so? Not more.. It's a vendetta...In addition, why do we find some justice in those acts ? A political power who shuts chaos: a proud legitimate democracy ? No, because it's the plotter of the chaos, thus in fact a tyranny...A calm public opinion: a peaceful society ? No, it's the silence of fearWell, those questions to show you that this movie is more subversive than it seems. Based on a comic book, it is not about SUPER heroes & villains, but it's rather a very philosophical & political pamphlet. It's amazing that Hollywood supports it, after the 9/11, the London terrorists attacks, the fear climax As a citizen, a fan of comics, a movie-maniac (among those of Natalie Portman), 'V for Vendetta' is an absolute recommendation.What I don't understand is why its creator, Alan Moore, doesn't like it?",7,0,2,24 December 2006
The Godfather," Brando Rex ! Godfather Marathon  28/12/08  13H30 (Screen)
","The Godfather Trilogy was projected on one single day at the Paris cinematheque: 9 hours of film and 9 hours of pure delight!I was motivated to see this trilogy in particular because it's one of my first heart-struck in movies! I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the 'The Last Don' for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the sameBrando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root! What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!",10,6,10,4 January 2009
