The Avengers," The Marvel Team delivers a top-notch series home run...
","This movie was absolutely a masterpiece of direction. Josh Whedon literally knocks them out of the park again and again. This movie has an opinion, a vision and a determination to deliver on them in spades. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!It's to Marvel's credit that they managed to pulled off the long windup of movies presenting each of the individual characters as well as they did (even if it's taken them a few tries on the Hulk...). There choices of directors has been relatively spot on both for pulling off the individual movies, but also to deliver enough stylistic continuity across all the movies such that they could eventually all come together in the The Avengers. Joe Johnston, Ang Lee, Louis Leterrier, Jon Favreau, and even Kenneth Branagh (almost unbelievably) all did stand-up work setting the stage for this film. Of the bunch, I personally think Jon Favreau really hit the nail on the head and set the tone for this movie with his stellar work on Iron Man and Iron Man 2.Kudos to the Marvel Team for sticking with it all and delivering a home run at the end of the series.[ Sidebar: Oh, and Hunger Games was a complete and utter creative failure in both vision and execution compared to this movie. In fact, it's quite a shame it was put out at all as it has now set such an amazingly low bar for what should have been the real deal - like this movie is... ]",9,1,5,4 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Not even vaguely in the same league a film as HP or Twilight
","As much as I love this director and loved Jenifer Lawrence, the film was a disaster from start to finish. It doesn't even get on the radar of the worst of the HP or Twilight series. Hopelessly without depth at every turn: ridiculous sets, garishly clownish costumes, and so lacking in character development as to be pointless. One gathers from the heavily conservative budget the studio really wasn't a believer or really committed. I also suspect the very able Gary Ross had his hands tied at every turn and wasn't allowed much creative input into the translation to the screen - it had none of his character outside of the district scenes. Who knows, maybe they'll do better next time now that they've been shown the money - but this one, pitiful.",2,26,44,26 March 2012
Underworld Awakening," Epic Sony / Screen Gems fail in choice of director(s)
","Sony / Screen Gems should be hung up and bled out for eviscerating a beloved franchise with this sad and paltry offering. The directors were in no way up to the task of carrying the franchise into new or interesting territory Then there's the screen play which can be boiled down to 'a really BIG Lycan'.You're kidding me, right? That's what Screen Gems built a movie around? The movie is flat-out brain dead and embarrassing. The entire movie represents so many missed opportunities to develop and explore the saga that it has to be written off as a complete train wreck by anyone who loves the Underworld franchise.Next time just wait until you can find a director with the talent, depth and skills to add something new and worthy. Ditto on the script. If you can't authentically enrich and develop the franchise then find someone with a little vision who can - or don't bother us with a toss- off offering that demeans and cheapens the whole concept.",3,7,13,23 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The franchise is badly in need of a 'Dark Knight' overhaul...
","Turning the franchise over to a TV comedy / action crew had the predictable result - a bad movie that fails even the most basic 'Lethal Weapon' test. Tom isn't Mel or Jackie and shoehorning the otherwise wonderful Simon Pegg into the mix spoiled the whole lot. And the 'Team' never had a ghost of a chance when the actors were all so obviously conflicted between their action and comedic timing. Overall, the Transformer treatment left the whole affair feeling like a wobbly and robotic mess.The direction also lacked subtlety, grace and the continuity necessary to sustain pace which is admittedly hard to do when you are constantly dropping out of warp drive to do one-off skits. The editing wasn't the best either, but it's hard to say just what they were given to work with so I won't be too harsh on them.I'd say the franchise due for some serious reinvention and should dump the comedy and head deep into a darker and edgier landscape capable of better supporting the theme and premise. Maybe get someone with an edge like Cormac McCarthy help with the next screenplay.But if they're unwilling to take a serious turn with the franchise, then they should give Jon Favreau a shot at the next one; at least he understands what he's being tasked to deliver and does so with the eye of a movie goer.",4,6,17,27 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Original Star Wars Concept Needs To Pass With Carrie, Mark and Harrison
","Don't get me wrong - I love Rey, Fin and Po, but the incredibly tacky bar scenes, smarmy stuffed animals, overall bad writing and endless repetitious plot elements need to be blasted by the nearest Death Star as soon as it is charged and ready. The franchise is now officially in a zombie mode that sucks the soul out of every new Star Wars film before the opening crawl has faded. We need to demand the franchise be allowed to mature and become leaner hopefully strangling as much of the Lucasonian kitsch as possible. I personally think it's time for a darker Star Wars that still holds to the light even if that requires walking a tightrope between what was and what could be - the same tightrope they fell from when making Blade Runner 2049. It's now time to let the kids run with it.",2,17,29,15 December 2017
