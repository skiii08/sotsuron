Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat - my spoiler is that this film is rubbish (oh, what a give away)
","I recently wrote a review of Dad's Army (2016) and was shocked to see that film offered up as the worst film ever made. I hated it; it was a poor movie in every respect, but I watched it for about 10 minutes longer than I watched the abysmal Borat - and I will never get those 20 minutes back either. I won't lie - I didn't pay to see this sorry excuse for entertainment at a cinema. It had actually just appeared on Sky Movies (pay to view) or whatever it was at the time, so this had to be way back around 2007, and my wife really wanted to see it because of the reviews she had read somewhere. Me, I knew of Sacha Baron Cohen by his reputation and what I had heard was enough for me to suggest we watch something else (or poke cocktail sticks into each other's eyes, for fun) but no. So she watched with enthusiasm and I watched with a heavy heart and Samaritans on speed dial. After 10 minutes she was rather less enthusiastic, and at the 20 minute mark she actually apologised to me (a rare occurrence) for choosing to watch something so moronic and suggested we watch something a little more entertaining instead. I forget what we did watch, but it was infinitely better (and, whatever it was, be it Schindler's List or whatever, it would have been funnier) than watching Borat. Borat was infantile. It was crude. It was offensive - and that was just the 20 minutes that we watched. We both agreed on these things the following day when discussing why we quit a movie we had paid good money to watch, and when talking with friends we discovered we were not alone - in fact we had difficulty in finding anyone who would admit to having watched the thing to the end; those who did mainly said they had paid to see the film and that walking out was not an option. No one said that it was as funny as we had all been led to believe it was and, 11-odd years later, not one person I have spoken to recently has good memories of this shameful movie. Incidentally, today I was looking at DVD's in a charity shop and there was Borat (99p). Interesting to note that, apparently, there is even more shocking footage that is included as bonus extras that didn't make it to the original edit. Just imagine how much worse it could have been... Also interesting that the bits taken from reviews, telling us how fantastic this production was, are from what would have been regarded as 'lad's mags' that have gone to the wall. Baron Cohen has said something along the lines of he uses his characters to expose the prejudices prevalent in society. I would ask if he isn't perhaps waving a red cape before a bull and when the bull charges he tells us that this demonstrates that bulls are obviously monsters whose violent and antisocial actions he is exposing. Maybe he could be persuaded to poke an angry beehive with a stick, naked, to show that bees can also be provoked, rather than giving us anymore of his lame characters. Either way, he is not someone whose films I will rush out to watch. In fact nearly anything with the name Sacha Baron Cohen in it means that, generally, we will not watch it - although the kids love the Madagascar series, but were indifferent to Hugo - so there will be no chance of deliberately watching anymore of his crass output.In summary: this is absolutely the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to pay money to view. I gave a score of 1 because there is no lower figure, but this production - to me - would seriously justify there being a minus score opportunity for IMDB reviews.",1,2,13,3 June 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Clich√©d, by the book, lazy - you get the message
","A quid in a charity shop - having enjoyed most of the others, and with this one being the most recent, I couldn't believe my luck! But now I know why someone donated it, and I feel short changed...The Tom Cruise action series rumbles on and does so in a text book tick- the-box fashion - car chases (tick), chases on foot with gun and fights and stuff (tick), chases in the dark (tick), world wide locations (tick), Cruise being the only one with the 'vision' (tick), Cruise going on the run (tick), subterfuge and deception as standard (tick), the authorities not appreciating Cruise and his IMF chums (tick), Cruise having to do something death defying (tick) several times (tick), Cruise on a motorbike (tick), Cruise going against the advice of his IMF colleagues (tick), guns, lots of guns and gadgets and technology (tick), Cruise saving the girl (tick), the day (tick), the world (tick), etc (tick). The writers appear to have either fallen asleep or just grown lazy when coming up with this one: the CIA (boo, hiss) want to close down Cruise (hurrah!) and his playmates for not being reliable with saving the world, citing the plots of previous films (breaking into CIA headquarters, destruction of the Kremlin, the missile that didn't wipe out Seattle, etc) to which Jeremy Renner (as Brandt) has to appear before a board of bigwigs and the CIA boss (Alec Baldwin) to argue his case for them not to be closed down (wasn't Renner a field agent in the previous movies? Where was their boss anyway?), which the CIA want, purely so that they can control an out of control Ethan Hawk (Cruise). But when the IMF (Cruise's boys) subsequently gets closed down, and absorbed into the CIA, Cruise goes underground to carry on his investigation into a group that everyone except Cruise (obviously!) believes does not exist. Baldwin decides that Cruise has gone renegade and pursues him like there isn't a bigger problem in the world to occupy his time (incidentally, it is unfortunate that the world moves on and Baldwin now plays the orange US president on SNL, because that was all I could think of in every one of his scenes), even to the point of making it a shoot to kill mission, seemingly because Cruise made a fool of him. There was a beautiful British enemy agent (actually working for the British secret service - or was she?) in a bikini, there was an unemotionally evil criminal boss with a weird voice, there was an evil British government minister with ugly glasses and a dull voice, there were a few evil henchmen who looked as though central casting had been asked to just send some mean-looking east European-looking hombres (own hair not important) along, there was blundering Benji and dependable Luther to do the technical stuff, warn Cruise not to give the secret 'gadget thing' to the opposition and look scared, confused and knowing as required. Like I said earlier, straight out of a text book; sometimes the end result of a scenario was practically telegraphed, it was so predictable. The mystery came from trying to figure out whether the girl would die before the end of the film, and how the baddie would die (spoiler - he doesn't).On the DVD there was an additional special feature, a short called Cruise Control, about (surprise surprise) Tom Cruise, a little propaganda piece in favour of Cruise, with his colleagues (from both in front of and behind the camera) telling us that he was a dream to work with, that he was on the side of the movie goer, that he was dedicated to bringing the best film possible to the viewer, etc. My eyes glazed over and as a result I missed the end, but it is safe to assume that Cruise overcame the baddies, got the girl, and saved the world as usual. I have been of the opinion that M:I2 was the worst of the bunch; it might still be if I can't convince myself that lazy and predictable equals bad.",2,3,6,15 May 2017
Minions," One star, but only because we cannot rate a film no stars
","Minions - good grief. An hour and a half that I will never get back.Back in 2015 my son went with his cub/scout group, for a special treat, to see this movie. When he got back I asked him how it was; as a family we all liked the Despicable Me films, and this was part of the deal. Surprisingly he was a little reticent - he loves going to the cinema - and non committal. I now know why.This is an utter abortion of a film. They could have made 18 five minute cartoons, or maybe two good ones, rather than invest the time this move took to drag out in a full length feature.There was a plot; not a good one, admittedly, and - weak and lame as it was - it looked like someone had taken just two minutes to outline it on one side of a damp sheet of toilet paper. In crayon.
There were characters; again, not good ones (mostly forgettable, in fact) and the director appeared to have tried to make up for the lousy plot by telling most of the voice talent to ham it up like their lives depended on it. There was also quite a bit on national stereotyping, always the sign of a lazy scriptwriter, or a director looking for an easy life.
Even the animation appeared to be of a lower calibre than the usual Despicable Me quality (!); maybe because this was a movie set in the past, possibly to give the trainees and apprentices some on the job experience, but I suspect it was more just to save money.
The soundtrack was the best thing about this film, but then all you can credit Illumination with is choosing it; yet the target audience is 15 and under - who amongst them is going to listen to or even care about a bunch of songs from nearly 50 years ago?I like the Minions, as characters. It is a concept that has a history in slapstick, and they can be as violent as can be gotten away with in cartoon form because they are quite obviously not human and appear to be indestructible. They work well as criminal, erm, minions in the Despicable Me films and they do make for amusing five minute fillers on the DVDs; this was one or two five minute cartoons stretched full length and packed with filler to pad out the slack. And there was lots of slack.I doubt if we'll see a Minions 2 anytime soon. I certainly hope not, anyway.
But then, at the time, we would have thought the same about Sing...",1,1,2,17 December 2018
