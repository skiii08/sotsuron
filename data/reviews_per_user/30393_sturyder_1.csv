Kill Bill: Vol. 2," she roared and she rampaged (may contain spoilers)
",now that i have seen both parts of kill bill i can now comment on both parts as one whole movie will i feel is how kill bill vol 1 and 2 should have been done in the first place but enoght about that and on with the review.Vol 1: i personally think that this is the better of the two halfs it has everything that just one film would have (e.g a big cinimatic fight at the end of movie) add to that a great soundtrack and you have one of the best films of 2003 if not of all time. I give Vol 1 ***** out of *****Vol 2: This half of the film at time feels like it is a completely different movie from Vol 1. I have to say that Mr Tarantino always get a great performance from both Uma Thurman (Who was great in Pulp fiction and this but bad in Batman and Robin and the avengers) and Michal Madsan (who i think is the best part of this and Reservoir Dogs). The only real problem i have with this film is the last half hour went on to long and i was hoping for a big fight between the bride and bill but it did not happen. I give Vol 2 **** out of *****I give Kill Bill as a whole ***** out of ***** ok Vol 2 let it down sightly but i still enjoyed it,8,1,2,27 April 2004
