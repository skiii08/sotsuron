The Ring," To this day, I have not watched the whole thing!
","I was six years old when this film came out, and I can still remember my mom and my grandmother watching this film together, while I was told to go sit in my bedroom, or the other room. But of course, being the kid that I was, I would sneak peeks at the movie here and there, which me doing so would scar me unknowingly for life. As a kid you love television, I grew up with Spongebob and Winnie the Pooh, so being exposed to something like The Ring was something I had never experienced before, and growing up I always had my grandmother and mom telling me about Poltergeist, in which the Carolanne was sucked into the television, so you could only imagine how it was for me to watch a girl climb out of the television! I had nightmares for months, and every time I would close my eyes I would see Samara climbing out of the television, coming to get me. Every time the move was on television, I would stray away from it, I would eventually go on to watch the second one first, to which I had no problem watching, it wasn't in till I saw the first one on DVD at my grandma's friends house when I was around eleven, but even then, I ran out of the room as halfway threw the first scene, when the two teens are at home. I would have gone on for for four more years in till I watched it finally, and even then I was on the edge of my seat, with the blanket by me almost the whole time. It has been many months since I watched almost all of it on HBO, but I made it to the end where Samara goes after Naomi Watt's boyfriend in the movie, and that's where the channel was changed. I have still not seen the whole movie from start to finish, but I have been looking for it on cable everyone in awhile. This is a truly scary movie, and a great one at that, so that is why I gave it ten out of ten stars without seeing the full product first. I wouldn't let small children watch this movie though, it could give them recurring nightmares like I experienced. But I recommend this move to any horror fan, and anyone wanting to get a good thrill on a Friday night.",10,1,1,8 May 2012
