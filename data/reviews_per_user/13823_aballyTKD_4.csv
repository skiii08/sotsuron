3:10 to Yuma," Like the curate's egg - good in parts.
","Makes a strong start despite some silly shoot-ups and Peter Fonda's bullet-proof peritoneum. Nearly made it onto my list of best Westerns until the last 20 mins or so when the characterisation went a bit dada.An excellent main cast is supported by strong performances from the rest of this posse. Russel Crowe is initially chillingly convincing as a bible quoting psychopath and Christian Bale's character as a desperate, if decent, loser is understandable and played with considerable pathos. Ben Foster is also notable as the Schofield revolver-toting minion of Crowe. Peter Fonda still has beautiful eyes despite his now rather craggy exterior and plays the part of a nearly indestuctible Pink to perfection.It's just a pity that it all falls apart at the last hurdle. When I watch this movie again (Which I will) I'll stop it 20 minutes before the end.",7,0,1,2 October 2008
Thor," A confused effort mistaking style and CGI for plot and content
","Directed by the one time great hope of British film and theatre and involving a pretty high-end cast of talent this film was visually pleasant enough. The lead was certainly easy on the eye to watch as the humbled warrior learning diplomacy, love, discretion, and all the other touchy-feely nonsense essential to the 21st century metro-sexual male-cum-mature Norse god.The scale of the CGI environments and settings was truly Wagnerian in nature and the film had a couple of reasonably funny slap-stick moments of comedy for light relief.The film is however pedestrian and plodding for the most part - my children (11 and 13) were both squirming in their seats for considerable portions of the movie. The main battle on a New Mexico (?) street seemed to be what the movie was leading up to - it was over in a trice, though the big tin man was impressive in a Gort-kind of way.A pleasant enough way to spend a rainy afternoon, but definitely not worth the money to see on the big screen.",3,8,18,8 May 2011
Beowulf," A good idea let down by poor casting.
","A potentially great film of an epic story with outstanding 3D effects totally spoiled by the ridiculous casting of Ray Winston as Beowulf. May be credible for the US market, but certainly in the UK Ray Winston is a 'cockney geezer' who should stick to playing London gangsters - certainly not the material that Nordic heroes in Anglo-Saxon poems are made of!Visually the film is very impressive - I was very glad to have taken the 3D option and enjoyed the night flights on owl back and other visual jim-crackery. The strong supporting cast of characters were all well voiced by a variety of celeb talent. The prominent wrestling scene with Grendel was ridiculous however, with far too many sight gags hiding Beowulfs CGI genitalia - given the mature content and extreme violence of much of the rest of the film this modesty seems somewhat pointless.If ever this film is remade maybe Tony Soprano would be a good choice for the lead - badda-bing, badda-bong.",1,4,9,5 January 2008
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Fairly poor action film aimed at the 'young adult' market
","This film was picked by my 15 year old son as a family film, suitable for middle-teens up - obviously.To any parents contemplating renting this film for kids nearly 15 'because they're quite mature' I'd suggest caution. This should really be an 18.How the BBFC could have awarded this offering a 15 certificate beggars belief - without offering any spoilers, the language in the film is rather excessively bad with most sentences containing the F- word, and a couple of variants to do with incest. There is also a highly inappropriate gag relating to anal sex that has a visual punchline at the end of the movie.Disregarding the prolific foul language and surprisingly graphic violence, it's actually a very formulaic teen/young persons' actioner akin to 'Storm Breaker'. Tough inner city underdog wins through to overcome a bunch of snooty Oxbridge toffs and become a Kingsman - some sort of Super Army Soldier/MI6/Ninja agent.Colin Firth appears to be tired of his career as a softly spoken, typically-English romantic lead and is trying to more street by incorporating a few four letter words into his vocabulary, kicking wholesale ass, and decapitating women with a fire axe. He really should stick to what he's good at. Samuel L Jackson is also at his cringe-making worst (I actually rather like SLJ in pre-Star Wars era) as the camp, lisping super villain of the piece. Even by the standards of 'Snakes on a Plane' this is not one of his finest hours.The rest of the cast do their best with what they're given - Mark Strong and Michael Caine will no doubt have been grateful for their cheques for turning up and going through the motions.Bottom line in my opinion is that it's a slightly below par, adolescent thriller/actioner starring a group of talented actors who for whatever reason (Aging, or early career) need the work - but really should have known better. It's spoiled as a family movie by excessive bad language and somewhat too graphic violence - admittedly without much blood-spatter.",2,2,8,6 September 2015
