National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Real good movie
","This was a real good sequel. Not as much action as in the first movie, but the plot was intriguing and believable. Makes me think there really is a Book of Secrets! The clues and riddles for finding the treasure were thought out well. I loved all the parts involving the President, especially the ending. Nicholas Cage always delivers! He is so good at this type of part, and this movie is no exception. There are enough surprises to keep you guessing and interested, even though it might be just a tad slower than the first one. I did not find this at all predictable and enjoyed finding out what the book was as well as where it was. And clean - you can see this one with your kids!",9,0,1,8 July 2008
Stripes," Hilarious - loved it
","Bill Murray is at his best in this film. I think this is the funniest movie of all time! My all-time favorite comedy. Every actor is good. Every scene is good. Every character is good. It's fast paced and raucous. There's the good guys and the bad guys. The scene during graduation is absolutely wonderful and hysterically imaginative. There are hilarious surprises around every corner. The rescue is wild and wacky. Even in 2008, this is still a classic must-see. It's totally timeless. Rent it, buy it, whatever you have to do, but see this movie. You'll be laughing about it for weeks, and it'll end up one of your favorites too.",10,0,2,11 July 2008
National Treasure," Excellent action adventure flick
","If you like action adventure you will love this. Nicholas Cage is such an awesome actor in these type of movies. He does intrigue and plot twists with the best of them! Hunting for treasure, looking for clues, figuring out riddles, and staying ahead of the bad guys is just what this one's about. You can almost believe that something like this could really happen. The supporting acting is also good, and some of the supporting characters are fun and endearing. This one definitely gets thumbs up for plot, acting, and action. Reminds me a bit of what Indiana Jones goes through looking for treasures. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat. Enjoy!",10,0,3,8 July 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Don't bother
","I am a huge Will Ferrell fan, and a huge Nascar fan, but this movie was an even bigger disappointment. The plot is lame. The acting is worse. Most of the comedy just doesn't get there. I can't even remember half of it because it just couldn't hold my interest. There's way too much junk that kids shouldn't see for it to be a family movie. I hope no one took their children? A Night at the Roxbury is Will's great movie, but I haven't seen him do anything else that was very good. He's great at stand-up comedy and skit acting. I loved him on Saturday Night Live. But so far, his movies fail to deliver. Please don't waste any money on this one.",Null,1,2,8 July 2008
