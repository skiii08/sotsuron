The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," twilight vampires
","DO you think this film is worth paying money to go to it? I think not because i loved all the twilight movies but not this one.This movie is too cheesy and it has too much sex scenes also some scenes contain well.....weirdness! Let me give you a example there was a scene were Bella had to drink blood and she liked it! And let me give you another example when Bella wakes up (after the sex scene)she has a bruise on her arm and the top of the bed is broken how did that happen?i think this film might be suitable for teens because i don't think children will like to see any of the sex's or birth scene and there's too much blood like when Bella dreamed that Edward killed all the guests at the wedding which happened because Edward warned Bella that he killed lots of people in the past and Bella got a bit frightened.I think this film is forth seeing only for people who like blood,sex and weirdness.And i don't think you should go to the film alone you should go with your boyfriend or a friend if your a teen if your a child go with your parents! And thats my review so i think you should pay a cheaper price for this movie.",5,0,4,13 January 2012
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," sexy werewolf and vampire
","This movie is great it has drama,romance,anger all in one movie! I think this movie is better than the first twilight which didn't have much love but in this one Edward leaves also Bella and Jacob build a relationship which suddenly turns into romance and feelings.And it's dramatic when Edward leaves Bella but it is sad too. So unfortunately we don't get to see Robert Pattion until the end when he takes his shirt off and starts to kiss Bella (sexy) but i feel sad for Jacob because he loves Bella.I think you should see this film if you like romantic stuff.I hope you liked my review!",7,1,6,14 January 2012
