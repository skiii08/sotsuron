It," Best ever!!!
",The movie was not scary. There is however a lot of of 'shocks' and the clown is shown almost the whole movie(it isn't common for the 'evil character' in horrors). The film even though not scary is very entertaining. It has a good plot and a bit of comedy here and there which does not compromise the horror. A very good watch. I would recommend watching it in cinema for best experience. The reason i rates it 9 and not 10 is because i didn't find it very scary.,9,2,3,3 October 2017
John Wick," Quite good
",This movie provides excellent action. There is always thrill and some background is given about his wife. He is a extremely gentle man and we only find out his capabilities after a while. i enjoyed this movie but i am not exactly the biggest action fan and therefore i could be a little biased.,7,0,0,3 October 2017
Man of Steel," Very enjoyable
","The movie was overall good, the story is more detailed and there are minor changes which make it very interesting. A lot of action, hardly a boring moment in the film. I really love the actors that play superman and lois lane. They make a very cute couple. Looking forward to see the sequel Batman vs Superman.",8,1,2,29 October 2017
Wonder Woman," A good movie
",An entertaining movie for sure especially is you like action. Not one of my favorite movies and i have not watched any other wonder woman movies or read stories so this was a first for me and there were certain parts of the movie that disappointed me. expected bit more for sure.,6,4,7,2 December 2017
John Wick: Chapter 2," Good
","This movie continues straight after the previous one, there is no leap. I was disappointed that they did not pair him with someone as he is extremely sad throughout both the movies.It is on the same level s the previous one. there is however an open ending. The movie ends before he has completed the task of killing the board.",7,0,1,3 October 2017
