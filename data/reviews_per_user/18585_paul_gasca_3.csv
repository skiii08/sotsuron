The Blair Witch Project," could be a good short movie.
","First of all, I would like to know how much did they try to expand the script... Because during 10% of this movie they are yelling in search for Josh...
This movie could be a great short one! You know why? the entire movie is at the last third of it, and that's it. That's the entire movie. 20 minutes.",3,0,0,18 June 2020
The Maze Runner," goofs. full of them...
","well, I don't want to suggest anyone not to see this movie, but ... as far as I see an escape plan from a maze, well the whole movie is built with goofs like these: 1. first of all, they did not even try to climb the walls by any means (ladders, trees, etc) 2. in the scene where the giant robot spiders enter their glade (the grievers), they are trying to hide from these beasts, in the forest... well, with a torch in their hand!! come on! how can you hide from someone during the night, when you have an one meter burning torch in your hand???And that's it. I will stop here with this kind of flaws. I can't even imagine how this movie is rated so high on IMDb, but, anyhow. good luck to it.I was so bored at one point, that in the scene where the leading actor was trying to find gate number 7, I was laughing out loud thinking about the scene with the maze, in the 1975 'Three Men in a Boat'. 'follow me... and now, turn to the left' and so on. PS: this is my first review. can anyone tell me if I can uncheck the spoiler button later?",4,0,2,19 December 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," I loved just a single scene
","I just saw 'Hail, Caesar!'. A mediocre film, with gags for both simpletons and for the public who understands small jokes with communists. It has the feeling of 1950 movies, it has the feeling of the 1950 communists speeches and looks of those folks, but friends, this movie is so week. it's not a comedy, it should be created a new kind of genre for this kind of movies, called week movies. But what I liked most, was the scene with the cowboy stunt, which was distributed in his first serious movie, which also has replicas. Something new for him. I firmly believe that that scene was an homage to Seinfeld. These pretzels ... are making me thirsty! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMe7mlRv8UE",5,0,2,3 March 2016
