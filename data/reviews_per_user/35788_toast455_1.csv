Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not Funny, Major Disappointment to ALI G/ Borat Fans
","Borat is a great character who asks that you laugh at him and not with him. Borat does not understand American culture and, his cultural differences cause him to be inadvertently funny. However, this film is mostly staged and contains very little of the spontaneous improvised humor that is the hallmark of Sasha Cohen's Ali G show. On a good note, the unprepared/unrehearsed scenes were funny, but sadly, the film is mostly comprised of scripted bits that are not funny. I do not recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of his show. It is a major disappointment. For anyone who has not seen the Ali G Show and find this premise to be funny, I recommend that you watch his show instead of watching this movie.",2,2,5,27 January 2007
