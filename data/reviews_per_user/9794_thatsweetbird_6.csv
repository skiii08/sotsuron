Casablanca," Best Hollywood Movie, Period
","It makes perfect sense that Hollywood would make its greatest movie out of nowhere, as opposed to when they think they are making their greatest movie.. Dialogue? Has there ever been a movie not written by Shakespeare with half as many memorable lines?..And Bogie wasn't the original selection for Rick? And they were writing it as they went along? This one even has a great underdog behind-the-movie story!..This is what every movie (should) aspire to..It doesn't even matter if you 'don't like old movies'. It is just too good!..Perfect. And it even DIDN'T have a sequel(Yay!)!..God couldn't make a better movie..You can argue that there is a better 'film'; this is the best 'movie':)",10,1,2,24 February 2005
The Natural," My favorite baseball movie?-My favorite movie, Period.
","What a beautiful movie this is.
The cast is superb in every role.
The film both captures the feeling of a fable
And wonderfully evokes the era it takes place in.
It is like a filmed Valentine Card to the romance of baseball.
Every time I watch it it gets me.
The score is so gloriously moving.
I'm not going to pick at the rival 'best baseball movies'-
But for me there is just no comparison.
Roy Hobbs says 'God, I love baseball.'
And real baseball fans know what he means.
This movie shows that love.",10,0,1,26 November 2018
Closer," Realistic Relationships!
","Wow, I heard from a friend that this was good. This was shockingly, almost brutal in its unflinchingly realistic portrayal of the behind-closed-doors machinations of four individuals who are in and out of lust and love with one another. They are neither traditional movie heroes or villains. Just people. They are flawed, selfish, confused. Just like people are.Not a previous fan of Roberts, I was delighted to hear America's sweetheart(as well as the other performers) spew such filthily real dialogue. Her revelation scene with Owen is very memorable.No pat Hollywood happy ending here. This is no 'date' or 'feel-good' movie. It stays true to the source material, a British play.Many memorable lines of dialogue: shocking, thought provoking, thoughtfully humorous,cutting and caustic.So glad to see a film that really looks at relationships in a real way, like 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' did, although this may seem a bit harsher in tone.",10,3,5,15 July 2005
The Shining," Only gets better the more times you watch it
","What can I say that has not been said before ?
One of the most analyzed and speculated about movies of all timeIt's well documented how Kubrick asked for many retakes.
Although this may well have been unpleasant for the actors
I cannot rule this out as a contributing factor in the fine performances.
Kubrick simply would not stop until he was pleased with the reading.While many obviously and justly note Nicholson and Duvall in this
I also mention the boy who plays the son.
Just how good his performance is becomes the more apparent
When you compare it to the one in the later Stephen King directed version of this.Something I find interesting but is rarely mentioned
Is that the subject of the title-
The boy's psychic paranormal ability-
Is really the subplot of the story (perhaps more so in the movie than the book)
To the main story of the evil of the hotel
That we see Mainly in the father's growing insanity.",10,0,5,24 April 2019
The Fly," A True Romance with a Horror Setting
","What does love really mean? Do you stop loving someone if they change? What if they change so much that they are unrecognizable? What if they have absolutely no control over their change? What if they don't even want to change? This is a great love story, a tragedy. The ending is heartbreaking. Has an audience ever felt such sadness at the demise of such a hideous, murdering creature? We, as does the Geena Davis character, still see that 'thing' as Seth Brundle, at least in some sense. This is as moving as a sci-fi, horror movie can get. We care about these characters. Director Croenenborg at the top of his game, making us feel the horror of our own bodies, of change upon them, of disease. I find this much more romantic than say 'Titanic'. Will your girlfriend be grossed out? Maybe she'll appreciate the love story. I did.",10,3,6,25 February 2005
Titanic," Best Picture?????????
","Are there lesser films in execution and entertainment? Of course. But I felt a 'One' vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by box-office and awards. I think the Oscars should be embarrassed this won all those Oscars, including Best Picture. As another commenter pointed out, it is funny that such a bloated film won 'Best Editing'. Honestly, this winning Best Picture would be like 'Ghost' winning that award: a popular, sappy movie with pretty leads.. Only this lacks the actually humorous Whoopi...The 'romance' is laughable. I like Winslet. She has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since. Actually, mostly, so has DeCrapio...Malcolm X and Gandhi's lives: those are worthy of three hours(plus) of film..NOT this 'eternal romance'..Some people are simply impressed by the sinking. I'm sorry, but if there isn't one person on the ship I care about, the sinking does not mean much to me. Spectacle? Try nature. Go watch a volcano...BTW, I will say I think it is hilarious that people refer to Winslet as a 'cow' in this because she isn't an anorexic actress. I honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to, because Bates isn't even all that fat. Like they wouldn't want Kate as their girlfriend? Come on...I would certainly never want to see this one again...The script fails to portray an 'eternal love'. Rather it gives us a bit of lust. While it is believable Winslet doesn't want to be permanently with Zane, why she has to be with Leo is not shown...I t is encouraging that this is not in the IMDb Top 250...Perhaps the worst film to ever win Best Picture.",1,13,29,5 March 2005
