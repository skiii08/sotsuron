Ali," Yet another awful true story' picture that fails.
","Where to start.  Lights, cameras, action and slow motions and that's about it, unfortunately.  There's something that Hollywood must learn about biographical film making is that you must show something that the public hasn't seen before.  The reason for the appeal of films like this is to get under the skin of the person in question, see what goes on behind closed doors.What was Ali really like in reality, was he more than the public, rude, arrogant, cocky, but great fighter or was he really that sad and one dimensional.  Unfortunately after watching this bore-a-thon, I can only assume he was that dull.They clearly should have shown his childhood and his decent into his later years, this would have been much more interesting, and they could have cut out the rather boring and over long fight scenes.  I'm sure everyone already knew the results of the fights anyway.For some strange reason the film also drifted into a mini bio of Malcolm X and general re-cap of the civil rights struggles of black Americans.  This is all very interesting, but already done to death and please keep it out of a film about Ali.I can't say Will Smiths performance was anything other than just adequate, he never had me believing he wasn't Will Smith.3/10.",1,20,34,2 July 2003
Minority Report," Nice Fx, but very weak sci-fi
","If anyone has read any of my other reviews for Spielberg films, they will know I am far from a fan.  For me he is the McDonalds of filmmaking.  Quick, simplistic, formulaic story telling, no variety or depth in what he is showing.  I liked Raiders and Indiana J as I was growing up and I still love Jaws, but since then I don't believe he has moved on.  What disturbed me was not so much the success, but the acclaim he received.  Let's be honest, to be successful in Hollywood (i.e. make money) to have to make films with mass appeal you have to make movies that are very bland, so they will appeal to as many people as possible.  That's fine, as long as people respect that it's just tat at the end of the day.What seems to have happened with the last couple of films (A.I. and now Minority Report) is that people are starting to realise that Mr S, is a one trick pony.  Minority Report, isn't terrible, but it's very far from great, the story is ok and some of the concepts could have made an excellent Sci-Fi movie, but with SS at the helm it's dragged down to the lowest level.  Personally I don't like Tom Cruise as a action lead, he's small and looks like Pee-wee Herman could give him a fight, yet he is able to beat up and fight numerous well trained policeman.  The very stupid part to this was the way the Cruise character could jump through windows, walls, etc, without even so much as a scratch.The plot holes are also massive, if these people could see into the future then they would be able to see all the events that took place.  Why couldn't they see that Burgess was going to murder Witwer.  The fact that one of them wasn't there in the present time shouldn't make any difference.  The eyeball thing was very stupid, as many have pointed out, John's security access would have been removed immediately and also the fact the eyes were effectively dead.  Also, if they could discover someone's identity from the Pre-cogs surely then they could find out where they live, without having to guess the house.Anyway, the special FX, are nice and plenty of them, there's a lot of action, but otherwise a poor film, 5/10.",5,1,3,16 August 2002
John Wick," Best action movie since Raid 2 and about 10 years before that.
","Of course the plot is nothing new, it's your usual revenge story. However the delivery of this well-trodden path is told in such a quirky, interesting and stylish manner, it makes all the difference.First off, the camera work and fights scene are superb. Please any director making Bourne, James Bond or the awful Inception, keep the bloody camera on and at a distance. This stupid jumping, cutting every 2 nanoseconds with a camera 5 centimeters from the nose of the actor, is awful. It ruins any action movie.We know the story is cliché, so the director presents the story in a very chic and interesting way, which doesn't leave you bored. There is also this tongue-in-cheek criminal world with its own rules and quirks, which adds to the interest.I notice from other reviews there is a lot of focus on the revenue story, being boring and routine. There are almost no original plots these days, most stories are based around a simple plot of love or revenge. This is no different, but what elevates it above so many other actions films is the style, pacing and brilliant fighting scenes. It doesn't dwell on the obvious, it treats the viewer with some intelligence.There is very little unnecessary obvious join-the-dots dialog. Everything is keep lean, fast and minimal. It doesn't hide the inevitable story, it embraces and celebrates it.Before someone accuses me of being someone with no film experience, I am in my 40's and have seen way too many movies, I find nearly everything predictable and dull. This one was a very pleasant surprise in a sea of mediocrity.",8,10,24,16 January 2015
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Best comedy ever
","Any film maker in the world who wants to make a comedy, go and watch this film.  Stuffed and I mean stuffed with brilliant scenes/lines, so much so that every scene is a classic that you're happy to watch time and time again.Rather, surprisingly, this film isn't very 'Monty Python'.  It's nothing like the slightly amusing Holy Grail, that's just thrown together.  It's a work of genius, every part of the movie is hilarious and at no point does it lull into some drawn out scene's just to fill out time.Take note : Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, Steve Martin, Mel Brooks, etc.  This is a funny movie.",10,0,3,13 July 1999
As Good as It Gets," Great acting and dialog, but...
","I was very impressed with the first hour of this movie.  Nicholson was for once brilliant, normally he just plays Jack Nicholson and everyone says he's great, but this time the credit was justified.  Helen Hunt was fine and the dialog was excellent and amusing.  The style of filming is similar to the excellent Jerry Maguire, in the fact that it isn't the predictable stereotype Hollywood crap.The 'but' is that's 'as good as it gets' the story kind of drags a bit, you know they'll get to together in the end and Nicholson will lose all his idiosyncrasiesIf the film had ended after the first hour I would have said it was a classic movie, but it lost a few points for the last part of the movie. In essence the story let down great performances and dialog.  Still worth watching.",Null,0,0,21 September 1999
Inglourious Basterds," No plot - Just mindless violence and gore
","This film has no plot of any real substance it's just a few scenes strung together to bore and then shock the viewer. In fact this is a theme with Mr QT, who, in my opinion, hasn't made one good movie. The best movie he was involved with was True Romance, an excellent film, which actually had a story. Fortunately QT never directed it; otherwise it would have been a mess.Pulp Fiction is one of the most overrated films of all time. It was new, shocking, unusual and quirky, but it wasn't actually that good. The plot for this awful film: Scene 1Bore the audience with some drawn out painful conversation. Kill everyone in an unpleasant way. Scene 2 Bore the audience with some drawn out painful conversation. Kill everyone in an unpleasant way.etc There is nothing pleasant or redeeming about this film. It leaves a nasty taste in the mouth, mindless over-the-top gore and cruelty, which has now become blasé and acceptable. A distasteful and pointless film, 1/10.",1,16,33,10 December 2009
Amistad," Poor drama with no point
","It really does worry me when I read comments like '10/10 great acting, very moving'.  This is very poorly made drama that lacks any depth or emotional punch.  Generally I don't like Spielberg movies as they're quite childish and are aimed at a broad audience, but then along came Schindlers List', which in my opinion was handled brilliantly.   I then heard about Amistad and expected more of the same, but I was very disappointed.All the characters were cardboard stereotypes of what people should be like. The performance by Mathew McConaughey was a repeat of his performance in a A Right to Kill' and seemed very unbelievable.  The only performance with any credit was the excellent Hopkins who brought some drama and believability to his character.  The token black, Morgan Freeman, seemed to just pop up every so often and didn't really add anything.Because of the bad direction and acting even the horror scene's lacked any emotion and just appeared as a sequence of melodramatic typical slave scenes.A strange film with no real point, badly made, unbelievable and surprisingly unmoving.",Null,0,1,17 September 1999
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Morrisseys version of the laughing policeman
","Okay where to start.I will confess I am not a particular fan of the Star Wars movies, I never got 'into them' as many others have, but never-the-less I found them harmless entertainment. The action moved quickly and generally they were upbeat and vitriolic. Obviously, you can't take them too seriously when you have weapons which can blow up a planet, yet people still fight hand to hand or rather lightsaber to lightsaber combat.This film tried to add a more serious side to the story. It tried by combining more slow serious scenes with the frivolity of the previous movies and unfortunately it just doesn't work. In fact, instead of giving the film depth it made it a dull, boring and miserable story. There's no fun in the movie and no interest.The plot is painfully slow, the dialog is boring and doesn't add anything to the story or the depth of the characters. The action is dull and routine and the CGI of Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher is terrible! In 2001, Final Fantasy looked more realistic.The film needs some editing, a number of scene's could have been trimmed or eliminated altogether, to get this down to 100 mins and more watchable.In the end, you have a fun action movie genre, made in a serious, uninteresting and boring style. Needless to say, it doesn't work too well.",3,14,30,30 December 2016
The Others," One trick pony
","I won't into to too much detail because there isn't really a plot as such. Basically we have a 30 minutes Twilight Zone episode dragged out into one full-length motion picture.That is not to say that it's badly made, it's not.  The acting all round is very good, the atmosphere and direction are fine.  It's just the story is really just 10 minutes at the end of the film.  All the rest of the film is rather pointless and boring.The film was made even more uninteresting by me predicting the twist in about the first 10 minutes of the film.  I'm actually surprised more people didn't.  After seeing Sixth Sense and any sci-fi film I always question everything.  Are they really there, have they gone back/forward in time, etc.  When they showed the first scene with Victor, immediately the thought that they actually might be the ghosts, popped into my head.  Of course when she meets the husband, the game is up.  He's dead, so she must be dead, plus the fog of course.  Then I was just waiting for the end.Well acted and well made, but ultimately boring and dull.  3/10.BTW  There weren't living in England, they were living in the Channel Islands.",3,0,1,7 January 2003
The Terminator," The complete movie
","First of all I'll say that this is my favourite movie.  Granted there are better dramas, films with superior acting and deeper stories, but The Terminator, for me, is the complete movie.You have a clever Sci-fi story, time travel, one of the best villains in movie history, a love story and relentless action.The reason this film really hit the mark for me was when I first saw it.  I was about 15 and saw it on video knowing nothing about it and I was blown away.  For the first time the 'bad guy' didn't tie people up, drag out a death scene only to be thwarted at the minute.  No this finally showed what a true killing machine would do.  There's two great remarks in the film that I only picked up on repeated viewings: 'Stay in a public place and you'll be safe' and 'There's over 30 cops in this building, what could happen to you' (sorry not a direct quote words to that affect).  These statements are then blown away as The Terminator just destroys everything that gets in his way.On top of this refreshing callous violence is the wonderfully developed love story between Reece and Connor.  It's so well done that the character interplay takes place at the same time as the main action.I could go on and on as to why I love this film, but I'll leave it there.By the way T2 was such a disappointment when compared to  this. >10/10",10,1,1,23 September 1999
We Were Soldiers," Crap with a capital 'C'
","The alleged true portrayal of events that occurred in the first conflict between America and the US.  It's very hard to write more than a few words about a film that is really so awful.  This is basically a John Wayne Cowboys and Indians picture.Mel Gibson (John Wayne) wanders around the battlefield impervious to bullets and has no fear.  On top of this he shows his feminine side, as he cares so much for everyone.  The full well rounded Christian American.  Throw in a few slow motions and the Brady Bunch and then you have it, We Were Soldiers, absolute crap.Just take the family scenes at the beginning, does anyone know a married couple that acts so 'in love' and sappy.  Totally unrealistic and unbelievable.The Vietnamese run into bullets like robots.Ridiculous, racist, flag waving, propaganda.",1,5,11,30 September 2003
Alien," A milestone in horror/sci fi
","I can't believe anyone can consider Aliens a superior film to this. Aliens is a well made action movie that has a few flaws and doesn't stick to the theme of the original.  I suspect that if people hadn't seen Aliens and possibly Alien 3 first they would have a different opinion.Alien is a masterpiece.  It's wonderful attention to detail and the slow build up to the eventual chaos of the final crescendo is marvellous. There is such belief and tension even in the early scene's in the space ship and especially when the crew first encounters the Alien.The special effects are excellent and even by Todays standard.I've read other reviews and people have criticised the long periods where nothing happens and that you don't see the creature.  This is essence is the point of the film.  In 1979 this set a landmark.  If you saw the creature constantly it would ruin the fear element.  The slow scene's built up vulnerability and tension.  You were constantly terrified that the creature was lurking in the dark just around the corner.The main theme of this film was that this creature, was a monster, but yet was superior to the humans.  It could think, and was almost invincible (this idea was destroyed in Aliens).All the credit goes down to Ripley Scott, the writers and lot to Mr Giger for creating a believable tension filled, scary movie that won't be forgotten.Definitely a classic.",8,0,1,6 August 1999
Shutter Island," Nice style, but weak, predictable and typical overlong.
","I have never quite understood the status that Scorcesse enjoys amongst fans, but nevertheless he has made some good movies, well two to be precise, Taxi Driver and Goodfellas. Everything else he has done has been between OK and awful. Gangs of NY and Casino were both toilet water.However this seemed a change of direction and even started quite well. However I found myself guessing the ending after about 10 minutes and hoping it couldn't possibly be that simple and obvious. I really wanted there to be more, but the film stumbled along, ramming home the now obvious plot the subtlety of the BP deep sea oil platform.I am a great believer in being fair and I try much harder to admit that others have a valid point of view, yet when I read things about what an ending or it was a suspenseful, I cannot do anything but insult the these reviewers. It was a bloody mental institution and the doctor said in the first 10 minutes that he liked to play out patient fantasies. How hard was it to make the connection? Did anyone else notice the invisible glass, when the woman went to drink she had nothing in her hand, but a glass was there when she put it down, was this deliberate?",5,0,2,28 June 2010
Capote," Well made, but super boring
","Like many Oscar movies, which are nominated on merit for the technical art of film-making, there is little to no consideration to if the film is actually interesting.I watched both Good Night & Good Luck and Capote recently and in both cases wished I hadn't bothered. It's not that there is anything technically wrong with either film; in fact they are both very well made. It's just that there is no entertainment, no emotion, and no passion at all. In fact they were both very boring and painful to watch.In my opinion Capote was such a pointless film. How can anyone find this rather uninteresting tale of a period of someone's life that can only be described as rather dull; an interesting thing to watch.Films can be intelligent, well acted and well made, but ultimately they have to give something to the viewer. This does not do that.",3,22,38,13 February 2006
Barry Lyndon," A beautiful work of Art
","A couple of years ago I caught the end of a movie on TV that captivated for the brief time it was on.  Finally 2 years later I get the DVD.Initially the story was a bit slow, but nevertheless intriguing.  As the movie progress I got more and more drawn in.  Again Kubrick has done it, he doesn't use the camera by zooming in and out and using slow motions etc, he is able to simply set up a scene with detail and perfection then let the actors do the rest.Everyone complains that books to film never works.  Often the reason is trying to emphasise the emotion and thought process that takes place is very easy in a book, but very hard on film.  Kubrick just added narration and got the actors to not over-act and it worked perfectly.I could go on and on, but it's been said before.  I imagine a lot will say this film is long and boring and it has no story. The reason is we're all conditioned to be told who the good guys are, who's right and wrong.  This is not the case we don't feel for the main character until the scene with his son (which was so well done).This has lots of similarities to 2001, lots of meticulous detail, lots of silences and subtleties.  As in 2001, this is more than a film, it is a work of art and should be experienced rather than just watched.",9,1,2,24 December 1999
Interstellar," It's a Chris Nolan film. All style, but no substance.
","As you can probably ascertain from my title sentence, I am not a fan of Mr Nolan. However I don't have any bias prior to watching his films, in fact quite the opposite, I want to like his films, as I really like his ideas and concepts, which is why it's such a shame he never delivers.I also seem to be in a minority with my views as his films seem to have mass appeal, certainly if you look at money they make, but so far, they have all left me cold.Interstellar, TDK and Inception all have similar flaws: On the positive side, they are all really cinematic, stylish and well filmed. They all have really atmospheric music and nice special effects.On the negative side, the plots are terrible and make no sense. The dialog is flat and unrealistic, there is no charisma or charm in the films, they are functional and soulless and they lack any real depth or meaning. The characters tend to be robotic and cold, not warm or humorous.The problem is when you put these two elements together you basically get high expectations that something great is going to happen, but ultimately nothing does, so it becomes a major let down.On to Interstellar specifically (warning spoilers a plenty): The first hour of the film, was very boring, and very silly. The Earth is running out of food, so people still plant huge fields of crops, which they destroy when driving through them for no good reason. They have completely automated the process of farming crops, yet they don't need Scientists or Engineers, they need farmers, which makes no sense.If the Earth was starving then the crop fields would be fenced off, taken away from farmers and it would be a controlled process. Scientists and Engineers would be the most valued members of society. If the crops were so valuable they wouldn't be exposed to the elements and the dust. They would be covered and protected. Everyone is so worried about the food shortages, they don't take any notice of it. Instead they drive around in huge petrol driven SUV's from 2014 (where's the Google cars or electric cars?).Here's an idea. You now have the ability to hibernate on spaceships, so apply that to the population of Earth and reduce the need for food. Anyway let's move on.They go into space, arrive at some place and immediately land in some water. Do they survey the area first, check out the planet and landing area first in detail, nope they just land. Now I know there is time pressure, but why haven't NASA sent numerous robots into space to visit these planets and send back information.Anyway this drags on a bit, they visit another place, which is another disaster and then we get to the point of the film (only after about 2 and a half hours). Cooper flies into a black hole, where he would normally be crushed and killed instantly, but survives in some kind of advanced framework, where he very predictably sends the already sent messages back to his daughter. After this there is a very silly ending. Even though he is outside of time, as it were and he can send messages to any point, he can't for some reason stay in the same time as his daughterAnd how stupid was the 1970's Minecraft designed robot.In the end the visuals and atmospheric music was great, but the plot, soul and charm of the film was completely missing, unfortunately like all Nolan movies.",1,10,21,19 March 2015
Léon: The Professional," An original beautiful action movie
","Having read some of the reviews for this film before writing this comment I was very pleased that I wasn't the only one who was moved by this film.I went to see this film based on the excellent trailer and I wasn't disappointed. It's very original and very unusual, the love that grows between two incredibly unusual characters is surprisingly well done and very brave. If you try to explain the film to someone it's very bizarre 'how could an Italian hit-man befriend and fall in love with a 12 year old child'. This really is the genius of Luc Besson. He's able to make a very strange idea and insert some beautifully crafted scenes of violence, but still come out with a very credible film, that's overriding memory is the love between the two characters and not the revenge or the violence that takes place.Overall this film has a wonderful charm, the love that develops, although improbable, is wonderfully realised and believable. The acting is superb and there's some great 'dirty harry' style lines thrown in which make a light relief now and again.Since watching Nikita and this movie, I began to believe I'd found a new hero in Besson, after Cronenberg, Carpenter and Cameron had all lost their way (in my opinion), but of course besson went on to make 'The Fifth Element ' which disappointed me.Please Luc, watch Nikita, and Leon and remind yourself how good you can be.10/10By the way  For anyone who hasn't seen the full version, which I was lucky enough to see, it's well worth it.",10,0,1,23 July 1999
Bohemian Rhapsody," True story with little truth and little interest
","In my opinion to make a good biopic picture, you must do two things; One stick to the true story as much as possible, two, show the things that the public has never seen, this is what makes the film interesting.Now this fails on both accounts. Key scenes in this are completely untrue and therefore the motivations behind the actions we seen aren't true. In the end its a largely fictional account of Queen.So many biopic movies fail on focusing on the behind-the-scene stuff, which is what we are all interested in. I don't need to see a Queen tribute band perform, I can see the real thing on YouTube. What I want to see is the real Freddie, the real scandals, the real struggles.In the end I don't feel I know the Queen story any better or that I got to know/understand Freddie Mercury either.",1,6,10,15 April 2019
American Pie," Actually very funny
","I'm almost 29 and will confess to being a massive fan of Bachelor Party and Animal House.  Unfortunately these popular films, I believe, never got the credit they deserved because they were immediately associated with hundreds of other childish soft-sex clones.  Obviously John Hughes came along upgrading the teen theme with some excellent comedy-dramas (Weird  Science, Ferris, etc).There'd been a bit of gap in-between then and know and I was sceptical that this film could add anything new.  Oh what the hell, I'll give this American Pie a go.About 4 teens trying to get laid and the hilarious antics they get up it to, culminating into some kind of growing up by the end, it was surprisingly funny, actually really funny.  It was a nice way that an old idea was brought up-to-date using the tools of the nineties.  The film didn't resort to just shock and stupidity it actually had some charm and whit about it.I'm sure this won't appeal to everyone, but even though I'm not a teenager I found this very funny and highly enjoyable.  Probably the best comedy I've seen for a long time.9/10",9,0,1,25 January 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Grandiose scenary, but a weak story.
","I'm ignoring the fact that this was a book conversion and judging purely as a film.I haven't read the book and I'm not overly interested in children's films, but I thought with Peter Jackson at the helm, that maybe this would be a more adult version of an alleged classic.  I like Peter Jackson as a director, every since he made 'Bad Taste', which took him 4 years, I believe.Any great film, has one main theme, you need to believe and care about the characters.  Whether you have great special effects, acting or story twist, you need to feel something.  This is where LOTR fails very badly.The film started very well, I like the atmosphere and the style, and there was even some tension.  If the film has ended when Liv Tyler rescued Elijah, then, although short, I would have liked it.  From that point onwards the film became very tiresome.  Basically any depth was lost, it became a sequel to 'Clash of the Titans' or any other Ray Harryhausen film.  Lets just walk somewhere, have one of the Scottish Hobbit's do something stupid (which was very annoying by the way) and have to fight some monster or creature. This carried on for 2 hours.  You realised at this point that no matter who or how many things attacked, this bunch could beat them all with relative ease, hence then, you didn't care anymore.  The worst part was the end scene one bloody soldier against 50/60 men and they still couldn't kill him, just silly.One other point, the 'Special FX', good FX are when you don't know that they are there, they mix seamlessly into the background, like the film.'A.I.' (crap film though).  LOTR, had a lot of bad FX, they were obvious all the time, very few of the backgrounds actually looked real.  The mines and the big creature looked particularly fake.If I'm being cynical about the story, why didn't Gandalf just use the big bird to fly them or the ring over the mountain and drop it, but that wouldn't be a very long film I guess.  How many times can someone drop or lose a ring, that is meant to be so important.Judging by the comments here, a very overrated film, good at times, but generally childish and silly, I would recommend it to anyone under 14, for me 5/10.  I suppose a lot of blame has to go the book, as essentially the story is a poor one.BTW- Why is every new film on IMDB, `The greatest film ever made'",1,17,40,12 August 2002

Cast Away," A waste of film
","At the end of this film and found myself just saying 'why', why would anyone bother to make this film.  It didn't appear to cover any new ground; it wasn't a true story, so seemed rather pointless.The acting was fine, and some of the cinematography was good, but there were some basic errors.  The whale scene was poor; the scene in Moscow was a joke.  If anyone has visited Red Square, it's behind a number of pedestrian areas and although, in special circumstance, can be access via road, why would you.  Oh, because, to show you're in Russia you have to have the backdrop of Red square.  The scene in question was impossible, so I assume it was computer generated.  The cliché scene with Helen Hunt was so Hollywood' it was a bit sad.  Not to mention that she didn't waste too much time getting married and having kids, he was only gone just over 4 years.Overall, I didn't hate the film, it was a bit boring, but I just could see why anyone would be interested in such a poor, uninteresting story.",3,6,13,11 March 2001

Like most I've only ever seen this film on Video, and again like most, I've seen it countless times.The character interact is good, but the wonderful atmosphere and terror created by the camera work, acting and the music is what makes this film truly great.The special effects are still the best I've ever seen, created by the great Rob Bottin.Yet another Carpenter film that reminds me what being a director should be all about.  Good story, great atmosphere and a great film.A true horror classic.",10,0,1,14 July 1999
Split," No twist!
","So M Night is back. The man who has been on a downwards spiral, well, since his first film. The 6th Sense, was excellent, in my opinion. I liked Unbreakable, but Signs was garbage and nearly everything else he has done has been rubbish (the Village has some merit).Now this was interesting, no question. James M was stunning in his performance (similar to Filth, a brilliant film).However, I was waiting for the pay off at the end of the movie. I assumed that the girl was either all 3 girls or the girl was just one of the personalities, that might have been a clever ending, but in the end, nothing; it just ended. Huh? What was the point of the uncle story? It added nothing. I thought it actually might have something to do with the whole story, but no, totally meaningless.I gave it a 1, as it lead nowhere and was a waste of time. The acting of the 2 main characters was brilliant, IMO, so deserved a higher score, but the writer and director deserves a minus 10, which balances it out.Complete crap!",1,114,285,29 March 2017
Cold Mountain," Awful, too simplistic story, yet well filmed.
","Certainly a well made film, with some nice camera shots and some nice acting.  Yet the whole film is ruined by the simplistic black & white story. Any story where the hero is all good' and the bad guy is all bad' cannot be taken seriously.We have Inman from the South, good looking and doesn't do a thing wrong. Doesn't shag anybody else, after just one bloody kiss, loves black people and even tries to help the Yankees.We then have Teaque, fat and ugly, nasty to the core, wants to shag Inman's betrothed love, wants to hurt and kill everyone.  As soon as a film follows this children's book story line, the realism and belief is totally lost.  How about Inman also hating black people, how about him getting the odd shag on his way home, why not.  How about Teague being good looking and generally ok, but felt he needed to do his job.  This would have made a good film.By the way, the ending was stupid.  After all that, why do the silly gunfighter stand off, why not follow the guy and sneak up on him like any normal person would.5/10.",5,1,3,30 August 2004
"I, Robot"," Tired old 80's plot line with shinny new FX
","So, man's best friend, the Robot, starts to attack mankind. Hardly the most original plot line in the world, Animatrix and Terminator to name just a recent couple, have very similar themes. The 2 big problems with this film are: one, Will Smith and two, the Plot. Will Smith, plays Will Smith, the same character that appeared in Bad Boys, MiB and Independence Day. I cringed every time I had to hear yet another throwaway cliché remark. Isn't this man meant to be a professional detective, yet he swans around like some cocky adolescent.The plot: First big mistake, the future, the year 2035, we suddenly have redesigned the entire city of San Francisco, in just 30 years. You would not rebuild an entire city and it's transport system such a short space of time. The second was the awful tired old cliché of the cop with a nightmare. It's not that he had this issue, it's that you knew it was in the story just so this moral dilemma would pop-up later in the film and he could then right the wrong that had troubled him so much.The other awful parts were, the motorbike jump and shoot nonsense and the end fight scene. These robots are much stronger and agile than a human, yet about 50 of them can't stop 2 people from destroying their queen bee.It's not all negatives, the robot special FX are truly excellent and there is some semblance of a good sci-fi conundrum somewhere beneath the surface. Overall it's a tired old film that might have original about 25 years ago, but the days of cocky cops fighting insurmountable odds are long gone, Arnie and Stallone are testament to that.",5,3,6,5 October 2004
Aliens," Good, but no cigar
","WARNING SPOILERISHIt appears that with many people this was a great movie.  Well I'm going to be different.  I certainly don't think Aliens is a bad movie, I think it's very good, but everyone's gone a little bit OTT.A couple of points, people have said the films perfect, well:In one scene towards the end Bishop is meant to be cut in half yet you can clearly see him standing up in a hole.  I can't believe the editor or director missed it.  The acting of the little girl was poor (IMO) and as a result I had no feelings for her.  In the end when she was captured I couldn't care less and just said leave her there (like they left everyone else).I found the film a bit predictable and found myself saying 'get on with it' on many occasions.  I was also disappointed with how easily the Aliens died. In the first film part of the terror was that no one knew how to kill the creature, in this it's just a bullet away.The macho interplay between the soldiers was a bit stereotypical and unbelievable and that period of the film dragged a bit.I recently saw the 'directors cut' which was a lot better and cleared up a lot of the inconsistencies in the film.You probably think I'm being a bit picky but I think these are a few of the issues that stops the film from become a great film and, for me, will keep it as just good.",6,6,12,6 August 1999
Avengers: Endgame," Shallow, dull, boring, unemotional, rubbish
","Warning spoilers a plenty.I thought it was utter rubbish, complete drivel. Nearly everything was off and wrong about this bore-fest.Almost nothing happened. It was so boring. Virtually the entire first 90 minutes could have been trimmed to about 15 mins.Pacing was terrible, it lost all momentum at times and was tedious.
The feel of the film, was all over the place, jumping from very dumb childish comedy to attempted serious drama and then to social commentary. It didn't natural have a core or flow to the film.So many stupid, misplaced scenes, such as the 'girl power' nonsense, so contrived.Massive plot holes. I know Time Travel is a very difficult subject to tackle, but this made little sense. Either you cannot change the past or you can? This sometimes does and other times doesn't. If you steal the Stones then try to put them back. In theory they haven't been stolen, as you can't change the past, therefore, how can you put them back? How on earth did Captain America manage to put the Stones back and Thor's hammer and presumably the Green girl? They erased Thanos and the Robot girl in same timeline as well and that didn't effect anything?Apparently you can't kill a baby Thanos, but you can kill a slightly younger adult version of Thanos when he comes to the future that is okay.How did Capt A, put the Stones back at the exact time they left, without interfering with the original operation to retrieve them or changing the past anyway.The cringe worthy comedy was awful. There was a serious tone to Avengers, but this just turned into a cheap gag reel. Thors (a god) getting fat. Hulk getting fans.Corny cheap false scenes with Tony and his daughter, with the terrible music playing at the same time, like some cheap matinee from the 50's.Overall there was no feeling or emotion, the funeral scene was false and contrived.Pepper Potts is now Iron Woman?Spider-man goes back to school, after 5 years away? Really?I saw it with my teenage Daughter, she thought it was crap and we heard most people around us saying the same thing.A real stinker this one. 0/10.",1,141,261,30 April 2019
Meet the Fockers," Awful
","I only managed about the first 30 minutes of this movie, then couldn't take any more, so don't have too much to say, other than this film is terrible.The jokes and humour in this film are so obvious, unsubtle and stupid they don't even bring a smile to your face. Each scene is contrived and false, it loses all coherence as any kind of competent film.Of course there are no real rules for comedy other than a film needs to be funny, but it helps to have believable characters and plot, otherwise, awkward and amusing situations don't work. It looked like it was the first time Ben Stiller had ever met his parents.Meet the Parents was mildly amusing, this was just rubbish. 1/10.",1,6,10,10 August 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Spielberg = Popular + big money, but poor film
","Again, yes again, our friend Mr Spielberg does it.  He takes a subject matter that needs clever acting and clever direction, but rams it home like a 2 hour pop video.Why do people like these films, THE ACTING WAS AWFUL, the story was boring, the script was something out of a 1950's 'B' movie and people, not just one, but many, are saying that was a great film.Go and see a movie that is cleverly made, not just a five minute script that, uses every cliché in the book to ram home emotions and depth that aren't there.  I suppose this film appeals to the masses that don't have to think about a movie, just accept it as arty as it had couple of drawn out sad scene's, so it must be a masterpiece.I won't bother to go into the racism in the movie, the Germans played as mindless morons that just walk into bullets and of course, us stumbling Europeans, Australians, Russians, etc that actually fought through the entirety of the war.0/10 - Awful.",1,15,34,21 October 2000
2012," Worst film I have seen for some time
","Where to start. Basically in summary this isn't really a film, it's a collection of many poor over-the-top CGI images and sequences that aren't realistic in any way or believable. Added to that is the most corny, pointless, dull, cliché ridden soap opera scenes the world has ever been exposed to. This film is completely devoid of any realism or emotion; it's over long and completely boring and pointless. I will give just some small example of pure nonsense: <ul><li>Aircraft taking off just before the whole airport and area is about to be destroyed, yet the tower keeps telling the plane they are no authorised to take off!!! 2 seconds later the tower is destroy, why would they be in the tower and why would they try stopping the flight. </li></ul><ul><li>Mobiles phone work all the time even with no land, towers or electricity for miles around. </li></ul><ul><li>The wife, who has just been stuck on a boat for x weeks/months still has lovely make-up and new clothes on, even on a packed ship. </li></ul><ul><li>Animals are flown in one by one, by helicopter in the open air. Not in boxes and not on trucks and not well in advance, hours before departure. </li></ul><ul><li>Why do all planes fly 1 inch off the ground at all times, rather than bothering to actually climb over any danger.</li></ul>I could go on and on, this film is simply brain dead nonsense with no redeeming qualities. Even the green screen FX are awful and poorly done.",1,50,79,4 December 2009
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A lot of effort, but little reward.
","Very similar feeling to the first film.  Certainly everyone can admire the effort and hard work that must have gone into making these three films.  I have never read the books and probably never will, so I can't comment on whether the original material was worthy of praise, but as films, they are poor.I can only assume, by the large amount of hysterical praise both films have received, that people decide before even watching the film, that it is great or that audiences just wish to see special FX.Just like the first movie, there's lots of little sub plots going on, but for what reason, none of the external characters seem to have any purpose or add anything to the story.  The complete mess of a story is virtually non-existent and by the end you realise after all the pompous procrastination you have a very simple battle sequence.  What were the first 2 hours about  ?The biggest crime of this film is that you don't care about any of the characters, nothing is explained really, none of the motivations of any of the characters seem genuine.  In the end, you see that the main cast of characters basically are invincible, so who cares, they're going to win, there is no tension, no edge.The FX, which seems to be the main reason everyone is watching the film, range from very good to very average.  The laughable tree sequences never really look real or believable.   Parts of the battle sequence were comedic, they were so over-the-top.The bottom line is really if people were more honest and looked at this film or it predecessor without pre-judging it as a book conversion, they would see that although there's lots of FX and lot's of things going on, the film is a muddled mess and not really worthy of such high praise.",1,4,12,7 February 2003
I Am Legend," Simply rubbish
","Oh dear where to start. Everything is wrong with this film, really everything, it must go down as one of the worst films ever.The story, yet another virus that not just kills people, but for some inexplicable reason makes people turn into superman zombies that for unknown reasons want to risk their lives to kill one healthy man. Making any film with the last man alive on Earth storyline struggles to be interesting, but when you add the cliché zombies, I mean really how many times has this stupid storyline been done.The acting, it's Will, so what's the best you can expect. The dialog is totally devoid of making sense and on top of that no real explanation for events. A pandemic that acts so quickly would effectively wipe itself out, as it's victims would run out, see the Spanish flu for an example.Anyway you have a dull non-sensical, pointless story, poor special effects, bad acting and poor dialog, how on Earth did anyone vote this higher than 0. IMDb seems totally unrealistic lately, I can only assume people are paid to write dummy positive reviews for any new movie.",1,13,37,24 December 2007
The Game," Silly, stupid and predictable
","This is one of the few comments I decided to write after reading other peoples.  Anyone who watched this film and thought the ending was a surprise or twist, my god you couldn't handle the Teletubies.The film started off ok, but about half way through I realised that things were getting silly and started not to care about the main character at all. In the end it was obvious what was going to happen, but the ridiculous idea that someone could have planned and anticipated every action that someone might take was beyond absurd to say the least.Then of course we can just fall through a window and be perfectly ok.I don't want to sound too rude, the film wasn't that bad, but to claim that it was clever and has a shock ending, is ridiculous.  The film was silly, unbelievable and very predictable.",1,20,42,26 July 1999
K-19: The Widowmaker," Well made, but the choice of story was uninteresting
","I guess my summary line says it all.  A rather uninteresting event in history, that doesn't have any particular dramatic point made into a movie.I think the film is well made, but a little over-the-top sappy.  The sub scene's are realistic enough and the portrail of a typical Russian submarine was believable.  The problem is simply the story wasn't that interesting or remarkable.Unfortunately the last 40 minutes of the film was annoying.  The director desparately trying to get some emotion and sympathy out, that wasn't really there.Next time pick a more interesting event to show.",Null,1,2,1 March 2003
Transformers," Very very bad (good fx though)
","Oh dear, really oh dear.I mean I didn't expect much; I kind of hoped it would be OK, but Jesus it was bad.Special Effects were good, I must say not exceptional, but good and lots of them. However plot, acting, plausibility, and story, pretty much anything that makes a film worthwhile was non-existent.As I couldn't give a crap about anybody in this comical tale I didn't even get through the 144 minutes, way too long. I will point out that I am not 3 years old, which of course is the intended audience demographic for this trash, so I guess I am missing the proverbial point.I might be getting old (redundant statement as we all are), but this is not a film it's a special effects extravaganza (wow I can spell that), the ridiculous comical relief scene's when they hide in the garden, shows the film makers didn't really care too much either about any plausibility.Had a couple of drinks as I am writing so my English might not be the best.Glossy, Pretty, expensive and silly, but still crap.1/10",1,4,10,24 September 2007
The Evil Dead," Classic Horror (Video nasty)
","I only read a few of the reviews here and was a bit disappointed by the negative ones.I'm only 30, but when I was 13, this was the one of a group of films to get you hands on.  Cannibal Holocaust, I Spit on your grave and other classics were classed as Video Nasties' in England.  Anyway copying and the black market supply were rife, but still The Evil Dead' was too bad for me to see.I eventually conned somebody, I forget who now, into getting it from someone I knew (wouldn't give to me directly, something about being 13, but I forget).  Anyway finally saw and was scared to death, something that never happens and unfortunately has never happened since.Ever since then I have loved this film, made with such passion, yet with so little money.  So much in your face' horror.I'm sure in this modern age, some will even laugh at this movie, but at the time, for me, it was wonderful and scary.I remember a number of people remarked on how Sam Raimi would go on to become a hugely successful director, it never happened as every other film he made was quite poor.",Null,0,1,20 January 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Pointless, meaningless, dull, boring, shock imagery, without the shock.
","As others have mentioned, it reflects the rather shallow pop culture we now live in.  Films used to have some kind of depth, some kind of meaning.  In this you couldn't care less about any of the characters.  Actually let's be honest there wasn't even a plot, just a mix of jumbled edits and formats to try and seem quirky and clever.  Surely this retro style of filmmaking has now gone out of style.  Nothing in the film was subtle or clever.  Of course there were references to other movies, but so what, does that make the movie a good one.Now even I can enjoy a brainless comedy/horror or action movie on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but this was so uninteresting, I simply couldn't get anything out of it.  Someone on this list used the summary `An adrenaline-driven coaster-ride through gratingly bold and captivating martial-arts extravaganza.'  I can only assume that the roller coaster that this gentleman was referring to, went about 1 mile an hour and had bed on it to take a nap.  When you don't care who wins, when you know the main protagonist is going to kill everyone with ease, when you realise parts of the film are just plain silly.  Where is the interest, where is the adrenaline.Strangely QT's best film, IMO, is True Romance, which he didn't direct. That had style, an unusual story, but most importantly characters you actually cared about.  All his other movies are just for the sake of it'. Let's blow someone's head off here; let's swear a lot here, some people will think it's clever.Judging by the fact films like, XXX, Shaft, Swordfish and Kill Bill are successful.  I can only assume people just want special FX, martial arts and explosions.  Is that really what people enjoy?  1/10.Go and see Leon, clever, witty, sad, violent and brilliant.  Now that's a movie.",1,12,22,30 June 2004
The Dark Knight," Too implausible and too dark, but not terrible
","For a film to be 10/10, it really has to be almost perfect. I know it's all about opinions, but to get that rating it must be technically well made, you know, entertaining, good plot, special FX, acting, realism, etc. Oh and when I say realism I don't mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy, but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules. For example the Matrix was still realistic even though people could fly (it was set in a computer so it's possible). I liked the fact TDK was serious and dark, but that is where the positives end. The plot is ludicrous, as the Joker, who is a human being, is omnipresent, clairvoyant, a great hypnotist, invincible and has no human needs. I know this is a 'comic book' movie, but when you set up a film in a normal America city, with normal physics and all that goes with it, you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events.<ul><li>The joker is beaten up, involved in car crashes, doesn't seem to sleep, yet is perfectly fine at all times</li></ul><ul><li>Has a vast amount of mindless, kamikaze, henchmen, who inexplicably do everything he says.</li></ul><ul><li>The joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in Gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once.</li></ul><ul><li>No one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter. </li></ul><ul><li>A man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time, somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery.</li></ul>In the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well. You don't care about anyone, as everything is too unrealistic. Therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10/10, almost regardless of opinion. I quite liked the filming and the mood of the film, but it has too many flaws to be considered that good.I gave it a 1/10, which is too harsh, but I felt obligated to bring down the overall rating.",1,159,394,15 October 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," A masterpiece
","I wasn't born when this film was made, but as I was growing up I remember people talking about it and most of the comments were negative, mainly people saying that they couldn't understand what was going on.Then when I was about 14 I came home one day and this film had just started on BBC2, I was stuck to the spot, I was completely enthralled by the film and found myself saying how the hell did they do that'.  Although I never really understood the ending, and maybe I wasn't meant to, but 2 hours of my life had just had a profound affect of the rest of it.I think that this was the moment that I realised there was real skill and art in film making and by using silences, music and camera angles in the right quantity at the right time can create all the atmosphere you need.I have since seen this film countless times and it still enthrals me as it more of an event than a film.  A realisation of human existence and our relationship to technology.  The special effects are still unbelievable and how they did some of the zero gravity' sequences I still don't know.  The realism of space is wonderfully realised with the movement of the craft and the silence of space (take note every sci-fi film/series).It's incredible that when you watch the poorly made 2010, how dated that looks with the poor computer effects, yet when you watch 2001 it still looks accurate and believable.Film making at it's best 10/10, certainly a classic.",10,1,3,20 July 1999
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Nice story and twist, but is too slow and too long
","Spoilers included.Obviously every since BJM arrived on the scene, everyone is now curious about anything Kaufman does. Not so long ago I saw Adaptation, which had some nice quirks, but was ultimately a boring failure. I also saw Human Nature, better than Adaptation, but nothing great (apart from the gorgeous Patricia Arquette).I heard good things about ESoaSM, so recently went to see it. It is certainly well made and the camera work, lighting and acting are all top notch. The problem I had was the story. OK the twist at the end, if you can call it that, was good and something I didn't see coming, but in between the beginning and end is a lot of fluff. Yes I got the picture Joel had a relationship with Clementine and starts to remember all the good stuff. The little sub-plot with Kirsten and her boss held some interest, but not enough for about an hour of film. I got seriously bored during the middle of the film. Are you people really interesting in seeing some sappy love story told by showing scene after scene, after scene of some personal moments.As I said I liked the beginning, I liked the twist, but there just wasn't enough to create that much interest the film, ultimately a dull and un-interesting story. 5/10.",Null,1,4,8 October 2004

Super 8," Goones 2 & really, no really, its rubbish
","This is one of those movies that comes along, where I was waiting for the punch line or the twist. I was waiting for some great leap to really explain why such cheesy, corny and really quite poor plot up to this point had been taking place. I expected some great sci-fi plot to have occurred around these events. Maybe they were all in some computer experiment, maybe the main character invents all the events in his head as a representation of reality, maybe they had all died in the train crash and this was the children's version of purgatory, but no, this was it.What a really bad, pointless, soppy movie. How on earth did it get such good commercial reviews? I am pleased to see quite a degree of what I would call genuine reviews more recently on IMDb.It's basically Goonies 2, as it would have been made in 1980, really a very bad film, avoid.We just need to get Inception down from top 10 to about top 500 and that's being generous.",3,0,2,8 September 2011
The Hurricane," Good drama, but very unbelievable.
","I watched this movie not knowing anything about the man or story before starting.  Even thought I knew nothing about the truth, the story seemed extremely biased and unbelievable.Filmmakers seem to always fall into the same trap when making a true story'.  They try and make out the hero' is an angel.  This then ruins all credibility for the film.  There were two scenes at the beginning of the film that made me immediately doubt the story:<spoiler>The scene at the beginning when a young Rubin, stabbed the man, seemed so contrived, I, immediately assumed, he actually stabbed the man, without provocation.  The scene where Rubin, allegedly jokes with the reporter, about killing white cops. I suspect he did make these remarks in a serious way.I don't know, if either of these events were as they were portrayed, but I suspect the reality was very different from what was shown.I found the first half of the film amateurish and disjointed, admittedly after that, the film improved, but still there was a large lack of believability.  The Policeman, who seemed hell bent' on making Rubin's life a misery, was totally unbelievable.  I'm sure there are bent' cops, but they was absolutely no explanation as to why he acted in the manner he did. There was a similar problem with the Canada crew', these people who seemed too nice to be true.I still found the film entertaining and reasonably well made in the second half, but please Hollywood, if your going to make a true story, make it true.",Null,11,18,6 September 2001
The Fly," Brussels, Belgium
","It was nice reading the reviews for this film as so many people picked up the real elements of this movie and not just about the horror.This movie, as most great movies, is a subtle love story, where someone realises they are a burden and maybe even a danger to them, and so make the ultimate sacrifice.Cronenberg is probably my favourite director as he is able to take unusual film idea and turn it into something intense and believable.  As he has evolved he has improved his writing and as a results the stories have become more hidden and more intelligent.I think the Fly, Deadzone and Videodrome are his best work.  His more recent films, Crash and the Naked Lunch have impressed me with his ambition and ability to try something new, but have failed as entertainment. 
I can't really put my finger on how Cronenberg is able to create the intensity and atmosphere that he does, even with very obscure subjects, but I would love to see him try some less obscure subjects and make films of the caliber of the Fly again.  Highly recommend  9/10",9,55,85,26 July 1999
Pretty Woman," Absolute pants, but....
","This film has to go in my worst films list, it's awful.Julia Roberts is (IMO) very average looking and has no sex appeal at all, but I suppose that's irrelevant as this film is directed purely at women.The whole idea is basically the same as almost every cliche 'Hollywood Romance'.  Get some hunky actor who falls for this woman, they have a bust up and then in the end after some soul searching the man sweeps her of her feet. (see Officer & a Gentleman, Dirty Dancing, etc).Obviously the idea of this story has no basis in reality, which is a shame because it would have been a great movie if it dealt with a real relationship between a prostitute and a Billionaire.But...and this is the but, it's only a movie (how can I say that) and really a pantomime story like cinderella.  The shopping scene is, of course, every woman's dream.Overall, for me and probably most men it's rubbish and a waste of film, but for a lot a women a very enjoyable fairytale.",Null,0,2,6 August 1999
Pulp Fiction," Some good acting and dialog, but very boring
","I don't want to be rude to anyone as we've all got different opinions, but, if you really watch this film it's very boring.Just like Casino, if you stuff some good actors together and come up with some interesting bizarre scenes and some unusual dialog (with no point) it doesn't make a movie.  How about having a story, a point, perhaps.This is one of the few films that actually sends me to sleep.  Take the scene with Bruce Willis.  Could that drawn out boring scene have taken any longer - Dull!!!I, Personally, go to see a movie to be entertained, shocked, moved or informed.  This movie did none of that.  Of course I'm people will say 'you just don't understand the brilliance'.  Just because someone makes an 'Arty' picture doesn't mean you have to pretend to like it even when it's boring.I suspect in the future, when all the hypes forgotten, people will ask, 'why did anyone like that film'.",2,1,5,14 July 1999

Okay, yes, I know make some more money.The opening sequence set the tone, apparently everyone is now invincible, it doesn't matter if they are thrown around, eaten or hit trees at 300 mph, everything is fine.Once you remove any semblance of reality from the story, it fails, no one cares any more, as there is no tension or surprise any more.The film focuses on very bad, cheap laughs and is very boring.Just some explosions, no story and poor humour. Simply a crap, pointless film that isn't even enjoyable in any way.Can someone explain how Vin Diesel gets a credit on this film?

Titanic," Cardboard story and cardboard acting
","Actually reading a lot of the previous reviews (lots of them) has restored my faith in humanity.I half expected to read 'best film ever' which pops up far too often for average films that hollywood rams down people's throats.This film was so poor.  I'm generally a fan of Cameron and normally his writing is very good, but the sub plot to this film was appalling.  Why did Rose, who was meant to be English played by an English actress have a bad American accent.  Why did every Englishman/woman on the boat (which incredibly was an English ship you know, not American as the film tries to push) an evil nasty character.The acting was probably the worst in film history and the love story was so silly and badly done.  All the scenes on the boat looked like Hollywood stage sets.It's very disturbing that a film like this can win Oscar recognition.  It was bad enough that Braveheart won an Oscar, but that was much better than this.Film making and hype at its worst from a normally reliable director.",1,8,16,6 August 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Weak start, but overall excellent
","I must say I'm not surprised by some of the negative mails, but I am a little disappointed.  Obviously with any sequel it's tough to produce a quality next instalment that embodies the soul and style of the original without just copying it.The original Matrix, IMO, was a masterpiece, not just for it's ground breaking effects or style, but more for the idea and depth of the story.  No matter how many times I see the film, there is always some new little snippet of dialog or image, that re-enforces the theme of the film.Now to capture that again, would be extremely difficult.  We already know about the Matrix, it is no longer a surprise.  We already know that Neo is the one' and now has less vulnerability than in the original.  To just present Neo's struggle between the real world' and the Matrix again, would be pointless.  Unfortunately this is where most of the criticism come from. Rather the same as Back to the Future, the film wasn't about time-travel, it was about the charm of the 50's.  This was completely missed in the sequels.Anyway I digress.  For me this film was excellent, the pure vision and effort that had gone into the planning of every scene and every camera angle was simply breathe-taking.  I would even go so far as saying a new milestone in action movies, the bar has been lifted once more.  Even after a poor start to the film the story started to gain pace and actually become an excellent social comment about the world, people and our perception of ourselves.  Countless references to history, human weakness and purpose. 
The most important thing, was the fact I got caught up in the movie, by the end and as a cynical 32 year old, that's rare thing.  The only downside to the film, was the rather pointless dance scene at the beginning, but I can forgive that.  Vastly superior in every way to the very average LOTR films, just disappointed that the current rating doesn't reflect what a good film this really was.Can't wait until November.",10,0,2,21 May 2003
The Fountain," Surreal and confusing
","Non-linear surreal story about immortality, life and death told in 3 time-lines.I expected to like this movie and expected a clever, passionate and deep experience to overwhelm the viewer. Unfortunately it became a rather confused and repetitive show of images and sounds, which weren't bad, but about an hour would have been enough.There is no-clear path to the film, other than the message that instead of searching for immortality, you should take the opportunity to cherish your time on this planet. If you don't, you may regret it. This film shows the longing and regret from a future perspective and a rather unusual story within a story as the main plot line.The result is a rather boring film that, at no point, really grabs the viewer, you always feel you are looking in on the periphery and waiting for the dots to be joined. However they never are.5/10  nice try, but falls short.",5,1,7,24 April 2007
A Beautiful Mind," Well acted, but poor story telling
","I watched the DVD, of A Beautiful Mind, over a week ago, as I had really made my mind up about the picture, I didn't write anything until now.  One thing I can't dismiss was the performances of Jennifer and Russell, whom I thought were both excellent.I'm not sure about Ron Howard's direction, it's hard to criticise Ron, as he is such a likeable chap and on the DVD, you hear him talk about the film with great dedication and passion.  Having said all that I feel that this was a weak presentation of a story, rather like Apollo 13, simplistic, join the dots' film making.  No real use of the camera or changes of style. Nothing in this film draws me in or surprises me, by the end of the film, you have a feeling of being let down, with the director trying to get some kind of sentimentality out, even when there isn't any naturally there.There are, of course, two fundamental problems with this film, the story itself.  A mathematician, a shy difficult genius, who suffers from Schizophrenia.  Yet he has the dedication of his wife to help him through his experiences.  The story isn't that interesting or at least it isn't presented as interesting.  The other greater problem is the lack of truth, which is a real problem for me.  The reason I see a true story' is because I really want to see the reality of the situation and what really happened, not a fictitious account.  When I read, after viewing the film, that he had homosexual affairs, whilst at school and in fact he believed he was hearing from Aliens and not from people, it adds a completely different slant on things.  Also the key point of the movie, in my opinion, was his wife's ability to stay with him.  In reality it was her that hid his problems and it was her that had him committed to an institution and the biggest contradiction was that she divorced him.In summary, well acted, but yet another Hollywood true story' that is far from true (Hurricane, The Perfect Storm, Braveheart, etc)6/10",4,1,3,18 July 2002
The Departed," Terrible second half to the film
","This film certainly wasn't as masterpiece. It was reasonably well filmed and acted, nothing exceptional though. Up to about half way through the film I thought it was very good, however the film then moved into fantasy land after that.There were so many plot holes and inconsistencies that the film became almost a parody of itself. The quite ludicrous level that the Matt Damon character was able to get away with anything just went too far. This then ruined the film.To mention a few of the problems:Why was Sullivan (Matt Damon) motivated to help Costello (Jack N) so much, risking his career, imprisonment and life. If you have a mole in the Police you would give the case to another department and not randomly nominate some rookie, who is a suspect and then give him full power over the entire team. Internal Affairs would be investigating the Police unit, searching for the mole Sullivan already had a history with Costello, surely this could have been easily discoveredYou cannot just delete someone's record from a computer (back-ups, audit trail)Why did Costigan have to meet Sullivan and arrest him 'in person', on a rooftop, which was already a crime scene.I could go on and on, but basically you get the point. All films stretch reality, but this just went too far and turned the movie into a farce by the end.5/10",5,1,6,5 January 2007
Inception," Insipid – The pointless film.
","I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get 'one over' on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here's an idea, why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible, just there's nothing really there, no substance.",1,582,1093,26 July 2010
Raging Bull," Well made, but dull
","It would be wrong to say this film is rubbish, it certainly isn't, but it's important to remember that a films purpose is to entertain, inform or move you in some way.  Unfortunately this film is devoid of all three.Like a number of films it's technically well made, the acting is fine, but the story and the characters are exceedingly uninteresting.  People say that DeNiro's performance is amazing, well, I don't know how you can say that. His character comes across as selfish paranoid psycho, with absolutely no morals and no redeeming qualities.  Yet we know he has married twice, so there must have be something people liked about him.  Unfortunately the film is too heavy on the negative side, no balance is shown to Jake's character, so the believability and ultimately the interest in the film disappears.
In fact this is rather typical of Scorsese, a very overrated Writer/Director.  I liked Taxi Driver and GoodFellas, but most of his films are actually very poor (Casino, Gangs of NY, Cape Fear).Forgettable and uninteresting, yet technically well made film.4/10.",4,35,68,13 January 2004
Vanilla Sky," Weak Twilight Zone episode spread over 2 hours
","I'd heard mainly negative criticism about this film and my expectations were low, so perhaps I could be pleasantly surprised, unfortunately not.First of all, the story is very weak.  I generally like these type of films, `Welcome to Blood City', being a great example.  Question who we are, our place in the universe and our perceptions of the world are all interesting themes.  The problem is the story is quite simplistic and is presented in an annoying disjointed manner.  I know this was done deliberately, but spread over 2 hour +, this can get very annoying.  The filmmakers really needed to make the collapse of the VR much more gradual and subtle leading up to a crescendo, but atlas it was a mixed mess.On story and presentation, maybe the film would have got a 5 or 6/10 from me.  After watching probably one of the worst actors in Hollywood (Mr Cruise, in case I needed to clarify) present one of the most obnoxious uninteresting characters I have ever seen, what's with this stupid boyish grin the whole time.  Add Penelope Cruz, who was almost as bad, then you have no believability and no chemistry whatsoever.  Jason Lee, was also very unconvincing as 'the friend' which Cruise treated like crap.  Actually Jason Lee repeated his performance in `Almost Famous', yet another poor effort from Mr Crowe.Thirdly the length of the film, shorten it for God's sake, a plot this weak, doesn't need 2+ hours to send people to sleep, it could do it in 80 minutes.It's a shame about Mr Crowe, Jerry Maguire was excellent, IMO, but I recently saw Almost Famous and Singles, both were very poor, the only redeeming feature was that Singles had the best band in the world playing on the soundtrack (Pearl Jam, which I'm sure you already knew).3/10.",3,1,3,17 September 2002
Signs," Simplistic obvious and uninteresting
","After enjoying the Sixth Sense and even though I seem to be in the minority, Unbreakable, I looked forward to latest M Night creation.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed.  Where as both Sixth Sense and Unbreakable were slow paced, they were at least intelligent leading to a conclusion that was in both cases was a surprise.  In this I knew the ending right from the moment you knew Mel's character had lost his faith.  Of course his wife's word would really mean something and everyone would live happily ever after.Further to this telegraphed, rather insultingly simplistic story was a very poorly realised Alien invasion plot.  The worst being the ludicrous manner in which they could be defeated.  If you could be killed by water I think you would have worn a raincoat.  Strangely there is moisture in the air so presumably they would have died in the atmosphere anyway.  This was even compounded further by the fact that the Aliens take Humans one at a time, all 6 billion of us.  That means you would need quite a few Aliens.Anyway as others have mentioned the main plot line for the movie was the re-discovery of Mel's faith, it's such a shame that it was presented in such a dull, uninteresting and patronising way.An indication of how bad this movie is, when I watched with others we found us all groaning out loud or putting our head in our hands at the stupidity of some of the scenes.  They were often so dull and just unintentionally silly, yet you knew the director was trying to get some meaning or tension out of them.1/10  How the mighty have fallen.",1,2,4,26 November 2002
Jojo Rabbit," Unfunny childish boring mess
","This review is based on just over half way through the film, as I walked out before seeing the rest.I am completely baffled how anyone could give this mess anything above 5, let alone 10! I mean a 10 means the film is perfect and has company like The Godfather, The Matrix or Leon? Is this film on a par with those movies? clearly, absolutely not!I assumed the 10/10 reviews were just bot generated and many look like they are, but some seem genuine. By the way IMDB, you really need to do something about this, way too many terrible films get a 10/10, especially modern releases.Right from the off of this crap fest, the childish, camp, stupid attempts at humour fail completely. The film is boring, nothing interesting happens and who cares what a child thinks about Hitler and the war. The acting is awful, the script and story are poor, why would anyone praise this film. It was pretty much universally panned, quite rightly, by the critics. Its not even accidentally funny.Nothing more to add other than this is rubbish.",1,7,29,12 February 2020
Live Free or Die Hard," Harry Potter meets Heroes.
","Yet another dreadful summer sequel So far this summer, I have seen Evan Almighty, Spiderman 3, Fantastic 4:2 and Harry Potter, all have been awful. I am going to stop going to the cinema and just watch DVD's from now on.I often wonder if directors, writers or producers even watch the originals of movies to see what ingredients actually made it successful. Die Hard worked because it stretched the truth a little, but ultimately was realistic. McClane was a just a normal cop, he wasn't a karate master, ex-green beret or body builder, just a normal New York cop. He suffered and struggled his way to get through his ordeal.Die Hard 2 was were it all went wrong. Instead of continuing on the same theme, McClane, now became Superman, impervious from bullets, fear or making mistakes. He could not fail.Die Hard 3 continued in this comical theme, but for some unknown reason I thought I would give 4 a go. For the first 20 minutes, actually it was pretty good, and then came the first stupid thing, the fire hydrant on the helicopter, stupid. OK I can overlook that one, lets get back on track, oh dear ramming a car into a concrete barrier, somehow magically causing it to hit a helicopter with pin point accuracy. At this point I wondered if I had accidentally wondered into the Harry Potter movie.I guess the overall problem is that John is part of the Heroes cast and has the same abilities as the cheerleader, somehow whatever injury he has, a couple of minutes he has made a full recovery. Needless to say the film did not improve from this moment onwards and descended into a farce. The only positive was that I thought Justin Long was pretty good as the geek, sidekick, he at least played the stereotyped role well.I gave this a 1/10, it should have been a 3, but as so many people had voted 10 !!!, I assume company executives and people connected with the movie, I think it's important to re-address the balance.Awful, please Hollywood wake up and make a good, realistic action movie. We need it !",1,54,92,30 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best of the 3, but still very average and way too long
","I have now put myself through the sometimes enjoyable, but mostly painful experience of watching these three movies.  I have to say I do think the 3rd one was the best, but lets be honest, it didn't have much competition. 
One thing is for sure, this film and the trilogy as a whole is easily the most overrated event in history.  Many films should be above this effort, in the top250.The problems: The plot, for starters, not only did it not make any sense, it was basically after 9 hours about destroying a ring and fighting a couple of battles.  All the meaningless subplots and political gesturing really didn't add to the film.The characters weren't fleshed out at all, even after 9 hours.  Could you really mention much about any of the many characters?  As a result most of the time I couldn't care less about who was doing what and why.For a film, to be a classic, surely it must have some surprises or must be original in some way and perhaps more importantly stir the juices of our soul.  All we had were some very good special FX, and some nice New Zealand scenery.  The filming was very much join-the-dots stuff, nothing novel or clever it the way it was shown to the viewer.  Do we really need to here the word `precious' again and again, do we really need to see yet another slow motion close-up of Frodo's face.  All of this made the film and films over long and lacking in any substance.",1,39,108,12 July 2004
The Matrix," At last, a movie that dares to make you think
","It was wonderfully refreshing to finally remember what it used to be like at the cinema.  After the last few years of trash that has come out of hollywood, with the same old crap storylines, but with piles of effects. At Last a movie that made me forget I was just watching a film, forget that I was even in a cinema.  For the first time since Leon, I got completely caught up in the movie, forgetting that it was just a bunch of actors going through a routine, but a well crafted, clever, original movie.  From the first scene, when I found myself going 'f**k me' I was captivated into the world of the Matrix.  I won't spoil it for anyone by talking about the plot, but only to say, if you haven't seen it..GO.  I believe this will be a milestone for future films, hopefully they won't just be copies, but will make filmmakers think about making something clever and entertaining.In summary a great film, very original, very clever special effects and wonderful fight scenes.",10,1,3,13 July 1999
Casino," Pointless, waste of talent
","Having read most of the comments about this film, I'm shocked how anyone liked it.  3 hours of a half hearted attempt to remake Goodfellas.  Lets get a bunch of very talented actors and normally good director and make a film for the sake of it.This film is so pointless, it's predictable from the start and nothing really happens.  It's all been seen before, oh and lets throw in some meaningless violence that'll make it look arty.All the scene's are well acted and even well filmed, but to what end.  The story goes no where.  It's an obvious, boring, gangster story, that's been done a thousand times before.The reason it's so disappointing is all the talent involved, surely they could have done something better than this.",1,26,60,13 July 1999
300," Passionate dark moving fairy tale
","300 The mythical story of a small amount of Spartans holding out against a vastly larger invading army. The film is presented in a dark fairy tale still, but still can be taken seriously.In style, this film is similar to Sin City, but personally I did not like Sin City as it was kind of, well, ridiculous and didn't work for me. Like Sin City the film does stretch reality, but somehow this works with the period setting and the mythical storytelling.In fact it's quite a passionate and moving film about loyalty, honour, pride and bravery against the odds that captures the imagination with stunning camera effects and sound effects. Incredible battle scenes that are literally jaw dropping.Highly recommended and very enjoyable and the best film I have seen in quite a while.9/10",9,0,5,24 April 2007
The Thin Red Line," An adult emotional drama
","To compare this film to SPR is an insult to TRL, It's like comparing McDonalds to a classy restaurant.SPR was a mainstream flick with some simple slow motions and corny dialog to appeal to the masses, which it did.TRL, isn't a traditional, movie, its art and its not going to appeal to the masses.  There's some action, but very little.  The film isn't about the gore and heroics, it's about emotion and feeling.  When you make a film you don't just plant the camera down and say act, you can use technique, back drops, music and dialog to convey the feeling of what is going on.  This film was conjuring up the emotion and mind of the viewer to think about how you could deal with a life and death situation.  Killing people, who, are as scared as you just for a piece of earth.If you've ever been in a crisis situation in your life, your thoughts and feelings aren't displayed in your face or your actions, they are in your mind.  Most people will probably think of a loved one or better times in their past.  This is what the film is trying to show, its not just showing what people are doing it's trying to show the paranoia, thoughts and feelings.  It does that through music and film sequences.
Yes, I'm sure, most of the time soldiers joked and acted stupid and didn't think about life, but this film isn't about that, this is about stirring the soul of the people in the audience, who, hopefully will never be in that situation.  Giving them a glimpse of what it would be like to be the soldier not the spectator.My only criticism is that I do think it's is slightly long, especially towards the end, which spoilt the film slightly.  Still it's much better than the normal thoughtless trash that is shown and would recommend it to most.",Null,0,1,3 August 2001
Gangs of New York," Pompous disjointed mess
","I think a lot of people are going easy on this film, as the name Scorcese appears on the credits.  People are trying to find something that clearly isn't there.In my opinion, this film has nothing going for it.  Everything about it is bad or wrong.  The acting, the script, the editing, the sets, everything.A lot of people mention DDL acting as brilliant, when in fact all he does is overact a very unbelievable character.  I don't see too much skill in that. In fact his whole character, like all the characters in this film, are very poorly developed.  In reality no one is just bad and no one is just good. DDL's one dimensional character is just portrayed as nasty.The story itself, what little is there, is a presented in such a claustrophobic manner.  None the of sets look realistic, it always feels like a studio set.  Even though I know it was made on a huge back lot. 
One theme that bothered me was this simplistic racism in the movie.  The Irish were good, the Irish liked black people, etc, where as everyone else was evil and racist.I'm sure in the time period that murder and suffering were common place, but I'm also sure compassion and caring existed to some degree, surely even in those times there was some form of law. Overall a mess of a film, it had no punch, no direction, poor acting and no real story of mention.",1,9,20,17 February 2003
Braveheart," Simple fable Â– inaccurate and racist
","I can't say I hate Braveheart, it's actually not too badly made.  The camera work is generally good, the music is excellent and the battle scenes are well done.If you accept that this is just made up Hollywood stuff for kids, good guys vs bad guys then it's ok.  The problem is, most don't and this won Oscars for Gods sake.First of all, how can anyone give this film a 10/10, the characters are black and white, good vs evil, so completely unrealistic.  The story uses historical characters that actually existed and then makes up the entire story.  Basically you have a violent thug, who somehow can speak French and Latin, who hasn't had a bath ever and he's sleeping with the future Queen of England, come on.Can you imagine the outrage if the KKK replaced the Scottish and the English were all black, the film would have been banned in a second.  Yet because it's the English that are nasty, that's ok.If I made a movie portraying Abraham Lincoln as a child molester and a wife beater, who raped and killed innocent children, then claimed it was true, received 10/10 in this site and won an Oscar as best director.  Wouldn't a few Americans find it offensive, oh no it's ok, it's just Hollywood, that's all right.I can accept that an historical Hollywood film might be inaccurate, but portraying a whole nation as evil and ugly is very offensive and moreover acknowledging it as great film is even worse.",4,5,11,6 August 2001
The Breakfast Club," It was Excellent, but know...
","I remember watching this film as I was growing up and I loved it.  It was one of the few films I like that didn't have constant action, but a clever interplay between stereotypes of my day.It's interesting now, at 28, I watched this movie again and it seems like a whiney typical American movie.  In a way a bit like the characters that appear on the Jerry Springer show.  People who try to blame their lack of successful on everything but themselves.The other thing I notice now is the obsession society has with young people. This generation of, lets be honest, pretty naive selfish people have a ridiculous amount of time and consideration devoted to them considering they're in the minority.Anyway a great theme song and an excellent movie at the age I was when I saw it.  I think the movie probably does stand the test of time for a new generation, but as an older and wiser person it has lost a lot of its appeal.8/10.",8,0,1,6 August 1999
Donnie Darko," Very unusual and original film
","First all very impressed with the pace and style of the film, very original and very hard to predict what genre of film this was.   This is what got me hooked.  The first few minutes of the film, you think this is going to be some corny teenage angst film or maybe some moral family drama.  Yet you see very quickly this is far from a healthy normal family.  The film continues like this and keeps us guessing, we are never really sure if his visions are real or in fact just figments of his imagination.<Spoilers>Obviously the story is really about the discussions that took place between the science teacher and Donnie.  If you were able to see your destiny right in front of you could you change it.  What would happen if you did as regardless of the change this would still be your destiny. 
Anyway as we find out Donnie gets pieces of future events through visits from someone in a large rabbit costume and strangely he is influenced by these visions to perform various actions, which presumably take him to his eventually destiny.  At the end of the film he realises this and decides that given the chance again, he would not allow the events to take place as they had and so allows his own death to take place.Well that's my take on it.  There's still some unanswered questions; the engine from the plane still comes from the future.  The first scene of the film hints that maybe this has happened before and this is the second time around the loop.  Also why was it the dead boy who coaxed him out of the house if indeed his destiny was to die in the accident or maybe it wasn't.<Spoilers>Anyway I dislike most Hollywood films,  as they are so predictable, join-the-dots film making.  This is very original and every time you think you've put it in the box , it breaks out of it.  Wonderful realism in the school scene's, no silly over-acting, realistic reactions from pupils and teachers.For me a genuinely original and interesting film that showed me as an old bitter, generally disappointed film watcher, that even I can get caught up in the magic once in a while.9/10",Null,1,2,10 January 2003
