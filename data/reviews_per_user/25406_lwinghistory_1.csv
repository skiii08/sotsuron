50 First Dates," Adam and Drew are Great!
","Fifty First Dates is the second teaming of Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore following their first hit The Wedding Singer; let us hope it's not the last.There's something about these two that clicks and I found that this most recent paring was just as enjoyable and enchanting as their first; perhaps even better. Sandler is charming while Barrymore is a graceful mix of innocence and beauty.The story goes something like this: Sandler is a island playboy who ends up falling in love with a local girl who has a memory problem; with each day she wakes up, she has completely forgotten what has occurred the previous day. Sandler is forced to make Barrymore fall in love with him day after day after day which is the cause of some hilarious as well as some heartwarming scenes.I really have only a few complaints with this movie, complaints that I consider really hold this movie back from being fantastic. The sub plots, which are there to provide humor, really fall flat, especially the scene with the vomiting walrus. These small glitches aside, the movie is wonderful and at the end, I even found my eyes a little misty.If you loved Sandler and Barrymore in The Wedding Singer, You may just love them even more after Fifty First Dates. Let's hope another Sandler/Barrymore project isn't too far in the future.",8,0,0,23 June 2004
