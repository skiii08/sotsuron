The Lobster," Worst Movie I've ever sat through
",Was hoping to watch something twisted with a slight sense of dark humor. Didn't laugh once during the film. Movie had no real story. So dull. Biggest waste of 2 hours. Whoever thinks this movie is golden should blind themselves.,1,0,3,19 April 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Disappointment
","There was nothing interesting about this movie. Villain was not good. Character development flopped for every single character. Storyline was just silly. Fight scenes were too messy. Not exciting to watch from the beginning. I understand Marvel's expectations now are high, but they over-hyped this movie. FYI there's no classic Peter Parker glasses, photography skills, or his job. He made a great spiderman but a horrible Peter.",5,31,51,12 July 2017
