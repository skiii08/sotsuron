10 Cloverfield Lane," it's not a sci-fi movie it's a psychological drama
",warning -s somewhat of a spoiler ahead for 80 minutes 3 people are trapped in an underground Bunker. no one knows whats going up above ground. people mood and theories swing back and forth. for 80 minutes.i actually almost fell asleep twice...at the last 10 minutes someone actually plastered and tapped a finale that makes it a 'cloverfield' movie. we finally get to see somewhat of a ? monster / flying machine ? bio-mechanical chopper ??? feels like a rip-the sci-fi community. total wast of 90 minutes of valuable time.kind of like the same feeling i felt when i watched the phantom menace.by it's own right this movie would not stand a chance at the box office...,1,20,42,12 May 2016
