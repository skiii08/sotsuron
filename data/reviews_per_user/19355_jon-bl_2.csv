Sucker Punch," This movie made feel something new...
","I don't pretend to understand the deeper messages in this movie, and sometimes I think myself lucky in that way(and at other times i just feel stupid =) ). This is one of the most depressing and sad stories, I've ever seen. The world(s) in this movie is so dark and the people so cruel! Throughout the whole thing I kept on expecting a good ending, where everything would work out - The girls would meet the guide in the 'real' world, escape to paradise and live happily ever after. But only one girl gets out, and its not even the main character/narrator! I felt so ****ing bad for Babydoll, even tho she maybe found peace in the end...I love the characters, the action, the scenes, the soundtrack(!!!!) and all the other things in the movie. Everything except the ending... It was just too cruel for me.An emotionel roller-coaster! I recommend it, but i don't think i'll ever see it again...",9,1,4,25 May 2012
Prometheus," Not worth it unless you'r an 'Alien' fan
","I didn't do my research properly before watching this movie in the cinema. I saw the trailer and thought it looked promising. I did not know it was a sequel to the Alien movies, and had i known i probably wouldn't have seen it. (I don't think the trailer made that clear to anybody, unless they knew in advance)The story was boring(as i said, i'm not an Alien-fan), sound OK, effects not original, actors not really convincing and the 'scary things' weren't scary...Maybe worth buying in three years when it's getting cheap on blue-ray/DVD...",2,18,45,31 May 2012
