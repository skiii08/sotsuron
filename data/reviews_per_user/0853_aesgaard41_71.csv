The Blair Witch Project," Not Based On A True Story !
","It was George Romero who set the standard for the stark realism in horror films, and this movie has also set more standards for creating a movie that has caused more tourists to settle upon the same sleepy little Maryland town than when Confederate troops stalked the same hills a hundred years ago. With a legend based loosely on Tennessee's Bell Witch and Rhode Island's Mercy Brown, this movie has a very simple if not slightly illogical premise: three college kids look for a ghost in the wilderness. I might have been the only one in my school to have taken such a feat and I'd bet even money that no one else would have joined me for the simple matter of having something better to do. While much of the movie's production baffles me, it does have more of a coming of age style that a horror flick; compare this with Rob Reiner's 'Stand By Me' and you know what I mean. The movie doesn't really explain what happens to the three would-be film-makers, but such a point isn't important as long as the film hits it's mark and it sure did with me. when I saw the Sci-Fi's channel's documentary-style promo for the movie, I was already interested enough in the paranormal and freaked out enough to think this movie was true, but a lot of logical thinking and lateral research to look into the case set me straight. I don't understand the people condemning this movie who criticize it for not being scary. They just prove to me just how conditioned we are as a society to violence. Everyone I talk to just about agree what in the world does a chain-wielding serial killer in a hockey mask have to do with a haunted house! A true ghost story will always tap into the primal fears of terror in the human mind while the sensationalism of gore and violence always turns into little more than a pass the time schlock. To me, The Blair Witch Project starts out as a neat little ghost story that turns scary as you worry about the sanctity of these three campers who get lost while filming a documentary in the middle of no where. Yes, a pile of rocks is not very scary if you happen to be the one who put it there, but if you and two others are the only ones for miles and you keep coming across evidence that an unseen fourth person is leaving tell tale signs of their presence, then you may be a little unnerved. Again, it's the presence of what you don't know that scares you; not the presence of what you do know. What heightens the fear factory is the suggestion the movie originally intended by filming it as if it was a true story; the aspect that this movie was based on true incidents sure had me curious, but of course we all know now that that was the filmmaker's intent. The only things I find wrong with this movie are the slip-shod editing, the shaking cameras, the swearing and the endless droning on of some of the duologue, but in its execution, The Blair Witch Project really is one of the scariest films out there for serious horror fans and it will certainly go down as a milestone in true horror entertainment in the same way as Psycho and Night of The Living Dead !",9,1,2,5 January 2001
The Avengers," Avengers Tops All Other Superhero Movies Before It
","Not since the original Superman in 1978 or even Batman in 1990 or Spiderman in 2000 has there been a comic book movie that so exploded like this one. Maybe it takes ten-year interims to produce blockbuster superhero movies; I don't know. There has never been a movie that picked up on the characters of several movies at once, least of all from the comic book/superhero genre. Loki ends up on Earth after 'Thor' and discovers the tesseract ('cosmic cube') from 'Captain America.' He decides to uses it to conquer the planet, but Nick Fury from 'Iron Man' uses it to rally 'The Hulk' and the rest of Earth's Mightiest Heroes into protecting the planet. It has more violence than 'The Dirty Dozen,' more wrecked cars than 'The Blues Brothers' and more damage than any of the James Bond films. (Insurance rates in the comic book universe must be astronomical on Manhattan.) It's exactly like watching what you would expect from a comic book brought to life or of you could get into the world of the Marvel Universe (except without the expanded universe characters like the She-Hulk and Ant-Man). The movie never gave me a moment to catch my breath or tear myself away. It is just that compelling. Filled with numerous memorable scenes (Thor battling Iron Man, Hulk batting Thor, Tony getting his suit in mid-air, Hulk smacking Loki around) and numerous quotes ('I've got an army.' – 'Yeah, well, we've got a Hulk.'), the movie and plot charge forward and never slows down. It's augmented by numerous strong performances given by an obscenely talented and gifted cast. Downey's swagger and gift for wry humor carries the incredible film as does Tom Hiddleston's Machiavellian role as Loki, one of the most complicated personalities of the Marvel Universe. Mark Ruffalo succeeds as Bruce Banner (and the Hulk!) where his predecessors could not. There is not a bad performance in the entire movie, not even from Stan Lee in his Hitchcockian traditional cameo or Jeremy Renner in this his first comic book film. (It's had to believe he's the same guy who played a slacker obsessed with drugs and alcohol in 'National Lampoon's Senior Trip.') 'The Avengers' really deserves to be called 'the greatest comic book movie ever.' The only thing that could possibly have made this movie anymore awesome would be including cameos of the cast of the 'Fantastic Four' (although Justin Timberlake would have to be the new Johnny Storm), Tobey McGuire as Spiderman, Ben Affleck as Daredevil and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. (And maybe Dean Cain, Michael Keaton and Charisma Carpenter as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman.) The only bad thing about the movie is that the DVD is totally lacking in decent bonus features, all of which are unfortunately held hostage on the Blu-Ray. What's up with that? Why am I being coerced to buy stuff I don't want?",10,1,6,30 January 2013
Changeling," Based On A Story Almost Never Told
","This is the first Angelina Jolie movie I have ever seen and the second for John Malkovich (the other being Johnny English); and the only reason I decided to see it was that it was based on a true crime story. The story is based on the barely told behind the scenes drama of the notorious real-life Chicken Coop Murders, and despite liberties and facts left out, it stays so shocking that it is hard to believe it was true. The story is that Gordon Northcott was a serial murderer and pedophile sheltered by his parents and allowed to slaughter several abducted boys, but the real-life story of Christine Collins connected to the case would not be told if her court records were not spared from destruction. To me, period pieces make the best stories, and in this one, one the crooked police make a mistake in covering up a murder investigation of Christine's son, it's a doozy. It has a cast of two big stars and several unrecognizables - although the Chief of Police looks like Michael Gross or Dan Castellaneta. The plot and script are excellent; my favorite scenes are when the dentist and teacher bust the holes in the police fraud. I mean, if the corrupt cops had just played up Walter's death, they would not have screwed themselves over to be busted down the line. The most powerful point of the story is the ending and where the players and locations are today. While this story (unlike the true story) ends with the suggestion that Walter could have lived, it remains uncertain. If this story had broke in the Fifties or Sixties, he would have been found, but now, there's probably someone out there who could be his son or daughter and not be aware of it. If anything, the case needs a modern-day forensics follow-up at the modern Northcott Ranch, wherever that is.",10,1,3,13 January 2010
Men in Black 3," MIB3 Rocks Your Mind
","I've seen the first two MIB movies; they're both excellent movies merging both action and science fiction genres with some absurdist comedy, and this third installment not only follows then with the same formula, it pole-vaults with it. First off, it's lacking Rip Torn as Zed and Frank the Pug, but their presence and legacy is still inherent in the film. A villain named Boris the Animal escapes prison on the moon with the sole purpose of taking out the man who put him there, namely Kay, but instead of the traditional vengeance plot, Boris goes back in time to stop Kay from putting him in prison in the first place. Here's where it gets sticky, somehow, Jay is the only one who knows time has been altered. In a true time travel story, Boris should have vanished into the past never to be seen again. After all, time is immutable; it can't be changed. Just as there should have been two aliens named Boris in the diverging time line, there would be another Jay in the alternate time line that Boris creates instead of Jay just experiencing a time-rip. (Can you say 'plot device,' boys and girls? I knew you could.) While a bit of accuracy would be nice, it's a small blooper in what is actually a top-notch plot. Will Smith is in top form, picking up Jay's character with ease, as does sardonic Tommy Lee Jones. Josh Brolin really pulls off an excellent temporal version of Kay in the 60s, and Emma Thompson shines as their new boss. Alice Eve is stunning as usual, but she really doesn't get much to do, and Jemaine Clement gives something to the villain that the first two movie villains didn't have, a presence and a character. Will Arnett also manages a rather brief comic cameo in one of the best gags in the movie. Definitely the best film in the series, probably because the film manages to link both Jay and Kay's pasts in a way even I didn't see coming, this is the one we've been waiting for.",10,4,9,3 April 2013
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Succeeds Over The First Hulk
","Despite the negative reviews of the first movie, I'm surprised that Hollywood gave the Hulk another chance; however, instead of picking up as a sequel, Hulk gets a reboot with a new back story retold in a flashback... or not. 'Incredible Hulk' is meant to be a reboot, but it can be felt as a sequel. Banner's dream can be construed as revised imagery, and Ross's memories can be behind the scenes details of the first movie. There are no real contradictions that this movie is anything but a sequel; Betty is still a colleague, and Bruce is still in South America. The only problem I have is the cast. Edward Norton plays Banner much like Bana, and Liv Tyler and William Hurt replace Jennifer Connelly and Sam Elliot who I much preferred in the roles. Tim Roth, however, steals all his scenes as the power-hungry Emil Blonsky more obsessed with being like Banner than being a real soldier. That's kind of where it falls apart for me; you'd think Ross would hire more qualified men with less than shaky psyche evaluations. At some point, you'd think Blonsky would realize why Banner wants to get rid of this thing. One of the highlights is Tim Blake Nelson as the puckish and affable scientist who will become the future Leader. Unfortunately, Ty Burrell gets limited scenes as Doc Samson and is pretty much only an observer to the life Tyler's Betty Ross and her complicated relationship with her father. The plot and script, however, are excellent, the action is impressive and the brief jokes and 'Easter eggs' along the way to the 'Avengers' movie are enjoyable. What the movie lacks from the strong cast of the first movie, it actually makes up for a much tighter and lighter story, even going as far as embracing the scenery and imagery of the TV Hulk series. At times, Norton even looks like Bill Bixby. What I like even more is that the CGI is a bit better that we get slow tertiary shots of the Hulk before being blasted with him in entirety, eventually exploding toward a full-on animated climactic battle between the Hulk and Roth's Abomination (now a bit more reptilian and orange) on the streets and rooftops of Harlem. An earlier showdown between the Hulk and the Army deploying high-tech weapons is one of the top scenes in the movie. The only thing that would have made this movie even better than it already is would have been including Dean Cain as Superman to scrap with the Hulk, because, let's face it, the next top thing for comic book movies should be an inter-company crossover.",9,1,1,11 September 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worth The Wait
","I don't understand the negative reviews or some of the slander on this movie. It may replace 'The Empire Strikes Back' as the weakest in the story-line, but then it may have resorted to too many computer graphically created scenes, and Jar-Jar may be an annoying character, but then so was Alf and ET after a while. There is a lot of good things in this movie such as the dizzying pod race, the first double handed light saber, Liam Neeson's contribution to the series and Natalie Portman herself. I for one had an interesting time spotting the precursors and cameos of Jabba, jawas and what not. Ewan MacGregor makes an interesting Obi-Wan considering he will have to grow up and look like sir Alec Guiness and Portman is a sight to watch as a would-be heroine creating the standard for the Leia Organa to come. All together, I think the movie was worth the wait.",10,1,4,14 June 2002
Iron Man 3," Iron Man Soars And Fails On Different Levels -
","I think it was in 'Last Action Hero' that the kid sidekick told Arnold Schwarzeneggar's movie character that by the third movie, everything is supposed to get harder, and that's very much obvious in 'Iron Man 3' because Robert Downey Jr.'s character of Tony Stark spends more time out of his suit than he did in it in both the first two movies. Once more dipping into the franchise of Marvel Comics, a terrorist named the Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley is threatening the world, and it is again up to Tony to stand up to defending the planet, only he is not going to be helped by his teammates from 'The Avengers.' Tony is assisted by Don Cheadle as War Machine aka Iron Patriot and the rest of his iron brigade that by this movie he has developed to operate by voice control. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts actually gets more to do than just scream and be a victim; she actually gets to wear the suit and become the Iron Princess. The movie and plot are rungs above the first two films with a lot more going on. Experiencing a bit of post-traumatic stress after the aliens in 'Avengers,' Tony proves he doesn't need the suit as he deals with a number of genetically enhanced assassins led by Guy Pearce who can actually burn through the suit via a genetic quirk that amped his healing factor. (Does Wolverine know this chowder-head stole his gimmick?) Watching the movie, I can't help but wonder if Tony has ever seen a zombie flick; why doesn't he just shoot these people in the head? There is no way they can regenerate brain cells. Once those things are lost, there is no coming back. Beyond that, 'Iron Man 3' is beyond exemplary, setting new standards for all superhero flicks coming up or in production and establishing that it really doesn't matter who's in the suit, just what you do with it. There are a few more deaths than usual, and several jaw-dropping moments, and Downey's quips and the fact the movie itself doesn't take itself serious make it more than appealing. My only fault with it is that Tony was going to come to Tennessee, he could have stopped by and said hello. My advice: leave the genetically enhanced assassins in California.",9,19,30,11 September 2013
The Ring," Scary But Fair
","MIGHT INCLUDE SPOILERS It's been a long time since a decent horror film with this style of plot has been created. Most horror movies today try to scare you with special effects or idiots with chainsaws. The Ring is what horror movies should be: a taut psychological thriller that builds to a fevered pitch and then lets loose with both guns. However, the movie does not know where to end. After the discovery of the well, the movie should have ended there. In fact, it might just as be best to stop the movie at the shower scene ten minutes from the end because the rest makes no scene and in fact leaves more questions. For one, not all the images in the video are explained and two, any boy who sleeps with his mother is going to grow up messed up. In all, the movie is worth a watch toward a point and then after that, you start wondering, 'What the heck was that ending about?'",8,1,2,6 August 2004
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," As Crazy As A March Hare
","I love this move. It's crazy and enjoyable and a virtual cavalcade of cartoon stars from Betty Boop to Bugs Bunny even if it neglects the existence of TV Toons like Scooby Doo. The recent live action cartton such as Space Jam and the others just don't have the spirit of Roger Rabbit. The plot involves Eddie Valiant, played by the excellant Bob Hoskins, a detective who hates toons, who once more has to enter their world as he gets involved in a murder investigation involving Jessica Rabbit, the most oversexed cartoon ever born under ink and paint. Christopher Lloyd plays the psycho judge who wants to destroy Toon Town. The plot, however, plays second fiddle to the effects, which by now are a bit dated under the computer magic of today's movies. Hopefully, the promised sequel will be all it can be. I also hope that if Warner Brothers and Disney can get together to show their big toon stars together than it will inspire Marvel and DC Comics to put their best heroes together in a live action extravaganza.",8,0,0,2 January 2004
Meet the Parents," Not As Funny As You Think
","I never gave a second thought about seeing this movie until I caved in a bought a copy of it for the heck of it. I thought of it as a curiosity, but I had to know if it was as funny as everyone said it was (which it isn't, the one reason why I will never see Something About Mary). I just don't think it's funny to watch Ben Stiller struggle through a weekend trying to get along with his parents as the movie and the script have already made it impossible for him to do so. Robert DeNiro is one of my favorite actors. He is a very likeable guy even playing a hard-nosed father-in-law. He does a very good job doing comedy, I'd like to see him do it a lot more, but the movie just isn't as funny as everyone thinks it is. DeNiro and the cat steal all the best scenes, and Stiller almost comes off as a comedy partner, but this movie doesn't really live up to its hype.",8,0,0,13 July 2001
This Is the End," Raunchy Comedy Wrapped In A Cool Candy Coating Shell
","First off, take Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, James Franco, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill and Danny McBride, put them in another god-awful CGI-laden disaster flick full of celebrity cameos, such as Emma Watson and Michael Cera, toss in twenty times more than the allowed profanity, sexual references and drug references than should be allowed in any movie out of Hollywood (but then this movie was written by Seth Rogen, whose brain is already wired a little weird) and a mild smattering of religion, and then you get a good idea of what 'This Is The End' is all about. Now, as bad as that idea sounds, this movie is actually a lot better than you'd think. James Franco has a party at his new fortress-like house for his celebrity friends while Seth and Jay make a food run and experience a paranormal event as most of humanity is beamed up into the afterlife. Returning to the house, they experience earthquakes as people vanish into the earth. There's some light gore and some dark sadistic dialogue and violence, but the movie moves along so smoothly and rapidly that one quickly gets out of it. Seth and the main cast start speculating that it might be the Apocalypse, probably the most religious stuff in any Seth Rogen (or James Franco or Danny McBride) movie ever. After they plan for what might be a long wait, things take a turn for the worst. McBride reverts to character and immediately eats up all their supplies and is exiled from the house. Emma Watson comes by looking for help but is quickly offended and robs them blind. The in-fighting causes Jonah Hill to make a deal with the devil, and he gets possessed. Franco turns out to be hiding food, and the resulting fight between Rogen's Brat Pack ends up in the destruction of the house. This is not just another one of Rogen's drunk buddy comedies or another offensive drug-laden sex fantasy. There is actually some serious character moments and real comedy in this movie as well as some positive messages in this film, and unlike 'Left Behind' with Nicolas Cage, it's not overtly preachy. Despite the stupid premise, it's done straight and logical, something you don't see in Seth Rogen movies, with some honest and decent performances and it ends with an awesome message. Dealing with demons and sin on every side, Rogen, Franco and Baruchel are the only ones left after Robinson gives his life to save them, if but only to run into McBride in ultimate douche-bag mode 'Road Warrior' style and a giant Satan stomping all over what's left of Los Angeles, although, if I was writing this movie, I would have brought Emma Watson back fifty-feet tall and completely insane instead in place of the Devil, mostly because that's something I'd want to see.",9,2,6,17 August 2015
Shaun of the Dead," Best Horror Comedy in Years
","This is the much funnier and enjoyable comedic version of Night of the Living Dead I'd have created years ago, just far more British. It has several references to the original NOTLD movie and a lot of non-familiar British references. (Do the English really talk like that?) Simon Pegg is a likable loser and his best friend Nick Frost is a likable idiot. Together, they're an incredible comedy team, making this a definite cult classic. I love the recurring gags and the predictable foreshadowing instances plus the character motivations, like Simon fretting and reacting as Nick tosses his prized record collection. A lot of it really is common sense in the face of confusion as well as taking the most difficult way to a solution, the way people really act, and that's what makes this movie in so many ways than one.",10,1,3,8 May 2008
The Others," Not Made Like This Anymore
","There has not been a decent horror movie like this one done in years. Today, horror movies have been replaced with splatter, blood and gore, redundant scenes of sex and nudity and million dollar special effects. This movie goes back to when you hid behind the comfort of your fingers over your eyes. It's done practically in the style of M. Night Shyamalan; it's taut, dark, riveting and has a thick atmospheric style with a touch of the macabre. Nicole Kidman gives an Academy Award performance as does Fionnula Flanagan who I have not seen since the 'Legend of Lizzie Borden.' I was expecting a simple end, but then it went one step further than my expectations. The excellent flawless score enhances the emotional state of the characters. All I can say is it's about time a horror movie was made that reflected the intelligence of its actors and creators and not the idiocy of tarnishing the intelligence of the audience.",10,1,2,4 April 2005
Troy," All Fluff and Grandeur
","I waited a long while to see Troy expecting it to be worth the wait. It's too expensive to see at the theaters and too expensive as a DVD, but quickly nabbed up as a previously viewed DVD at my rental place. Truth be told, I could have waited longer. A massive amount of creative license went into this movie. It is a highly stylish and visually stunning movie with epic written over it, but that's all it has. The inaccuracies and contradictions are enough to make you cringe. Wolfgang Petersen's attempt to create a historically factual film without the fantasy ingredients is noble, but if you want a full story of the Trojan War, you need to include Protesilaus, Penthesilia and the Amazons, Philoctetes, Diomedes, Cassandra, Pyrrhus, Aeneas, Anchises, Hecuba, Scamander, Astyanax, Oenone, Lycus, Idomeneus and a host of other major characters. There's too much talk of legacies and glories and a vague overview of missing incidents that were dropped from the screen play. The war lasted ten years, not a month. As far as the cast, Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom provide fair and noble performances, but Achilles is played by Brad Pitt as a restrained pretty-boy psycho with Hitler tendencies rather than the noble warrior he was. Peter O'Toole, an Irishman, a Celt, enemy of the Romans, plays Priam; Zeus must be loving that! Brian Cox seems miscast as Agamemnon and portrays him with the same personality of all his other movie roles. Lastly, I have a lot of offense with Diane Kruger playing Helen; she looks more like a movie star than a princess. Sienna Guillory from 'Helen of Troy' with her more natural beauty would have been a better cast choice. 'Troy' is pretty much all grandeur, but it lacks the romance of 'Helen of Troy' and the spirit of 'Odysseus' with Armand Assante. Once someone merges the best ingredients and cast choices of those movies, then and only then will we see a truly great Trojan War story!",8,0,1,4 April 2005
Dead Poets Society," Recommended for High School Kids?
","As a substitute teacher, this is the one movie which a lot of teachers seem to leave for their kids in their absence. While I'm not a big fan of 'highly rated' movies, this movie does have a lot of appeal and a knack for anyone to want to re-read the classics. The only role I liked was Robin Williams as the maniac professor who actually gets through to his students while Kurtwood Smith (' Last of the Dogmen,,') plays a father a bit too close to my dad as if he's getting ready for his TV role on 'That 70s Show.'",8,0,2,25 January 2001
X-Men," Comic Book Characters Come to Life
","Bruce Wayne Vocal Diary:'Having just seen the X-Men movie, I feel as if I have a deeper understanding of these controversial public figures and their dangerous terrorist antagonists. Couldn't get Professor X's opinion on the movie fictionalized from their battle with peace, bigotry and equal rights, but needless to say, some of the actors used aren't very flattering to the actual members as I know them. Per se, Halle Berry- she's a very beautiful actress but the real Storm is a little exotic looking, kind of like Vanessa Williams. I suppose it's the African blood. The only actress I know who comes close to the beautiful Jean Grey is Nicole Kidman, and Rogue is flattered by Anne Paquin's portrayal, but the Rogue I know looks more like a cross between Brooke Shields and Carmen Electra. Toad and Mystique are a lot more sinister looking in the movie than their truer counterparts, but the Mystique I know isn't quite that sexy. Otherwise, the similarities are rather precise. There I go rambling,,,but then I'm still irked at those Val Kilmer and George Clooney movies.  Continuing,,,, the movie is a very dark and sometimes light-hearted adventure somewhat patterned after the style of the recent Batman films of recent so I'm sure they'll be some sort of sequel. This Bryan Singer seems to display the same artful repertoire of Joel Schumacher and Tim Burton. The violence is played down for a more action feel,,,,,I wonder how the video store clerks are going to label this movie,,,action? fantasy? The masses who go to these movies have predominantly declared views that are mixed on the exemplary special effects and the less than satisfactory script. The true stars of the movie are the costumes and less so the actors in them; the television's 'Flash' and 'Lois and Clark' being good examples of when the costumes carry the entertainment. Still,the movie is a big departure from when all heroes wore spandex. That Adam West television show still gives me nightmares to this day; yet,the Hulk still speaks fondly of Lou Ferrigno. The movie fortunately has a very realistic feel unlike the campy atmosphere seen in the Generation X television pilot and the Spiderman television series. Memo: Remind Alfred to pick up copy of X-Men VHS as soon as it is available.'",10,1,2,11 December 2000
Cloverfield," Over-Hyped and Under-Appreciated
","For me, Cloverfield is a good movie, but it's just not scary to me. It was best by fast-forwarding through the monster scenes and watching the character sequences. The special effects are really well done, but a real creature at the size depicted would have collapsed under its weight. The movie itself has a very 'Blair Witch Project' feel where you follow the characters, but you're not allowed to learn anything or are you allowed to learn anything. The brief scenes of the creature (or creatures?) is something like a bald ape, frog, grasshopper and tick; it's never seen in full form and that's what makes it really annoying. There's a lot of overdone devastation, but not enough plot. I'm just not terribly impressed by it.",2,1,2,18 December 2009
Sleepy Hollow," Go to Sleepy Hollow,but stay out of the woods!

I'd love to see a sequel.Aaaaaah,I can see it now:the horseman running loose in the Twentieth-century with very modern-day police pursuing him Cops-style in turbo-charged cars and still not being able to stop him.

Sleepy Hollow," A Masterpeice in my Mind
","I have seen the Jeff Goldblum/Meg Tilly version of the Sleepy Hollow story and it looks like a high school play compared to this one.Burton's direction and style convinces me that I've been trapped in the story itself.The imagery,the sets,the style and the costuming all convinces me that I were almost thrust back into time.Although,this movie does remind me of Allison Hayes in 'The Undead' for the way Ricci's and Lisa Marie's breasts look as if they are about to explode from their bodices.Played against Irving's original story,but then even the Goldblum movie took its own liberties,this movie is a murder mystery wrapped in a ghost movie and a horror movie wrapped in an action film.The stagecoach flight-and-fight had me on the edge of my seat.I don't get the critics bashing Ricci for her accent in this movie; she does play with a limited range but who wants to nit-pick in a movie of this size,scope and magnitude.I give it ten stars!",10,0,0,11 November 2000
Scary Movie 2," They've Done It Again
","This movie is in the same boat with Scary Movie 1. It has the bad jokes out-numbering the good ones, some missing jokes they could have done but didn't and some jokes that lasted too long (the scene with the basketball). The sex jokes are seemingly toned down as are the body fluid jokes, but then they must have used up most of them in the first movie. The Excorcist/Amityville Horror spoof at the top of the movie was funny, almost a rip-off from Repossessed with Linda Blair, but it may have done a lot more damage to the Catholic church than the series Dave Allen at Large. Anna Faris is as cute as always, but she is embarrassing herself in some of the scenes. Calling her animal fighting moves for one and in her spoof of the cat fight scene from the Legend of Hell House are two examples. Kathleen Robertson is an obvious sexpot, but Tori Spelling ruins every scene she is in. Annoyingly grating as a middle-aged college student, she just doesn't belong in this movie. Regina Hall, Shawn and Marlon Wayans steal every scene they are in, and Chris Elliott and Tim Curry show the more tolerable range of their talents. The disability jokes between Elliott and David Cross are a bit tactless and tasteless and Chris Masterson is funny to watch in this full feature away from his role as a Malcom in the Middle second stringer. For me, the ghost effects are superb even if some of the simulated phenomenon was too over the top. I am definitely waiting for a Scary Movie 3; I only wish I could star in it too !",10,0,3,9 July 2001
Megamind," Mega (Blows My) Mind
","Okay, I've said it before, Will Ferrell is grossly over-hyped as a comedic genius when virtually every character he has ever played is actually a thinly-veiled clone of the last character he played; so when a role comes around with some actual character meat on it for him to play something other than the world's biggest idiot who lucks into likability by doing absolutely nothing, he actually starts to prove he just might be actually capable of doing some real comedy. That role is 'Megamind,' a blue-skinned large fore-headed alien sent to Earth and raised by prison inmates at the same time the last son of a rival planet is raised by wealthy parents. It's not much of a superhero movie in as much as it actually attacks and turns the whole 'superhero' mythos (particularly the Superman archetype) on its ear, analyzing it and taking it to both some logical and absurd conclusions. Along the way, the laughs come from character personalities and the absurdity of trying to be a costumed crime-fighter. Will Ferrell actually does very well voicing Megamind as a under-appreciated genius looking for acceptance in attacking the one person holding him back, namely Metro-Man, voiced by the very excellent Brad Pitt, getting a chance to really over-act and pump out some bravado, but still maintaining his humility. Tina Fey is equally excellent as the hero's lady sidekick unsure where she fits in his life, and David Cross, yes, Tobias from 'Arrested Development,' provides the voice of the cynical fish in a bowl on the robotic gorilla body as well as a lot of the humor and the voice of reason in the movie as Megamind's opinionated conscience. It really is an excellent movie, even with Will Ferrell in it, and the animation is superb. The only thing that would have made it better would have been some stinking Special Features on the DVD.",9,1,2,3 April 2013
Horrible Bosses," Horribly Entertaining
","It's not often that an actor like Jason Bateman succeeds in both the small screen and the big screen. TV stars don't always make good movie stars, and movie stars can often be constrained by the limits of TV to really showcase their talents. In 'Horrible Bosses,' Jason basically plays Michael Bluth, his character from 'Arrested Development,' but in this incarnation, he's trapped in employment limbo and being kept from a raise and position in his company that he knows he deserves and that his boss wants to keep him from in order to keep him in servitude. Kevin Spacey plays his power-hungry boss and seems to be having fun in the tyrannical role portraying a sadist who delights in the misery of others just for the delight of being mean and nasty. Bateman is joined by Jason Sudekis and Charlie Day as his wildly irreverent friends. Jennifer Aniston is barely recognizable as the sex-crazed dentist, but she's still smoking hot as she goes through oozing sex. Colin Farrell is also altered to fit his character, but he is still recognizable as the Irish miscreant seen in so many of his movies. In this broad remake of 'Strangers On A Train,' Bateman, Sudekis and Day conspire to kill off each other's employers, advised by Jaime Fox whose character is not quite the criminal they believe he is. The best part of the movie is that the guys finally get the solutions to their problems, but not by actually murdering anyone, but by just sheer dumb luck and improbable situations that could only happen in the movie universe. This dark comedy has a great script, funny lines, enjoyable characters and a satisfactory conclusion that opens itself to new revelations. That's what makes the movie for me, setting up the stage to wonder what happens next without necessarily suggesting a sequel.",8,0,1,13 November 2012
The Polar Express," Definite Christmas Classic
","This is the movie that started off the whole thing with mixing CGI animation with motion capture software, and it's still at the top of the CGI movie totem pole. After all these years, the effects and imagery still blows me away. Employing a mix of real world physics and the unique properties of a cartoon universe, the movie shows us the scale and details of what looks like a real train, but at no time is anyone ever at risk of danger. The train slides around and crashes through ice, but it also careens down mountains at top speeds without getting swept off the train tracks. Another thing, frequently the distances and horizons keep shifting, and this is exceptionally obvious on the frozen lake whose size we see on arrival, but as the Polar Express speeds back to the tracks, the horizon keeps popping back from getting closer to much further away. I also noticed the train length and number of train cars keeps varying, and that Santa's North Pole village seems much larger than its population seems to require. They're small bloopers for a movie whose whole purpose is to stun and stir awe in the watcher. The story is simple and sweet: a boy travels to meet Santa at the North Pole and get a secret tour with two other children. It's remarkable and utterly magical, but still, I can't help but want to add in the mythology of the 'Santa Clause' movies with Tim Allen. Maybe everything we're seeing is under the ice as in that movie and this Santa is the man in the suit before Tim Allen. Wouldn't that be cool? It's a good movie that stimulates our imagination, and 'The Polar Express' is definitely a good movie, ranking in the top ten of my favorite holiday movies with 'A Christmas Story,' 'Miracle on 34th Street,' 'Harry Potter,' 'Scrooge' and 'The Shining.'",10,1,4,30 January 2013
Tangled," Rapunzel Goes Disney
","What can I say about 'Tangled' that has not been said before about every other Disney movie before it. Like every fairy tale before it, liberties were taken with the original tale to expand it into a movie, the animation is breath taking, the actors and characters are excellent and it has its own morality tale behind it as usual. The songs are memorable but not as infectious as anything from say 'Aladdin' or 'The Little Mermaid' and much like Ariel and Jasmine, Rapunzel has a certain buried sexuality about her when she's not bouncing around like a Disney Channel pop star on soda and candy bars. The characterizations and mannerisms are fun to watch of course; at times, you forget these are animated characters. You can really see the efforts the animators made to have these characters move, react and respond like living people. The best parts mostly surround the character of Rider with the horse Maximilian and how Rapunzel reacts with her color-changing chameleon. I watched the movie because I like to see how far the animation is coming, and Rapunzel's ridiculous long tresses look perfect, but the story itself is just as much fun to watch.",9,3,6,3 April 2013
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Knocked Me Out Of My Seat !
","I never believed in the slander of 'The Phantom Menace,' but this movie really brings me back to the sheer awe-struck excitement of the others. You can tell things are getting closer to the events in 'Star Wars' as Boba Fett appears, the first designs of the storm trooper armor, the introduction of already familiar characters and other details. Other things made this movie for me such as sexy Natale Portman suddenly going 'Britney' and totally digital Yoda going bad-a** with a light saber on Count Dracula himself, Christopher Lee. Why couldn't we see a scene like this in the old Hammer films. Lee as you recall was first choice to play Darth Vader, but he turned it down. His awaited appearance in the series has become a milestone. There is also an anti-smoking message in this movie that millions of people ought to notice. The movie is still full of spectacular effects and insights to this universe that will drive the fans wild. I give this movie a ten for making me feel like a kid again !",10,0,2,14 June 2002
Forrest Gump," Idiot Savante or Lucky Jinx ?
","Forrest Gump is a wonderfully magical and enduring film of nostalgia through the eyes of one man who is so beat up inside that he doesn't mind getting rained on. Almost everyone he has ever met or known ends up with a fortune of bad luck (Elvis, Lennon, his mom, Bubba, the Kennedys, Wallace,,) as he further goes on granting good luck on others by creating or contributing to Elvis's movements, mooning, smiley faces, jogging, Watergate, Lennon's lyrics and the Chinese peace movement. The altering of the old footage was so masterfully done and the incorporating of historical and social events almost convinces you that Forrest Gump was a real person. There is a message behind this movie that suggests that we only gain personal fulfillment through  trying to improve the lifestyles of the others on this planet. This is a movie meant to be watched over and over.",10,1,2,9 January 2001
Man of Steel," A Reboot Too Far
","When Christopher Reeve first brought Superman to life in the movies, he didn't just create a movie; he established both a precedent and an ultimate prototype for all following live-action comic book movies to follow. 'Superman' was an awesome movie that merged a great script with talented actors, an incredible musical score that inspired awe and wonder and an excellent plot masterfully plotted by the great Richard Donner. This prototype has served Hollywood well in all other comic book movies to come, from 1990s 'Batman' with Michael Keaton under the helm of Tim Burton to the maestro of Sam Raimi's 'Spiderman' with Tobey McGuire. However, Zach Snyder's 'Man Of Steel' falls somewhere between Andrew Garfield as Spiderman and Ben Affleck as Daredevil. It's loud, it's obnoxious, it's more overblown than 'Avatar,' and it takes incredible liberties with a story that didn't need rebooting. It's a paranoid UFO-nut's nightmare come true. It has all the ingredients of a bad extra-terrestrial invasion movie amped up on a huge budget with Henry Cavil as Superman barely staying afloat in a plot that has more pointless violence, bizarre Christ imagery and destruction than a Michael Bay movie. Cavill looks good as Superman, much better than Brandon Routh from 'Superman Returns,' but the costume redesign stinks. What were they thinking moving away from the iconic red and blue uniform immortalized in the comics? Amy Adams is okay, making the best of her scenes, but Russell Crowe basically phones in his scenes with much less presence than Marlon Brando. I mean, he might as well be rolled through his scenes on a barcolounger by a couple of stage grips; it's that tedious. Kevin Costner is woefully under-used, relegated to a nearly endless stream of flashbacks that delegate him to the position of 'extra' like a poor man's Louis Nye. Michael Shannon on the other hand dominates the film much like Willem DaFoe in 'Spiderman' or Jack Nicholson as the Joker in 'Batman.' Ranting and raving like Hitler on crack; in some scenes, he sometimes almost looks exactly like Nicholson in 'The Shining.' Where the movie fails me, though, is the endless over-used CGI scenes of Metropolis and Smallville getting destroyed as Superman and the Phantom Zone villains crash, bang, bounce, ricochet and careen through buildings and personal property like the Hulk in a china shop, and then there's the annoying detracting details about Kryptonian relics and artifacts and memories which don't add anything to the movie but make it that much more insufferable, and let's not forget to mention the horrible DVD package with one DVD that has no bonus features and a second non-playable Blue-Ray waste of time that plays in. nothing!!!! Overall, 'Man of Steel' reminds me of a German opera, over-blown and full of unnecessary exposition. It's 'Superman Returns' on acid",2,3,7,17 August 2015
Little Miss Sunshine," Very Wonderful Comedy
","I actually liked this movie. I knew it was something unique by the previews, but once I saw it on DVD, I watched again and again, about three times in one day. It has a good cast, and in fact, I like Steve Carell a lot for this movie than anything else he's ever done. There is a lot in common with our characters; we're both pathetic. Abigail Breslin is adorably cute and funny with the greatest sense of lungs; she can scream so long and so loud. The plot has a lot in common with 'National Lampoon's: Vacation' inasmuch as both movies depict a long journey with an embarrassing vehicle and end up with a dead body and an unsatisfied end. However, in this one, it's more about five characters in search of self-discovery and that's where the movie shines.",6,0,1,18 December 2009
Knowing," Better Off Not Knowing -
","I like Nicolas Cage. I liked his movies 'National Treasure' and 'Ghost Rider,' but I'm not sure how I feel about this one. It's a creepy story involving a seemingly random series of numbers that predict tragedies, and that is about as far it should have gone because the rest of it goes where no movie should go. The numbers were transcribed by a psychic young girl and placed in a letter in a time capsule. Cage somehow inexplicably discovers the numbers predict disasters, and immediately one realizes, 'He's got too much time on his hands.' But then individuals who may or may not be from the government take an interest in his deaf son who is now 'hearing' the voices that the young girl in the Fifties heard. Just when you think you have this movie figured out, it throws you for a loop and then you hope to God you're wrong. I'm sorry, but I'm not a fan of disaster movies where the whole cast gets killed off. Bottom line: 'The Knowing' is like a highly cerebral serial killer movie powered by the cosmic energies of the universe and a very disturbing plot. If you are a highly neurotic person, I would not watch this movie. I saw it, and I'm still disturbed by it.",4,2,4,30 January 2013
The Shining," Vintage King
","First off, I have to say the obvious. Jack Nicholson is an excellant actor and Stanley Kubrick is an incredible director, but this movie is actually a hodgepodge of confusing clues and vague images that doesn't make much sense. Kudos do have to go to the masterful and artful creation of the chilling images, the female twins with the huge foreheads for one, but at it's core, this movie is actually one very chilling ghost story set in a haunted hotel that turns into a giant sensory deprivation tank for the hapless couple and child trapped in it. The blood and gore plot is unnecessary except as a way to establish the increasing intensity of the script. The real star of this movie is the hotel itself with its vast rooms and endless halls; I for one would love to visit this hotel and look for ghosts if it trully existed. I hold these set as a standard for ever large looming edifice in almost every haunted house movie I have ever seen. The movie is weakened by a confusing back story and phony history that doesn't make sense. Too much was left out of the original King material to explain why the place is haunted and why it centers on Jack much less his son.",10,0,0,22 October 2001
Spider-Man," Amazing And Spectacular
","It was a long time coming, but the long overdue Spiderman movie just may be a success. The plot is not what I expected, though, I pictured something a bit more darker and set closer to the real world as the first Batman movie. The film sets up Peter as the comic book did, as a social outcast constantly demeaned and embarrassed by his peers. Do we need to be reminded of how horrible high school was for all of us ? the origins could have been summed up in a few flashback sequences in a dream. As it is, the movie has a long set-up and once it gets started, it becomes a bit dizzying from the acrobatic sequences, but the viewer does get used to them. The computer imaging seamlessly works excellantly that soon it becomes hard to tell what is done real and what was done on computer. Tobey McGuire does a great job playing Peter, but his Spiderman is a little distant, not so much on the wise-cracking hero from the comics. Kirsten Dunst is titillating as MJ Watson (personally, I saw Kate Winslet in the role), but she does provide more substance and character than seen in the comics. Willem DaFoe out-Jokers Nicholson as the Green Goblin and out-Psychos Anthony Perkins as Norman Osborn. James Franco also gives a wonderful performance as does Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris (I thought Aunt May looked more like Cheers' Frances Sternhagen). Kudos to JK Simmons for actually looking like JJJ and giving the role a comic edge. The direction is excellant and the photography is superb. This movies deserves nothing less than a ten from anyone who has never seen the comic.",10,0,0,10 May 2002
Ratatouille," It's A Mouse Life...
","I really loved this film. Like all the Pixar films, it has that rather slick Disney feel where ten to fifteen minutes in you get so used to the computer generation that you forget its computer-generated and start trying to identify the celebrity voices; John Ratzenberger is always a given. The movie is about a rat who goes to Paris to experience fine dining after getting tired of scraps and then trying to extend his culinary knowledge to an inept and skill-less innocent. The humor, especially where it involves the rat world to the human world is hilarious, particularly where they take the health inspector hostage. Overall, it's a great children's movie with all the niceties to attract it to adults as well.",9,0,1,18 December 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man," Amazing Chemistry - Lousy Superheroics
","You just can't review this movie without comparing it the to Tobey McGuire-Sam Raimi trilogy that gave birth to it. Sam Raimi already created the special effects and style that helped make Spiderman a movie character so it wasn't that hard for someone else to come in and slide on the work already done there. What I don't like about the new movie is that Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is a young jerk. I really don't see Peter Parker stealing a security badge, sneaking into a secure scientific lab, antagonizing Flash Thompson, alienating his Uncle Ben nor mocking a car thief. If anything, Garfield's Spiderman like Christian Bale's Batman talks too much. The best part of the first movies was its believability, something that was sort of missing in the third movie and is definitely missing in this installment. (The scene with Peter discovering his superhuman strength is nothing but slapstick and looks out of place with the rest of the movie.) Now let's get to the new suit. It looks horrible!! I had a hard time accepting Tobey's Peter could create the costume he wore, and I have an even harder time accepting the new costume (much less that Garfield's Peter could even get the material!). It just looks horrible! In the dark, the red and blue colors run together and look purple. Even worse, Garfield looks horrible in it. The first bright version had a muscular body suit under it; the new version has nothing. About the only thing this movie has is better chemistry between its stars. I really had a hard time buying Kirsten Dunst as a high school kid, but Emma Stone really sparkles as Gwen Stacy and really blows the former 'Interview With a Vampire' actress out of the water. That's basically where 'Amazing Spiderman' (Spiderman 4?) works best. The story between Peter and Gwen takes center stage, but Rhys Ifan, possibly best known as Captain Hook from the Peter Pan prequel, works well too; his right arm is digitally removed with the same technology that removed Gary Sinise's legs in 'Forrest Gump.' The problem is the villain's story as the subplot takes up too much screen time. It was handled great in the first two movies, overdone in the third movie and extremely noticeable in this movie. It just takes too long getting into the plot. What bothers me most is the unnecessary reboot to Peter's origin. Do we really need to make Peter that much more tragic by over-emphasizing the reasons why he was left with Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I have nothing again Martin Sheen or Sally Field in the roles, in fact, they share just about the same amount of wonderful chemistry as Garfield and Stone, but there's too much exposition here to a movie where we already know who the characters are. I also can't stand the fact that the movie is a reboot; re-inventing his origin and chopping out whole chunks of it, and what's this thing about the mystery of his past? What mystery? He was left with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. End of mystery. Bottom line: Amazing Spiderman is passable, but Sam Raimi with his familiarity to the subject already pulled it off, and we've seen it before. We've seen everything before. The only new thing is the chemistry between Garfield and Stone, but is that all it takes to make us believe this movie is superior to all the hard work Sam Raimi already did? The hard work was already done; this movie is just sliding forward on the momentum. Take this movie back in time to BEFORE Spider-Man 1 and then I'll say it outdoes the original, but then, that would make the original not so original, wouldn't it?",3,5,11,30 January 2013
Captain America: Civil War," Awesome Movie - Wrong Spider-Man
","It is no understatement that comic book movies nowadays are really kicking out and breaking boundaries in theaters these days. Since Christopher Reeve made you believe a man can fly, Tim Burton has made Batman relevant again (before getting embarrassed by Joel Schumacher and rebooted by Christopher Nolan), and Sam Raimi has brought to life what is possibly the most definite Spider-Man movie ever. Where the 'Captain America' movie series has succeeded is by basing its movies on successful espionage stories. 'Winter Soldier' was based on the book, 'The Manchurian Candidate' and this one owes a great debt to 'The Odessa File.' After the Avengers unwittingly cause an international incident, U.S. Intelligence decides it's time to restrict their activities, but Cap meanwhile tries to defend Bucky who has been framed for an assassination. Their different opinions split the Avengers in half that culminates in the top scene in the movie, a clash of all the characters from the last several MCU movies excluding Thor and the Hulk while including Black Panther and Spider-Man, making this a super- sized 'Avengers' movie that thankfully doesn't get bogged down by the excessive characters. However, where the movie makes its fatal flaw is by not picking up from the Sam Raimi 'Spider-Man' trilogy and instead inserting yet another rebooted Spider-Man with a young and hot Aunt May. Even without Tobey McGuire, it should have cast a new actor to pick up where Raimi left off with his version of the character, bringing those movies into the MCU while ignoring the ridiculous Marc Webb DC Universe version of the character. That snafu aside, 'Captain America: Civil War' is awesome and spectacular; upping the ante on the previous Marvel movies. I can't wait to see where they go next.",9,2,5,23 October 2016
The Little Mermaid," Enchanting Myth Movie
","I'm a big mythology buff, and there is enough to hold my interest in this movie.I have to also leave it Disney to make a movie that both child and adult. Ariel has the cartoonish qualities that makes little girls want to be her, and a bit of Marilyn Monroe-like sexual innocence that attracts male fans. For mythology buffs, the figure of Triton, son of Poseidon, has been inserted along with several outlandishly named daughters from the sea-god's numerous wives. Even Ursula from a long line of successful Disney villains seems to fit in. While Scylla or Thetis might have fit it, Ursula could have easily come from the pantheon of Russian sea witches. At times in the movie though, it almost forgets it's underwater as these figures talk and move with little or no distubance, but the weightless look of the figures from odd angles augments the look at other times. I also love the repeated images that give homage to Denmark's Little Mermaid statue. The voice to role comparison also is excellant and Jodi Benson excells in her songs. This movie produced a great soundtrack and a great retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen tale by simultaneosly updating the myths of the Greeks.",10,8,10,5 September 2001
JFK," Look to the Grassy Knoll
","To think, that it took a movie like this to bring to the consciousness of America all the suspicious facts and mysteries of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Next to Jack the Ripper, this is one of several incidents that many time travel stories seem to head to, but would we really find Oswald in the window, or a team of shooters ? This is the best of Kevin Costner's movies. It has a stellar cast of recognizable actors and it made Gary Oldham a star. I could delve further here into the discrepancies and errors of the Warren Report here, but this is not the place.Even if we could find the man who really pointed the gun who killed Kennedy, what could we do now about it ? Dig him up and give him life ?",10,2,14,4 April 2001
Frozen," A New Generation of Disney Movies Is Born
","Have you ever been around a movie that everyone liked and whose endorsements and promotions were exploding everywhere, yet you were reticent to go see at the theater. That was me in the 90s when 'Aladdin' came out; I didn't actually see it until several months after it came out on DVD and left the New Releases wall for the regular movies of the rental place. After I saw it, I thought it was one of the best movies I had ever seen and was quoting and singing the songs afterward. Same thing happened with 'Frozen.' I didn't rent this until long after it was no longer a New Release, and I have to admit, it really is infectious without being obnoxious (Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast'). It's a modern fairy tale loosely based on Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Snow Queen' about the sisters Anna and Elsa, who seems to have a mystical ability to create ice. When Elsa's power is discovered after keeping it secret for years, she flees her home and creates an ice palace in the mountains, unaware the snow storms left in her wake are destroying the land. The songs are unavoidably memorable, the characters and voices are excellent and the plot moves forward evenly, barely sagging or slowing at any moment. What it is is an icy version of 'The Little Mermaid' for the new generation, and one movie like 'Aladdin' I wouldn't mind having in my collection.",10,2,6,23 October 2016
School of Rock," No Sense Movie
","To me, Jack Black belongs to a category of 'Luck' Celebrities such as Jim Carrey, Pauley Shore, Rob Schneider, Adam Sandler and David Spade who somehow became big time stars by proving to be as little talented as possible, (it gives hope to other no-talents to break into show business) although Spade did do Dickie Roberts and Carrey did Bruce Almighty so there is hope for the rest. In this odd little piece of would-be MST3K fodder, Black plays a screwed up, conspiratorial pothead who thinks he's a musician who impersonates a substitute teacher and somehow gets away with it with even unlikelier results. The major snafu in this movie is that he tells these kids 'to keep it a secret.' Thankfully, he seems to live in a world where logic does not exist. If these kids were as smart as they seemed, especially in a world where kids can be abducted, kidnapped from their homes or abused, they'd be reporting him to everyone who would listen. They're smart enough to keep it a secret, but dumb enough to not figure out what's going on. Like I said, this film occurs in a fishbowl with the dumbest fish somehow coming up with an end result and then orchestrating an unlikely and implausible sequence of events to get there. I hate to think what this movie stands for: Warping and ruining the minds of kids is acceptable as long as you can prove to everyone you can pretend to be a responsible adult. I'm sorry, but I refuse to accept that.",3,5,15,4 April 2005
Ghostbusters," Who You Gonna Call !
","I'm familiar with a Saturday Morning live-action show called 'Ghost Busters' that starred Forrest Tucker, Larry Storch and a man in a gorilla suit as an ape called Kong, but that was puerile, gimmicky and ridiculous compared to this straight-faced comedy about freelance parapsychologists who open their own ghost exterminating business. Insulting to real ghosts inasmuch as they refer to every sort of intangible goblin or monster as a 'ghost', the film also makes fun and pokes ridicule to real ghost hunters as nothing but a pack of money-hungry, double-talking, over-sexed pseudo-intellectuals with a collection of illogical and unpractical Flash Gordon-equipment. There is a pretty decent movie here as Bill Murray proves to be an enjoyable and likeable cut-up with a genius-level I.Q., Dan Aykroyd as the boyishly innocent believer in ghosts ( a character not unlike myself) and Harold Ramis as the straight man to the idiocy and the only one with a foot grounded in reality. Rick Moranis is as usual the rather nerdishly inept comic relief, Ernie Hudson the man with the muscle and Superman-grin and Sigourney Weaver who isn't attractive enough to be the type of looker that she is supposed to be. Tossed in for Bill Murray to pursue unsuccessfully, she is less sexual than a car accident, but is a good enough actress to give credence to her role. Annie Potts also provides a wonderfully funny talent as their frustrated, harried and demurely sexy secretary ready to kill them just so she can catch her breath. Slavitza Jovan of the unpronouncable name (later of the House on Haunted Hill remake infamy) is also on hand as some sort of forgotten immortal here to revert the world back to pagan times. It's a great comedy with action overtones, but the ghost formula is straight out of the pen of a Hollywood hack.",9,0,0,9 January 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Wonderful Nicole Kidman Musical
","To me, this is the movie Nicole Kidman was born to play. I could not see anyone else do it; I mean, who knew she could sing. Ewan McGregor accentuates her performance and creates a role any guy would want to live through; I know I can't watch without saying his lines with him. In the movie, a young writer (McGregor) falls for a courtesan (Kidman) in a bawdy bordello/dance hall after she confuses him for a Duke. To cover, she gets her employer to put on his play created in tandem with Toulouse-Latrec (John Leguizamo at his most eccentric). Modern day love songs from the Beatles to Marilyn Monroe to Madonna litter the plot with curious abandon and the play mirrors and shadows the plot of the movie itself so much they they become intertwined. There's 'Three's Company' level misunderstandings and cover-ups replete with sexual overtures and enough erotic undertones to choke on (few of the so-called 'show girls' are very attractive). Jim Broadbent is Kidman's employer, a sort of whorehouse madam in the form of a father figure, and Richard Roxburgh plays the Duke as a violent psychopath barely contained in the form of a naive idiot. The songs are infectious and the imagery is passing, but the whole pop-song opera style with the romanticism is what makes the movie worth seeing. Kidman and McGregor have such chemistry together that it would make sense to use them together in more movies.",10,5,8,27 January 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," How Not To Make a Comic Book Movie -
","I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I'm a bigger fan of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies than the Andrew Garfield version. My excuse is and has always been that Sam Raimi was such a fan of the Spider-Man movies that he knew how to do it right. On the other hand, the Andrew Garfield version was more about the Ultimate Universe version than the real Spider-Man, and there was the difference. There are elements in both movies that work very well, and elements in both movies that don't. Tobey's version was more like basic Spidey; Garfield's was more like the updated version. They were two different versions, and despite the fact Raimi did a better job, Emma Stone still kicks Kristen Dunst as far as sex appeal. On the other hand, Garfield's sense of vengeance over the murder of his uncle is a poor substitute for 'With great power comes great responsibility.' Amazing Spider-Man 2, however, seems to get worse than its original with even more plot lines to fall over and crash into each other. I couldn't keep up with everything that was going on, and quite frankly, there was nothing about them to make me interested. The villains are kind of lame and shallow. Electro terrorizes the city for no reason but to be noticed. The weird part is that when he gets arrested they terrorize him by electrocuting him. This makes as much sense as punishing an Ewok with a bath and flea dip. However, Paul Giamatti as the Rhino does nothing but yell and threaten kids. When he shows up in a giant ridiculous robot Rhino tank, it looks as if he's auditioning for the next 'Transformers' movie. Harry Osborn's motivation makes a little sense, but as the Green Goblin, all he is an amped-up school bully on crack. At least Sandman, Doctor Octopus and Venom had clear goals that went far beyond just killing Spider-Man. I mean, in Spider-Man 3, the villain that had the least to do was Sandman, but at least, he had some really cool bank robbery scenes. Even Venom had a little worth doing as an alien-possessed psychopath. Another thing that annoys me about the movie is that it feels as if it runs just way too long with moments that feel like its ending but then it drags its way to yet scene that once again runs toward an ending before starting again. The only good parts of the movie I like are Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's chemistry. The web-slinging scenes are okay, but they're all but stolen from Sam Raimi's work. At times, the whole movie feels like two movies loosely interconnected with enjoyable scenes, such as the Peter-Gwen relationship broken up by the interims with what feels like the DC Universe version of Spider-Man. The movie is bothered immensely by the fact that it's trying to create all these lead-ins to an expanded Spider-Man Universe that unfortunately has no part in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (and thank God for that since Sam Raimi's version fits in a lot better with those films).",3,2,19,17 August 2015
The Illusionist," Fantastic Smart Fantasy
","The was the first movie I've seen with Jessica Biel and the second for Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, 'The Hulk' and 'Big Fat Liar,' respectively. I've always enjoyed period movies, plus this is highlighted by a grand Austrian setting and fine performances. Norton plays magician who as a poor boy who loses his true love played as an adult as Jessica Biel and Paul Giamatti is the police inspector trying to understand their precarious secret love under the suspicions of a local prince. There are a few parallels to the 'Moulin Rouge,' but this movie is accentuated by a top-notch plot incorporating a mystery and suspense into a love story. Placed in the late 19th century, I was expecting maybe a Houdini reference, maybe more historical details to place the movie, but knowing when it happens is not nearly as important. The movie is actually nothing but a love story with mystical and mysterious overtones as unlike Houdini, Norton's character embraces Spiritualism to force a confession from the prince who has murdered his lady love, or so it seems, but as his character reveals, nothing is ever as it seems.",9,1,2,11 September 2013
Men in Black II," Good Movie
","I was really impressed by the first MIB movie with its good story and the terrific special effects to carry it. This movie is no exception. Everything that made the first movie great is back, plus they delve deeper into things they should have done in the first movie. The Pug for one and the inter-workings of the MIB to name two. Will shines in his role, Tommy knocks me out with his dead pan delivery and together they blow me away, but the best thing is from giving the Pug more screen time. His singing is the funniest thing since ever. Tony Shalhoub and Rip Torn also highlight the movie; without them, there is no movie. Rosario Dawson highlights the movie as an innocent ingenue very well too. Lara Flynn-Boyle does nasty very well; I had a dirty little smirk when she said she could rule the world with the right size of mammaries (being an alien as she was and using some computer graphics would have made for an even more interesting scene ala The Benny Hill Show). The plot is great with its expectations and then twist to the end. Definitely a worth-see !",10,8,15,11 April 2003
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Enjoyable To A Point
","I never read the book this movie was based on. In fact, until I finally broke down and saw the movie, I did not know it was based on a book. It's a nice family movie, but what bothers me are the constant idiosyncrasies that don't make sense. For one, it's located on an island that couldn't possibly exist and for some reason, this island has a dam on it. It just those details that make it only possible in the Pixel Universe. Beyond that, it's a very charming movie with a top notch cast including Anna Faris, Bruce Campbell, Neil Flynn, Al Roker and Mr. T. It's fun, it's charming and the characters are appealing, but one is obviously going to be wondering about and pointing out the flawed science (a Jello home capable of supporting it's own weight?). Where the movie works is in it's sheer imagination and creativity.",5,1,3,23 November 2010
Brave," Excellent Celtic/Irish/Scottish Modern Fairy Tale
","I truly enjoy computer-animated films. From 'The Polar Express' to 'Hotel Transylvania,' these films really up the ante on what can be done with the technology, which keeps getting stronger and stronger. What I like most are the character reactions, expressions and mannerisms that can be done with the technology with the cartoon caricatures. It really is like seeing animation come to life, and 'Brave' is among the best I've seen in a long time. Heightened by a strong modern Irish-Celtic fairy tale, several impeccable voice actors and an army of masterful computer animators, the film makes you forget the story is a Disney cartoon and keeps you on this journey of love, honor and destiny. The only drawback is the lack of any grounding to place just when or where the story takes place. The cultural references are both Scottish and Irish (from haggis to cabers), and the locations as stunning as they are seem to hearken to both those countries as well. The story involves a wild-haired red-haired free spirit named Meridel who often escapes the rigid life of a princess to go riding and hunting, so when she decides to declare her independence at her betrothal ceremony, she incites a disturbance in her homeland and a rift with her mother. (Both her hair and spirit remind me of the singer/actress Robey from the Eighties.) To sway her mother's plans for her future, she finagles a spell from a witch who has given up witchcraft for woodcarving, and the results are not as planned. It seems the witch has a bear-fetish. Everything she carves is a bear, and her spell on a crumb cake transforms Meridel's mother the Queen into a bear. Off they vanish into the woods to hide the secret, if but to sneak into the castle to set in motion the way to undo the spell. Of course, nothing is every easy. Father thinks his daughter is crazy, tries to kill his wife the bear, Meridel's brothers become bears and on and on Not to mention the mad bear that took the king's leg to begin with. By time the movie ends, I was stuck with Celtic accent I couldn't get rid of. It really is a great movie – especially for someone like me who enjoys cultural folklore. I don't know of kids will like it, but adults will enjoy it just don't miss the tag scene at the end of the credits with the raven making the witch's deliveries",Null,2,3,3 April 2013
From Dusk Till Dawn," Salma Hayek as a vampire ? WOW !!!
","I had never considered seeing any Quentin Taratino movies until I saw the previews for this one.It blew me away ! Most of you may want to fast-forward through the Gecko Brothers opening, but I think the movie really starts when Cheech Marin is calling guys into the strip joint in one of the numerous roles he plays in this movie.No,that's not right,I think it REALLY starts when Salma Hayek comes out wearing a snake {oh,to have been that lucky snake}.The rest of the movie is just fodder with nudity, swearing,violence and computer special effects.As a vampire movie,this film is the bomb.As a Clooney film,it's so-so.I'd only watch it for Salma's scenes.",Null,0,0,1 November 2000
Paranormal Activity," Over-Hyped So-So Paranormal
","I don't see movies in the theater anymore unless I think it's worth it. 'Paranormal Activity' was one I knew I could wait for, and I was right. It's atmospheric, boring at times and tedious and portrays what's becoming society's obsession with voyeurism with the paranormal merely the topic. We have Katie, a good-looking shapely brunette with a shrill scream, and Micah, the average-looking dumb ass warned not to bring a Ouija board into the house but does it anyway. It seems they've been living in their home for three years and have just now noticed paranormal activity; Katie even adds she's been haunted since she was a kid. Everything is video-taped and there's some shaky 'Blair Witch' point-of-view as Micah obsesses with taping everything in an effort to get rich off of activity he doesn't really believe in as Katie gets more and more frustrated. The paranormal sounds are little more than atmosphere and there's no plot. It's never revealed just how Katie's past connects to what's happening now. Her sleepwalking is scary, Micah's powder test is supposed to be scary, but it's handled fleetingly. The unseen ghost is the real star waiting for it to appear; it actually has more personality than the two of them put together. The whole underlying 'demonic' pretense is unnecessary; it detracts from the story to imply whatever is occurring has to be evil. Why does it 'have' to be evil? It's merely a tool to put a scare at the end. It's a surprise, but it's not scary... It's a punchline for a long and very tedious riddle that just went way too long to get to its point.",5,0,1,25 March 2010
Hotel Transylvania," A Roller Coaster Ride of Fun And Horror
","I grew up on the Classic Universal movie monsters of the 30s and the 40s, so I definitely had to see this movie, and overall, I think it's a pretty strong movie with few weak points. Of its weak points, it has too many non-generic creatures. Dracula creates a hotel for monsters, but in the movie, 'monster' remains unspecific. The castle is teeming with ghosts, walking dead, cryptids, mutant freaks, outcasts from society and a few mythological beasts. It could have been entirely devoted to ghosts, undead creatures and demons, but instead, it goes a bit too far with a few creatures that defy explanation and identification. The hotel is meant for these outcasts of society to exist alongside each other away from humans (shades of 'Monsters vs. Aliens) – somehow forgetting that many of these beings were once human themselves. There is a buried political statement here about how society treats its outcasts, but the point is never addressed. However, this cacophony of contradictions is pushed to the background because the main plot is mostly about Dracula (Adam Sandler) being over protective of his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez). Mavis was originally going to be played by Miley Cyrus, but backed out. This works well to the film's benefit because Miley's Tennessee accent would not have worked for the sheltered daughter. Not only that, but Selena does pull off the innocent effervescence required for the character. As Dracula, Sandler's signature voice is practically unrecognizable with the thick Slavic accent and sounds at times almost exactly like Bela Lugosi. It is into this world that a lost hiker voiced by Adam Samberg wanders, and Dracula quickly tries hiding him as a relative of one of the body parts of the Frankenstein Monster, once again using the name of his creator. The movie has a fast and furious roller coaster parade of jokes and scenes; the best material comes from Steve Buscemi as the harried Wolfman as the father of a litter of kids who fail to respect him. At one point, Dracula asks straightly: 'Do you have any kids left who still respect you?' There are also a few gags from Dracula suffering the indignity of years of bad Dracula impressions and alleged vampire misconceptions. When getting a look at 'Twilight,' he asks very forlornly, 'Is this what my legacy has come to?' The movie has a top-notch cast of comedy actors including David Spade, Kevin James, Jon Lovitz, Fran Drescher, Molly Spade and Cee-Lo Green as the singing voice of a fat mummy. The animation is superb; it may not be as top-notch as 'Brave,' but then, why are we expected to have these 3-D movies compete with each other in animation? While the movie does tend to drag down on logic at times, it pulls together with the zest and appeal of a carnival fun house, and if the animation over the credits is any indication: I could see the movie siring an animated TV cartoon.",9,3,5,2 October 2012
Men in Black," They made me watch it!
","I am not a Will Smith fan largely because I though he was constantly over-perpetuating an image on his 'Fresh Prince' show.I would never have gone to see MIB on my own if my buddy  hadn't made me watch it on VHS [I'd rather watch Benny Hill anyday].MIB,however totally blew me away solely by it's special effects.I stll think Smith overdoes everything,but Jones,Fiorentino and Torn really deliver some great roles and superb characters.The only thing I didn't like is how the bug[played by my man Vincent D'Onofrio]seemed to flip-flop between being so dangerous and then so child-like [when he teases the wife or plays with the bell].Why does it calmly deliver a lunch order then go nuts looking for where the  dead go ?

The Artist," Brilliant Salute And Homage to the Silent Movie Era
","After 'The Artist' won five Academy Awards, there was kind of a joke going around on Twitter that it was one of the most praised movies that no one ever bothered to go see, so, I just had to rectify that by renting the DVD at my local movie place, and I am glad to say that the people making those jokes really don't know what they're missing. No, people don't go see Silent Movies anymore, and that's a crying shame because among the movie-going public, there are those among us who actually miss the Golden Years of Hollywood before we were inundated with sequels, computer-generated effects, bathroom humor, movies based on television shows and endless god-awful references to drugs, alcohol and pornography. There's a reason it's called the Golden Age of Hollywood, and Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo demonstrate that so eloquently in this movie by creating characters that we both love and reach out to without uttering a single line. What they have created is not just a modern Silent Film, but also a profile of a fictional Silent Film star and an analysis of the era in general. Contrary to the movie, several Silent Film stars actually went on to bigger success under sound once they embraced the technology, but a few, like Dujardin's character, faded into obscurity and later became icons of a lost age now finally appreciated by film students and aficionados of the old classic movie. 'The Artist' shares moments of great humor and sincere drama with levels of extreme pathos, all without a single character saying a word. If this movie was taken back in time to pre-1925 Hollywood, I think it would have fit in very well with the works of Douglas Fairbanks. Errol Flynn, Harold Lloyd and Buster Crabbe. If you haven't seen 'The Artist' yet, what's keeping you?",Null,1,4,11 September 2013
Titanic," Reminds Me of an Episode of 'Quantum Leap'
","Voice of Dean Stockwell as Admiral Al Calavicci: 'Sam, Ziggy says you've leapt into one Jack Dawson of Chippewa Falls,Michigan and that there's a 78.5% chance that you're here to save the life of one Rose Dewitt Bukater.' Well, at least that's the way I see it. I may not see Scott Bakula or Stockwell, but for some reason I get the feeling that behind DeCaprio's pretty boy looks, it is Bakula as time-traveler Sam Beckett pulling his strings. I can just hear Stockwell after the nude drawing: 'You drew that while she was.....And I missed it?! Rats!!' Back to the movie, it may be a chick flick for girls to see Leo, but it does have Kate Winslet for the guys. She looks incredible with red hair! Billy Zane should get an award for the sheer arrogance he plays (maybe it comes naturally) and David Warner should get the Jerk Reward for his portrayal as Zane's stooge. Exceptionally talented Kathy Bates is wonderfully likeable as Molly Brown, a far cry from her 'Misery' role, but then she does excellant work in everything she does. Cameron pays a lot of detail into this work, or not considering the bloopers constantly being nick-picked. The story of two lovers separated by fate works well against the tragedy of the Titanic's sinking as does telling it from a past point of view at the site of a salvage expedition with Bill Paxton. I haven't seen him since 'Wierd Science.' The sinking is very well done. We just don't see a miniature sinking as have we seen in so many other movies, we see the drowning, the suffering, the deck going up, the sheer terror and true nature of the human spirit when faced with its mortality, the people fighting for life boats......this is the movie to put an end to further Titanic movies. Cameron has put together here not just an incredibly powerful movie, but a chick flick that even guys would want to see!",10,2,3,27 January 2001
It's a Wonderful Life," Must See Christmas TV
","I just love this movie. I've seen it so many times I've got the lines and voices memorized. it just ain't Christmas unless I've seen this movie, although I still have to see it once or twice over the rest of the year. The story is sort of 'A Christmas Carol' in reverse as a good man experiences a paranormal event within an alternate reality in order to make him want to live. Frank Capra once said that of all his movies that this one is his favorite and it obviously shows because of the time and effort used to bring it to life. I give this movie ten stars even if every tv series does a variance of this plot for a Christmas special.",10,0,4,31 May 2003
Psycho," Grand-daddy Of All Slasher Movies
","Not many people know it, but Robert Bloch loosely based his original novel on the story of Ed Gein, a farmer of Plainfield, Wisconsin who collected body parts from the cemetary and who killed two women. Almost too weird to be true, Bloch sensationalized the original story and created a top notch horror story which became a movie that started a whole new series of slasher and killer movies. Psycho is a masterpeice in direction, style, acting, writing, plot and execution. The story centers around that of a lovely, would-be female thief who absconds with a lot of money. The movies rotates around the movie's main character like a pin wheel before shooting in and absolving the story with a climax and one of the single most recognizable visuals in movie history. Anthony Perkins is a vulnerable but likeable maniac with a character, a far cry from his hockey masked and claw handed progeny. Janet Leigh proves how the shower is the most vulnerable spot for a person to be, and Martin Balsam creates a believable detective far from the trench coat gumshoes in the old nickel and dime stories. Spoofing the role later in the flick, Silence of the Hams, he proved just how far this movie has seeped into the consciousness of movie-goers.",10,1,3,9 April 2001
Hercules," Excellant But Wrong
","I'm a big fan of Mythology Movies, even cartoon versions, and Disney has made some very wonderful movies, but this movie gets one thing wrong after another. Hercules's mother was Alcmene, not Hera, and his main antagonist for his whole life was Hera not Hades. There were also seven Muses, not five. Philoctetes was the son of his best friend, Poeas, one of the Argonauts whose boat the Argo is shown in peices thirty years too early. Phil, the goat man, though, may be a substitute for Chiron the centaur, but he mentions Odysseus and Achilles (not born yet) and Perseus, Hercules' great grandfather. Theseus, though, is a contemporary. Hercules never rode Pegasus (neither did Perseus fot that matter). There is a scene with a Gorgon, the only creature Hercules never killed.The likenesses of Hermes and Ares are rather insulting, but several of the others are rather splendid and augmented by various voices if but colored rather egregiously (only the Hindu gods had a significantly colored pantheon). Meg was the daughter of King Creon of Thebes, not a lackey of Hades, but she is a part of Hercules' history as his first wife. She was probably placed in the script to avoid parallels with the Legendary Journeys TV series.Depicted as if Teri Hatcher would play her in a live action version, she is one of the truly wonderful characters in the film behind Zeus, Hades and Hercules. Pain and Panic are unnecessary if not inserted for the comic relief and two extra Happy Meal toys. Despite the bloopers and anachronisms, the movie is great entertainment for child and adult and should get any kid interested in mythology as an interest.",10,3,7,5 September 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The Greatest Vampire Flick Ever
","This is a great, if not equally appreciated, movie. The sets look true to the period, as are the clothes, the plot is a lot closer to the original novel with all of Mina Westernra's finally added and just the right amount of light nudity to hold a guy's interest (Oh boy,Am I going to get mail on that comment!). The only thing I didn't like was the lack of how Dracula got to be a vampire; because he wished it ? Winona Ryder and Sadie Frost are sexy, and Keanu Reeves pulls off a fair if not befuddled performance as if he's still rather distracted by his scene with the female vampires. 'Were two of them glued together at the crotch ?' Cary Elwes is one of the heroes, but at times Anthony Hopkins' Van Helsing looks like Hannibal Lecter ! The score in the theater,though, was deafening, but is appreciated much more on video. Gary Oldham makes me forget he once played Lee Harvey Oswald, but then he is almost indistinguishable as the young or old Dracula. His wig was lampooned hysterically by Leslie Nielsen in 'Dracula:Dead and Loving It.' This movie goes to the top of my favorite vampire movies list near 'Lemora' and 'Interview of the Vampire,' but I just have to ask: would it have hurt to leave Winona or Sadie as a vampire ?",Null,1,1,8 December 2000
Dark Shadows," Dark Shadows Gets Lighter (And Dumbed Down)
","I'm about as big a Dark Shadows fan as the next person who grew up on the series. I feel closer to the Collins Family more to my real relatives, but this movie is like watching a high school drama class trying to act out the dirty secrets of my family at exaggerated and misinformed levels. I was expecting something more from the mind of Tim Burton of 'Sleepy Hollow' fame, not the Tim Burton of 'Willie Wonka' infamy. To me, Dark Shadows was about a family living in a haunted house, and one of the relatives was a vampire. The campy aspects of it were barely noticeable, but in this interpretation, they are elaborated and stretched thin for comedy effect. Yikes!!! Johnny Depp plays a distant and ignorant version of Barnabas Collins whose best moments are trying to understand the Twentieth Century, and Eva Green plays a much more malicious and unscrupulous Angelique, a far distant cry from the tragically romantic version by Lara Parker. One saving grace is Michelle Pfeiffer as Liz Stoddard who looks timeless in the Joan Bennett role. Chloe Grace Moretz plays Carolyn in very small doses scattered through the movie, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a new spin on Julia Hoffman as a washed-up alcoholic psychiatrist scared of getting old. The movie is very loosely based on the events of the series, the characters are taken in directions they shouldn't be taken and new developments and scenarios are created. Looking very much like one of the animated dolls of 'The Corpse Bride,' Bella Heathcote wanders through this insane asylum of caricatures and eerily feeling right at home. The final climax between Barnabas and Angelique looks and feels taken from 'Death Becomes Her' with some very late plot points and revelations tossed in. I was bitterly disappointed with this film, which at times seems more like one long dirty joke. If it was not for the original Sixties series to compare it to, this adaptation might have stood alone as a parody of horror movies, but instead, I consider it an insult to a series that both inspired my imagination and still haunts my dreams. However, for a truly worthy legacy of the series, it might be best to check out the 1990s mini-series with Ben Cross and Joanna Going that was so unjustly canceled.",3,11,18,13 November 2012
Stalag 17," 'Hogan,,,,, I Mean Sefton,,,,'
","The only thing that made me see this movie was a thousand references to 'Hogan's Heroes.' Now I have to admit that I like and appreciate both. With the wry wit of 'MASH,' this movie has given me a faint glimpse into the prisoner of war camps of WW2. The plot starts out like the show with Bob Crane and Werner Klemperer and turns into a whodunit that leaves you wondering who the fink is. Even after seeing this movie a dozen times, I keep returning for the humor, my favorite being the Hitler take-off. 'One Fuerher is enough for me. ' says Schultz played by the obscure Sig Rumen. My favorite characters besides William Holden's are Harvey Lembeck and Robert Strauss as they are at the hub of most of the humor. The cold reality of the war is also present in the superb plot as is the POW's way of handling it. Otto Preminger turns in an excellant performance as the Commodant. All together, the Billy Wilder material comes through perfectly in this classic film.",10,2,5,9 March 2001
The Terminal," Forrest Gump Returns!
","I love this movie. It's about the closest thing I could see as a sequel to 'Forrest Gump' without actually seeing tom Hanks play Forrest Gump again. He plays Viktor Navorski, a Bulgarian national from a fiction republic who lose his country in the air and cannot return home, but without a new reclassification, he can't enter the United States so he has to live in the world of the airport terminal. This sequence is highlighted by very convincing CNN scenes of his war-torn homeland. He gets by living by his wits and the kindness of other people, encountering and touching on the lives of people passing through, much like Forrest, and they touch his life in return. The mystery of the can he carries around makes for a good and worthy sub-plot. George Takei appears in the movie where one character is a Trekkie. Catherine Zeta Jones has a wonderful role as a potential love interest that surprises by not having her end up with Tom, a cliché ending that otherwise would have been too predictable.",10,2,4,15 January 2008
The Conjuring," Almost Decent Haunted House Movies Turns Stupid
","Hollywood has a strange notion of what a scary movie is. What they think is 'scary' is actually 'surprised.' You can get over being surprised, but if you're really absolutely positively scared, you will still feel that cold shiver you got three to four years later while remembering what scared you, but then that's just me. I've read so much about real ghosts that the fake stuff in the movies doesn't chill me at all. Even modern horror movies don't know what it takes to really scare people. Compare a weak installment like 'Occulus' to movies like 'The Amityville Horror' or 'The Others,' movies you likely watched between your fingers, and you realize it's what you think you're going to see that is going to scare you. It's because older horror movies knew how to exploit what scared you. Today, movies like 'The Conjuring,' 'Insidious' and 'Sinister' try to follow in that vein with the addition of adding disturbing imagery within chilling shadowy settings. What we have with 'The Conjuring' is a file from Ed and Lorraine Warren. It is 'based' on a true story, but since it has been embellished, exaggerated and had fake incidents added, the movie is about as fictional as the books claiming John Wilkes Booth escaped. It tells the story of the Perron family and the hauntings they experienced on their Rhode Island farm. The opening activity consists of poltergeist activity and odd sounds, it's charming and quaint, adding atmosphere to a story that should be building in intensity but instead goes Hollywood with the arrival of Ed and Lorraine Warren, self-proclaimed demonologists who Hans Holzer called 'religious zealots posing as paranormal researchers.' I'm not sure what really happened at the Perron Farm, but anything concerning the Warrens always go from a straight haunted house movie to a bad rip-off of 'The Exorcist.' Is the movie scary? Yes. Is it a good plot? Hell, no. What the movie does have is a good cast, some decent special effects and several good scares, but it's only the first half of the movie is really watching before it descends into malarkey about demons and ends with a very unnecessary possession/exorcism scene which doesn't add or further the plot except to add some disturbing scenes to a movie that was already only partially scary to begin with. If anything, 'The Conjuring' runs like two different movies badly edited together – the first half a pretty decent haunted house move, the last half a really disturbing and sometimes really loud exorcism flick. Be warned and only watch the first half of this movie and switch it off when the Warrens meet the Perrons because by then, it's just not worth watching from that point.",Null,1,2,17 August 2015
1408," Interesting and Compelling King
","Whenever I go into a ghost movie, I go into it playing ghost hunter and paranormal detective. My mind is always in 'Yes, that's happened,' 'Aw, come on...' and 'Would never happen.' Hollywood rarely gets it right when it comes to trying to depict the supernatural, and when it's Stephen King, reality goes out the window. King may be inspired by the paranormal, but he generally brings your worst fears to life. In his latest movie venture, John Cusack plays a writer with a past over his head who doesn't believe in ghosts and goes around exposing them with pure cynicism with the artful styling of a seasoned writer. When he heads to Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel, he is there to challenge it, but it proves to challenge him. Samuel L. Jackson plays the elegant yet austere hotel manager with all the pomp and grace of the grim reaper trying to talk him out of it. It's never explained just who sent the post card that sends Cusack to the hotel: the manager trolling for victims or the spirit of his dead daughter trying to warn him. Both Cusack and Jackson give intense roles, and the haunting activity and Cusack's rambling soliloquy and flashbacks keeps it from becoming too claustrophobic. In the end, even the audience feels trapped in the room. It's an excellent movie of the supernatural as explained by and deciphered by the mind of Stephen King. It's definitely worth a watch as long as you look for all the references to the number thirteen.",10,1,2,23 January 2008
The Woman in Black," Harry Potter's Scariest Adventure Yet
","In Hollywood, there are three types of ghosts. There are the invisible people who can't be touched and are usually played for laughs, there are the murderous serial-killing fiends who cause mass homicides and then there are the demonic forces whose sole purpose is the misfortune and torture of the living without any long-term plans. It is so rare to have a decent haunted house movie that actually knows how to scare and terrify the viewer. 'The Woman In Black' is one of those movies. It is what a decent haunted house movie should be: creepy setting, strong characters, engaging plot and an unsolved mystery with some suspense. It stars Daniel Radcliffe as a lawyer barely over the loss of his wife. He is already haunted by her death and the responsibility of his son when his firm sends him to secure the papers of a deceased client. The job requires he travel to the distant isolated village of Crithin Grifford in Northern England by train, encountering the creepy superstitious people and eccentrics along the way. The movie is thick in atmosphere and the plot moves briskly as he wonders if the isolated house he is located could be haunted – a premise we are sure is happening even if his character is not. The movie is far more scary and unnerving than the tedious voyeuristic style of the 'Paranormal Activity' movies. This is a movie reliant on its setting as much as its ghosts to be scary because we know Radcliffe's character is trapped in the house by the rising tide and can't leave as easy as other characters in other movies may have. His eyes and expressions relate the fear he is having in the location. Unlike 'Paranormal Activity,' 'Woman In Black' is carried by a plot involving town mystery where none of the children in town live long to adulthood; so now we have not just a ghost story by one wrapped inside a mystery. It's the type of horror movie we rarely ever see. Bottom line: the movie is scary as hell without being as condescending, tedious or confusing as 'Paranormal Activity.'",10,0,2,13 November 2012
Bruce Almighty," Movie Over-Rated
","I went into this movie liking the idea that God would put his power into a simple mortal and the concept that said mortal would use the power to get into mischief. But why did it have to be Jim Carrey ? I still don't think he all that funny; he mugs, he grins, he makes noises and hams it up and somehow he's considered a comic genius ? What am I missing ? The saving grace in this movie is Morgan Freeman as the Almighty; he is very enjoyable to watch as he spouts pearls of wisdom and portrays the Lord as I would see him; not as a Puritanical dour-faced creator of worlds but as a father figure with a sense of humor. Jennifer Aniston is also in this movie and what better reason to see this movie than to see her boobs get bigger. The comedy is fair, the special effects enjoyable and the plot struggles to stay aloft as Carrey camps it up, but it does have a message without being too preachy and it ends with a wry sense of humor that even Carrey can't foil.",7,0,1,2 January 2004
Lucy," Good Movie, Missing Ending
","I'm a writer myself, and I've turned out a few horror novels where the female ingénue and the antagonist turn out to be one and the same; so with 'Lucy,' I was very interested to see how well this premise could be converted into a 'Jason Bourne'-like scenario. First off, Scarlett Johansson is awesome in the movie. It's almost what would be expected if the Black Widow from the 'Avengers' went through the Captain America process then went after HYDRA. Unfortunately, in 'Lucy,' HYDRA is replaced by the Chinese mafia, and the Super Soldier Serum is replaced by a dangerous addictive drug which in small doses causes heightened intelligence. Small doses is the key because when Scarlett's character is unwittingly used as a drug mule, the drugs break open in large doses inside her, granting her heightened intelligence, psychokinetic powers, paranormal abilities and eventually a complete control over reality itself. Along the way, Morgan Freeman narrates what's happening as the expert on this drug who she seeks out for help. While the action and chase scenes are 'Terminator' quality, it soon turns into an uninteresting plot that runs out of steam. Starting out, the plot is fascinating and fun to watch, but as it gets closer to the end, and one starts wondering where it's going with the metaphysical discussion, it becomes more tedious and lackluster. The ending does not match the first ninety percent of the film. I don't understand it, it doesn't make sense, and it outdoes 'The Shining' on its vagueness. It could have gone anywhere so to end on a question mark ruins what I thought was an otherwise interesting flick. I give it 3 out five.",5,0,2,23 October 2016
The Sixth Sense," Excellent !
","SPOILERS MAY BE INVOLVED:I love ghost and haunted house movies even if I end up picking them apart on the level of paranormal fact and reality. This movie was excellent; it's almost a straight faced version of 'The Frightners.' Both Willis and Osment do wonderful jobs high-lighted by Shyamalan's directions. The ghosts themselves deserve an A-plus for the atmosphere they imbue, but realisticly, sixth sense perception is not that exclusive. Ghosts are not that invisible or that tangible. Some people do have greater sensitivity to them, but on a whole, ghosts can be seen by just about everyone whether they are psychic or not. The only other plot point I see unresolved is while Willis discovers the truth about himself, did Osment know it all along ? Otherwise, this is great movie for believers and unbelievers.",10,0,0,6 November 2001
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," What Is It ?
","I only like this movie for the time traveling aspects, and that's about it. In all, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a good one. It's not a teen movie, but it's not a fantasy. Two low-achievers are given the assignment to save the future. The reason is extremely far-fetched; it alleges that their music plays a factor to world peace. If that was the case, I can name twenty other more talented singers, vocalists and entertainers with a lot more brains and talent who honed their craft by hard work who are far more eligible. The boys will fail if they don't turn in a history assignment which just so happens to be set up for them to be able to yank historical personages from the past. Isn't it likely they were more likely to fail ? How could this so-called future have existed to send them a time machine to pass when it they were most likely to fail the test ? I think someone in that future rewrote their history to depend on the two idiots. The other facts about time travel are pretty close when it comes to being able to travel both a few minutes forward and backward, but there are historical contradictions a plenty on the characters, most obviously is the t-shirt tan on Socrates. Anyone from Before Christ would be a lot more tanned ! The actors are matched up solely on appearance to the roles they play and the script depicts them well, but it is less kind to Bill and Ted themselves. George Carlin is the only character to watch in this, but he has few scenes as a would-be Obi Wan to Bill and Ted, two characters sharing a brain - and both of them thinking the other has it.",7,0,1,10 May 2002
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Spectacular !
","This is definitely one of the top most memorable vampire movies out there. A definite classic, it takes its story from the vampire's point of view and shatters everything we think we know about them regarding Vlad the Impaler, crosses, bloodlust and nearly everything else. Tom Cruise is at the height of his career with this role that he should most definitely reprise, Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderas as both spellbinding and Christan Slater makes the most of the scenes he has. My favorite of course is future babe Kirsten Dunst who plays the female vampire trapped immortally and eternally as a child. The only thing that gets me through the rest of this is the hope that Pitt finds away to bring her back, but seeing Cruise's incessant returns just when you think he's really gone also kept me watching. Lestat's and Louis's odd twisted partnership of less than friends and more than enemies is very similar to that of Barnabus And Angelique on TV's Dark Shadows. The whole surreal situation seems to be the real plot of the movie and the true calling of the Anne Rice material. Ten Stars to this film, its stars and its legacy !",10,1,2,28 April 2001
Aladdin," Vintage Robin Williams
","I did not care to see this movie, but I was such a big Robin Williams that I rented it long after it stopped playing in the theaters. From the first few scenes I was spellbound by the voices and the script.I can still mimmick nearly all of the Genie's themes as well as see myself play Aladdin in a live action version of this movie with Paula Abdul as Jasmine and John De Lancie as Jafar. Jasmine in this movie has the same sexual innocence as Ariel the Little Mermaid and Krysta of Fern Gully. The songs are infectious, especially 'Friend Like Me' and 'A Whole New World.' The whole movie is one big roller coaster ride augmented by the raucous wit of Robin Williams and his own talent for mimmicry and improvisation. Ten Stars way up!",10,87,110,5 September 2001
The Cabin in the Woods," Cabin In The Woods Has A Few Leaks In It
","By today's standards, it has become kind of obvious that Hollywood is running short on original ideas, and part of the problem is that the industry is based on a predilection of ignoring and pretty much stone-walling struggling new writers with fresh ideas. If you look at the number of horror movies coming out these days, the majority of them are nothing bur remakes, sequels or new spins and incarnations of existing horror movies. You could say that there is only really around twelve to fifteen horror movie archetypes, but every once in a while, a movie comes around like 'Cabin In The Woods' that takes its archetype and either re-invents it or twists it on its side. Set up with the general format of 'The Evil Dead' or cabin-in-the-woods story, the movie centers around five college kids who vanish from society for a wasted weekend of debauchery, drugs and all the god awful anti-social stigma frowned upon in a normal rational society, but from behind the scenes they are being watched by what seems to be an advanced social experiment. Not a lot of details are wasted on the re-animated undead redneck slasher zombie family attacking the kids, although their invention hearkens back to every slasher/gore movie from 'Friday The 13th' to 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' The main drive is centered on the two voyeurs and their company controlling the events. Immediately, one starts wondering what their agenda is. You start thinking they might be some sort of hidden camera series or a sociological experiment, but then the murders turn out to be real, and they start engineering details to keep the kids from escaping or leaving the confines of the plot. Once their main drive in seeing the kids murdered off is revealed though, a whole barrage of questions arise that make the movie that much more unbelievable. At the top is how in the world could one agency or corporation capture and contain so many potential paranormal and psychotic threats, and there are a lot of them. The majority of them can pretty much be separated or reduced down to their base core: ghosts, demons, undead, cryptids, psychos, mutants and alien entities. I mean, there is so many of them, it would take an entire website to describe and identify them all. Another thing, how does a simple thick glass prison (shades of the 'Thirteen Ghosts' remake) contain the majority of them; what could possibly have been used as a deterrent to imprison the supernatural beings? Another unanswered question, why even have one switch in such an obvious accessible spot where just one irate employee or, in this case, one of the kids having sneaked into the facility could let everything loose at once. What is so laughable is that we see several of seemingly human psychos released who just walk through the carnage without getting attacked by the more powerful inhuman entities. (If Michael Myers or even Jack The Ripper crossed paths with Dracula or the living dead, psycho or not, they would be toast.) Is it just because they're wearing a costume? That is the true appeal and climax of the movie: seeing variations of every major and obscure horror character of other seventy years of cinema all at once in the movie from the Wolfman and zombies down to Pennywise the Clown and the Fifty-Foot Woman in one all-holds barred blood bath. That is why I liked this movie, and why it should appeal to aficionados of horror movies, even those purists who only care for haunted house movies or the deadheads who prefer slasher flicks. The only bad thing about 'Cabin In The Woods' would be I don't see a sequel possibly coming out of this carnage, except maybe a prequel showing just how this agency captured and contained all these entities.",9,2,4,30 January 2013
Back to the Future," Great movie, Lousy Reasoning
","Next to ghosts, time travel movies are widely entertaining when they throw fourth-dimensional reasoning out the window. Marty McFly goes back in time and prevents his parents from meeting so he vanishes, right. Wrong! He has already been born in a timeline that still exists in another Quantum reality. He's just a visitor from another future timeline apart from the one he altered.  The only reason to restore his parents' relationship would be to create a future along that timeline to go to in the first place. 'Don't forget to think fourth dimensionally.' says Dr. Emmett Brown, wonderfully played by Christopher Lloyd, but now the bane of his existence thanks to numerous would-be impressionists. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover fit right into the 1950 sequences, as does Thomas F. Wilson as the idiot/bully Biff. The script as are the culture shocks between the Fifties and the Eighties are wonderful and the cast does a wonderful job. This is a great movie for anyone to watch over and over, but it is best seen on video rather than with commercial interuptions.",9,1,2,27 January 2001
Jurassic Park," Feel The Magic
","This movie made me feel like a kid again. I loved dinosaurs as a kid and knew everything about them, but as I grew up my interests strayed to mythology and ghosts. This movie returned me to my youth by reminding me of the sheer awesome splendor of these extinct beasts. Joseph Mazzello plays what could me me as a child while Jeff Goldblum could be me as an adult, wise-cracking and one-lining myself in the face of danger. Sam Neil and Laura Dern are a wonderful couple, but the real stars of course are the dinosaurs. The explanation of their cloning is told very convincingly, albeit not without some infallibles. Am I to believe that the DNAs from the fifty odd dinosaurs that appear in the whole trilogy all came from one drop of blood in one mosquito ? That was one very busy little bug to hit that many creatures in one day. Maybe it had a preminition that the dinosaurs were about to die and that someday they would be cloned. Pretty convenient to say the least.",10,3,5,15 August 2001
Beetlejuice," Great Movie,Lousy Premise
","I'm a big fan of ghost movies,but I do tend to go into them with a certain knowledge of ghosts and paranormal activity. This movie seems to suggest that a sub-culture exists beyond our knowledge and has been developing into a society beyond the confines of our reality. This movie is pure Tim Burton as we see the point of view from the ghosts who realize that strangers have moved into their house and have to hire a poltergeist named Betelgeuse who must have been a really obnoxious New York City cab driver before he died. Michael Keaton is the title role with the least screen time, but he is so wild and crazy with his appearances that it's barely noticeable. Winona Ryder is the psychic daughter who feels his presence. Cute and gothic as Lydia Deets, this is definitely one of the highlights of her career. Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara are wildly eccentric as the new owners who viciously rearrange the ghost's enviroment and character actor Glenn Shadix puts in a great role as the wierdly eccentric kook who becomes a remorseful exorcist. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are the one-dimensional traffic cops in this barrage of humor and wildness as they experience Burton's slanted views of purgatory and the afterlife. This is where the movie really deviates from actual phenomenon and instead suggests that ghosts have civilized the afterlife instead of crossing over. I'm sorry but 'Casper' made more sense. The movie does succeed in creating images and dark visions straight from Tim Burton's imagination and that's where the appeal of the movie lays.  The Harry Belafonte score, however, is contagious, but the overall movie has a corny but hilarious laugh a second roller coast ride to it.I give it eight out of ten stars.",8,1,2,27 November 2000
