Resident Evil: Afterlife," rubbish
","Very Poor, the 3D effects are good but just a gimmick to make more money, the film strays from the other 3 films, Alice is no longer cool and hard as nails head of security type heroine which in turn makes this movie a normal zombie shoot em up with no direction. i loved the first 3 films and was looking forward to this one but I've been let down again by a money hungry Hollywood, at the end the villain gets part of his head blown off and filled with bullets and the impression left is that hes dead? great until 2mins later hes flying a helicopter with no explanation as to how he regenerated or how he got to the helicopter in the first place? there's a bomb on the helicopter, how did it get there? the film is a joke and the director should never be given this sort of money to make another film, bring back the original director",1,14,25,14 October 2010
