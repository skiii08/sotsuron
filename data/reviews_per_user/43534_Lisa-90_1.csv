The Blair Witch Project," Not for me!
","Wow, I can't believe all the hype. I'm not going to say anything too bad about it though as I know quite a few people who enjoyed it. I kept waiting for the movie to actually start and I haven't found two people who agree on what happened at the end yet.  This could be good or bad, depending on your take of the rest of the film. I'm glad I saw it in the theater though (I would have HAD to rent it) but at least it was big and boring.  Rated R??? I can't believe that either.",2,0,2,21 August 1999
