The Blair Witch Project," someone is making serious money...
","I saw this movie on its opening night in Miami after losing a coin-toss with my boyfriend.  I saw it with a mind untainted by hype, therefore I had almost no history on the movie except that it was supposed to be real footage.  With that in mind, these comments are from the perspective of a viewer who was skeptical at viewing time about authenticity and needed to find affirmation of doubts.Immediately after viewing the movie, I had a few criticism of the film, if not suggestions for the characters:  to begin- WEAPONS!  I would ask if anyone brought at least a boyscout knife, but everyone was so frightened during the movie, I doubt that it would be used anyway.  Plenty of sharp sticks hanging around, and piles of nice rocks for projectiles.  ...they didn't even try. second- DROP THE CAMERA AND RUN!  Is it dedication to their documentary, loyalty to Heather, or just plain craziness?  I understand that a movie would be a radio program without the visuals, but at some point even the most obsessed would value their life more than making a film.If one suspends disbelief, however, the film has some good qualities, which makes the premise work.  It was consistent in portraying all shots from the view of the two cameras as opposed to an audience view.  It was also plain in its style which made it seem like the work of film students.  Some shots were too deliberate in their use of space, focal point, etc. however, for someone who would be running or looking around out of fear and holding a camera.  Another good quality was that the characters seemed genuinely afraid.Despite the comments of other critics here, the fear-factor *is* there, depending on what one finds frightening.  For myself, the house at the end of the movie is not unlike houses that are in my nightmares, and not being able to escape from something that is chasing me has also been nightmare material for me.The good with the bad, what is my overall impression of the movie?  Hmm... I can't help but think of the impact of 'War of the Worlds' or of Milli Vanilli 'exposed'.  Maybe I just didn't get it from the beginning, that the viewer wasn't actually supposed to think that it was real.  Despite the movie's authenticity, or lack thereof, the real masterpiece is not the movie itself.  That is, this film probably shouldn't be critiqued on a movie website, but on one for marketing strategies.On that note, although I liked the movie from a cinematic point of view, I can't help but feel duped by the movie makers- like my money in their pocket is just one more chuckle for them.  I would recommend that the movie be seen, but in doing so, I would just be another victim of the marketing ploy of its creators.  My recommendation-  save the six bucks and put it towards your own $40,000 to make a multimillion dollar movie that's essentially all profit.",Null,0,1,12 August 1999
