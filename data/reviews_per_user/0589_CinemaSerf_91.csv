The Blair Witch Project," A racket - on multiple fronts....
","So three young folks go off into the wilderness in search of evidence to support the local Maryland legend of the 'Blair Witch'. Shortly afterwards, they lose their map, get lost - discover an old house; scream and cuss a lot.... A collection of three more odious folks I struggle to recollect seeing on screen. Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánches substitute noise for suspense; and despite the fact that they spend several nights (more than planned) out in the woods without food, the batteries for their camera seems to endure remarkably well as they run around in the dark edging ever closer to whatever grizzly fate they well deserve. This is an huge triumph for hype over content and the marketeers have done a truly remarkable job. Though I would advocate that you watch it; it would only be because it has become a film of cult status - which, like so many others in that 'elite' grouping, is a polite word for dross.",5,2,2,3 June 2020
Gremlins," A remake brought to you by (insert fast food chain here) for Christmas.
","Now I'm usually a fan of the whole '4K restoration thing' - it has brought 'The Elephant Man' and 'Notorious' back to the cinemas recently. Why, though, alight on 'Gremlins'? Surely this isn't just a cynical exploitation of the Christmas spirit? Nor can it be purely to spawn a new sales boom in cuddly toys and midnight-snack meal kits? The film was fine in 1984, original and quirky. Now, it is just a badly dated piece of comic cinema that was successfully throttled by it's own sequels never mind by the passing of time. Nope, sorry - 'Gizmo' ought to have been left in the toy box in the attic.",6,0,4,7 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An intergalactic means to an end, nothing more...
","Hmmm. I watched this again recently hoping that it wasn't as mediocre as I had thought first time around. Sadly, not. The opening scenes are great: a good fight with lots of action and lightsabres; then it descends into a sort of cross between 'Ben Hur' and 'The Golden Child' with some pantomime thrown in too. The film is clearly designed to be part one of another trilogy and as such spends way too much of its time setting the scenes and establishing the characters for the films to follow - we do start to get a sense of the evil 'Palpatine' and it looks spectacular, but it is basically pretty empty and soulless with a very weak storyline.",7,0,3,4 January 2020
Source Code," A certain feeling of déjà-vu...
","Jake Gyllenhaal is quite convincing as the army captain 'Colter Stevens' working on a secret military programme whereby his consciousness can be implanted into the body of another - but only for eight minutes at a time. When a bomb goes off on a commuter train he is tasked with going back - via the body of a teacher - to try and piece together what happened and apprehend the perpetrator. before it happens again. The one thing he cannot do, is prevent the explosion but as he continues to go back, time after time, he develops a fondness of a fellow passenger 'Christina' (Michelle Monaghan) and so he decides to establish just what he can actually do to help save her from her fate. His operators - Jeffrey Wright and Vera Farmiga have other plans for him, though, and as that realisation sinks in he must take perilous risks to break free from his digitally induced 'Groundhog Day'. It does lack pace; the very repetitive style of the storytelling negates the otherwise well paced urgency of the plot, and can grate after a while - at times it seems like quite a long 90 minutes. It's conceptually quite clever, however, and worth watching.",6,0,0,5 April 2020
50 First Dates," Quite a fun concept adequately executed...
","A harmless feel-good romantic comedy with Adam Sandler on usual form as a bit of a commitment-phobe. That is, until he meets 'Lucy' (Drew Barrymore') and he really thinks he has found true love. The snag is that she has some pretty serious short-term memory issues and so each time they meet, he has a sort of first date groundhog day to get through. This is a bit of a one joke movie, though some of the daily variations inject a little extra to the, sometimes laboured, prevailing theme. Decent enough performances from the leads - with a strong supporting cast (including Dan Ackroyd, Sean Astin & Rob Schneider) - make this a watchable, if forgettable rom-com.",6,1,1,14 March 2020
The Young Victoria," Needs a much stronger supporting cast to enable it to rise to the occasion...
","Historically - as far as the cinema is concerned - Queen Victoria was born well into her seventies. Rarely has anyone tried to depict her early years and sadly, this is a rather shallow attempt so to do. Emily Blunt portrays the Queen with some fortitude but the rather soppy performances from Rupert Friend and Paul Bettany don't give us anything like a proper comprehension of the struggle she had, as a (young) woman, to establish herself at the head of an empire riddled with chauvinism, ambition and pomposity. Miranda Richardson as her mother takes up some of the slack in this lacklustre effort with the occasional, wise, contribution from Harriet Walter as the dowager Queen Adelaide welcome too. If it is a love story, then it just about works - anything else is just too far out of reach.",6,0,0,1 December 2019
Spartacus," Whether or not Kubrick and Douglas saw eye-to-eye on this will always a subject of speculation, but what we got in the end could hardly have been improved.
","Kirk Douglas had the vision to back the previously black-listed Dalton Trumbo with his excellent screenplay for this epic tale of slavery and the struggle for freedom. He also led a cast with some of the best actors to ever grace the silver screen. Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov, Curtis and a wonderfully tender Jean Simmons who all lift this tale of a slave who rebelled against the tyrannical rule of his Roman masters and inspired thousands to follow him (and to perish) as they strove to escape, then defeat the armies of Rome. The cinematography, colour, costumes are all the stuff of artists and Alex North creates a score that carries the intimate and the grand scenes in equal measure. The principles of struggle against oppression and of brotherly loyalty ring true even now, and this film is so much more than a sword-and-sandals melodrama.",8,0,1,8 December 2019
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Hand crafted animation with plenty of pedigree, chum!
","A fine Disney animated adaptation of the gentle Dodie Smith tales of a couple who have a pair of Dalmatian dogs who have a litter to make Noah shudder.... The evil 'Cruella de Vil' cottons on to this almost endless supply of material for her future fur coats and sends her hapless flunkies to do some devious dognapping. Aside from Rod Taylor as the daddy dog ('Pongo') the assembled voice talents are lesser known (if at all) actors who put their heart and soul into the characterisations - especially Betty Lou Gerson as the evil 'de Vil' and J. Pat O'Malley as the redoubtable 'Colonel' who helps the parents mount a rescue of their spotted little darlings . It's a tightly scripted, enjoyable and fun story that almost seems crammed into 80 minutes.",7,0,0,28 March 2020
Mulan," A fun story of myth and determination ruined by a dragon...
","Disney heads East for this fantasy adventure, this time based on an ancient myth from Imperial Chinese folklore. The Hun hordes are attacking the ancient kingdom and the Emperor must rally every troop he can to defend the nation. His riders travel far and wide calling upon all his men to join the army. They arrive at the home of 'Mulan' and rather then send her ageing father, she decides to impersonate a boy and go join the fight. There is plenty of action in this much darker animation; the evil 'Shan-Yu' has devilish, piercing eyes and the use of darker colours and hues - alongside heavy drum-based themes from Jerry Goldsmith goes some way to project a decent sense of menace on the latter half of the film. 'Mulan' herself, though spending half of the film pretending, turns out to be a feisty heroine easily the match of her male counterparts. So, why only 6/20 - well: Eddie Murphy drove me mad. 'Mushu' was as irritating as he was noisy; a hammer to crack a nut - so overblown as to largely ruin the film for me.",6,0,1,3 April 2020
Darkest Hour," Oldman is superb as the Old Man...
","A tour de force from Gary Oldman as he portrays Winston Churchill in his first few months of office at the start of WWII. Oddly enough though, aside from a few brief appearances from Kristin Scott-Thomas, the rest of the cast in this historical biopic are really quite unremarkable. The speeches are delivered magnificently; but there are too many speculative machinations going on - not least those involving King George VI - that do bring the credibility of this into question. There was plenty of accurately documented reportage from this time to enable Anthony McCarten to pen an entertaining script based more on the facts of this unsteady period of Churchill's premiership; Dunkirk; his relationship with Halifax & Roosevelt etc. rather than invent storylines. The attention to detail is superb and well deserved the second Oscar.",7,0,0,29 January 2020
Underworld," Lots of tongue-in-cheek acrobatics and leather-clad antics.
","I quite enjoyed this. True, it isn't the most original concept and we have oft seen similar styles of treatment of ancient rivalries, but Kate Beckinsale and Michael Sheen are engaging enough in this tale of vampires v werewolves. Scott Speedman provides the eye candy (but very little else) and Bill Nighy is superbly over the top as the recently raised from his slumbers 'Viktor'. It isn't for the purists of the genre, but a perfectly watchable 2 hours of escapism.",7,1,1,25 December 2019
Captain Marvel," One Marvel too many?
",Hmmm! This is really quite poor considering the resources thrown at it and the pretty decent cast assembled. The characters don't quite get off the comic-book page; no amount of CGI can animate the script and the stars simply don't shine enough to compensate. It's all just a bit too formulaic and lacking in novelty or innovation.,6,1,2,26 November 2019
Argo," The best movie of 2012 - Oscar, BAFTA & Golden Globes said so...
","Hindsight always allows liberties to be taken with facts when making a film like this, so it is probably best not to try and scrutinise too closely the actual (train of) events in this really gripping tale of half a dozen US citizens caught up in the capture of their Embassy in revolution-fuelled Tehran in 1979. Offered refuge by the Canadian Ambassador they remain for months until the CIA (hmmm?!) hatch a cunning plan to get them the hell out of there before the new rulers manage to discover they are missing from their mission. The wheeze is to turn them into a crew of Canadian film-makers and with the aide of Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) who arrives in Iran to ostensibly advise the team, they plan their project - a film called 'Argo' - to facilitate their freedom. The usually reliable Bryan Cranston (Jack O'Donnell) is on really good form, as is Tate Donovan and a cracking Alan Arkin (producer Lester Siegel) and the pace develops in a tense, edge-of-your-seat style right until the end. The dialogue is plausible reflecting, well, the mounting tension they feel after living day-to-day in fear not just of their own lives, but of those sheltering them. Affleck's best effort to date, in my book.",7,0,0,5 April 2020
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," I love Turkish Delight too....
","CS Lewis certainly had one heck of an imagination and it is rarely better exemplified than in this lovely fantasy adventure. 4 wartime siblings are evacuated from London to stay with the reclusive 'Professor Kirke' (Jim Broadbent ) in the relative safety of the English countryside. Once they get there, the housekeeper 'Mrs. Macready' (Elizabeth Hawthorne) makes it quite clear that they are to be seen and not heard! Boredom sets in and thus a game of hide and seek seems sensible. 'Lucy' takes refuge in an old wardrobe - a wardrobe that has a secret! Much to her astonishment, she finds herself in a snowy land with a single streetlamp and there meets 'Mr. Tumnus' (James McAvoy) - a scarf-clad faun. She returns to her brothers and sister and after some convincing, they join her in the wardrobe and all discover the delights and dangers of 'Narnia' meeting loads of new friends and a couple of not so nice wolves, too! This is the first of the adventures of the 'Pevensie' children in this mysterious land where animals can talk and winter is perpetual under the control of the villainous 'White Witch' (Tilda Swinton). They align with 'Aslan' the all powerful lion (voiced by Liam Neeson) and have a battle royal to free the kingdom from her icy grip. The CGI isn't, to be honest, great. Indeed, some of the effects are a bit cheap and cheerful for 2005; but the story, settings and characterisations are great - as is Harry Gregson-Williams' eerie and gentle score.",7,0,0,31 March 2020
Public Enemies," The bullets miss as often as the rest of it...
","This is a stunningly good looking movie about the battle between organised crime and the emerging FBI in the USA in the 1930s. Johnny Depp is the charismatic Robin Hood style bank robber John Dillinger who has escaped from prison and embarks on a crime spree that makes the authorities look hapless. J Edgar Hoover drafts in Christian Bale to lead the Chicago office and stop Dillinger at all costs. The film now proceeds to depict the long, very long, relentless game of frequently publicly-fought cat and mouse game between them; with plenty more bank robberies; protracted gun battles and, occasionally some style. Depp and Bale are rarely on screen together and the rest of the supporting cast; except, maybe Marion Cotillard - really don't pull together ands the story quickly becomes repetitive and really quite dull. Depp carries off his part well, raising his character from the reputed thug to someone who did care for his loved ones, and who certainly had a more benevolent side. There has been a considerable degree of effort put into the costumes, cars and general aesthetic of the film, but given we all already know what happens at the end it just isn't enough to keep it interesting for 140 minutes!",6,0,0,8 May 2020
The Other Boleyn Girl," Very definitely style over substance... and script.
","Except, it isn't really much about the 'other' Boleyn girl is it? Eric Bana never could hold a film together, and he can't here either. Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman play the Boleyn girls well enough with strong, if brief, contributions from Kristin Scott-Thomas and Mark Rylance. This is really quite an imperfect adaptation of quite an insipid story from Henry VIII's reign that is one for fans of a good costume drama big on costumes but less so on drama...",6,0,0,10 December 2019
Us," You can leave your brain at home for this...
","A run of the mill family on holiday are terrorised by their seemingly immortal doppelgängers. I liked this - it's not remotely scary, in fact it is actually quite funny - in a perverse sort of way. The acrobatic kids cavorting about with limbs that bend (and break) every which way. It's hardly original, either - you'll have seen plenty other films in the same vein - but it is FUN! It's not quite two hours of escapism that makes no pretence to be otherwise. (Yes, the ending is pretty darned dreadful!).",7,3,4,9 December 2019
Elizabeth," Historical pinches of salt required...
","A very good looking depiction of the early reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I with Oscar-nominated Cate Blanchett in the title role. Initially, she struggles to stay alive during the reign of her devoutly Catholic (a superbly cast Kathy Burke) half-sister Mary, with the help of her childhood friend Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes). These risks do not diminish at all once she succeeds to the throne and faces conspiracies and plots from all around. It's not the most historically accurate version of her early reign, but Richard Attenborough, Geoffrey Rush and a devious, unscrupulous schemer in Christopher Eccleston as the Duke of Norfolk keep this intrigue of treachery, betrayal and power moving along tautly. Michael Hirst has a definite penchant for writing of the Tudor times and Shekhar Kapur brings the costumes and palaces alive with some creative direction.",7,0,0,4 March 2020
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Seez pwa de moi
","I suppose your view on this will very much depend on whether or not you like (or at least appreciate) the Eurovision Song Contest - much of the humour derives from decades of the subjugation of Europe by this: the epitome of campness, talentlessness, political bias and general tone deafness! If you do, then this will work; if not - then don't waste your time. Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams are good as a couple who ever since Abba won in 1974, have been inspired to take part in the competition, representing their home nation of Iceland. After an exhaustive selection process - involving a bin and some CDs - they find themselves auditioning and well... you can guess the rest. It swipes at just about everything from the corny looks/lyrics; huge - frequently calamitous - staging; dodgy judging and just about anything American but it also manages to tap into what makes the whole event work - it's gentle sense of national pride; of silliness - epitomised by a superbly smouldering Dan Stevens as 'Alexander Lemtov', the gorgeous, super sleazy Russian candidate - who is clearly enjoying himself. Graham Norton (who hosts the real BBC coverage in the UK) is as taciturn as ever as the event is showcased in Edinburgh. It is not, however, particularly well written; the jokes are a bit low-brow and the romance between the two characters is, frankly, quite distracting from the point of the whole thing. I have to admit that it did take me a good half an hour to recognise Pierce Brosnan! Oddly enough, there just isn't enough music in it - but it is still fun, if forgettable",6,2,9,26 June 2020
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," 'Did you know that ostriches have suicidal tendencies...?'
","Jake Gyllenhaal is clearly having a good time as he portrays 'Dastan' the adopted street-urchin son of the Shah of Persia. Along with the two true sons of the Emperor, they lay siege to the holy city of Alamut where the beautiful Gemma Arterton is the inviolable princess. Based on some dodgy intelligence, they attack and capture the city. When their furious father (Ronald Pickup) arrives to establish what drove them to this sacrilege, he dons a glittering prayer robe and mysteriously dies. Dastan, who presented it to him, is blamed. He escapes (with the princess) and tries to stay one step ahead of his pursuing former family - and of some ostrich-racing slavers before saving the world and proving his innocence by way of a magical dagger than can alter time itself. It's a great, action-packed little adventure feature with Ben Kingsley adding some theatrical ham as his wicked uncle 'Nizam' and Alfred Molina as the man with the ostriches. You don't need to know anything about the game to watch - it's just good family entertainment with a good looking, if somewhat bedraggled, top biller.",7,2,2,29 March 2020
Knives Out," A good effort in this hard-to-innovate genre.
","This is good - but it isn't great. Ana de Armas competently, if not vibrantly, takes centre stage with Daniel Craig - sporting a deep Kentuckian accent - playing the Poirot-esque private detective role. Chris Evans leads the remainder of this accomplished, if somewhat under-utilised cast in a murder-mystery caper that doesn't quite have the brio I'd hoped for. It moves along well enough, though and is good fun to watch. It just doesn't quite catch fire. It dips a bit in the middle too, and could probably lose about 20 minutes without compromising the story very much (if at all). You won't guess the ending - unless you have a crystal ball - so it's certainly worth going to see.",7,10,26,27 November 2019
The Irishman," The 'A' Team if ever there was one....
","This is a gripping piece of cinema. Messrs. Scorsese, Pesci, De Niro & Pacino deliver a gangster movie like no other. It is a little bit long but that was really only an issue for my circulation in a rather old cinema seat. The 3Â½ hours flew by. True, we still don't actually know what happened to Jimmy Hoffa but this film offers a compelling and engrossing narrative as to what might have happened, not just to him, but to the whole Mafia-led enterprise that dominated parts of the USA in the sixties and seventies. Whether Charles Brandt's book - upon which this is based - be true, or not is almost academic. This doesn't set out to deliver history, it sets out to deliver a theory, and it does so with style and panache and illustrates with distinction the toxicity of the political situation at the time with all of its concomitant violence, thuggery and nastiness. Excellent!",8,4,10,16 November 2019
Alexander," Worth a conversation, but maybe not about the film itself....
","Opinion on this film seems to have been hijacked somewhat by the definition and appropriateness of the relationship between Alexander (Farrell) and Hephaestion (Leto). It seems daft to try to apply 21st century social morals onto a society in which same sex relationships were simply unremarkable. Whether or not it was about sex, or love, or both isn't really that important - I think Oliver Stone was trying to involve us in a much more complex story of human nature. It may also be more of an Anglo-Saxon thing - men on Continental Europe from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean (and their N. American descendants) have a completely different, relaxed, view towards tactility amongst men. What this discussion does do successfully, however, is distract us from a pretty lacklustre effort at an epic. The film has grandeur and style but really does lack substance. It has all the grit of a beauty pageant. The script is wordy and weak, and characterisations way too shallow given we have effectively a blank canvas from which to work and an almost unlimited timeframe in which to tell the story. Inevitably, it does draw comparisons with Richard Burton and Frederic March's version from 1956 but not favourably; the all star cast here just doesn't really gel in the same way and the CGI isn't anywhere near as convincing as the real photography of the earlier iteration. Overall, a very well resourced missed opportunity to tell the tale of one of history's most enigmatic characters.",6,0,1,10 January 2020
The Mummy," Good harmless, if brainless, fun....
","This is just a good bit of fun. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz star as the unlikely couple who set off to discover the golden treasures of Pharaoh Seti I. Alongside her hapless, scaredy-cat brother (John Hannah) they encounter the Mummy - an epitome of evil, disease and destruction - and engage in a battle royale to defeat this monstrous reincarnation. Stephen Sommers keeps this moving along well, and there is enough in the script to make you smile now and again. Perhaps not a film to be too closely scrutinised by any Egyptologists out there, but it's an enjoyable little romp through a rarely exploited vein of ancient mythology.",7,0,0,7 December 2019
Troy," Watchable epic effort but more about the look than the story
","Now then, where do we start? On the plus side, this is one of the more intelligent applications of CGI in an historical drama setting. The film delivers lots of epic grandeur; the at sea-scenes/battles are classily produced and the attention to detail across the costume and prop departments is outstanding. Sadly, though, the acting isn't at all joined up. At bit like the Dutch football team of the 1980s, we have lots of individual stars but relatively little cohesion between them. Peter O'Toole brings some gravitas as Priam, bit otherwise it's a loose collection of A-lister performances that try their best with a staccato script and some fairly clunky direction. As an end-to-end adventure film, it isn't as bad as it has been accused of being, but it definitely could have done with a deal more emphasis on the characterisation - Brian Cox is dreadful as Agamemnon; Brad Pitt (Achilles), and particularly Eric Bana (Hector) are shockingly wooden; Orlando Bloom (Paris) & Garrett Hedlund (Patroclus) appear there merely as eye-candy and Diane Kruger as the one who launched the thousand ships sounded more like Celine Dion every time she spoke.",6,0,1,10 January 2020
Chicken Run," 'I'm a chicken... the RAF don't let chickens fly planes...'
","Ok, there is an huge temptation to riddle this review with puns - but I'm just going to say it's a cracking little family adventure. It's seemingly based on a whole range of classic movies from the 'Great Escape', 'Star Trek' to 'Love Story' with a score cannibalised from just about any/everything ever written by Messrs. Korngold/Williams & Bernstein all adding to this really super stop-motion animation that Ray Harryhausen would have been proud of.. A flock of chickens are relentlessly exploited for their eggs by the evil 'Mrs Tweedy' - that is, until 'Rocky' (an on-form Mel Gibson) arrives over the fence and incites escape plans... Meantime their malevolent owner (Miranda Richardson) has plans to industrialise production - and this time, not just of the eggs... It's a fun frolic, this - with great vocal performances from Jane Horrocks, Julia Sawalha and Benjamin Whitrow as the rather pompous RAF spotter chicken 'Fowler'. Nick Park and Peter Lord - and the wonderfully imaginative Aardman team - have built upon their 'Wallace and Gromit' experience and created some charming characters with some great lines for both the young, and the formerly young. Certainly a film you can leave the kids alone in front of the telly to.",7,0,0,18 June 2020
The Jungle Book," A great story and great tunes... just great!
","This has probably the most perfect balance of story and soundtrack of any film I've ever seen - animated or otherwise. Adapting Rudyard Kipling's tale of 'Mowgli' the child abandoned in the Indian jungle, but rescued and raised by a family of wolves. 'Bagheera', the sagacious panther realises as the boy starts to grow to manhood, that he ought to return to his own kind but 'Baloo', the avuncular bear thinks otherwise and so takes our young man-cub on some fun adventures in the jungle - including some near-misses with the wonderfully menacing, sardonic tiger 'Shere Khan' and 'Kaa' the hypnotic python. The voice cast - especially Phil Harris as the bear and George Sanders as the tiger are great; Louis Prima as 'Louie' the King of the Apes provides us with one of the best songs ever to feature in a Disney film - and the Sherman brothers provide a great slew more of them for us to enjoy, too. The detail in the animations and the humour in the script are super - this really is a must watch.",7,0,0,4 April 2020
A Bridge Too Far," Faithful rendition of a perilous WWII operation.
","Usually when you read the term 'stellar' applied to a cast, it's more for marketing purposes to convince us that the cast is better than we might want to think - well not so, here. Connery, Caine, O'Neal, Olivier, Bogarde, Hackman, Hopkins, Caan, Schell & Liv Ullmann all chip into this true telling of 'Operation Market Garden' - a co-ordinated attempt by the allies to use almost anything that will fly to parachute troops behind Nazi lines. Their purpose: to secure strategically important river crossings before the enemy have a chance to blow them to smithereens. Their missions are fraught with dangers - bad intelligence, bad weather as well as a tenacious and well established enemy. The planning and actions scenes give a clear dramatic indication of just how logistically complex and risky this whole procedure actually would have been; and as war films go it is much less gung-ho. It is, however, very long - and a bit more judicious editing would have helped keep it more taut.",7,0,0,28 March 2020
Ready Player One," 'Enders Game' seeks a glass elevator...
","There is more than a passing resemblance to 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is this great looking sci-fi tale of a creative genius (Mark Rylance) who bequeaths his entire OASIS business empire to the gamer who can play the games, unlock the keys and solve the ultimate puzzle. I am neither a gamer, nor have I read Ernest Cline's novel upon which this is actually based - so can only speak from an entertainment perspective. It isn't a great film - the swapping between reality and avatar existences gets annoying after a while and Tye Sheridan as the hero 'Parzival' is not Spielberg's best casting choice - he struggles to be convincing as either the nerdy geek or the sexy super-hero as he and sassy Olivia Cooke 'Art3mis' determine to win this dream competition. Arch baddie Ben Mendelsohn is a sort of 'Cyber-Slugworth' though without any real menace, from a rival company who is also trying to solve the puzzle that will hand him control of this industrial nirvana and as we see, will stop at 'virtually' nothing to thwart their enterprise. It's end-to-end stuff and visual effects are superb but at 2 hours and 20, it is way too long for the two principal actors to spin out, despite some effort going into a decent soundtrack accompaniment.",7,1,1,4 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," May the Farce be with you....
","I don't quite know how to describe how disappointing this is. Ordinarily, I would expect to be shouting from the rooftops about it all but it's so poor. John Williams usually scores outstandingly well to compliment the action, but here he seems to be trying his best to replace it - the story at any rate, which is completely lacking in just about everything . The 'Kylo Ren' character has never sat well - his constant personal conflicts would have 'Darth Vader' spinning in his grave. The telepathic conversations between him and 'Rey' are confusing, irritating and half the time don't add up - is he the baddie or isn't he?. The fight/battle scenes are superbly created but are far too long and there is an unenjoyable inevitability about them - Stormtrooper training seems predicated on the principle of the more of you that there are, and the better kit you have, then the more likely you are to be overwhelmingly defeated by someone wielding an electric toothbrush. Boyega, Isaac and Ridley are fine, they do their jobs - but there is no charisma on the screen; and nothing special about their performances. The idea that a state of the art interplanetary battle cruiser is being attacked by some folks on horse(?)back is absurd; and there is at best only a laughable attempt to create any menace or fear in the First (thankfully, also the Last) Order. It's end to end stuff, but to what end is more the point. Billy Dee Williams and Chewbacca do their best on occasion and C3PO has some quite witty one-liners; but Mark Hamill and, particularly Carrie Fisher, just seem to be there for the sake of it. Certainly the weakest of these last 3 Bad Robot efforts; and you certainly appreciate the chasm between this and the original trilogy.",6,5,19,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Sorry, younglings - far too much romance, not enough action...
","Romance really does know how to suck the fizz out of an adventure film! Here, with the complicit contribution of John Williams' string accompaniment we have to endure the nauseating love story between Hayden Christensen ('Anakin') and Natalie Portman ('Padmé'). Couldn't they just have got a room? 'Palpatine' has seen to it that Ewan McGregor has now been charged with guiding his young pupil to fulfil his potential with the 'Force' but without being elevated to the status of Jedi master, so he is naturally a tad narked about that. Luckily for us, though, he discovers that there is a secret army of clones ('Jango Fett' lookalikes dressed a lot like Stormtroopers and just as useless in a fight) and so with the help of 'Yoda' et al, he rallies the Jedi order against the evil 'Count Dooku' (Christopher Lee). Away from the slush, it's a good action fantasy and the last half hour redeems it somewhat. Worth watching if you like the series, but a very poor relation of it's older cousins.",7,1,2,9 February 2020
The Lost City of Z," Interesting story of grim determination...
","This is a slow burn, but worth the effort of sticking with as Charlie Hunnam takes on the role of real-life explorer Col. Percy Fawcett; who is initially charged with sorting out a tiresome border dispute between the colonial powers in Bolivia. Accompanied by his aide - Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson) they set off and battle exhaustion, disease, heat and natives on their quest. They also, surprisingly, discover evidence of a civilisation so vow to return - better equipped, and despite the concerns of Fawcett's wife (a somewhat stoically resigned Sienna Miller) - to find the source of these artefacts. Despite their best efforts, again the elements defeat them; then WWI intervenes before, finally - and this time with the support of his son Jack (Tom Holland) they go back for a final attempt. We know not what happened to them all so the narrative is somewhat speculative, especially at the end, but it does build a clear picture of the grim determination of the man; clearly inherited by his son, to seek out 'Z'. It is too long, there is a repetitive element to the search/retreat/search again structure of James Gray's film that does lead to bouts on ennui at times; the photography is beautiful and conveys the relentlessness of the unforgiving forest - but just a bit too often. That said, though, this is a fine piece of acting from Hunnam showing that he is not just an handsome lad with limited scope.",6,0,0,3 April 2020
Ant-Man," Quite a good, vertically challenged, heist movie...
","Paul Rudd ('Scott Lang') commits a crime of principle that results in his going to jail. When he comes out to his daughter and ex-wife (married to a cop), he can't even get a job selling ice cream. Desperate times call for desperate measures and he finds himself robbing a vault in which he discovers a strange suit. When he dons it, he shrinks to the size of an ant and attains super strength. Scared by this, he attempts to take it back but is arrested ninth attempt then finds himself enveloped in a complex plot lead by Michael Douglas ('Dr. Hank Pym') to regain control of the company that built it all from the megalomanic control of Corey Stoll ('Darren Cross'). It's quite an enjoyable tech-fantasy and Rudd brings a good deal of fun to the role as he tries to save the world... The SFX are cleverly executed and it is fast paced. The dialogue, however is rather uninspiring and the set-piece nature of many of the action scenes grow repetitive after the umpteenth time. At 2 hours long, it could do with a bit of judicious trimming to compact it down a bit - but it is, nonetheless, quite an enjoyable comedy sci-fi.",7,0,0,5 April 2020
Nightcrawler," Long before there was 'fake news' there were odious newsmen...
","Jake Gyllenhaal is superbly charismatic and worryingly plausible in this story about a failed con man who discovers there is a living to be made from tapping into police communications and then getting to the scene of the crimes to film and sell on the incidents to the constantly avaricious news organisations. He finds one such character in Rene Russo, the editor of an under-performing news channel. Together they form a relationship that fuels both of their almost psychopathic needs for attention and success, with little regard for the truth - indeed he soon loses perspective between reacting to crimes and starts to create opportunity. Riz Ahmed is good, too, as his sidekick. It's a bit on the long side, but sharply directed.",7,0,1,18 February 2020
Bird Box," A trill a minute....
","Sandra Bullock and her two children have to flee from a lethal monster/creature/thing that is out to infect and possess all of mankind. They must use every skill and sense at their disposal to reach the last safe haven for mankind. Every sense, that is, except for their eyesight - the evil force is a bit like Medusa, you don't want to look at it or you are toast! Derivative is the word - 'Falling Skies' meets 'War of the Worlds' in Filene's basement; augmented occasionally by John Malkovich and even Tom Hollander. It's way too long, the story lacks any kind of suspense or sense of danger and after about an hour you would gladly swap your blindfold for ear plugs. It it were not for the calibre of the cast, it would just be written off as a mediocre TV movie.",6,0,0,25 June 2020

What's happened to Henry Cavill's face? Wasn't Grant Gustin available? Luckily for Amy Adams she rarely features in this B-movie; hell even the special effects remind me of early X-men stuff. Really not good.....",4,1,1,24 December 2019
"I, Robot"," An enjoyable race-against-the-machine thriller...
","Will Smith is a cop who detests artificial intelligence with a vengeance; despite the fact that he has a substantial part of his body made up of enhanced prosthetics after a car accident. When an executive from the world's largest robot production company commits suicide, he has to investigate and soon discovers a plot to take subjugate humanity. 'I Robot' is a clever exposÃ© on how AI could take over the world; largely by capitalising on the indifference of people, our obsession with convenience and reliance on technology. Smith and Bridget Moynahan - and Alan Tudyk as 'Sonny' a rogue robot designed to reveal the plot - turn in good fun performances as we try to stop the robot revolution. It's quite a well written and pacily directed couple of hours.",7,0,0,18 February 2020
American Beauty," You will never look at your neighbours in the same way again...
","Despite all the plaudits - including 5 Oscars, 6 BAFTAs and 3 Golden Globes - I didn't love this film. It focuses on the trials and tribulations of ostensibly happy, humdrum daily life with all of the idiosyncrasies engendered by the bored, frustrated and jealous people whose lives are pretty empty of meaningful experiences from day to day. I struggled from the outset to see why anyone would be besotted with the rather skeletal 'Angela' (Mena Suvari); perhaps that is what makes Kevin Spacey's performance so appreciable as the pretty unlikeable voyeur ('Lester'). Are we supposed to like him; sympathise with him, hate him - all of those? I didn't know - and I don't suppose that I really bothered much either. His self-induced mid-life crisis was rather tedious as a storyline, regardless of the actor's (superb) quality of character delivery. Clearly Sam Mendes had a vision for this - but like life itself, it is all over the place. By the time we get to the repressed gay aspects of 'Lester' and the shame/depression and brutality that it appears to evoke from his thoroughly flawed personality I needed to come up for air... Without a doubt it is a well constructed piece of cinema, but the underlying complexities are so convoluted as to render it little more than an over-long sad indictment of American suburban existence where all human life appears to exist within one single street...",7,0,0,30 March 2020
Salt," A Jolie good action thriller....
","Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a CIA operative who having recently been repatriated in a Korean prisoner swap, is back behind a desk looking forward to going home to her arachnologist husband. On her way out of the door, she and her boss 'Ted' (Liev Schreiber) are diverted to deal with an hitherto unknown Russian who in the course of his interrogation names her as a Russian spy. Now we hit 'Bourne' meets 'Lara Croft' mode as she is determined to get back to her husband and to prove she is not an enemy agent before Chitiwel Ejiofor ('Peadbody') and his FBI buddies nail her slats to the mast. It's end to end action with lots of car chases, explosions, gun battles and the usual red herrings as she tries to hunt down the real bad guys. It is an action thriller, not a documentary - so don't expect Pulitzer standard writing nor for it to be especially plausible or to make much sense; it's just a good old take-over-the-world adventure movie with decent performances all round.",6,4,4,22 March 2020
Van Helsing," Just a jumble of dark fairy tales and rotten SFX.
","Sorry, but this is just all over the place. A potpourri of myths and legends loosely connected with the famous vampire hunter that just don't gel at all. Doctor Jekyll, Mr Hyde, Victor Frankenstein and his monster all vie with Count Dracula for the attention of a really rather lacklustre Hugh Jackman in the title role. Kate Beckinsale sort-of recreates her 'Underworld' role as she becomes his kick-ass sidekick. It's fairly action-packed but the scenes go on for far too long, the script is cheesy, the CGI just isn't great and the attempts at humour don't work well either.",6,1,2,25 December 2019
Divergent," Theo-cracy gone a bit crazy!
","Ever since I saw him in a UK television drama entitled 'Bedlam' (2011) I thought that Theo James ('Number Four') was a man to watch. He was certainly the hook that got me to start watching these adaptations of Veronica Roth's futuristic novels. Well, beauty can only take you so far; the rest has to be down to acting; dialogue etc. and this falls pretty flat on all counts. The premiss is unique - society is divided into five factions based on a perception of virtue. At 16, teenagers have to decide which they have and then they spend their lives living up to the ideals - involving strenuous mental and physical trials. 'Tris Prior' (Shailene Woodley') is an exception, however - she doesn't fit into any one category - and so the system has no idea how to cope with this renegade. When she reveals her confused status to James - her trainer - we embark on a tale of cat and mouse as she and a rag-bag gang of misfits set out to save a world that deems them all as a serious threat. It certainly looks good - budget clearly was not an huge issue, and it is broadly faithful to the book but therein lies the problem - it is a preposterous proposition from the outset - it has not even the weakest of anchors from the society we know today (i.e. how the hell could we ever have gotten ourselves into this kind of dystopian mess in the first place?). When romance begins to rear it's head too, then I started to forget how sexy Theo actually is and wonder what else I could watch... There are clearly some parallels with 'The Hunger Games' series, but this one definitely comes off a very poor second.",6,0,0,29 March 2020
Duck You Sucker," 'Duck, you sucker...'
","Another wonderfully ground-breaking western from Sergio Leone with a memorable score from Ennio Morricone - this time with Rod Steiger as a bit of a low life bandit who encounters James Coburn - a IRA explosives expert on the run from the British. The story is told in tandem timelines as we discover just what brought Coburn to revolutionary Mexico in the first place and the current scenario as he and Steiger gradually develop their relationship from potential bank robbers to something way more sophisticated and inter-reliant. Along the way we've got plenty of humour, action - explosives galore - with some fine photography of the locale. At times, it can be a little too unnecessarily violent - particularly once they become more involved in the revolution; but Steiger and Coburn are great.",7,0,0,25 April 2020
The Duchess," An elegant, lavish, but soulless, reflection of high society...
","In theory, a more sophisticated period drama based on the true story of Georgiana (Keira Knightley), an aristocrat married off to a loveless marriage with the enormously wealthy and politically influential Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes). She is treated little better than a brood mare in fancy dress but has way to much independent spirit to settle for that and is soon having an affaire de coeur with Dominic Cooper 'Earl Grey' (yes, he of the tea...). Meantime, the Duke has taken a mistress and so the film depicts how our multiple ménages-à-trois work out. It very much emphasises the (very) limited choices of women in 18th Century Britain - regardless of their status - but unfortunately, save for a few brief appearances by Charlotte Rampling - the characterisations were way too sterile for me. It is a great looking costume drama, though - some of the finest stately homes shown off to their best effect but in the end it was much more style than substance.",5,0,0,4 March 2020
Yesterday," Luckily Jack Barth & Richard Curtis don't write songs....
","Sorry - but I don't understand. How can you take quite an original idea - man gets hit by a bus and awakens to a parallel existence where only he remembers the Beatles - and turn it into this one-joke film? Himesh Patel, himself, is quite engaging but he has nowhere near enough to work with to stretch this out for two whole hours!! Lily James tries her best to assist but there's no getting away from a very weak screenplay. The soundtrack is superb but most of that was written elsewhere 50-odd years ago.There is a sort-of swipe at the modern day music business and at the industries that support 'solo' artists, but any potential for a more satiric review of the business is lost in the banality of it. Pity!",5,2,4,27 November 2019
Independence Day," Ye ha! Will Smith saves the world...
","If you like your sci-fi full of gung-ho machismo then this one ought to cut the mustard. On the face of it, it is quite an engaging story of mankind uniting in the face of overwhelming odds - a sort of blitz spirit. There to save us all from the pending oblivion is Bill Pullman as the President, Jeff Goldblum as the scientist and Will Smith as the epitome of the American 'kick-ass' air force pilot. The plot is terrible; the sentiment oozingly American and the script lacking in any kind of subtlety. This is still a good old lock 'n load action movie, just don't look for depth, or style....",7,1,1,18 December 2019
Mamma Mia!," Just good fun - don't overthink it!
","How can anyone not like this? Phyllida Lloyd has managed to convince half a dozen serious A-list stars to take part in this Mediterranean musical extravaganza. Meryl Streep and Christine Baranksi are cracking and Julie Walters - when the three together sing 'Chiquitita' is glorious. Sure, it's not a wonderful piece of classic cinema; but it must bring a smile to your face (even if - as Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgård or Colin Firth break into song, it's more of a grimace). Dominic Cooper makes a valiant effort as 'Sky' who is to wed the orchestrator of this whole predicament 'Sophie' who has invited the three men to her wedding in the hope that she might find out which of them might be her father. If you don't like ABBA and musical theatre, then don't waste your time; otherwise this is just good fun!",7,0,2,3 January 2020
The Favourite," Didn't live up to the hype.
","Queen Anne was one of the few British monarchs still to have had her story committed to film and this was the Oscar winning result. Olivia Coleman stands out as the cantankerous and temperamental last of the Stuart's to reign; but otherwise the performances fall rather flat. The rivalry - and sometimes pretty vulgar visualisation of it - between Abigail & Sarah Churchill doesn't quite work for me and the foppish Nicholas Hoult is a parody of something from 'Blackadder'. It moves along quite sharpishly, and the craft skills behind it all are second to none, but I can't help feel that the subject matter - and the triplet of three strong women in leading roles earned it more attention that the film actually merited.",7,1,3,30 November 2019
Foxcatcher," I couldn't help feeling that, in the end, they reaped what they sowed...
","Steve Carell is really good as the enigmatic John du Pont, a millionaire who takes the Schultz brothers - a duo of American Olympic wrestling champions under his wing. Channing Tatum is pretty wooden as Mark with Mark Ruffalo much better as his sibling David. The story focuses more on the erratic, downright selfish behaviour of du Pont as he desperately seeks some sort of validation which; despite his enormous wealth, he needs more than anything from his contemporaries. The brothers become little more than his pawns, and soon it all begins to impact on their wellbeing and sanity - not to mention their success as sportsmen. The story is interesting, but there's no getting away from the rather mediocre performance from Tatum. Vanessa Redgrave pops up occasionally as Jean du Pont (the mother) and at times Bennett Miller almost had me invest enough in the pair to care; but in the end I just didn't - and at over 2 hours it started to become more of a marathon to watch than to run.",6,0,0,20 March 2020
It Follows," Dangers of going too far!!
","Now everyone has had, hopefully only occasionally, a night of bad sex... well, nobody has had a night to compare with poor old Maika Monroe '(Jay') who after a one night stand finds herself haunted by a fairly malevolent supernatural creature. The first ten minutes are actually quite promising but... sadly, that's really the height of it - it now just becomes another slightly scary teen-flick with a set of characters who, quite frankly, deserve all they get, and the ending - think swimming pools and electric toasters - is just silly. It's proficiently put together with ocassional use of effects - partuclrly effective are those audio ones, but otherwise I'm afraid it's nothing much to write home about...",5,1,1,13 June 2020
The Little Mermaid," The course of true love never did swim smooth....
","This time, Hans Christian Anderson rescues the Disney animation factory from the fire - this is a wonderfully colourful and fun adaptation of his almost Faustian story of being very careful what you wish for. 'Ariel' is a beautiful mermaid who is fascinated by what goes on ashore - and that only gets more obsessive when she espies, and ultimately rescues from a violent storm, the equally gorgeous 'Prince Eric' and falls hook, line and sinker. Her sagacious father 'King Triton' forbids her from seeing him again and so, like any resourceful teenager, she enters a pact with evil sea witch 'Ursula' that allows her to become human for three days and go ashore to seek out her new love - but at what cost... The support characters are so good in this - especially Samuel Wright as the long-suffering chancellor/lobster 'Sebastian' and Pat Carroll as the evil 'Ursula' aided and abetted by her slippery eel sidekicks 'Flotsam' & 'Jetsam' and Alan Menken's songs, including, 'Under the Sea' & 'Kiss the Girl' jauntily carry it all along apace. 20-odd years later, it's still well worth a watch.",7,0,0,5 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A bit of emperor's new clothes here, it really isn't anything special.
","In theory, this ought to have been excellent. Di Caprio and Pitt together with Tarantino and a sprinkling of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Well, eventually - after maybe 2 hours, or so, we get something akin to what I was expecting. The long, ponderous road to this conclusion has been described by some as a sort of 'love story'. Hmmm, I think they are being kind. There is a bond between the two gents but it isn't really worthy of comment. I don't see how it significantly differs from the bond any partnership might form after many years of working together. Boo hoo, 'Dalton' (Di Caprio) is a bit of an alcoholic who has become typecast and doesn't get the parts he used to. Well how many other actors have ended up in the same boat? 'Booth' Pitt's character has very little to get his teeth into; except perhaps at the end and if you do expect anything substantial from Sharon Tate, then think again. Sorry, but this is a seriously long and over-rated swipe at too many late 60's Hollywood stereotypes for me.",6,3,3,9 December 2019
Aladdin," A sumptuous and lavish remake with very little heart...
","Sometimes I really do yearn for a return to the wonderful stop-motion world of Ray Harryhausen and Charles H. Schneer - don't you? Sure there was a surfeit of plasticine, things on strings and dodgy green screen, but there was also a sense of authenticity and creativity - and not just the, admittedly impressive, output of a sophisticated computer programme. In this version of the tale of a street urchin, who vies for possession of the magic lamp with the ambitiously manipulative Grand Vizier - Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott and Marwan Kenzari do their jobs well enough - in a sort of off-broadway fashion. Will Smith certainly oozes charisma as the now famous blue genie but everyone is just too pretty. The production is just too slick; scenery and costumes too perfect - it isn't (and I know is will sound stupid to say of a film about a magic lamp) real! The digital mastery of the real life/animation sequences is flawless, but it has no soul and is far too long, sorry - even if it is a billion dollar movie (or because that's all it really ever wanted to be?).",6,0,0,2 April 2020
The Lion King," A great looking but soulless void of a film.
","The first ten minutes of this are spellbinding. The animation is visionary and the accompanying music can't help but raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Then... well it drops off a cliff. The characterisations are empty; as two-dimensional as the cartoons themselves and no amount of sound effects and shouty-singing can bring them to life. I'm not asking for Paul Haggis or Aaron Sorkin - but surely a production of this magnitude, with this kind of budget, could find a writing team that didn't have to reduce this to 'Janet and John in the Jungle'? Even if it is a kids film (I think not!) it deserves so much more substance to support the beautiful imagery than it gets. For reasons that aren't immediately clear to me; the lyric has been 'updated' too - why? Truly a let down.",6,1,2,3 December 2019
K-19: The Widowmaker," Thankfully submarines aren't quite this wooden...
","A rather clunky cold-war maritime thriller that manages to mix plausible science with shallow propaganda in a rather cack-handed fashion - and a (mis)casting that gives the film the same sinking feeling that the submarine must have felt when it first put to sea. It's a synch that the 2-kopeck systems aboard this state of the art Russian boat 'K-19' are going to cause the maiden voyage to be riddled with dangers, and Captain Harrison Ford who blindly believes that nothing can possibly go wrong both before and after the boat sets sail leads to loads of crew resentment - not least from Executive Officer Liam Neeson - who all see him as a sort of 'Captain Bligh' figure. Technically, the film does evoke a genuine sense of peril and claustrophobia, but the stars don't really have enough to work with beyond their very two-dimensional characterisations and the sight of John Shrapnel (whose son Lex also features) as a Soviet Admiral is verging on the risible. It has moments of pace, and jeopardy - but they are few and far between and more than nullified by the rather dodgy CGI and really pedestrian script.",6,0,0,4 May 2020
Pawn Sacrifice," A story that gripped the world, but not the cinema...
","This could have been a fascinating account of the troubled life of American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer - unfortunately, Tobey Maguire just couldn't quite convince me that he was that man! The well documented life of this chess genius and of his many demons is the stuff of public record, but this interpretation borders on the melodramatic just a bit too often, and the lead performance is way too one-dimensional for me to get beyond the initial reaction that he was a bit of an arse. An hugely accomplished master of his craft, but as an human being - an arse. There are flashbacks to try and give us some guidance as to the causes of his paranoia - his mother was a communist living in the USA so he genuinely believed that the FBI were listening in on him from a very early age - a neuroses that never left him - and as such his sense of trust was internally compromised and his ability to form meaningful relationships never remotely developed. Liev Schreiber - who really only features towards the very end, does indicate a bit of the grace and professionalism of arch-rival Boris Spassky but it is delivered by Edward Zwick in an almost grudging fashion - the pesky Ruskies will do just about anything to win - except, that is, play fair! It does demonstrate the effectiveness of the cold war chess battle that many of us will recall from the 1970s, but it could have been much more adventurous and less stereotyping with it's characters.",6,0,0,18 May 2020
Clash of the Titans," A pretty soul-less achievement for the computer programmers.
","This certainly attempts to emulate the 1981 original by putting together a decent enough cast - Worthington, Neeson, Fiennes, Arterton, Jason Flemyng - even Nicholas Hoult makes an appearance, but the script is stilted, wordy and just plain silly. The CGI is simply no match for the delicate, stop motion animation of Ray Harryhausen either. There is still plenty of action and the film keeps an even tempo (though this is set as much by the music as it is by the acting) as they all search for a way to defeat the evil Kraken and save Argos. This makes for a good enough, if forgettable, afternoon adventure film. Nothing more, though, sadly. Keep an eye out for Luke Treadaway hamming it up superbly as the soothsayer.",6,0,1,3 December 2019
Paranormal Activity," Why they just didn't leave the house is beyond me...
","This story has more holes in it than a string vest at a moth convention but those supernatural conspiracy theorists amongst us ought to have fun with it. A young couple who are already filming most of their rather humdrum lives at home start to notice some odd noises. They leave the camera on in their bedroom overnight (and, no - not even a hint of anything naughty or kinky occurs between them) and their poltergeist starts to make the tiniest bit of mischief. Gradually they get more and more preoccupied by these shenanigans and that leads to hysteria and, I have to say, quite an hysterical ending. There are plenty of things that go bump in the night; she screams quite a lot and there are contrived rows between them a-plenty but as it all comes from their home-move camera the entire thing just looks and sounds amateur...",5,0,0,24 June 2020

Dev Patel and Anupam Kher offer perfectly plausible portrayals of innocent local folks caught up in this most hideous and random of terrorist attacks - and yet still determined to help a collection of spoilt, rich, over-indulged Westerners survive the slaughter. Much of the script apparently derives from transcripts of real mobile phone conversations adding a unique slice of authenticity and Maras' direction offers a taut and well crafted framework for the story to enfold.

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Even my evil physics teacher never thought of quite such a cruel way for someone to do their punishment lines....
","'Harry' has an extra-curricular experience with a 'Dementor' which draws the attention of the newly rejuvenated Ministry of Magic and after a show trial in which he is ably defended by 'Prof. Dumbledore' our trio return to a school that is all but under martial law. A new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher (a rather Margaret Thatcher-esque Imelda Staunton) is taking over the school by degree, imposing strict rules that merely serve to encourage the pupils to go underground to learn the more practical skills that will be needed if they are ever to face and defeat the evil 'Voldemort'. All of the characters from the previous stories are now knitting together much better; I still miss Richard Harris as 'Dumbledore' but Stauton is as magnificently evil as Emma Thompson is wonderfully pathetic and we have a cracking battle at the end. Our wizards are now fully cognisant of the dangers they face and have a much clearer idea of the enemy, too. David Yates does better, I think, in condensing this super-long novel into one film; again a two-parter would probably have done better justice to the detail and nuances of the JK Rowling story; but we get more than enough of the gist of the story to make do.

I think you have to be in the zone if you are going to get anything from this otherwise it could fairly be described as nonsense. There are shades of 'The Wicker Man' here, but this is nowhere near as well written or as scary. Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor try their best but this just doesn't really work.

In this case Fredddie Boath joins the gang of intrepid adventurers trying to save the world from the scourge of a recently re-reincarnated mummy (a re-born, born again sort of thing!). He finds the Bracelet of Anubis, gets kidnapped and off we go on a fun race against time across the desert encountering all sorts of dangers and evil critters along the way. This one also introduces us to the 'Scorpion King' (least said, I think) and Sommers, again, keeps this all moving along apace.

Selma," A bit too much of the myth and not enough of the man...
","It's really important, I think, not to mistake criticism of this rather run-of-the-mill drama with the actual achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King. Any re-telling of his story to new audiences especially to those who have (or had) no experience of just how African American's were practically, if not so much politically, treated has got to serve as a reminder that what we take for granted, we lose - and, like so many other hard fought rights and freedoms we must all continue to value them and work to ensure nobody is ever discriminated against - for any reason... This film, however, is really nothing special. The dramatic elements are awkwardly speculative - particularly the alleged conversations between President Johnson and MLK; the cast lacked any ability to engender the charisma and fortitude of their real life counterparts; the dialogue is way too wordy, the scenes too busy - constant camera movement distracting from the message that the film is trying to reinforce and I'm sorry but Tom Wilkinson as LBJ is just a bad casting choice - indeed the whole FBI wire-tapping business is delivered in a way that seems oddly routine and un-sinister. It is difficult to put together a decent biopic of such a visionary man and not let it slide into an overly-appreciative mire of sentimental mediocrity - and Ava DuVernay was possibly just too close to the subject matter to be remotely objective. It is an at times a rousing, but mostly a pedestrian effort.",6,0,0,20 June 2020
Snowden," Serves well as a conduit to make you think...
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the title role, is recruited to work for the CIA and soon realises that there are plenty of 'Un-American' activities going on that he decides to leak to the press. The 'Wikileaks' story is amongst the best publicised in recent years so there is little latitude the film can take with the chronology or facts. What it does do, though, is create a character in Snowden that is both torn and decent; not just with the responsibilities he faces at work, but with the impact on his family and long-time girlfriend (here, a rather better than usual Shailene Woodley) when he decides to spill the beans. That said, JGL really has to hold this up by himself - Zachary Quinto is terrible and neither Nicholas Cage nor Rhys Ifans add much beyond their names to the depth of the story. Clearly, much of this is supposition but it is certainly a thought-provoking attempt to question what we might do with information that is quite so condemnatory of our own 'free' governments, if it were to come into our possession; or, indeed - should we ever become faced with the evidence of the comprehensive extent of the monitoring sub-culture that this film suggests may well exist across all of our communities.",7,0,0,8 May 2020
The King," More 'Shallow' than 'Hollow' Crown...
","At last an opportunity to see Timothée Chalamet doing something a little grittier. Sadly, t'was not to be. His portrayal of this great character from early 15th Century British history left me cold. He looked like a good meal would have killed him, never mind a bloodthirsty foe clad in iron armed with an axe. The accent held up reasonably well, but he still struggles to shake off the winsome, 'butter wouldn't melt' image and as he has to pretty much carry this film en seul, it just doesn't really work. The rare appearances by Robert Pattinson border on the hammy; with his final appearance reminding me of the first few steps taken by 'Bambi' back in 1942. It is great that Netflix are prepared to fund projects like this, but the plain truth is that no amount of money can compensate for a poor screenplay - think Shakespeare 'light' - supplemented with a few high-profile cameo contributions.",6,25,52,21 October 2019
Limitless," Clever sci-fi concept thriller.
","Bradley Cooper ('Eddie Morra') is a struggling author who takes the experimental drug 'AZT' that allows him to fully utilise his brain. This renders him extremely sharp and focused, his senses honed beyond anything he could have imagined - and he puts these new skills to good use setting out to make himself a fortune. In so doing, however, he attract the attention of the evil Robert de Niro ('Carl Van Loon') who once he has cottoned on to what it is that gives 'Morra' his super-power, determines to get it at all costs. With his stash of pills running low, we've now got a great little cat and mouse chase as he tries to stay alive long enough to outwit the heavies in pursuit. Cooper is quite engaging, but the rest - including a rather wooden De Niro - are all just a bit flat. The script could do with some tightening and the whole pace of the thing is a bit lacklustre; there are quite a few plot holes that have you shouting at the screen 'Why did you do/say that?'... It's a fascinating prospect, though, it we really do only use 5% of our cerebral capacity - what could we all be like it it all worked?",7,0,0,27 June 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Sterile stuff, I'm afraid....
","A little like 'Into the Woods' (2014) this is a technically ambitious attempt to reconcile animation and live action with an excellent cast. Again, it works spectacularly as a piece of cinematic innovation - but has no spirit. We know the story: a vain Prince is cursed by a sorceress to remain shut up, hideously disfigured, in his castle until the spell is broken by true love's tear. 'Belle' (Emma Watson) does well to keep this almost Ziegfeld-esque extravaganza on track. She manages to avoid the amorous intentions of Luke Evans as 'Gaston' before ending up doing the prisoner swap for her father in the castle of the Prince - an extremely well made up Dan Stevens. The additional voice cast line up is great - Kevin Kline, Sir Ian McKellan, Ewan McGregor, Emma Thompson and Stanley Tucci. The songs are reprised from the 1991 version of the story but without the charm and mischief of their original iterations; they are just too precise and dare I say 'professional'. The technology has now super-subsumed every element of the process to the point that it is almost clinically delivered. The characters and story are still great, but please, Disney, leave something a little rough around the edges for us....",6,0,0,2 April 2020
Inside Man," More complex than your average cops and robbers film...
","As heist films go, this isn't at all bad. Spike Lee and Denzel Washington keep the drama going and although quite few, the twists do keep you guessing. Jodie Foster and Christopher Plummer appear sparingly, but they contribute quite substantially to the rather more evil and interesting sub-plot. This movie touches upon social and religious mores a little, though I wouldn't say this was Lee at his most political - and this all adds to an enjoyable multi-layered story. A good watch.",7,2,2,17 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Good fun, adventure film...
","I ought to start by saying that I love Chris Pratt - he just oozes charisma and has an on-screen presence that is elusive amongst the superhero/Marvel genre. As sequels go, this is pretty decent. The talking skunk and the tree are less annoying than in the first film, and the story is packed full of action, humour and fun. Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone have their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks and Zoe Saldana is great as the bad-ass Gamora. Not as good as the original - maybe because the soundtrack isn't, it is a touch too long and don't expect it to engage your brain too often - but it is entertaining nonetheless.",7,0,1,26 November 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Welcome to the world of magical friendships and imagination...
","It is impossible to imagine a world now, in 2020, that does not include these characters from the fantastically creative imagination of JK Rowling. That she worked closely with Chris Columbus in the creation of this adaptation of her introductory story featuring the boy-wizard means it stays broadly faithful to the book but allows the imagery to replace, rather than duplicate, the narrative. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson validate the best in the casting director's art as we set off on this wonderfully enjoyable fantasy adventure. The supporting cast - Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, ZoÃ« Wanamaker et al all add richness to this as young 'Mr. Potter' and is friends begin to realise their magical potential. John Williams' works his wonders creating a score almost as recognisable as his 'Star Wars' theme and the special effects are gentle, yet sophisticated. It is a bit on the lengthy side, and some of the adaptation sacrifices a little of the humour from the book - but all in all a movie to stand the tests of time.",7,1,1,26 February 2020
The Shape of Water," Loved this - well deserved it's Oscar plaudits....
","I appreciate that this probably isn't to everyone's taste - but I really enjoyed it. Set in 1960s America this is a story about a mute woman 'Elisa' (Sally Hawkins) who ends up working as a cleaner at a top secret military facility where an aquatic creature is being held captive/experimented upon. Over the course of the film, she befriends him and they establish a bond despite the cruel treatment he is receiving from a truly unpleasant 'Colonel Strickland' (Michael Shannon). Octavia Spencer is also superb as her close friend who interprets for her and ends up being her partner in crime. This is story about humanity (and inhumanity), trust, hope and ultimately vengeance filmed in a magnificently enigmatic fashion by Guillermo del Toro and scored by Alexandre Desplat.",8,0,4,13 January 2020
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Hogwarts begins to reveals ins secrets...
","This second book in JK Rowling's 'Harry Potter' series sees our trio of wizarding weans start to develop a much closer relationship with each other; and we begin to realise the challenges young 'Harry' is to face as he grows up. This is much more sinister than the opener; Alan Rickman 'Prof. Snape' starts to come into his own as his evil nemesis v Maggie Smith as his professional proponent and 'Dumbledore' (Richard Harris) starts to develop more as a character too. I could possibly have done without 'Moaning Myrtle' but the story is well adapted and moves along quickly, with a little more humour than the first one. Again, score and effects are hugely complementary to what is simply a cracking fantasy adventure story.",7,0,0,26 February 2020
Hercules," 'It's not about sinew, it's about what's in you...'
","Undoubtedly one of the better 1990s Disney films. The story and animation are very much centre stage with the music much less important - no big power ballads!. It is a fun take on the Herculean mythology of ancient Greece. Hades is desperate to avenge himself on Zeus who tricked him into ruling the underworld after he and his brothers defeated the Titans; meantime Zeus is celebrating the birth of a baby boy. Hades decides to strike back, but his augurs advise that this little boy - Hercules - is the fly in the ointment who must be neutralised if his grand design is to succeed. So Hades tricks him firstly into mortality and then cons him out of his great strength - but will that be enough to defeat the determination of our hero? It is a bit of a slow starter; but once it gets into the swing there are some good performances from James Woods (superb as Hades), Rip Torn (Zeus) and Danny DeVito as the long-suffering demi-god trainer 'Phil' that keep this fantasy adventure moving along nicely. Don't expect to see any of his twelve labours...",7,0,0,4 April 2020
It Chapter Two," CGI on steroids....
","I watched the two films in a double bill and I really did want to enjoy this as much as I did the first - but boy, could this have been much more of a let down? The original has a far better cast; snappier direction and a much tighter script. This just rumbles along with a staccato, portmanteau-style storyline that robs the narrative of much of the cohesion of it's earlier iteration. The ending is straight out of 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' without the roller skates!. Sadly disappointing.",5,1,1,24 November 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Mick Newell has something to be well proud of.
","Well, it isn't a title you will ever forget, is it? Lily James ('Juliet') had been writing to the eponymous society to find out about their island's experiences under Nazi occupation during WWII. She hits on the idea of writing a book about it so sets off from London to visit and dig deeper. The tale is delivered by way of letters and thus you are gradually drawn into a detailed, engaging and really charming story. It isn't so much about the wartime, though there are some very poignant threads to the film that are - it's about personalities; and pretty much the whole gamut of them at that. It's a bit of a love story - both between people and between 'Juliet' and the islanders themselves; even the more curmudgeonly ones! The high quality of the production and dialogue reminded me a little of 'Quartet' - Sir Tom Courtenay; Dame Penelope Wilton and Jessica Brown Findlay turn in excellent, but understated and delicate performances - as does Michael Huisman. Expect a few twists and turns but nothing to stem that feeling of warmth you are left with at the end.",7,0,0,9 April 2020
Jaws," Still has teeth - 45 years on
","I saw this recently on the big screen for the first time since I originally went as a child in 1975 and if anything, it has got better. John Williams' score and Robert Shaw's 'Quint' combine to far outweigh the 'rubber' shark scenes. Unlike 'The Meg' this film conveys a real sense of tension; coupled with some good old-fashioned scariness. It also dips it's toe into the science and behaviour of an apex predator, which we may consider ourselves to be. Take away our technical accoutrement and we are clearly the minnows...",8,9,12,15 November 2019
12 Strong," Just don't look at this too closely....
","Though this is certainly a well crafted piece of cinema, the narrative is riddled with inconsistencies that frankly put this on the borderline between fact and propaganda, That's not to decry the considerable bravery and achievements of the battalion sent to assist local tribes in their battle with an incredibly well armed Taliban; and were this just to be treated as an action adventure film on that basis then it's long, but quite watchable. It isn't though - and as such comes across as a confused, rather gung-ho, interpretation of facts that don't really stand up to too much scrutiny if you have even the faintest soupçon of knowledge as to the political situation prevailing in war-torn Afghanistan at the start of the 21st Century. Neither Chris Hemsworth nor Michael Peña bring much to the party from a performance perspective and though the photography (New Mexico) does give us some sort of indiction as to how remote and bleak the territory is; this is just a rather poor war film about a more recent war, with some good effects.",6,0,0,27 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Easily the best of the second trilogy...
","At last we get some semblance of the original trilogy with this action adventure iteration that is much darker and character-driven. Hayden Christensen 'Anakin' is coming to realise what really will turn him into the ultimate evil 'Darth Vader' under the guise of his new mentor 'Palpatine' (a magnificently, if theatrical, Ian McDiarmid). It's end to end action; the cast have thrown off their romantic notions from 'Attack of the Clones' and we are setting the scene, properly, for 'A New Hope' at the same time ridding ourselves of the baggage that weighed down the first two in this triplet. Curiously enough, the effects don't work so well in this, but George Lucas, David Tattersall and John Williams deliver a much, much better fantasy drama with some great galactic swashbuckling at the end...",7,1,1,9 February 2020
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," 80+ years on, this is still a magnificent example of animated storytelling.
","A vain Queen visits her mirror each day to have it confirmed that she is the fairest in the land. When, one morning, her validator gives her news less to her liking she determines to have her step daughter 'Snow White' done away with. Her captain of the guard is dispatched into the forest with his young charge with instructions to see she doesn't return! He can't quite bring himself to murder the girl, so abandons her thinking the forest will do the job for him... Luckily, she stumbles upon the cottage of the seven dwarves - who depart each day to mine for jewels. They return home, discover her asleep in one of their tiny beds and after a bit of a bumpy start, take her to their hearts. That's basically the theme - the film has 'heart'; the dwarves reflect seven differing facets of human personality but all are sensitively enveloped in a glue of loyalty and humanity. All of these are tested as the wicked Queen discovers that the girl is still thriving (via her mirror) and sets out, personally, do the job. This Brothers' Grimm story is the stuff of all of our childhoods, as is the ending to this ultimately romantic fairy tale. The animations are beautifully crafted; the dialogue of menace and humour is marvellously engaging and - at times - poignant, too. There are plenty of memorable, catchy songs into the bargain. I always preferred 'Bashful' myself...",7,0,0,1 April 2020
Wonder Woman," Watchable adventure romp that doesn't take itself at all seriously...
","This was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting. The script is really dreadful and the premiss that an Amazonian daughter of Zeus heads into the 20th century to help the Brits during the First World War is as far fetched as it goes. That said, there is some chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and David Thewlis is quite menacing at times as 'Sir Patrick/Ares'. The CGI isn't too oppressive and the (frequent) fight scenes though lengthy, are quite well staged. It's all just a bit of fun - quite comedic at times - and fine to watch on that basis.",6,2,5,7 January 2020
Marriage Story," At last, Netflix hits the jackpot.
","I was nervously expecting more shades of 'Kramer vs Kramer' when I saw the subject matter. Well, it's nothing like. Scarlett Johansson shines as the actress/wife conflicted every-which-way by her collapsing marriage; Laura Dern is wonderful as 'Nora' the truly obnoxious attorney and it's good to see Alan Alda, albeit briefly, back on the big screen too. The marvel for me, though, is Adam Driver. Who knew? He usually suffers from the curse of the tall man - his clothes never quite fit, he has that slightly jowly look and rarely ever seems to get a part that he can get his teeth into. He sure does, here - arousing passion, sympathy, disgust and pity - and he does a decent enough rendition of Sondheim to boot. He is a revelation and helps this film to deliver as candid a reflection on the divorce process that I've ever seen. It's over two hours long, but well worth it.",8,20,40,23 November 2019
The Woman in Black," Some things are just better left to the stage...
","The problem with this whole concept is that it works so very much better on the stage. This isn't a terrible adaptation of Susan Hill's novel by any means, and Daniel Radcliffe does fine; but there is no suspense. The ghost is way too two dimensional; there is nothing eerie or scary about it - your imagination doesn't really get to run riot with this production at all. Marco Beltrami's score adds little to the tension either. Perhaps if you've never seen the play, then this might be better but for me it was a very poor relation.",6,1,1,7 February 2020
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A stilted but colourful costume drama...
","Sadly, someone agreed that a sequel to 'Elizabeth' was required so we ended up with this rather fanciful vehicle for a still competent Cate Blanchett but not so much for a terribly wooden Clive Owen as 'Walter Raleigh'. Following the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton), England is facing impending invasion by the Spanish Armada. The (largely forgivable) factual inaccuracies that dogged the first film are somehow magnified in this rather poor follow up. It really does miss Richard Attenbourgh; despite the best efforts of Geoffrey Rush and a somewhat flighty Abbie Cornish. As you'd expect, the film looks great and there is quite an interesting 'making of' documentary demonstrating how the whole thing was filmed - perhaps more interesting than the film itself. Fortunately the Queen didn't live too much longer after this so we ought to be safe from 'Elizabeth III'",6,0,0,5 March 2020
Lucy," Now here's a proper superpower....
","So 'Lucy' (Scarlett Johansson) is caught up in a drug smuggling caper. When the package she has in her innards leaks, the new synthetic drug she is carrying gets into her system and boy does it change her. Meantime, Morgan Freeman is a top scientist trying to understand why humankind - and most other sentient beings - appear to exists using less that 5% of their cerebral capacity... Yes, you've guessed it - 'Lucy' now has a quirk that enables her to use much more of her brainpower; and that in turn enables her to do just about anything - even manipulate matter and time. She is, luckily for all concerned, quite a decent soul and so rather than set out on a course of world domination, she settles for involving a Frenchman policeman, Amr Waked, in her hunt to bring her traffickers to justice and, hopefully, to relieve her predicament. There's plenty of action, loads of car-flipping chases but the vastness of the opportunities offered by the story are not really translated into anything like what could have been. The effects are fine, Scarlett always carries off these kind of roles well enough, but Freeman features very sparingly and offers us very little by way of characterisation. I am afraid that this is just a waste of a good idea...",5,0,3,29 May 2020
Midway," Much, much, better than I was expecting...
","Yes, you could just write this off as a proper CGI-fest - BUT - it has been done with a very commendable eye to the detail. The flimsiness of the aircraft, and of the ships for that matter, are conveyed effectively. You do get a sense of the mortality of sailors from both sides and a little of the dignity of the proceedings too. Ed Skrein does come across as a bit of a gung-ho hero, but without the puerile 'Ye Ha!' type of nonsense that we see more commonly now in almost every movie which centres around the achievements of the US military. Perhaps because it is based on real people and events, it is a more respectful tribute to their accomplishments. Needs a big screen - will look dreadfully man-made on telly.",7,14,24,12 November 2019
RED," An all-action Willis adventure vehicle.
","Well there certainly isn't anything original about this, but it is hard to hate a film when a decent cast are clearly all having a good time! Bruce Willis is 'Frank', a bored man who only seems to get any enjoyment from life when he has a conversation with the girl (Mary-Louise Parker) at his pension office whom he calls when his cheques are wrong! However, things all start to heat up a bit when his former life comes back to haunt him and he has to assemble his old team to fight off this state-of-the art would-be assassin. The story is really rather formulaic, but there are some fun lines for the star, and some engaging contributions from Karl Urban, and an on-form pairing of John Malkovich & Ernest Borgnine. Helen Mirren and Brian Cox don't quite fit in - she looks really quite out of place, and his accent is pretty terrible. It's all about Willis - and if you are fan, then there is plenty here to enjoy.",6,0,0,3 May 2020
300," Loads of end to end action, but almost exclusively from the technicians...
","I'll say from the outset that I didn't hate this, but that it certainly will not suit everyone. Gerard Butler leads the 300 Spartans of legend as 'King Leonidas' tasked with thwarting the ambitions of Xerxes, Emperor of Persia who is bent on a total invasion of Greece. The story is the stuff of ancient Greek myth - and this very, very heavily computer generated film is quite a difficult one to enjoy - the colours/shades are dark and ambiguous; the battle scenes suitably gory but equally fake and the script needed someone with better than A-level English to work on it. That said, it does benefit from that darkness and edginess - the characterisations combine honour and brutality in quite a plausible, if at times an almost alien fashion. If you know the legend upon which this is based, you will appreciate that this is a pretty 'loose' adaptation of events at Thermopylae and certainly way too long; but worth a go - just about.",6,0,0,14 March 2020
Tarzan," Simple story well told.
","'Tarzan' is rescued from the clutches of a tiger and raised in a colony of gorillas. As he gets older, he bonds with the animals around him and ultimately, with a few reservations from the alpha 'Kerchak', becomes an internal part of the family. Enter a group of British explorers determined to see gorillas and our hero see 'Jane' for the first time: the love story begins. Their guide 'Clayton' betrays them all - he wants to sell the apes for £300-a-head in Europe and a colourful, perilous battle of 'civilisations' ensues. The animations are a bit simple, vey angular - but the characterisations are much stronger. It isn't just a love story with an happy ending; we are taken on their journey of self-discovery as they both introduce the other to their own, drastically, different worlds... Great vocal efforts from Brian Blessed, Minnie Driver and Nigel Hawthorne add some extra fun and lots of pace to this action adventure complemented by a few good songs from Phil Collins.",7,1,1,4 April 2020
Da 5 Bloods," Join Da 5 dots...
","Ok, so a team of old African American soldiers decide to return to Vietnam to find the body of their colleague who was killed in action - and to retrieve some $17m worth of gold bars. En route they have to face some personal demons; an old girlfriend and the locals who have their own plans... It's not dreadful, but it certainly could not be described as Spike Lee anywhere near his best. The gang do emanate some sense of comradeship and loyalty, but in such a gung-ho fashion as to render the whole thing little better than a run-of-the mill Nicolas Cage style shoot 'em up effort with a really rather episodic and inevitable structure and a storyline remarkably indifferent to the indigenous population. Two and half hours is far too long, to. Looks great, though but sorry, more miss than hit for me.",5,7,15,13 June 2020
Saboteur," 39 small steps...
","A rather run-of-the-mill espionage thriller, this one, with Robert Cummings wrongly accused of complicity in a fire that destroys a large part of an aircraft construction factory. He manages to avoid the police long enough to travel the breadth of the United States on the trail of a group of wealthy, powerful, fifth columnists. Priscilla Lane is the initially sceptical sidekick as they try to ensnare Otto Kruger and his network of traitors. Unfortunately, there is just too much inevitability about the story; very little suspense and the performances are really quite dry - especially the rather daft circus act storyline. It is fine to watch, but nothing notable to remember, I'm afraid.",6,0,0,15 April 2020
Pocahontas," You will recall the songs long after you've forgotten the film.
","A gentle telling of the tale of early British settlers arriving in Virginia in the 17th century. Seeking gold, they found the indigenous population and pretty much set out to annihilate and/or enslave them. Pocahontas is curious to meet these white visitors and Capt. John Smith keen to reciprocate with both keen to prevent bloodshed and promote conversation and understanding between them. On the face of it, it is just an animated love story. Those looking for historical accuracy ought to look elsewhere; this is a vehicle of some good (not great) animation that touches on Native American traditions and beliefs ('The Willow Tree' - voiced by Linda Hunt - being quite a poignant example) and for Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz's Oscar winning, if dreadfully sentimental songs. It is perfectly watchable, and perfectly forgettable in equal measure.",6,0,0,3 April 2020
The Soloist," Foxx is terrific...
","This is a truly super performance from Jamie Foxx as the virtuoso musician (Nathanial Ayers) who lives his life on the streets of Los Angeles. He is 'discovered' by LA Times journalist Steve Lopez (Robert Downey Jr.) who is seeking a theme for his column - and his subsequent probing into his new subject discovers that Mr. Ayers suffers from a acute form of schizophrenia that renders his ability to rationalise his thoughts and or skills into anything that could enable him to use his musical talents to escape his predicament all but impossible. As ever with RD films, the pace of the dialogue is frenetic and here is actually quite distracting from the subtle and poignant efforts from Foxx - the story works best when it is told from his perspective, and though I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the actual effects upon the real man, the fact that it is based on a true story does incline me to consider that this representation of Ayers' battle against his own demons could be a true reflection of the actual difficulties faced by a man of such magnificent talents, but with so many equally mammoth psychological problems. The score from Dario Marianeli serves to accompany the mood of the film - at a variety of paces - magnificently, too.",7,0,0,18 May 2020
