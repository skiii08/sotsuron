Requiem for a Dream," Powerful
","Requeim For A Dream is one of the most powerful movies I believe I've ever seen. It is a dark tale into the world of drugs, and street life. The movie stars Ellen Burstyn an old women with an obssesion with televison who believes that her big chance to make it on Tv has finally come so she goes on a diet of taking diet pills. Her son played by Jared Leto a junkie who is trying to break big with dealing with his buddy Tyrone played by Marlon Wayans. During the course of the movie we see the too make it big and hit rock bottom at almost the same time. Jenifer Conlley stars as Marion the girlfriend who is simply relying on Leto to make things happen. The movie takes you on a wild ride through each of these individuals lives, we see them fall then rise but then fall again until everything crashes down for them. Requeim For A Dream is a powerful film that should infulence its viewers about the overpowering effect of drugs and what happens to your life when it gets out of hand. ***1/2 out of ****",Null,0,0,16 March 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," I'm not a star wars fan but this was good
","I dont enjoy Star Wars that much but episode II was not bad. I enjoyed all of it some was a little boring, but I was pleasently suprised. Ewan McGragor(Obi Wan Kenobi), Hayden Christensan (Anikan Skywalker), they both where the movies stars. When it comes to space movies I enjoy Star Trek, Alien, Aliens, and now Star Wars Episode II Attack Of the Clones.",Null,0,0,17 July 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," They did it
","When i first heard that the third installment of the Terminator series was without James Cameron, and Linda Hamilton i wasnt expecting much of a installment.The first two films are both science fiction classics, and it is hard to match that. The movie is about John Conner(Stahl)who is living in complete isolation or 'off the grid' as he calls it. Who ends up in a weird way reuniting with an old friend Kate Brewster(Danes). Soon after there meeting Kate an John find themselves in a race for there lives aganist the TX(Lokken), who is the most advanced killing machine yet, however help is not far off. The T-800(ah-nold) soon comes in an saves the day. Now with the verge of skynet taking over John, Kate, and Terminator must try an stop Judgement Day(again). The movie is filled with wall to wall action, with a chase seen like none you have ever seen. The acting is very good all around. Nick Stahl does a good job of a young man having trouble accepting his fate, Clare Danes does an excellent job of the girl who at first is lost an scared but turns out to be a kick ass help. Arnold is still very effective at being the buffed up Terminator, An Kristanna Lokken does a good job as the very lethal TX. James Cameron's direction is missed, but Jonathan Mostow does a fine job of handling it. All in all T3 measures up to be a worthy entry in the Terminator franchise, what i thought would be crap turned out to be a good action film that doesnt miss a beat. ***/****",Null,0,0,14 July 2003

Reservoir Dogs," Before Pulp there where Reservoir Dogs
","Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's directoral debut. Reservoir Dogs comes before his masterpiece Pulp Fiction. Reservoir Dogs is about a diamond hiest orchestrated by 5 total strangers under color coded names. Mr.White(Harvey Kietel),Mr.Orange(Tim Roth),Mr.Blonde(Michael Madsen),Mr.Pink(Steve Buscemi),and Mr. Brown(Quentin Tarantino). The movie takes you on every part of the diamond heist, from where it got started to where it happened, to where it failed. After meeting back at the rendevous spot the remainig men must figure out who obviously set them up, and they must figure out what to do with there wounded. The movie takes you along as the remaining men pull there hair, and guns out to figure out who is the 'Rat' in the group. With Quentin Tarantino's style of directing and the great preformances Reservoir Dogs will hit you hard. ***1/2 outof ****",Null,0,1,18 April 2003
Signs," Excellent Alien Flick
","Signs What a movie. I was sitting in this movie about mid way through thinking to myself this movie is So much more than a regular Alien movie. So many hidden messages, So many refrences to religion and fate. The movie deals with a family living in a desolate area. One morning Grahm Hess finds his crops destroyed and he belives innocent foul play is involved. We soon find out in a clever real world slash sort of dream state its more than that. Mel Gibson gives a fantastic preformance as a former reverend and father figures. The father figures in movies are hard roles to pull of realisticlly but Bill Paxton did it in Frailty and Mel gibson does it here. The director of signs is M Night Shamilyan(I think thats how you spell it). He works so gracefully his pictures are revolved around things that could happen they have a feel of the real world. Signs is a movie that makes you want to go deeper inside the issue of Aliens and figure out would this be like the real thing if it happens. A great movie",Null,0,1,4 August 2002
