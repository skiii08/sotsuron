Casablanca," Just plain good
","This movie is just flat out good.  It still holds up after 60 years, and for excellent reason.  The performances, though more over-the-top than what we are used to today, are spot on.  The story is simple but effectively moving, and the movie is entertaining from beginning to end.  The musical score is magical.Casablanca is simply a fine example of classical Hollywood cinema.  I watched it with a degree of skepticism, not expecting the movie to live up to its hype, but I was pleasantly surprised when if far exceeded my expectations.  The story is interesting and the script is well-written. All of the characters are strongly crafted, and the acting is superb.  I give this movie the 10 it deserves.",Null,1,1,21 June 2002
Fight Club," Fight Club is mediocre, at best
","I can't comprehend why people think this movie deserves to be critically acclaimed.David Fincher's masturbatory use of unnecessary, high-tech, cheesy CG/camera effects and poor, way-too-blue lighting rule out cinematography as a virtue.The characters are one-dimensional and inordinately cynical; I think he was trying to make the characters hip, but they come off as ridiculous caricatures, amalgamated from various disillusioned 15-year-olds' journals. As a result, said misfit teenagers (I am a teenager by the way), or immature adults that act like such teenagers, are the only people that have any possibility of identifying with these characters.The dialogue is painfully cheesy and contrived, the Dust Brothers' electronica soundtrack comes off as an out-of-place post-modern marketing scheme, and the story is absolutely absurd.Nothing is special about the movie.  The movie does not 'challenge the minds of movie-goers.'  It erases them.  Yes, it's entertaining, but for the love of God, stop drooling over this movie.  I can't figure out why anyone likes it; the only reason I can think of is the inherent homoeroticism.  If you're into that sort of thing.",Null,1,3,14 May 2002
The Evil Dead," sorry for the repetition, it needs to be more than 4 lines

A Nightmare on Elm Street," Kind of cool I guess, but very poorly done
","I was aware that this movie, along with the Freddy Krueger character, became a massive horror movie franchise.  I grew up in the 80s during the era of ubiquitous Freddy dolls and posters, conscious of the fact that he was in this movie and a lot of people seemed to like it, but I had never seen any of the Nightmare movies until recently.I simply don't understand why this is supposed to be a good movie; I found it barely watchable, and largely laughable.  The special effects, even given that the production team did not have the ability to use CG effects at the time, are terrible.  It is completely obvious how every single effect was done when they pop up in the movie.  Furthermore, many of the scenes contain nonsense character actions that seem to exist only to show off more crappy effects (e.g., when Freddy says, 'Watch this,' and chops off his prosthetic fingers).The movie starts off very suddenly, with absolutely no character development.  I found it difficult to care about or sympathize with people I don't know anything about, who can't act, with ketchup squirting out of them.  I just didn't get it.The Freddy Krueger character is far too clownish and rubbery to be scary (I've read that it gets even worse in the sequels).  The annoying cheesy synthesizer music is far too present in the film, drowning out most of what could have been genuine scares.The performances in the movie are some of the worst I've ever seen.  Johnny Depp, unsurprisingly, turns in one of the less ridiculous ones, but given that this movie has almost no redeeming qualities, he has almost no lines. Heather Langenkamp is a boring, vapid heroine who clearly just can't act. She displays an extremely narrow range of emotions, from tired, to asleep, to sort of tired and angry, to somewhat scared.  Speaking of which, she seems alarmingly unconcerned when Freddy Krueger materializes out of nowhere and tries to stab her.  Maybe she's just tired.I will acknowledge that this movie seems to be more creative with the story line and visuals than those that were coming out around that time, and it's more gritty and original than a lot of the slick, boring crap that Hollywood churns out today. Other than that, this movie really isn't anything all that special.  It's not scary, it's extremely fake, and the script and performances are terrible.",3,15,30,21 June 2002
