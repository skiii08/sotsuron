Frost_Nixon," Frank Langella gives a bravuro performance
","As close to an American masterpiece as it gets: honest, touching and politically charged, this film humanizes a point of contention that still matters to this day. Frank Langella gives a performance I did not know he was capable of: not mere impression, but a complete engagement in his character, an understanding at a core level of a man who is subject to as much caricature as any politician since Ceasar. Bravo.",9,0,0,26 August 2017
Empire Records," Unbelievably awful.
","This film is horrible in so many ways that I would hate to think of how long a review I could write.But I won't.  I will focus on one thing, simply to hint at how horrible this film is.  The music.  The music was absolutely chosen by director, who demanded that hip music only existed between 1976 and 1983.  That period, I fear, was not exactly a stellar period.  This film contains a dance number to AC-DC.  Thats right.  Because the kids absolutely LOVE David Bowie.  And dance numbers.  And, I may be wrong, but the romantic ending music sounded like Yaz.I am stunned that this film was ever allowed to be made.",4,0,2,18 September 2002
