Skyfall," What's the point in strangling a guy that already cannot breathe?
","My first reaction after watching the movie was 'Wow, was this really the new Bond?'. I'm a huge JB fan, but this one's so bad on so many levels that I don't even know where to start with my critical remarks. A lot of discussion has been going on lately about the direction in which the Bond series was moving, and I could forgive the screenwriters for turning one of my favorite heroes into a pathetic drunkard who badly needs target practice. But the problem is that the whole plot in Skyfall is so absurd and inconsistent that the story looks more like a parody of JB. At the beginning we learn that a list of secret agents has been stolen and MI6 has to get it back at all costs. But at some point this thread is simply discontinued - and there's no mention of the missing agent list whatsoever! Oh well, who cares. Now we have to deal with some maniacal ex-00 agent with a bad hairdo and a grudge against M. He's the uber villain, super hacker, criminal mastermind and obviously wants revenge, but because the movie must be about 2,5 h long, he obviously doesn't want M. dead too early. Otherwise he could have just blown up the MI6 headquarters with her inside or he could have broken into her apartment (if Bond can do it, why not the uber-villain?) and shot her in the head. And even when he's so close to killing her during the session with the politicians, he simply walks away because, what, there's some white smoke in the room (?). Earlier, his plan was apparently to get captured by MI6, but again, what was the point? To have a little chit-chat with M. and show her his denture? But there's too many illogical points to mention them all. One of the funniest scenes is when Bond strangles one of Silva's henchmen in the pond. Nothing wrong with that, except they were both under water, so what's the point if the guy already couldn't breathe... The whole plot was truly preposterous and that's why I was hugely disappointed with the latest Bond. What a waste of time. Recommended only if you can turn off thinking for more than 2 hours.",1,26,47,26 November 2012
