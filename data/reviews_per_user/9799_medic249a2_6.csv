Scarface," One of Pacino's finest roles
","This one had so much about the 1980s it's hard to know where to start. I remember when this one came out & was getting rave reviews; I wanted to see it badly but my parents always said 'no way' as they were very strict about these kinds of movies. However, 2 years later I was finally able to watch it for the first time with my dad. It left an impression that has stuck with me since then.Pacino is at one of his best roles here; admittedly he is over-the-top sometimes but that is also part of the character. As others have remarked he is not playing a Corleone-type gangster here; he is playing a violent drug dealer that gradually replaced the gangster-types of Corleone & even Al Capone. The supporting cast is solid as well; Robert Loggia, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio & Steve Bauer are all excellent performers.Some of the scenes, especially the infamous chainsaw scene, are disturbing, although the violence in the drug underworld is arguably more extreme than in the times of Al Capone or Michael Corleone. Oliver Stone's screenplay gets dull in places; while it does tell a good story, I got tired of hearing the F-word in almost every line. One does expect a fair amount of swearing from these characters in order to make them believable; however the extreme use of the F-word made the dialog lag in places.Brian DePalma is a solid director; while this is not his best effort by far, it is fine work just the same. He followed up this effort with another gangster film - 'The Untouchables' - four years later, which portrayed the 'classic' images of the early 30's gangsters. Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' also fit the mold of the 'crime family' gangsters. 'Scarface' certainly dispelled the traditional movie stereotypes of the gangster lifestyle; it showed that it is gritty, messy, and frequently outright savage.This one is the movie that got me interested in Pacino's films; his finest since this one was his role on the other side of the law in 'Heat', playing an intense Los Angeles policeman.This 1983 classic is terrific viewing for those who grew up in the 1980s. However, I would strongly advise anyone with a weak stomach or nerves to avoid it - it is EXTREMELY graphic!",7,0,1,10 September 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Remake that's its own movie
","I think that when Zack Snyder undertook this project, he realized just what he was trying to remake. Romero's original 'Dawn' would be hard, if not impossible, to duplicate, and to try to do so would likely enrage countless Romero fans. So he wisely tried to make this 'Dawn' its own movie, with a few notable differences. Most differences add to and enhance the film.***WARNING!! SPOILER ALERT***A pretty young nurse named Ana (Sarah Polley) returns home from her hospital job, just as we get a hint of what is coming; a patient at her hospital admitted for a minor injury is in ICU - with an unknown problem. When she returns home to her husband Louis, they spend a romantic night in the shower while the TV flashes an emergency broadcast...The next morning Louis wakes up to discover their next door neighbor, a little girl, standing in their doorway. When Louis gets up to investigate, he is attacked and killed by her. Ana wakes up to discover Louis bleeding heavily from a bite wound. and he rapidly succumbs to his injury. When Ana tries to call for help, 911 replies 'all circuits are busy'; the world is falling apart. In seconds Louis is on his feet, hungrily coming after Ana. She manages to escape to her car and flee, and as she does, her suburb is swarming with police and ambulances, as well as people running everywhere. As she gets onto the freeway she is forced to stop at an accident, and on a nearby city bus she sees two hideous zombies feed on a third. After crashing her car, a policeman (Ving Rhames) discovers & rescues her. They make their way to a mall with 3 other people, including a man (Mekhi Pfifer of ER) and his expectant girlfriend. They hole themselves up in the mall as the world falls apart around them; TVs in the mall show the problem is as far afield as England, India, and the Middle East. Outside the mall, mobs of undead zombies try to get in - to feast on the living...***END SPOILERS***The first 20 minutes were an excellent take on this classic; showing the world falling apart as the mysterious plague spreads uncontrollably was something that was only hinted at in Romero's original. Some of the characters, such as the obnoxious guard C.J., were probably unnecessary, though C.J.'s character gradually develops through the movie from a self-centered man to one who sacrifices himself to let the others get away. Most 'Dawn' watchers may remember Gaylen Ross' pregnancy in the original; this one takes it a bit further with the birth of the zombie baby, after its mother becomes a zombie. It was interesting to see some of the original 'Dawn' actors in cameo roles; Tom Savini as the sheriff; Scott Reininger as an army colonel; and Ken Foree as a preacher, stating his line from the original 'Dawn' - 'When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth'.**** out of *****",8,0,0,12 July 2004
The English Patient," ATROCIOUS! The worst movie ever to win 'Best Picture'
","At the time this movie came out, my parents and aunt - an English college teacher - invited me to see it with them. They told me that since it was written by a Canadian that that alone made it great. Suspicious of wartime romance movies, I declined. After its release on video I decided to give it a try. An hour into it I knew why I had skipped this awful, stereotypical movie. I could not subject myself to 2 more hours of unnnnngggghhhhh!'The English Patient' is nothing more than an overrated, formula-using wartime romance with a pace that more resembles geological time scales than human. The plot itself - battle-injured soldier develops romance with nurse - is a clich√©-ridden, often-used formula. Admittedly, there are some deviations from this - the man's terminal injuries, the additional characters of the young Sikh and the thief, but they are not enough to save this long-drawn-out, thoroughly DULL film. Nor is the photography, which so many people and critics laud as contributing to this film's misplaced 'masterpiece' status. To be fair, some of the scenery is marvelous but again it is not enough to justify 3 hours. Avoid this piece of junk at all costs. It just isn't worth it if you value your patience (pun not intended). There are times when I wonder what the people at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences were thinking when they gave this awful film the Best Picture nod.",1,13,26,21 September 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Impressive
","While I had been hoping that James Cameron would be back to repeat his fine work with the 'Terminator' series, I was not disappointed with Jonathan Mostow's version of the latest installation. The only thing I would have added was the start of the future war - in the post-nuclear-attack world, where the human resistance starts to fight the horrifying machines of Skynet.In this latest addition to the Terminator series, the CSM-101 (Schwarznegger) returns again to protect John Connor (Stahl) - now invisible & untraceable - from Skynet's latest assassin droid, the T-X (Loken), a frightening machine with multiple onboard weapons and the ability to control other machines from a distance. Additionally, Skynet has already begun its stealthy takeover of computer systems, in the guise of a computer virus. In a series of frightening and near-lethal encounters, John meets up with his future wife and co-leader in the resistance, Kate Brewster (Danes). With the T-X unable to locate John, she starts by going after future prominent figures in the resistance, one of whom is Kate's dad, an Air Force General in charge of Cyber Research Systems - which includes Skynet. They also discover that it is too late to stop Skynet from starting the horrible nuclear war that is the prelude to the war between Skynet's machines and the human resistance. However, they decide to try to at least protect General Brewster from the T-X, as the Terminator reveals he is an important resistance figure - making him a main target of Skynet's assassin droid. When they reach CRS, they discover that General Brewster's bosses in the Pentagon have lost all control of their military, courtesy of the Skynet virus that has cut them off. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has ordered Kate's dad to uplink Skynet in the hopes of killing the virus. Despite Brewster's reluctance to do so, he complies - and Skynet takes control of ALL the U.S. military, including the nuclear subs and missile silos! The T-X appears and guns down General Brewster, but he escapes along with John & the others to his office, where he warns Kate & John to head to Crystal Peak - supposedly the system core of Skynet. John & Kate escape to the hardened facility and enter, aided by clearance codes carried by Kate's dad. After a narrow escape from the T-X, in which she meets an ugly end, they descend several hundred feet into the mountain to discover it is nothing more than a command center for General Staff and VIPs. The President, Congress, Cabinet and Joint Chiefs never got the warning, however, and John & Kate are alone in the structure. Seconds later, alerts pour in from all over the country, as Skynet launches the USAF's ICBMs against targets in Russia & China. In a frightening end sequence, missile trails criss-cross the sky as Russia & China launch their counterattacks, and all over the world nuclear mushroom clouds erupt. Judgment Day has come - and soon, the war against the machines will begin.Despite the lack of an 'opening' sequence about the future war, it still leaves open great potential for a Terminator 4. The characters of the future war are introduced to us in a way that makes them believable and real. It will be interesting to see how the CSM-101 Terminators figure in the future war - we are given some hint of this in future war sequences that show huge platoons of CSM-101s deploying from Skynet bombers against the human resistance. Bring on Terminator 4!",8,1,2,14 February 2005
Titanic," A masterpiece in historical accuracy as well as screen writing
","When I saw James Cameron's Titanic on its opening day in 1997, I remember overhearing a woman explaining to her 2 daughters, 'The Titanic was a real ship and real people died on it', so they would not become totally caught up in the love story of Jack & Rose. I had first read about the legendary Titanic when I was about 10 years old, but I had no idea just how horrible the real disaster has been until reading Walter Lord's 'A Night to Remember' and seeing the 1959 B & W movie based on that book. When Dr. Robert Ballard found the Titanic's resting place in 1985 the world's interest was re-opened in the story, and Cameron's massive undertaking to retell the story of that fatal night in April 1912 was a success on any scale.I was mostly interested in the historical aspects of the story, and was not disappointed. Cameron's research into the ship's design, the passenger list (especially 1st-class), the costumes, right down to the last detail on the 1st-class china, is minute. It was SO close to the historical accuracy as detailed by Walter Lord (and later by Robert Ballard) that one could have easily believed they were actually there.Cameron's use of a love story featuring people at opposite ends of the spectrum (Rose, the dignified 1st-class girl and Jack, the impoverished steerage passenger) makes for an interesting element in the story. Though the story focused largely on their own experiences I don't think it detracted from the movie's historical accuracy. We often see Rose & Cal Hockley interacting with such real-life passengers as J.J. Astor, Ben Guggenheim, Molly Brown & the Countess of Rothes. It also focused well on Jack's experiences in steerage which were probably similar to those of many steerage-class passengers, who often found themselves trapped below decks in a ship that was rapidly filling with water.Some of the more interesting historical elements were cut & later released on the deluxe DVD edition; one shows Capt. Smith calling for the boats to standby close to the ship and Q.M. Hitchens (in Molly Brown's boat) ignoring the order. Also missing was the well-known scene of Macy's Department Store owners Isidor & Ida Strauss, which showed Mrs. Strauss insisting on remaining with her husband right until the end. (They are seen while 'Nearer My God to Thee' is playing, in their cabin as water rushes in on the floor.) Another missing scene which was understandably cut showed little Cora Caldwell (Jack's dance partner in steerage) and her family trapped by a locked gate with water rising behind them.Jack's ultimate fate was that of most steerage passengers; he died of hypothermia well before the arrival of the only rescue ship. Rose only survived because she managed to improvise a life raft on a floating piece of the Grand Staircase. She could have become one more of the small number of 1st-class women & children who did not survive (the only others were Mrs. Strauss, Mrs. H.J. Allison and her little daughter, Lorraine).Depending on how one wants to see it, this movie is either a grand love story against a backdrop of imminent doom, or a historically accurate movie with a love story as the background. Either way, Jim Cameron's masterpiece will long stand as one of movie history's greatest achievements. It could have been a colossal flop, but because so much planning had gone into it to make it as historically accurate as well as creating a story people would want to follow, it has succeeded beyond even Cameron's expectations. Well done James!",10,1,3,18 June 2007
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Still frightening 18 years later!
","I first saw this one when I was about 16, after my younger brother had told me about it. The concept of a monster that hunts you in your dreams - and follows you when you wake - was original for horror flicks.Mass murderer Fred Krueger (Englund) had killed 20+ children with the now-infamous claw-glove - an ordinary working glove outfitted with 4 straight razor blades. When he was caught by Lt. Don Thompson (Saxon) and a group of officers from the Springwood Police, several bodies of the town's murdered children were found in the boiler room where he worked. (This boiler room became the setting for the nightmares of the Elm St. teenagers in the film.) Unfortunately, as young Nancy Thompson (Langenkamp) finds out later in the film, a legal technicality sprung this monster loose from police custody. Krueger was followed to the boiler room, which an angry mob of parents torched with gasoline. Krueger burned to death inside. (Adapted from The Nightmares on Elm Street novel).Years after his death, the ghost of Fred Krueger returns - this time in the nightmares of the children whose parents had torched the boiler room and killed him. Nancy and her friends Tina (Wyss), Rod (Corri), and Glen (Depp), are experiencing nerve-wracking nightmares involving a deformed madman in a dirty red & green sweater, who is horribly burned, and wearing a glove outfitted with 4 razor-sharp blades on the fingers! Tina is the first to encounter him, first in his boiler room - from which she escapes - and again in an alley behind her home. This time, she is killed by Krueger in the dream and dies in reality - a violent, frightening death while her boyfriend Rod watches helplessly. Next morning, Rod is arrested by Nancy's dad as an obvious suspect. But Nancy has a horrifying nightmare at school in which she also encounters the horrible man with the finger-knives, and narrowly escapes. Realizing that before her death Tina had described the EXACT SAME man to her, Nancy visits Rod in police custody where he describes having a similar nightmare - in which he ALSO faced the monster with knives for fingers. When Nancy has another dream encounter with Krueger - in which she sees Krueger threatening Rod - she & Glen go to her dad's precinct and urge him to check on Rod. But by the time they reach the cell, Rod is dead - the victim of a hanging by Krueger. At Rod's funeral, Nancy describes the man in the dirty sweater and deadly finger-knives who killed Tina & Rod to her father - and a disturbing look crosses her dad's face. Nancy's mom takes her to a sleep-disorder research clinic, where Nancy has another frightening nightmare involving Krueger. This time, she emerges with a bloody gash from Krueger's blades, and something more disturbing - the old fedora hat that Krueger always wore. It is only after learning Krueger's identity that Nancy's mother reveals the true story of Fred Krueger to her daughter. Armed with this knowledge, Nancy goes about preparing herself for the final confrontation with Krueger, to bring him into her world in the same way she did with his hat - and hopefully to erase Krueger for good.In the DVD commentary, director Wes Craven described the story that inspired his concept of Fred Krueger as the demonic presence that haunts people's nightmares. Apparently it was based on a series of true events involving children of immigrants from Thailand who were living in the Los Angeles area. The children had been describing horrific nightmares to their parents and were terrified of going to sleep. In 1 case a child stayed awake for 7 days. Their parents brushed off their children's concerns, and several died in their sleep. I had never heard of this until watching the DVD version 18 years after I first saw the film! Despite its low budget, the film still does an awesome job of creating the illogicality of nightmares, such as the appearance of the sheep in the boiler room and the 20-foot-long arms that Krueger extends across the alley to block Tina's escape, not to mention Tina's terrible death which was made in a revolving room set.Still the most frightening of them all!",9,3,4,21 February 2005
