Walk the Line," Oscar-caliber performances in this truthful telling of Johnny Cash's early life
","Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give incredible portrayals of the early Johnny Cash and June Carter in this effort of James Mangold ('Girl, Interrupted'). The film chronicles the early career of Cash and his life, marred by thoughts of guilt over the death of his older brother (a topic expressly probed in 1980's 'Ordinary People'). Phoenix truly embodies The Man In Black's persona as a young man (in an Academy Award worthy role) , and Witherspoon completely sheds her persona of being a sweet-natured good girl (a la 'Legally Blonde' and 'Sweet Home Alabama') with a mature, Oscar-worthy performance of June Carter, and her solo on the autoharp is worthy of a nomination itself. Phoenix captures all of Cash's early demons, from his first marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), to his historical meeting with Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts), to his notoriously volatile courtship of June and their engagement in 1968, the same year of Cash's 'Folsom Prison Blues' in concert. This film is definitely a must-see. Give these roles a thorough look-see and extreme consideration come Awards time. ***1/2 of ****",10,0,1,26 November 2005
Catch Me If You Can," Singular Spielberg effort makes for great entertainment
","'Catch Me If You Can', written by Jeff Nathanson from Frank W. Abagnale and Stan Redding's novel of the same name, is based on the real-life story of Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose life fell apart in 1963 when his parents Paula and Frank, Sr. (Nathalie Baye and Christopher Walken) lost their house and subsequently divorced.  Not wanting to fall short of the American Dream like his father, Abagnale pulls a few forging tricks out of his hat and soon finds himself as an airline pilot, a doctor and a Louisiana lawyer, all before he turned 18!  Expensive clothes, plush suites and gorgeous women are now accessible because of his newfound 'gift' of deception.  He goes unnoticed until FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks, very effective in a supporting role) picks up on his exploits and is determined to nab him. This sets in motion a tireless game of wits between the two men.  Colorful sets and nostalgic backdrops gives the film its 'look', but the real juice comes from the cat-and-mouse teaming of DiCaprio and Hanks, with fine support from Walken, Baye, Jennifer Garner (in a memorably amusing cameo as a seductive prostitute) and Amy Adams (as Abagnale's nymphet wife, Brenda). Very similar in nature to 'The Thomas Crown Affair', this engrossing (if overlong) caper won Oscar nominations for Walken and composer John Williams. *** of ****",Null,0,1,15 May 2003
Monster," Fact-based drama features unforgettable performances from Theron and Ricci.
","Patty Jenkins' 'Monster' is the real life story of recently executed prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos, who murdered a series of men between 1989 and 1990.  The film focuses on that time period and Wuornos' budding lesbian relationship with Selby Wall, a quiet, shy young girl looking for companionship.  The film dosen't attempt to glamorize Wuornos' life, but it does paint a shocking portrait of why she killed her 'johns', problems dating back to her childhood.  Until now, Charlize Theron has just been seen in decorative supporting parts ('That Thing You Do!', 'The Cider House Rules' and 'The Italian Job'), but this time, she IS the lead character, and she IS Aileen Wuornos.  Her Oscar-winning portrayal of the emotionally broken and suffering Wuornos is devastatingly real and brilliant.  Kudos to Christina Ricci, as well, for her quiet, fierce, award-caliber role as Selby.  Their scenes together are intensely effective, but ther are also scenes with Wuornos and her 'johns' that are quite heartbreaking as well: the vignette when she is with an equally broken, stammering man named Gene (Pruitt Taylor Vince), and the shockingly realistic scene with Horton (Scott Wilson), a middle-aged passerby who unsuspectingly gives the young woman a ride, little expecting the danger in store.  From beginning to end, 'Monster' is a powerful tour-de-force and a cinematic achievement.  ***1/2",Null,1,1,11 March 2004
Finding Nemo," A delightful film for kids and adults alike!
","'Finding Nemo', Pixar's latest project, is a wonderful story about the unbreakable bonds of father and son.  Clownfish Marlin (voiced by Albert Brooks) is an overprotective father who tries to shield his underdeveloped son Nemo (voiced by Alexander Gould) from the ills of the underwater world. One day Nemo is caught in a net by a fisherman, and with the help of a friendly and forgetful fish named Dory (voiced by Ellen DeGeneres), the duo go about trying to locate the missing boy-fish, encountering various characters along the way (from a shark in rehab to a family of sea turtles). A wonderfully fresh and inspiring film, this box-office hit can only get better with each viewing.  A winner.  ***1/2",Null,1,2,18 December 2003
Being John Malkovich," Pungent black comedy about the consequences of human exploitation.
","Weird.  Strange.  Thought-provoking.  These adjectives can be used to accurately describe what you may feel after watching this very original satire/fantasy written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze. Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a struggling puppeteer who gets a job as a filing clerk on the 7 1/2 (!) floor of an office building.  One day after dropping a folder behind a filing cabinet, Craig discovers a small door which leads him into the actual mind of actor John Malkovich!  After experiencing this unbelievable sensation, he is then dumped in a ditch near The New Jersey Turnpike.  Craig then relates his experience to his bisexual, pet-loving wife Lotte (played by an unrecognizable Cameron Diaz) who after going through the portal herself, is convinced that she REALLY wants to be John Malkovich!  Malkovich himself seems to be having a good time poking fun at his own image, giving light to his own hang-ups and eccentricities. However, the film's most colorful character is the shrewd, shrewish, and cold-hearted office worker Maxine Lund (played to perfection by Catherine Keener, who deservedly won an Academy Award nomination), who finds herself becoming the object of both Craig and Lotte's sexual obsessions.  For a $200 fee, Craig and Maxine begin offering everyday people their own chance to be John Malkovich, leading to a dramatic (and less than hilarious) conclusion.. This is an imaginative and sensational expose (in the vein of 'Network' and 'Bamboozled') about the effects of trading in integrity for dollars. Nominated for 3 Oscars, 'Being John Malkovich' is a movie experience like no other.",Null,1,2,21 December 2002
American History X," Gripping.
","That one word pretty much sums up this tour-de-force drama, about reformed, recently paroled ex-skinhead Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton, who is amazing in his Oscar-nominated performance), his troubled life, his confrontation with his past, and his relationship with his younger brother Daniel (Edward Furlong, who is equally startling).  How a film with such stark subject matter like racism and intolerance can be made in this day and age and not seem over-the-top is incredible.  The main reason that I enjoyed this film is because even though the main characters are hateful, hate-filled people, you can't help but commiserate with them.  You can't help but feel sorry for them and the beliefs that they've espoused.  This movie depicts the reality of racial discrimination in modern America and the drastic and dire effects these viewpoints can have.  Also, irony and imagery are elements that, if used effectively enough, can teach others as well as make them think.  The irony: Derek went to jail for killing a Black man, befriended a Black man in jail named Lamont (Guy Torry), and soon after changed his xenophobic line of thinking.  The imagery: the B&W images represent Derek's bleak closemindedness as oppose to the color images, which symbolize his acceptance of 'color' in his life.  The conclusion, which is nothing short of mesmerizing, is a vivid reminder that violence and hate constantly revolve in a vicious cycle.  One of the most controversial and thought-provoking films in recent cinema, 'American History X' is a film that everyone (racists and liberals alike) should view at least once.  A must-see.  ****",Null,0,1,25 December 2002
The Pianist," Heartbreaking, real-life account of one man's journey through the brutality of war.
","The opening sequence of 'The Pianist' shows a pensive young man sitting at his piano, playing a sonata.  Soon, bombs burst everywhere, leading to a swift evacuation of war-torn Poland.  'The Pianist', written by Ronald Harwood from the memoirs of Polish Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman (1912-2000), is heart-tugging moviemaking at its peak.  Adrien Brody is compelling as the beaten but not defeated Szpilman, who amazingly survived the German invaision over a five-year period (but lost his entire family).  His struggle to secure food, shelter and elude murderous German officers is often painful and unbearable to watch, but during these troubled times, serves to remind us of the senseless brutality of war.  The supporting cast is also incrdible, including Emilia Fox as Dorota, one of Szpilman's admirers who aids him during his peril, and Thomas Kretschmann's small role near the end as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, the German officer who spared Szpilman's life when he caught the pianist in hiding, is fine as well. Roman Polanski's most personal film to date may also be his best.  Three Oscars for Best Actor, Director and Adapted Screenplay.  A moving, immensely powerful story.  ****",Null,0,1,4 June 2003
The Graduate," Classic late 60s mosaic of youth angst and alienation
","One of the most treasured relics of a landmark era, 'The Graduate' is the story of Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman in his star-making role), a 21-year old milquetoast who seems a little worried about his future.  After graduating college, he dosen't seem to have any direction or prospects.  At a welcome home party given by his parents, he crosses paths with Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft, who is marvelous), a middle-aged alcoholic friend of his parents.  She asks him to drive her home.  He does.  She asks him to have a drink.  He does.  She asks him to see her daughter Elaine's portrait. He does.  She asks him to have an affair.  Boy, does he!  Their 'relationship' gets all the more complicated when Ben falls for Elaine (Katharine Ross) to Mrs. Robinson's chagrin.  This film is splendid in every way--the soundtrack by Simon and Garfunkel, observations about the vain lives of southern Californians, and the repression of sexual emotions and feelings--and never takes itself too seriously.  Extremely interesting contrast of Ben's nervous relationship with Mrs. Robinson in the first half, and his boy-meets-girl relationship with Elaine in the second half.  Loaded with celebrity cameos (inc. Alice Ghostley, Marion Lorne, Norman Fell and even a young Richard Dreyfuss).  Peerless script by Calder Willingham and Buck Henry (who's seen here as the hotel desk clerk) from the Charles Webb novel.  Among its seven Oscar nods (three being for Hoffman, Bancroft and Ross), Mike Nichols won for his pitch-perfect direction.  A timeless classic about youthful disillusionment.  ****",Null,0,1,13 September 2003
Some Like It Hot," Irrepressibly funny and frantic film; excellent performances
","Billy Wilder's 'Some Like It Hot' opens in 1929 Chicago and follows the desperation of musicians Joe 'Josephine' (Tony Curtis) and Jerry 'Daphne' (Jack Lemmon) to get out of town after witnessing the St. Valentine's Day massacre.  The solution?  Board a train to Miami posing as girls with an all-female band!  Everything about Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's script is hilariously pitch-perfect, including the train sequence, the meeting of Daphne and Osgood Fielding (Joe E. Brown, whose closing line is a gem), and the yacht sequence with Joe and the sweetly dim-witted Sugar Kane (the incomparable Marilyn Monroe, who gives one of her best comic performances). Side-splitting support from George Raft, Pat O'Brien and Joan Shawlee add to the fun.  Oscar winner for Best B&W Costume design (Orry-Kelly).  A definite must-see comedy classic! ****",Null,1,2,4 March 2004
Mystic River," Trenchant, somber production with several potent vignettes
","Dennis Lehane's 'Mystic River', adapted by Brian Helgeland and directed by Clint Eastwood, is a coming-of-age tale/character study/murder mystery with marginally compelling results.  As young boys growing up in a working class section of Boston, Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine and Dave Boyle spent their days reveling in their youthful innocence until one event drastically alters the course of their lives, Dave Boyle's in particular.  Thirty years later, Jimmy Markum's eldest daughter is found dead, and the three old friends (whose lives took separate paths) are reunited under less than harmonious circumstances.  Later, Dave is targeted as a suspect in the girl's death. Sean, now a police detective (Kevin Bacon), along with his partner Whitey Powers (Laurence Fishburne), is assigned to the investigation.  From here dramatic fireworks erupt in key scenes such as when Jimmy discovers what has happened to his daughter, when a shaken Dave comes home covered in blood to his stunned wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden in a perfectly crafted, Oscar-nominated portrayal), when Celeste confides in Jimmy about Dave, and Jimmy and Dave's final confrontation.  The only main character who seems woefully misplaced is Annabeth (Laura Linney), Jimmy's second wife.  She has very few scenes anyway, and doesn't know what to do with the scant screen time she has.  Annabeth has a powerful speech towards the end, but parts of it defy comprehension.  She has a dramatic point to make, but it only comes across halfway.  The same argument for Fishburne's stereotypical role as a sarcastic, platitude-uttering cop.  He just doesn't bring much depth to his role.  The real meat of the film lies in the deeply emotional (and personal) performances of Sean Penn, as Markum, and Tim Robbins, as Boyle (both men won Oscars for their gripping work).  Bacon is good, too, as Devine, but the subplot involving his faceless wife is extremely diverting (this must be the story's way of involving his personal background).  Also, what conclusion(s) can the viewer make from the final scene?  A mixed bag by Eastwood, but undeniably compelling.  ***",Null,0,0,29 April 2004
Rosemary's Baby," Riveting modern day horror chiller from Polanski
","'Rosemary's Baby', adapted by director Roman Polanski from Ira Levin's ('The Stepford Wives') novel, tells the tale of awe-inducing, mind-numbing witchcraft in late 60s Manhattan. Guy and Rosemary Woodhouse (John Cassavetes and Mia Farrow) move into the grand Dakota, and are immediately seen as the All-American couple: He's an aspiring actor, and she is a dutiful young woman hoping to conceive a labor of love. They are immediately befriended by the Castevet's, Roman (a terrifically menacing Sidney Blackmer) and Minnie (Best Supporting Actress scene-stealer Ruth Gordon), who lead the pregnant young woman through dis-invigorating hell. A terrific script, score (by Krzysztof Komeda), and minor supporting roles from Patsy Kelly as childish Laura-Louise, Charles Grodin as Dr. Hill, Rosemary's seemingly good-natured obstetrician, and Dr. Sapirstein (a stern, Ralph Bellamy) round out this incredible ensemble. Only complaint: Where was Mia Farrow's Oscar nomination? Or Best Picture? ****of****",Null,0,0,30 July 2005
Vanilla Sky," All hail 'Citizen Dildo'!
","For those who thought that 'Eyes Wide Shut' was Tom Cruise's most compelling film, take a look at this surrealistic 2001 fantasy/allegory directed by Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire).  In one of his most introspective roles, Cruise plays David Aames, a wealthy, handsome head of a publishing company. Cameron Diaz plays Julie, David's friend and frequent sex partner whose mental instability and psychotic fixation on him (literally) drives them over the edge.  Penelope Cruz is Sofia, a luminous dancer who captures the heart of David and fuels his true masculine passions.  These three characters form a mental/emotional menage-a-trois which leads David into a harrowing sequence of events, which he relates to Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell).  From the moment their eyes meet, the audience can sense the chemistry between Cruise and Cruz, but the MANY instances of deja vu in the movie will keep you guessing until the gripping end.  The fantasy episodes are a marvel to watch, which transports the film from its realism and turns it into perceptive imagery.  With surrealistic set-pieces (the deserted New York streets in the beginning) and artistic cinematography by John Toll, Vanilla Sky is a wondrous venture into the complexity of one man's personality, mind and soul.  Why Cruise was overlooked for a Best Actor Oscar nomination, and Cruz and Diaz for Supporting Actresses, is one of those unexplainable omissions only the AMPAS can answer.  All in all, a provocative and disturbing movie experience.  *****",Null,0,0,15 November 2002
Casino," THE 'Gone With the Wind' of gambling flicks
","Director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker and Oscar-winning actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci reunited for this three-hour epic tale of the rise, fall and resurrection of a casino proprietor.  Set in Las Vegas from 1973 to 1983, 'Casino' tells the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro, in one of his most underdeveloped roles) who makes his mark as one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas.  He has money, notoriety, connections, everything...except that special woman.  Enter Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone in a knockout performance that earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination), a flashy, high-maintenance, money-driven cocaine hustler/prostitute who eventually becomes Mrs. Sam Rothstein.  Nicky Santoro (Pesci) is Sam's hotheaded friend who become a major player on the gambling scene himself, until greed and distrust bring their glittery (albeit volatile) decadence to a monumental halt.  With all of the film's star power and energy, it still just takes a long time to get where it's going (wherever that is).  Whether it was Scorsese's handling of this particular material, or Nicholas Pileggi's inability to adapt his own novel to the screen, 'Casino' is just a few notches short of achieving real meaning and depth.  However, the film certainly deserved more nominations than it received (its only one being for Stone's characterization of Ginger): Pesci's explosive supporting role, Robert Richardson's vivid, colorful cinematography, John Dunn and Rita Ryack's costumes and Jack G. Taylor Jr. and Rick Simpson's Art Direction/Set Decoration all went unnoticed by the Academy.  Artistically, 'Casino' is a visually sumptuous masterpiece.  Storywise, the movie fails to deliver in certain areas.  An uneven mixture, but it IS a handsome production.  *** out of ****.",Null,1,1,17 April 2003
