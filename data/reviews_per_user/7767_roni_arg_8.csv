Resident Evil: Afterlife," Fun, but dumb
","It is fun to watch, like the other three, but this one is by far the worst of the saga because it is full of ridiculous mistakes and clich√©s. Watch it only if you don't have anything better at hand...Jovovich is great like in the previous ones, but even she cannot save this movie. She looses her powers, but this doesn't really make a difference, she still fights like a super human. When she has Wesker at aim, instead of just shooting him, like anyone else would, she asks Any last words? only to make him aware of her presence. Then, he turns into Neo and the zombies mutate into Tremor-like creatures. We still don't know how the survivors are getting food and gas. Well, OK, we can forget all this for the movie's sake.But some things are just ridiculous. The survivors in LA are keeping a man prisoner because they don't trust him. But the man is perfectly healthy! A healthy strong man in a zombie ridden world and he is a prisoner?? And how can he be strong and healthy when he has been confined to a 2 by 2 space for God knows how long?? And the ship, well. It turns out the ship is a lab facility where over 2000 people are being experimented on. A devastated world, 99,99% of the population are zombies, but somehow the Corp. is still experimenting *something* on survivors and finding healthy workers to pilot helicopters...come on, do they do it for the salary to buy, um, nothing?? One last thing, I never understood why they didn't just torch the zombies outside the prison...the zombies were there all together, it seemed like they were waiting to burn in a huge pyre of zombies...but no, Milla has to shoot them one by one, of course, losing a couple of secondary characters along the way.",5,0,1,22 April 2011
It," Want a regular horror movie? See this. Want a masterpiece? Read the book.
","I read the book and I have to admit they are not very similar. The friends are there, and It, but that's all. Usually, books are way better than adaptations because authors say so much. They give great backstories, characters have unique personalities and feelings, events take their time to unfold. In the movie, time is a constrain, so all this is summarized and sometimes not very effectively. This is the case with It. So, to enjoy it as a horror movie you don't have to compare it to anything. The cast works fine and the special effects and cinematography are ok. Dialogues too, usually in horror movies dialogues are lame. If you want to enjoy a decent horror movie, see this. If you want a masterpiece, read the book. There's a reason why Stephen King is called the King of horror. This book is worth It (pun intended). The book opens with Georgie's scene, and this is the best scene the director managed to convey from the book. In the book though (spoiler ahead) Georgie's body is found. And there are many changes throughout the movie that is difficult to know why they were changed, since they worked great. This gives an idea of many pointless stuff in the movie, that actually make sense in the book. Also, in the book, the kids take weapons when they go searching for It. The part when they are adults is completely missing (guess they kept it for chapter 2) but this makes the movie more of a Stranger Things than It. The movie is watchable anyways.",7,0,0,11 November 2018
The Hunger Games," Did not read the books, did not like the movie
","First, I will repeat this, I have not read the books. But I can imagine that the books must be obviously better because the movie is kind of bad...It's called Hunger Games why?? No one is hungry, ever. I mean seriously, it should be Hunting Games, or Last One Standing, but hunger?? Didn't get it.But the seriously disturbing part is...the plot is gruesome and violent and yet this movie does not convey any emotion to the viewer.Katniss saves her sister, but you don't feel a connection between them. The sister is a whiny little fool who is 12 years old and can't even make a line. She shows nothing when her name comes up, it's like she doesn't even understand what's going on. We should feel sorry for the little girl, feel Katniss' desperation, but instead you almost want the sister to go and leave Katniss to enjoy her life with Gale!Then the oppression the districts have to tolerate, and the sadistic rich people who use these poor kids as entertainment. It should make you angry, it should show the ridiculousness of it all, the violence, the ruthlessness of the privileged, how unfair and terrible. But it doesn't, it doesn't move anything inside the viewer. The movie 'In Time' does this much better.And the game itself. Man, 24 teens get locked up in a forest to kill each other. It's terrifying; hunted like prey, having to sneak and hide and kill other kids. It really gets on your nerves!!! But it's all too anesthetized. The kids die and no one cares about them, they don't have back stories, there's no character development, they are all extras!!! Even Rue, who I think touches Katniss' heart, is just another extra! You ask yourself why is Katniss so moved??And the background love story...what love story??? Is she pretending so they'll win?? Does she eventually fall for real?? Did he really love her in the first place or he just said that to win sponsors? If they loved for real, you don't feel the love.Things happen but you don't feel for them. The plot is very good, this movie should be full of emotions -anger, anxiety, sorrow, desperation, shock- but it has none.",6,4,8,21 July 2012
Life of Pi," Moving, brilliant. A perfect masterpiece.
","This is not just a movie, it is a real masterpiece. It is what a film should be. The cinema is the telling of a story through images and sounds and this film does all this, and more, in a very beautiful, artistic and touching way.The visuals are breathtaking. From the opening scene (the zoo), a swimming pool, even a shipwreck, to the images of the ocean, the fauna and the sky. Every frame is a beautiful picture. The colors are bright and perfectly blended. The little boat just floating in the immensity of the ocean where you can't tell where the water ends and the sky begins will amaze you.The soundtrack is magnificent. It is very touching, it sets the moods very well, and the Indian sounds suit everything wonderfully.The story is moving to the core. Everyone who has lost something or someone dear will be moved to tears. Everyone who has ever said a definite 'goodbye' will walk out the cinema with a knot in their throats. Whether you have faith, whether you believe in God, in some power, or whether you don't, you will be looking inside yourself, wondering, reflecting.What do we have when we've lost everything? Is there a higher power? Do animals have souls? Are we any different from them? Which story do you prefer?",10,5,10,28 January 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I'm not paying to see any more Star wars movies
","Last Jedi is a disgrace for the saga. The movie feels like it's a totally different universe. More like Marvel. Jedis are more like X-Men now, they have all sorts of superpowers and tricks that they didn't have before. Now with the Force you can make videocalls and hologram yourself like Loki. Where there was evil and the dark side before, now you have a weird kid Vader-wannabe who throws tantrums like a 2 year old and can misteriously overpower the Emperor-wannabe as easy as pie (how??). Where there were efforts in training and developing Jedi skills and wisdom, now there is a couple of days of BS, a cave that doesn't scare anyone and lame lines. Where there was a brave Jedi who single handedly faced Vader and the Emperor and lived to tell, now there's a depressed lame character who exiled himself because a child seemed to have inclinations towards the dark side (WTF, Luke brought Vader back). I'm just going to erase this episode from my mind and pretend it didn't happen.",4,18,25,10 November 2018
The Shape of Water," It really made me feel uncomfortable
","The movie is well made, cinematography, actors, cameras, special effects, sound, editing, everything is wonderful. Except there's a creature here that is not human, and a woman who falls in love with it, has sex with it (or at least kind of tries, since it is not human it's hard to tell). There's a point where the movie turns really weird and uncomfortable.
I've been thinking, there are a lot of movies with non-human characters who fall in love with humans and it's not remotely weird, in fact, it's nice and romantic. Take Guardians of the Galaxy with starlord and gamorra, or Avatar... but they are all human-like. The thing with this movie is that the creature is very animal-like. It reminds you of a dog. It feels, it learns, it tilts its head when curious, you see it suffering and you feel bad, it hunts and eats a house cat because it's a wild animal. So seeing the woman dancing naked with it gets extremely weird. You loose the point of it all. Is it a movie against bullying? Against racism? Against animal abuse? About love? About feminism? About strange relationships? The only thing I liked and I thought was very well achieved was the bad guy. The actor does a great job at getting you to hate him. The rest of the movie was a big WTF. I really don't understand why they gave it an Oscar.",6,3,6,23 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Gosh, so boring
","GOSH is this movie boring! It's like a whole hour too long. And the plot is weird, there are holes in the argument, inconsistencies, weird story telling, and ridiculous things, such as:.The movie starts in Gotham, then suddenly jumps to Metropolis being invaded by aliens? WTF? And Bruce Wayne is there too. Superman fights the invading enormous ships that destroy all the buildings. A guy gets crushed by debris and looses his legs, so he hates Superman for not saving his legs (again wtf). . Lex Luthor is a nut case that, for some not explained reason, hates Superman so much he is willing to go through some serious work to kill him (this includes creating a creature that could wipe life from earth as we know it, Luthor included). .Even though Lex Luthor is a nut case, senators believe him and are willing to give him what he wants. .No one knows who the woman is or where she comes from or even why she is there, not even Batman or Superman. .Batman seriously hates Superman and wants to kill him very much for a reason that is not clear. This is weird since everyone knows Superman is the best and kindest person on this planet. .Batman steals kryptonite from Luthor (this is not easy), designs a weapon with it and fights Superman in a fight that makes you hate Batman and wonder why he suddenly turned into such a stupid character. . When Batman is about to use the weapon and win the fight, just like he wants, Superman says 'martha' and they become super awesome friends (this literally happens). Batman throws away the kryptonite weapon, it just lies there and everyone leaves. And a long etc. Conclusion: wait and see it at home.",4,10,21,26 March 2016
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Get Dreamworks on acid and this is the result: deliriously funny and entertaining!!
","I went to the movies expecting to see a film similar to the previous two, but I was nicely surprised. This movie is so fast paced, delirious and hilarious I can't believe it. The characters tour Europe with a circus with new friends that are amazing. There's an Italian dorky sea lion (steals the movie), a bitter Russian tiger, quick-tempered puppies on roller skates, pop music, neon colors, the zebra flies through the rainbow, King Julian strolls The Vatican while Andrea Bocelli sounds, there's a bear on a Ducati, the villain is so evil she is like the terminator and sings Edith Piaf (would steal the movie if it weren't for the seal)...You are probably wondering how they managed to pack all this in one movie with a good plot and make it incredibly entertaining. I don't know, but they did it!!Go see it in theaters to fully enjoy the circus experience and don't miss the 3D.",9,1,2,10 June 2012
