Requiem for a Dream," Unique, Chilling, eye-opening
","Language limitations often limit us to be able to portray the feelings we get from watching, reading and viewing art. This movie is art at its finest. All the cast in this movie you've seen in other pictures, but I can say with confidence that each of the four main cast members give their best performance in thie movie, especially Ellen Burnstyn whose character is one of my favorite of all time. I've watched this movie at least 5 times and each time I get something more out of it.The movie is about much more than this comment to follow, but on a surface level, this is a movie that older teenagers should watch to reconsider drug habits. It would make more sense for the anti-drug squad to show this movie to teenagers then to give their contradictory 'proof' and 'facts' on the dangers of drug abuse.On a deeper level, the viewer will find something in this movie that can relate to their lives, whether it is the empty feeling we get sometimes sitting on our couch or lying in bed or the emotion and fear caused by aging, getting old and feeling lonely.I like a number of Hollywood hits for their special effects or one-time entertainment value, but this movie is a subjective, deep look at the downward spiral of 4 lives that goes beyond cheap thrills. I related to the movie and I don't even drink or do drugs. It made me rethink some things in my live, I cried at parts, thought of family/ friends.This review is vague, not really telling you much, but i'll finish by saying you MUST watch this brilliant film.",10,1,2,2 November 2005
