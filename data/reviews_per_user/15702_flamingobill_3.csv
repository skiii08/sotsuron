Kill Bill: Vol. 2," QT delivers a masterpiece with both films combined
","The first one was an adrenaline rush of a good time, while the second one pushes the end product to be a masterpiece. It's up there with Akira Kurosawa's 'The Seven Samurai'. The first film played out like a video game with great visuals, music, and a thin story without characterization or QT's sharp dialogue (and managed to be great because of all this, because it was, plain and simple, a bloody good, shocking time), while the second one can stand on it's own as a full movie. It has what the first one lacked, yet without the first one the mythology about the Bride, and just how brutally, and horrifyingly violent she can get, is absent. Together, as a whole, the movie delivers on every note any cinemaphile could want in a movie.",10,1,2,10 April 2004
The Fountain," Pretty, but not much of a movie
","While I found the movie entertaining, I was disappointed by the film's structure. The film is about the fear of dying. The emotions were all there and terrific, with acting solid. But, the film is more of a metaphor/allegory for trying to come to terms with death, than a filmic story. I guess if you go into the film expecting to get a filmic poem, you may not be disappointed. I personally felt they could have kept the poeticism and lengthened the movie into a cohesive narrative story. Perhaps that was the original intent, as I heard the studios had the filmmakers shorten and completely change the original script. As it stands, the ending happens suddenly, and is a let-down. The message it sends isn't surprising, and maybe fleshed-out more could've been effective. It looks like the film could've been amazing. Still, the visuals are cool, the ride, while bumpy here and there, was neat fun, and it was never less than entertaining. Maybe there'll be a director's cut on DVD or something, I'm not sure. I'll keep my fingers crossed.",7,2,4,30 November 2006
Signs," It's bad points out weigh the good. --spoilers--
","If it had stuck to the horror, which it so well developed it would've been the good movie it thinks it is, but it has a few bad moments, and a disappointing ending which ultimately detract from what little it does well. I was thrown out of the movie as soon as the director cast himself as a supporting role. His intro was practically a spoof of itself. The camera techniques to avoid seeing the aliens, and letting our imagination scare us was a clever technique (much like Aliens), but as soon as they were seen onscreen (TV bit, and end bit) the whole mystery/terror was quickly erased. Plus the reason for thier leaving is completely obsurd (as well as the end confrontation with the aliens). Lastly the director did his trademork flashback explanation ending, only for this film it wasn't necessary. The twist was that the story wasn't about aliens but about religion/family, and frankly that's not much of a twist, and you really don't need flashback to explain that.",4,1,1,29 January 2003
