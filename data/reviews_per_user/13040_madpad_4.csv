Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I love how many people totally miss the point
","But the fact that it was released in the US at all shows just how much everyone missed that Americans were the butt of EVERY single joke.From playing on their desire to appear cultured and accepting, to the point where a hostess lets him hold a bag of feaces at the dinner table, anywhere else in the world this would fail, and it works because most of the people involved don't realise they are being insulted.The whole point is that Americans have such a limited view on the outside world that they think there are people in other parts of the world who don't know how a toilet works, that don't know what a hotel is, that would have a telegram informing them of their wife's death sent to them in a language they cant read.It highlights American racism and anti semitism, comments like how many Gypsies could i kill with this car? and a good gun for shooting Jews, all of which were treated as completely normal rather than kicking him out of the shop or car lot.SBC is a comedy genius with this page adding to the hilarity, with comments proving that he is still mugging everyone who sees it in the US",8,0,5,4 December 2007
Spider-Man 3," Awful, disgusting. Personally I felt violated
","Without a shadow of a doubt the worst film made from a comic book, EVER and I'm including Supergirl.If they had said at the beginning: Not so much based on characters created by, but more so loosely based you might imagine we spelt Parker with a Z, then they might have got away with calling this film Spiderman.It was gut wrenchingly painful to watch, the story didn't so much arc as fall over and die, cough a little, stand up and then fall again. Massive plot gaps, massive story gaps, so much left unexplained and not easy to resolve with imagination even if you were a fan of the comic books.Like how did Parker explain Harry's injuries and if not state of the art body armour complete lack of clothing? Why did he carry him from the alleged car accident rather than call the emergency services, you cant exactly perform CPR on the hoof? What tests did Dr Connors perform on the symbiote sample that was left behind, oh and by the way why didn't it die? But that aside why didn't he tell Peter it was sensitive to sonic waves, that would surely be somewhere in the tests for a biological organism, ultra-sounds are not exactly uncommon.On purely plot related things if Spiderman was so loved by the city (which by the way he isn't in the comic books, criminal, vigilante all sorts of other nice names) why didn't he just admit who he was, at least then he could move out of his rat trap apartment.Why in a film costing in excess of $100million dollars couldn't they let Kirsten Dunst sing her own songs, or if she did at least dub them into the film in something resembling a professional way.I could go on, but Why Sam Raimi allowed his name to be near this I don't know, how Stan Lee could appear in it I don't know (although that scene was even more wooden than usual). All I can say is to allow the studios to do this sort of damage to an icon like spiderman, both of them must have seriously fleshed out their wallets which really makes them worse",1,28,48,5 May 2007
28 Days Later...," What would YOU do if..... ?
","What would you do if you woke up alone?That one question will haunt you after you see this film. Shot in London, a city with which i am more than familiar, the sheer loneliness of the first few scenes is striking. Seeing Cheapside devoid of life, The London Eye not turning, and the silence, it is errie in a way that defies belief.Danny Boyle did an amazing job with the subject matter, making it fightningly realistic. The characters were well defined and in the current climate of alleged impending bio-war from Iraq, it is easy to put yourself in the position of any of the people portrayed.What is most scary is how normal they all are, just doing what needs to be done, to survive and exist, making the most of an overwhelming experiance.
You are unlikely to run for the kleenex, although the scares, (there are a few), may have you diving for cover, or new undewear but that may just be me, but there is serious emotion in this piece and that makes it watchable. I was sceptical going in (my thoughts were actually this will be s***e but it will pass a few hours) but coming out i was so impressed at how gripped i was all those thoughts evaporated.Not for the faint hearted, but for those who love cinema at its best, this is a must see.",Null,0,0,3 November 2002
Black Hawk Down," Just saw it today, americans look away now.
","Subject: Black Hawk DownWhat happens when the Americans f*** up big time?They complicate things, and add carnage to the order of the day.A seemingly simple mission. Go in, get the bad guys, leave. If the SAS did it it would have been covert and a small team. When the Yanks do it everyone gets a hand in Delta, Rangers, Air Corps, the lot. And what happens when they know you are coming, and they are ready? Lots of dead soldiers.Directed by top brit Ridley Scott the film concentrates on the heroics of the soldiers, their integrity, their bravery and to be fair some skill while not entirely avoiding the mistakes that caused the whole SNAFU to happen.The story is set in the Somalia civil war(oxymoron) and the trouble that followed the UN sending in food shipments, which were then hi-jacked on a regular basis. The Americans stayed to try and help by getting rid of the warlord behind the hi-jackings.What follows is the sort of thing that Custer would have been proud off, 10,000 p***ed off somalians vs 81 US troops, any one need a quick math lesson here.Some excellent direction leads to some excellent acting from the lead Josh Hartnet (Pearl Harbour, The Faculty) and a few notable actors (mostly Brits but with accents as shocking as Tom Cruise in Far and Away) put up sterling performances Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting, Pearl Harbour) Ewan McGregor, Jason Issacs (The Patriot, Armageddon), Tom Sizemore (Heat, Pearl Harbour, Red Planet), Ron Eldard (ER, Sleepers) and William Fichtner (Armageddon, Pearl Harbour). They are believable (for the most part) and for reasonably unknown actors with the exception of McGregor you wonder where they have been hiding.As I tried to show most of them have worked with Jerry Bruckheimer and this probably helps their portrayal of a unit of troops and as you will see the one who hasn't (McGregor again) is one who has never been in the field with them.Its worth seeing, not too long for the subject matter but i suggest not taking in a big drink, oh and concentrate, the first 5 minutes are narrative, but in subtitles, and it sets the whole scene.Enjoy.",Null,0,0,18 January 2002
