Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runiner 2049 - Not what I expected
","I'd call it 'Blade Ruiner 2049' because the sequel ruins the mystique of the original movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high. In my opinion, the story-line of the original 'Blade Runner' conceived by Philip B. Dick was far more compelling than the screenplay from which the sequel is based. Any attempt to build upon the original movie should have been considered sacred ground. And though the sequel did capture the original movie's cinematic ethos, the movie lacked substance and it all seemed too Hollywood. Maybe it was the numbingly slow development of an uninteresting story-line, too preoccupied on showcasing the juxtaposition of a decaying society supported by technological advancements. Maybe it was Ryan Gosling's lackluster and soulless performance. Or maybe it was the marketing ploy to unnecessarily include Deckard, Harrison Ford's character, when the movie could have gone in other much more compelling directions. All in all, I found myself hoping the movie would end halfway through it. So, if stunning visual effects is enough to keep you entertained for 2.75 hours, then see this movie. Otherwise, before you waste 2.75 hours in a theater, I suggest reading more reviews, and not just the 'dummy' reviews the studio has managed to enter, but the authentic reviews of unbiased folks hoping to see a sequel worthy of its original.",2,13,26,10 October 2017
