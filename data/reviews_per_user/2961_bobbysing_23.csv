Captain Phillips," One of the most authentic & moving portrayals of a real life event on screen.
","Post a fascinating UNITED 93, based on the real life tragedy of 9/11, director Paul Greengrass returns to portray another horrifying event of the recent history when an American cargo ship was attacked by Somali pirates in 2009, taking the captain away as their only hostage. Luckily, Captain Phillips survived that tragedy with the timely efforts of the rescue team and he later wrote a book on the event too as the co-author titled 'A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea', on which the film is based upon.CAPTAIN PHILLIPS superbly gives you a realistic account of the event and is definitely not an easy entertaining watch to say the truth. Its highly impressive recreation of the attack, at first excites you well and then even makes you sea sick and claustrophobic because of its constantly jerky, hand-held camera movements edited skilfully. There is a great amount of energy and excitement in its initial moments when the pirates are fast approaching towards the ship trying to get on it from any side. But once they successfully get over the deck, a disturbing tension is all over the progression till the end, which even becomes annoying to some extent as I felt.Without going into a documentary mode, Paul thoughtfully shows the contrasting living conditions in Somalia before introducing the pirates as pure villains. And due to that one scene alone, the viewer is not able to hate the attackers completely even if they act as a clear life taking threat to the Captain and his crew. At times the film loses its connection with the viewers in its second hour. But an energetic, fast paced background score always brings them back into the proceedings and one repeatedly finds himself sitting at the edge of his seat, watching the screen attentively.As a frightening surprise, it has a first timer Barkhad Abdi, exceptionally playing the skinny, lean and scary leader of the pirates, standing tall in front of the towering performance of the veteran Tom Hanks. But what Tom displays in the final 10 minutes of the film, enacting the post-trauma stress in his lost expressions, is nothing short of text book material and pure cinematic triumph achieved by the gifted actor once again. Playing it pretty calm and composed in the entire film, Tom delivers what he is known for in these final moments alone and one just keeps thinking about him in particular while walking out of the theater quite honestly.Not an easy subject to shoot, admittedly the film might not be a visual treat for a major section of viewers looking for just thrilling entertainment in those two hours. But in case you love watching intense, focused and shattering depiction of such tragic life threatening events in films, then do not miss CAPTAIN PHILLIPS especially in the theaters, since it is indeed one of the most authentic & moving portrayals of a real life event on the screen without any doubt.",8,0,1,9 November 2013
Airlift," Akshay's films might not be reaching the infamous 100 crore status, but the man is rightly choosing his subjects becoming the new-age Bharat Kumar for the present generation.
","Based on the genuinely lesser-known heroes of the past, AIRLIFT is a completely focused and a sincere effort by director Raja Krishna Menon enlightening the viewers about the time of first Gulf War, when around 1,70,000 Indians left stranded in Kuwait were safely rescued by the efforts made by a few local businessmen of Indian origin, a few government employees and diplomats here in India going out of their way compromising with the set protocol.The rare and unbelievable kind of incident deserved to be adapted on the silver screen as a must and team AIRLIFT does the given important task pretty well with only a few preventable minuses revealed in the later part of the review, mentioning the merits first.The film begins with a non-Hindi sequence giving you a feel of where the story is actually based and then the lead character of Akshay gets revealed as a cunning, money-minded businessman with a song 'Dil Cheez Tujhe De Di', reminding you of Khaled's hit track of the early '90s titled DIDI. However, the relief moments get over soon within the opening 10 minutes and the narration straight away comes to its basic shocking plot without wasting any more time as required.The director, along with his cinematographer (Priya Seth), brilliantly recreates the absurd, life-threatening and hell of a scary scenario on the streets very intelligently (with fine detailing), without going into any hugely grand scale (try to catch the sight of all wrecked shops at the back with boards like of CASIO). As a result one truly feels the fear watching military tanks moving around the houses, heavy guns in the hands of young soldiers and people being shot dead on just hearing a word said in Arabic.Personally speaking, the well-shot and conceived transformation of life within seconds – without caring about any kind of richness one might have achieved – reminded me of a similar sequence in Yash Chopra's WAQT where the life-changing twist is a result of devastating earthquake and not any foreign attack. The story progression remains convincing and majorly gripping till intermission despite some unrequired songs and the film keeps heading towards an expectedly uplifting climax arousing patriotic feeling among the audience that honestly could have been much more energetic and exciting giving the event a thrilling edge.Apart from the fact that AIRLIFT largely works due to its rare, unheard-of historical event and its (said to be) authentic portrayal, the other truth remains that the film completely relies on the strong shoulders of Akshay alone and the actor underplays the heroic act well without falling back to the usual Bollywood heroism. Akshay's first-rate performance gets decently supported by Nimrat Kaur, who could have done much better underplaying it too, because at times it does make you feel awkward watching her calmly living in her big house overlooking the gravely dangerous situation in the country they are living in. The supporting cast has some effective portrayals from Purab Kohli, Kumud Mishra, Feryna Wazheir and above all Prakash Belawadi who successfully annoys the viewers too along with Akshay and others on screen.Coming to the hiccups in AIRLIFT, which unfortunately don't let you rate the film as any classic exemplary attempt making a major breakthrough, firstly it's the usual inclusion of love songs (with another inspired one from a Punjabi hit number 'Soch') coming at a time when there is tension written all over the screen with people dying. Admittedly post the first acceptable party track, the moment a melody begins, you feel like why they are adding songs in such a finely progressing movie based on a serious subject? The second drawback in the film for me was the casting of Inaamulhaq as the Iraqi general speaking with a funny accent. No doubt Inaamulhaq is a fine actor who tried his best to deliver the expected result in the assigned job. But as I felt, another terrifying face in that particular role could have resulted in much more scary impact in those important sequences with Akshay avoiding all the unintentional comic touches. As the third and most important hiccup of the film, its climax lacked that expected exaggeration or cinematic tension that should have been there depicting probably the biggest civil evacuation in the world history. The detailing was completely missing as it actually had more than 450 planes airlifting the 1,70,000 people from the region, that took around one to two months as reported. Besides, the emphasis entirely remains on talks and requests made on humanitarian ground, without any kind of exciting cinematic moments bringing the viewer on to the edge of his seat as seen in similar attempts in the west like in ARGO.Talking about the political involvement and will showcased in the film as per the real life happenings, AIRLIFT actually doesn't make you feel proud for the government or political leaders of those times not taking any instant timely action as desired. On the contrary, it makes you feel proud for those few government employees and concerned officials who in reality made it possible through their personal efforts fighting against all the usual political drama and time-lags.So keeping in mind the shortcomings, do watch AIRLIFT as a good film inspiring us all to be together as INDIANS irrespective of any caste, colour or region. But don't expect anything as exciting and effective as ARGO, HOTEL RWANDA or SCHINDLER's LIST.",7,0,0,2 August 2016
Gravity," An incredible space journey without wearing the special suits and oxygen cylinders.
","More than a decade before when I first saw Ron Howard's APOLLO 13 (1995) and then Stanley Kubrick's epic masterpiece 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), it simply made me awestruck witnessing the unbelievable kind of execution by its immensely talented makers. Besides I truly regretted the fact that I couldn't see such great films on the big wide screen with an outstanding sound system playing its enjoyable musical silence, providing that out of the world experience to the viewers. Moreover the films also gave me the thoughts, that what if the astronauts have to repair their space shuttles by themselves by moving out manually in the unknown black vacuum and what if they need to ask help from any other country's space shuttle standing at a distance, in a state of crisis and then have to reach it somehow covering the blind gap.Thankfully GRAVITY is here with all the possible answers to my thoughts and the regret of not seeing any such space adventure in the theaters is now taken care of in an outstanding manner. In simple words, if you ever wished to feel the space and its deep silence like the trained professional astronauts, then here is your chance to live those otherwise unachievable moments in the theater, at the cost of only 300 bucks and that too without wearing the heavy space suits and oxygen helmets. The film takes you into that black soundless region like never before and then makes you feel the excitement, tension, loneliness, pain and discomfort of being in the space all alone with just the mechanical gadgets and machines. Capable of transforming you into a different world (space) altogether, GRAVITY is unarguably one of the best space adventure movies made till date, which actually makes you wonder that was that beautiful, absorbing ambiance all digitally created or they really shot those sequences by going into the genuine scary space in a shuttle? Further opening with a ground breaking long shot introducing the theme right away, GRAVITY not only keeps you absorbed with its breathtaking execution but also keeps you guessing through an engaging, original script written around a rare space disaster.Though for many viewers it might have less dosages of entertainment as expected but as a matter of fact, GRAVITY rises much above than any recent spectacular gem such as AVATAR or LIFE OF PI, because it is not really talking about anything fictional or deliberately created by the makers in order to provide a mesmerizing, magical treat to their viewers. It actually talks about the real existing space and the sudden, unexpected catastrophe which possibly can happen with the people up there in the space shuttles, anytime, any moment. Secondly the film gives you an entirely different and much superior experience as a 3D film (comparatively) since the technology is used quite wonderfully here, matching its subtle yet electrifying subject matter, moving ahead than any other 3D film to be precise. Talking about this personally, I have never seen a 3D movie by not taking off the glasses several times in those two hours to get some relief. But here in GRAVITY, I never thought of taking them off even once, other than the intermission and was constantly watching it with the glasses on for the first time ever.Thoughtfully & skillfully directed by Alfonso Cuaron, GRAVITY is a film which gets perfect contribution from every single creative person involved in its making, superbly led by the Sound, Cinematography and CGI departments in particular. Though its silent moments speak for themselves in those tense sequences, but the timely inclusion of many enjoyable dialogues and the well composed musical notes enhance the overall impact of the venture to many folds. Brilliantly performed by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the actors successfully make a solid impact on the viewers, even when you don't see their faces properly in a substantial part of the film till the end. Particularly this is Sandra's another absolutely stunning performance of her career and she reportedly spent six months of physical training, preparing for this role to play it in an authentic manner.Interestingly apart from GRAVITY's technical, artistic and creative attainment, the film has a proud Indian link too wherein you get to hear one of the astronaut singing 'Mera Joota Hai Japani' and then we have a duly acknowledged contribution in its soundtrack made by Delhi's own famous music producer, Gaurav Dayal.Last but not the least, I would like to write about GRAVITY's less discussed, rare spiritual or meditative feature, which truly gives you an enlightening taste of that supreme invisible power, hidden within this huge, complex but smoothly working universe and its unexplained phenomenon. The film takes you into those never ending, silent, infinite black spaces of the universe, which simply make you realize that how tiny, ineffective and momentary is our very existence on this planet Earth. The Earth, which itself is a very miniscule part of such an enormous universe and its numerous elements.In fact, this humble thought is very well defined in the last scene of the film itself, when Sandra somehow manages to reach back planet Earth safely, landing into the sea after a miraculous escape. And the moment she again touches the solid surface of mother Earth..there are only two words on her lips with eyes looking into the sky.. and those two words are.THANK YOU.GRAVITY ends on this very note giving us a fabulous thought to take back home, indicating that the human race is only capable of saying just these two words in gratitude towards the beautiful existence. And there is simply no other way we can repay back for such precious gifts showered upon ourselves by that Supreme Power since ages.",10,3,5,20 October 2013
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Though you may not find it as energetic as projected but that is how real cinema can revive in Hindi Film Industry.
","One of the most important responsibilities of cinema in a country is to bring forward few well researched and worth watching movies not only on its History, but also on its forgotten national heroes such as S. Milkha Singh, fondly known as 'The Flying Sikh'. And with BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, his writer Prasoon Joshi and their entire team has duly fulfilled their said responsibility competently. Talking about the film itself, yes it rightly introduces the younger generation to a man who had the guts of steel, conviction of an achiever and the spirit to do the hard work beyond imagination. It perfectly portrays a few selected chapters (till his last race) of the tough life lived by S. Milkha Singh taking many cinematic liberties of its own and remains a worth experiencing film for more than one reason, unarguably. But at the same time BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG again showcases the similar mistakes made by the thoughtful director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra in his earlier films namely AKS (2001) and DELHI-6 released in 2009 like insertion of few over dramatized sequences, unnecessarily giving artistic touches to the horrifying days of independence, a less engaging second half full of predictability and few avoidable dull moments resulting in an over-lengthy film going beyond 3 hours. Here I am keeping RANG DE BASANTI (2006) out of the list as I do assume that the film surely had another thinking mind working behind the curtain, who was none other than Aamir Khan.Nevertheless, beginning with its plus points first, BMB does remain a worth watching realistic saga for all, mainly due to its three strong merits mentioned below.1. Firstly it needs to be applauded for the unbelievable kind of effort put in by writer-actor-singer and director Farhan Akhtar playing the lead role. The hard working creator not only looks exactly like the real Flying Sikh but he also plays his part with an utmost sincerity and conviction which is mostly missing in the present big names of the Industry. If truth be told, you don't witness such kind of willingness to perform your given role with such perfection in our Hindi Cinema more often.2. As the second merit it has a commendable performance from a young Jabtej Singh, portraying the childhood days of S. Milkha Singh superbly. The boy is not only a perfect choice for the role but he also comes up with a performance which can equally stand tall along with the one presented by Farhan. 3. Thirdly the film truly deserves to be seen for two small cameos of the immensely talented Divya Dutta & one of the most underrated actors of Hindi films, Pawan Malhotra. Both the veterans bring back the emotional tears in their respective scenes and make you feel the hidden pain in the life story of S. Milkha Singh more than any other actor in the entire film. Personally I too had moist eyes hearing the way, Divya calmly says, 'Milkhu' in a scene where she meets him after a long time. In the supporting cast, Prakash Raj surprises you in a short positive appearance and thankfully Yograj Singh comes up with a quite controlled act as the national coach. In the female lead, Sonam impresses in a guest role and both Meesha (from Pakistan) and Rebecca Breeds (from Australia) are just fine. K.K. Raina delivers an OK act but DalipTahil is not able to make any kind of impact playing Pandit Nehru.As a cinematic documentation of S. Milkha Singh's world famous career, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG does ample justification to all the suffering, struggle and triumph lived by the Flying Sikh to a large extent. The cinematography is of international standard, enhancing the overall result to many folds using the graphics in its various sequences magnificently. Yet the director forcibly uses his own artistic touches in the 1947 killing sequences which could have been avoided as I strongly felt. The early part of the film reminds you of PAAN SINGH TOMAR but then you get to see a well directed and majestically acted first half which impresses you a lot being a realistic bio-pic and a visual treat, also providing the much needed entertainment factor constantly. Post intermission the pace drops considerably and everything starts heading towards a predictable race event taking too long with many overstretched sequences. The girls coming one after another become annoying after a while. And then it all comes down to the most awaited moment of the race where I really missed some energetic background music and the excitement which could bring me on to the edge of my seat as expected.Hence, its actually not a Sports movie but a realistic and emotionally moving bio-pic which goes over-length towards the end, unfortunately. The film does move you a lot in its various brilliant sequences, but with a better edit and more exhilarating background score it could have reached that much desired cult status for sure. The musical score by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy serves the purpose well as you are watching it and the songs are also intelligently used taking the narration forward (But I really couldn't appreciate its title song with such a weak composition).On the whole, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG may not be as energetic as projected in its promotional campaign. It misses the fire and it misses the excitement. Yet it does remain a worth watching film and a significant step in Hindi Film Industry, showing them a way that we do need to make films on our historical figures and national heroes at regular intervals, along with catering to the commercial aspects of the business like BMB.So do watch it in the theaters with all the young ones in your family, especially for Farhan, Divya and Jabtej respectfully saluting our national hero, The Flying Sikh, Sardar Milkha Singh.",7,0,0,23 July 2013
Life of Pi," It's a worth watching fabulous visual experience for sure but not an emotionally or spiritually moving fantasy.
","Widely publicized as a spectacular, visionary project with a spiritual touch, Life Of Pi was eagerly awaited by both the appreciators of meaningful cinema and the lovers of realistic 3D technique together. Also promoted as the most astonishing visual achievement after Avatar, the makers were successful in putting many innovative ideas in the mind of the enthusiastic viewers waiting to be shocked and amazed by some unbelievable kind of content as shown in its promos.However, the film makes a mixed kind of impact as it ends wherein the creative team perfectly fulfills the main aspect of their promises made regarding the superior technicality of the product. But at the same time the film is not able to cater the spiritual or emotional aspect of its storyline that impressively. Adapted from Yann Martel's novel, its unarguably a superb visual experience without any doubt. The execution of its unimaginable plot and sequences through a fresh colourful palette on the screen surely transports the viewer into a different fantasy world in its two hours of duration as a novel experience. So if you are willing to see an eye catching extravaganza supported by some outstanding hard to believe computer graphics, then you would love watching Life Of Pi a lot.But in case you are expecting an emotionally moving spiritual experience talking about a rare journey in the sea lived by a young boy and a tiger together then you may find it a lot less appealing than promised. Enacted well by Suraj, Irrfan Khan (ignoring his accent), Tabu and Adil Hussain, along with a graphically created incredible Bengal Tiger it's a difficult film directed by Ang Lee and remains a stunning treat for your eyes throughout as far as its cinematography, under-water takes, frames, sound, treatment and execution is concerned.Yet Life Of Pi cannot be rated as a movie with a highly emotional quotient giving you some enlightening insights of a divine existence around us through its fictional characters. The few initial moments of the film devoted to the discovery of various religions by Pi fall flat without any clear vision and the same can be said about the questions raised on the subject of Life, Death and Faith in its various tense moments. To conclude Life Of Pi is surely a life time achievement by director Ang Lee if one only considers its unique, never before kind of visual impact alone. But honestly I couldn't feel any human heartfelt touch in it and couldn't applaud it whole heartedly as I was willing to.",7,1,4,22 December 2012
American Hustle," Its good but not as per the expectations raised by the wide appreciation.
","Based on one of my favourite subjects on conmen & heists, probably I was expecting a lot from this widely appreciated film, nominated in many major categories of 2014 Academy Awards or maybe I am the only one having a different opinion about the film as it seems. Anyway in honest words, I found American HUSTLE to be just a good film with a lot of noticeable merits but not a great path breaking or exceptional movie to be applauded that loudly.Mentioning it worthy points first, the film has been shot well and written beautifully, especially focusing on the witty dialogues which in fact become the major highlight of the film throughout. Actually it's a thriller which focuses more on its characters, their mannerisms, their spoken words or their way of living life on their own terms and less on any major events or happenings as such. So if you are looking for any great con sequence in particular (as it is always there in such films) then you are not going to find the same in an exact from, but there surely are many enjoyable, worth watching, and commendable performances working as its major triumph card arguably.The largely convincing acts are led by Christian Bale, who has amazingly got into that shape to play the given character brilliantly and then there is Amy Adams sensually playing his con partner with all her sexy, glamorous looks and elegant dresses having long, open cleavages. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific as Christian's nagging wife and Bradley Cooper is great as the confused FBI agent along with the veteran Robert De Niro, who weaves magic in his only one scene in the second hour. Reportedly based on the real life Abscam scandal of late 1970s, it's about a secret FBI operation to investigate illegal transactions of money involving many politicians, wherein the FBI agent takes help from few con-artists. Director David O Russell uses that familiar kind of backdrop to make an engaging film which is surely great as far as performances and their mutual conversations are concerned. But it frankly cannot be rated as a thoroughly entertaining or a fast paced, thrilling con drama to be precise.At around 140 minutes, the film turns out to be a bit lengthy and gains its real momentum like an exciting, crime drama in only the last 30-40 minutes of its script. So before that one can only enjoy the film if he focuses more on the characters and their amusing interactions without expecting any great engaging sequence involving the con team. In other words, I found it to be a film where perhaps the ensemble cast and the director was having a more enjoyable time than the viewers. And that should easily give you a hint about the experience I had watching it in the theater. However in case you are the one more interested in enjoying the performances alone then you can sure opt for this over-appreciated movie for just once.",7,1,3,31 January 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Not an epic, but does deliver the expected excellence from the fifth presentation of the series in parts.
","On a Friday with more than 3 new releases, I luckily watched the film in its dubbed Hindi version and was surprised to see the theater occupancy more than 3 times from that of the new Hindi film released on the same day. But what gave me a much bigger (pleasant) shock was the fact that it was a single screen theater DELITE, situated close to Darya Ganj area of Delhi far away from the multiplex culture. And still there were whistles, shouts and claps as soon as Tom Cruise came on screen with an electrifying action sequence in the first 5 minutes of the film only fulfilling the huge expectations. No doubt, a clear indication of the general public becoming much more aware and interested in watching quality cinema instead of any usual stuff offered by the Hindi films.As a fifth presentation in the series with no linkages as such with the previous parts, MI5-ROUGE NATION makes a brilliant start and then follows an uneven pace before the forced intermission (as per Indian norms) with only a few exciting (but not mind-blowing) sequences coming at gaps. However the film delivers some worth experiencing action and chase sequences in its second half, especially the bike chase bringing you on to the edge of your seats through an excellent execution. No doubt director Christopher McQuarrie successfully maintains the basic essence of the 'brand name' throughout its two hours of duration. Yet the film doesn't give you any of those nail-biting moments where you don't really know what is going to happen next in terms of any suspense or mystery involved. In short, it's the fast paced script- developments in the second hour that largely save the film making a decent impression despite being too convenient and not so innovative in the heist sequences.As the lead, Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, the IMG (Impossible Missions Force) agent superbly deserving applause and it's his film all the way right from the first scene to the last. Sean Harris makes an impact with a flat face head of 'The Syndicate' and so does Rebecca Ferguson who simply looks great in her fiery sequences. Simon Pegg keeps providing the lighter moments that work and Ving Rhames, Jeremy Renner, Alec Baldwin are just fine in their valuable supporting acts. The background score and cinematography certainly contributes a lot in its key sequences. Plus the witty one-liners and characterization has been worked upon well too.In all, MI5 - Rogue Nation is not an epic but still manages to provide that expected thrilling experience in parts. So you can surely watch it once as one of the better sequels of the series, especially for the motorbike chase, Rebecca and Tom Cruise in particular.",6,1,3,2 August 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A delightful extravaganza with an engaging plot.
","The latest offering from director Wes Anderson, who is known for his own style of presenting a magical make-believe world on the screen, this is a fine example of an imaginative art of storytelling taking you into a different world of the past quite impressively. Narrating the story of a vintage hotel, the film has glimpses of more than one genres including illegitimate affairs, crime, love, murder, theft, jail-break, mystery, chases and much more. But in spite of that it never puzzles you due to an absorbing treatment of an interesting concept and some brilliant performances by a rare cast ensemble with many reputed names.Set in different time zones of the twentieth century, it is mostly narrated in flashback and tells us about the life a young 'Lobby boy' and his experiences with his boss,Mosieur Gustave. The lobby boy known as Zero is now the owner of The Grand Budapest and the film is all about his journey from joining the hotel to the present status of a sad, lonely man owning the mansion and much more. In the story told of the past, as one of richest regular visitors of the hotel suddenly dies, she leaves a precious antique painting for Gustave to be her parting gift in the will and that's from where the whole saga of crime and deceit begins involving the young Zero.The film unfolds like an exciting fast paced tale in a bedtime storybook of the young ones and presents many charming cameos of prominent names such as Jude Law, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Saoirse Ronan, Edward Norton, Tom Wilkinson, Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe and more. Along with the lead roles played by Ralph Fiennes & F Murray Abraham with a splendid portrayal of the young zero by Willem Dafoe.A kind of wacky comedy, it also subtly showcases the war scenario of those times & three different eras of century through some smartly written witty dialogues, an excellent background score, well detailed art direction and a worth experiencing cinematography (particularly the snow chase sequence at the mountains) which preferably needs to be seen at the big screen. The storyline also has a refreshing emotional angle between its leading male characters and then has a few surprising insertions too like a turbaned Sikh participating in a sequence happening in the Eastern Europe region of the 1930s.But at the same time, THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL doesn't offer any great energetic crescendo and is also not for the ones watching Hollywood Cinema mainly for their mainstream well promoted films releasing worldwide. This is for the niche audiences who are more into the offbeat movies and can easily relate to this eccentric kind of story-telling not interested in giving any kind of simulated high through an overdose of computer graphics or some loud treatment. So if you love watching this specific genre then you are sure going to enjoy The GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL largely.",7,0,2,3 September 2014
2012," Visually Stunning but scores low on content.
","When you are going to see a movie which has already impressed you with its outstanding trailer, then it's obvious to expect something great and out of the ordinary. That was the state I was in while entering the theater to watch 2012. Excitingly waiting for the movie to start, I had many questions in mind about how the director will tackle the various ongoing problems of the world while showcasing the Ultimate End of our civilization? And majorly what will be his take on the famous religions of the world when the characters will be talking about their Final Moments? And to my surprise the movie took off from our part of the world in 1999, where an Indian Geologist religiously named Dr. Satnam, discovers that the Earth is heating up to an extent that is causing a shift in its tectonic plates. He passes on the news of this deadly discovery to his American friend Dr. Adria, who straight away takes it to the White House as an emergency situation. Coming back to the future in 2012, the movie plunges into the amazing graphical world where the earth is sinking due to the high density earthquakes and all the historical monuments are falling left and right like lifeless toys.Visually it's a fabulous portrayal of the End of the World from the director 'Roland Emmerich' who is known for his mesmerizing work in his earlier movies such as 'Independence Day', 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'Godzilla'. The moment you witness the first shattering sequence of the earth making a huge wide gap and everything falling into it, you get transported into a gripping enigmatic world altogether. The spectacular special effects unfolding every 15 minutes in the movie, just keep you glued to the screen with your jaws wide open. The disastrous happenings worldwide, the enormous water tides coming over, the burning volcanic eruptions and ugly tsunamis spreading over the world map just bring on the viewer to the edge of his seat.Hence, if you are in for some great Computer Graphics and want to see a few terrific nail biting scenes where the heroes are just climbing up before the earth sinks in, then this is the perfect choice to spend your valuable time.But if you are expecting a great movie, rich on emotional and futuristic content as suggested by the impressive body of work by its director, then you may remain quite unsatisfied at the end. In simple words, 2012, undoubtedly scores high on technical and graphical terms but content wise it falls short of the earlier disaster movies from the director. It lacks the emotional depth in its characterization due to which the viewer is not able to relate with any of the characters fighting with the unwanted situation. In order to cover more number of people on the screen, the script fails to develop any one character in particular, which as a result leaves a very cold kind of impact on the viewer. The movie also tends to become a bit slow at times but bounces back with every new destruction sequence on the screen.The entire cast delivers fine performances as required by the subject, but they are also handicapped by the poor characterization in the script. John Cusack is pleasant to see but has nothing great written for him in particular. Amanda Peet is just there to give her constant looks of amazement. Danny Glover as the president, Thandie Newton as his daughter, Oliver Platt as the president's chief of staff and Jimi Mistry as Dr. Satnam simply play their parts as directed. Only Chiwetel Ejiofor looks like more concerned about the humanity factor in the movie and makes an impact.2012 also tends to be repetitive in few sequences which strongly give you a feeling of 'seen before'. The movie even reminded me one of the early 80's disaster movies called 'Earthquake'. In fact this time, Emmerich also seems to be inspired by his own masterpieces from the past. He surely surpasses them all in terms of mass destruction of the globe, but talking about the rich emotional quotient of those Hit movies, 2012 comparatively scores quite low. Emmerich, intentionally skips many important questions related to various countries and religions practiced by different people residing all over the globe.The main drawback of the movie is that even though it revolves around the concept of end of the world and its civilization, still it is unable to frighten you with the scary thought. The movie keeps on impressing you with its exceptional execution constantly but at the same time, fails to take you in on emotional grounds. In a nutshell, it's a film very rich in the Cinematography and Computer Graphics department, but is also quite unimpressive in its content.Interestingly the movie ends with a clear message to the World and its entire population. It simply says that 'Now is the time that we all have to unite together at the earliest or else the nature will unite us deliberately in its own destructive way.'",7,10,17,16 November 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A just OK sequel displaying its technical excellence, with far less entertaining content as compared to the earlier versions.
","One of the most loved superheroes (especially in the kids) comes with probably its weakest film till date with quite less entertaining elements as compared to its earlier versions. No doubt the sequel yet again displays an amazing technical excellence in all its actions sequences along with a spellbinding cinematography. But with a confusing opposition featuring two weak villains not able to justify their immense power and hatred, the conflict falls flat without making any solid impact on the viewer. And one seriously misses the expected depth and logical character developments in the script of one of the most awaited movies of the year, undoubtedly. For instance it has a highly absurd case of the 'villain by accident' (Jamie Fox), who has no visible reasoning of becoming so wicked with such evil intentions after getting electrocuted, all of a sudden.Stressing too hard on the computer graphics, the director doesn't give much emphasis on the entertaining factor in the film and tries to cover up playing with the romance and an emotional twist in the end showcasing an unexpected tragedy. Now though the romance factor doesn't tease you much but still I honestly felt that is it necessary that a superhero always has to be involved romantically with a lady essentially.In short, as a 3D film with great action sequences (surpassing the past ones), average performances and a pleasant emotional touch, many would not mind watching it once in all possibilities. But frankly speaking, for me it was really not worth the wait at all, with even the Spiderman looking as if he was on a diet plan.",6,0,3,2 June 2014
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," An OK feel good movie but entertaining only in parts.
","A Shahrukh movie along with Aditya Chopra having a unique look had great expectations. And fans all over were just ready to fall in love with the movie in any case. But the final outcome may not be upto the standards expected. In a short review RNBDJ is an OK sweet movie having good performances by the lead pair, has all predictable content, a bit lengthy and entertains only in few parts. No doubt Shahrukh's fan following is capable of making it a Hit, but the movie leaves the viewer somehow less satisfied.The best part of the movie is the starting 20 minutes where all the characters are being introduced impressively and you easily start liking the narration. Using the Punjabi feel, the current favorite of Bollywood, Aditya captures The Golden Temple beautifully and sets the mood showing the streets of Punjab. Everything is fine till the main plot of a dance competition is disclosed. From there onwards the movie starts entertaining in gaps. The plot moves around how a Husband (Shahrukh) tries to win his wife's (Anushka) love by playing a double role of a shy husband at home and of a happening and chill out dance partner in a dance competition.After the transformation of Shahrukh as a fun loving dance partner, the movie is completely open to the viewers as if they have already read the script. Every sequence from then onwards is all predictable and you also know how the movie is going to end too. Still as a loyal fan you keep waiting for more entertaining sequences but they are not too many to come. The movie never surpasses the mood set in first 20 minutes, so you start feeling lazy at times too. Whole movie relies on the two main lead characters and they both carry their part with perfection. But as the storyline has no exciting twists and turns to offer so it remains a sweet movie, nothing extraordinary, far below the expectations.Among the merits of the movie are the top rate performances of Shahrukh and Anushka. Shahrukh plays the role realistically without falling in the trap of over-reacting. He surely deserves appreciation for the simplicity he adds to the role of a common man and his visible support to the newcomer. Anushka surprises with such a professional debut very close to just perfect. Her dialogue delivery and confidence doesn't reveal that it is her first movie. She may not have the looks to kill but has got the talent to sustain. Vinay Pathak is purely lovable in his act and provides a good support to Shahrukh. These are the only three characters around which the movie revolves and that works as a drawback to the movie because you miss some more catchy characters in the plot. Apart from good performances there is nothing extra special about the movie to write on. It really does not look like a Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra movie.Among the weak points, first comes the thin and all predictable storyline. The moment viewer comes to know the plot he starts losing interest in it. Secondly the comic sequences in the movie, like the motorcycle run by Anushka, Gol-Gappa eating scene, both watching films in the theater and Shahrukh's fight with Sumo wrestler are not convincing or entertaining at all. There are not many great moments to share in the direction. Thirdly the whole dance completion thing is played too simply and in minute details. There are no major judges to the completion and there are no major competitors to watch too. There are no lavish dance performances in the competition and Shahukh-Anushka pair simply wins the contest as they were the only couple competing there. Their final performance at the stage is completely uninteresting and unimpressive. The whole dancing couple contest and Stage sets were not as expected from an Aditya  Yash Chopra movie. The glossy and stylish look of a Yash Chopra movie is totally missing. In fact it seems to be a film from a not so established production house. Fourthly, the length of the movie pinches you at times and you feel some scenes to get over fast giving way to more good ones. And lastly there is a major flaw in the direction. If a garage owner (Manmeet Singh - from whom Shahrukh buys his new car), can recognize Shahrukh in his new avatar, then how his own wife is not able to recognize him.Musically, the movie is weak too with only one song to remember that is 'Haule Haule'. Interestingly this only good song is also an inspired version of a Adnan Sami number. The other added attraction is a song featuring Kajol, Lara Dutta, Rani Mukherjee, Priety Zinta and more. But this song is not able to impress too as it was not even one tenth entertaining as the song in 'Om Shanti Om'. Songs have been a merit of all Shahrukh-Yash Raj movies, but this one stands far out of that impressive list.In few words, Rab Ne Ban Di Jodi, fulfills the expectations only to some extent. Everyone was expecting an entertaining movie with sequences of laughter, fun, youthfulness and excitement. But there are very few such moments in the movie. Aditya is not able to create the same magic as he did in DDLJ. It's not a bad movie, but it is not a highly entertaining movie too. You will surely feel restless at few places and also bound to hear some noises in the cinema hall.In the end, I would like to mention that after the first 20-25 minutes of the movie, the most entertaining part of RNBDJ is the Voice Over of Shahrukh along with the end credit rolls sharing the experiences of their successful Honeymoon in Japan. A Well executed ending makes you feel good while you leave the theater.",5,13,29,12 December 2008
Jurassic World," Its predictable following a set formula, yet well-made and engaging in its second hour providing the expected excitement.
","To tone down the expectations level first, it's admittedly impossible to relive those startling moments, excitement and thrill of witnessing the giant dinosaurs on the silver screen for the first time ever (two decades back) with Steven Spielberg's out of the world vision of Jurassic Park amazing the entire world. So moving ahead of any such comparisons, the world of dinosaurs is back after almost a decade of its last sequel, especially inviting the young viewers eager to witness the phenomenon in theatres (in 3D) for the very first time after having seen all its earlier parts on the smaller screen through their home video discs. Having said that, this fourth instalment of the series thankfully holds some novel surprises for the not so young viewers too featuring one of our own talented actors Irrfan Khan in a significant and much bigger role as the owner of the beautiful amusement park.In short, realising the pressure to deliver the content conceived in the time of much better CGI and VFX as compared to the last three parts, JURASSIC WORLD doesn't disappoint and comes up as a fairly entertaining joyride with many fresh attractions in its kitty to excite one and all.Co-written and directed by Colin Trevorrow, this time we have a much bigger and stunning theme park with the main attraction of a new genetically modified, extra ordinarily intelligent hybrid dinosaur called Indominus Rex. The killing machine gets introduced with a fine build-up along with the four terrifying raptors tamed by their brave trainer. And then we have a gigantic water beast too brought in with a terrific public show sequence providing the much expected thrills.Following a set pattern that's predictable right from the word go, the first half of the film is a visual delight establishing the new characters of two young brothers, their aunt who is the manager of the park, their ultimate savior and the owner trying to show the world some unbelievable creations of his hired scientists. Not much happens in terms of action in this first hour taking you on to the tour of this much advanced park and the tension actually begins when the dangerous Rex manages to escape from its specified secured area to kill every living being found in its way ahead.As expected its the second half that has the entire action, thrills and fights between the man and the animal also showcasing hundreds of flying creatures attacking, terrorizing and killing the visitors of the park unlike any other sequel in the past. And that indeed turns the film into a much more bloody and brutal sequel in comparison. The deadly fight between the Rex and the raptors makes the young viewers cheer and the CGI department just executes it perfectly. However, the forcibly added romance element in the script is just there to generate some lighter moments and it's the sheer predictability of the script that doesn't let you rate it as something really outstanding ending on the same repetitive note as usual.In the performances, Chris Pratt superbly plays the character of Owen with great conviction and Bryce Dallas is fine too in her given role along with the two kids. But its Irrfan Khan who gives you a pleasant surprise in probably the biggest role ever played by an Indian actor in a foreign film with such an elegant ease. Interestingly another life teaching fact about his association with the series is that, the man who once had no money in his pocket to watch the first part of JURASSIC PARK in the 90s, can presently be seen playing the owner of the park in its latest sequel of 2015 after two decades. Personally speaking, this certainly is one of the most amazing play of DESTINY I have ever seen till date.Summing up, Colin Trevorrow's JURASSIC WORLD is surely a must watch for every youngster who hasn't experienced the famous dinosaur show in the big theatre ever before (preferably in 3D). Plus it has enough in store for the grown-ups too with new inventions especially incorporated for this particular section of viewers expecting something fresh. Yet, one would have to keep the comparisons out of the mind to enjoy it in a much better way taking along the kids to this 'wonderful show of dinosaurs' invented by Spielberg, Trevorrow and their exceptionally talented team designing the incredible graphics.",7,1,1,2 August 2016
Everest," Its a visually stunning but not so thrilling adventurous ride, realistically talking about the loss instead of any triumph achieved.
","EVEREST is about a real life tragedy of 1996 when such expeditions were arranged for the interested (wealthy) clients and one of those teams lost its eight unfortunate members while climbing down the hill (post successfully reaching the peak) facing some extreme weather conditions and breathing problems. The film is no doubt a 3D visual treat with a breathtaking cinematography making you feel the fear of heights as if you are right there with them fighting the mountain range, snow, wind and lack of oxygen. But overall it doesn't turn out to be anything highly exciting, roller coaster ride kind of film as per the expectations raised by its impressive trailer.Yes, the fearful camera angles, scary heights, the sudden falls and an excellent use of computer graphics thankfully offer few (much awaited) exciting moments at intervals, particularly in the final hour. But the film mostly drags and is actually a sad and tragic account of a real life struggle between the man and nature, instead of any entertaining and enjoyable adventure.The first hour of EVEREST focuses on its various characters and how they all form a team finding their common commercial guide. The pace remains slow without any great engaging moments, but following a different realistic vision, here we do not have any individual heroic figure leading to some predictable dramatic sequences of a disaster movie. Besides, the action actually begins much later in its concluding hour, when the team gets to face the sudden snow storms and changes in weather conditions while returning from the peak in a joyful mood. However I personally found that huge feeling of victory missing in the sequences when they all reach the top and start clicking their pictures. At times the visuals are simply terrifying, forcing you to think that why the hell they are so desperate to just climb that famous hill? In fact a question that can only be answered or understood by the people who truly share this crazy mutual passion of conquering the highest peak.Putting the best of their individual efforts, the entire cast ensemble in EVEREST comes up with a fine show under the splendid direction of Baltasar Kromakur getting great support from his cinematographers, sound department and graphic artists resulting in many stunning visuals. But the written proceedings do not really generate any heart-stopping, enjoyable tension that is obviously the first thing expected from such adventurous venture.In all, EVEREST is indeed worth watching on the bigger screen alone because of its great visual appeal in 3D. But the film is surely is not the one you were looking for after watching that lively trailer. Also, focusing more on the sad deaths than the proud triumph achieved in its final moments, the film doesn't allow you to move out of the theater in any celebrating mood at all, deeply thinking about many precious lives lost in just an attempt to win over an unconcerned mountain?",6,0,0,2 August 2016
3 Idiots," Hirani and Aamir once again prove as the two most precious assets of Bollywood.
","In few words, '3 Idiots' fulfills every promise it made and entertains the viewer completely with its engrossing and enlightening content based upon some real life happenings. Loosely inspired from Chetan Bhagat's novel, 'Five Point Someone', it starts with a phone call to Madhavan, about their lost friend and then keeps shifting between the present & the past, majorly talking about the days they all spent together in the college.The first half is full of highly enjoyable moments which have a distinctive Hirani flavor and are sure going to be liked by everyone of any age or gender. The pants dropping humor may be a bit weird for some but the youngsters would not mind it at all for a change. The entertaining first half ends on a mystery note, which straight away gets solved post intermission and then the story moves on towards the search of the third lost idiot,Aamir. Though the second half has got some dragging moments in the mid but overall, it makes a good impact on the viewer with a masterstroke used towards the climax having a pleasant surprise twist.Director Rajkumar Hirani brilliantly writes all his scenes along with the talented Abhijat Joshi and the experienced Vidhu Vinod Chopra. The ease with which he showcases serious issues like Suicides by Students, Ragging in Colleges, Faulty Education System based on memorization and the unnecessary competition creating tension is simply commendable. He humbly goes on to remind you that Are you doing the job you always wished for? To be straight, '3 Idiots' is a director's movie completely. Though it has been more publicized and awaited as an Aamir Khan project, but significant contribution coming from every big and small character in '3 Idiots', simply restrains anybody from calling it an Aamir Khan movie alone. Having said that, I would also like to add that with '3 Idiots' Aamir once again proves his unmatchable understanding of the medium and willingness to work better with a team spirit. He consistently delivers another flawless performance of his shining career under the expert direction of Raj Kumar Hirani.After Aamir, the next best act comes from Sharman Joshi who very convincingly portrays a complex character of a student caught in a dilemma. It's unarguably the toughest role and Sharman's the best performance of his career till date. The third idiot, Madhavan equally impresses in the role of an engineering student, wishing to become a wild life photographer from heart. Madhavan, never makes you feel his huge star status in the south and impressively plays his part with a quite conviction. Boman Irani is superb as earlier seen in the similar role a University professor and looks great in his messy get up in the movie.Kareena Kapoor hasn't got a big role in the script, but she still manages to catch your attention through her new look with the glasses. Mona Singh is cool in her few scenes but Javed Jaffery is wasted in a two scene role. The actor playing the studious friend of the 3 Idiots is first rate and Parikshit Sahni thankfully is there with a controlled act. Cinematography is worth mentioning especially in the scenes where the three friends meet at the top of a high rise structure, the beautiful roads in the mountains and the climax scene of Ladakh. Shantanu Moitra's music is not worth buying as an album, but it impresses and leaves a mark after you have watched the movie in the theater.Summing up, there is no doubt that '3 Idiots' is one of the finest movies of 2009 and will be a great success at the box office, but at the same time I would like to share a few points I have in mind about the movie : Firstly, the basic format of the movie remains very close to Hirani's debut venture 'Munnabhai MBBS'. It has many similar (not identical) scenes of college classrooms, lectures and exams (though the subjects are different). The interaction between Boman and Aamir is on the similar lines of Boman and Sanjay Dutt. There is also a Hospital Sequence of Sharman getting paralyzed and Aamir curing him with his miraculous ways (quite identical to Carrom Board Sequence in Munna Bhai). And lastly as there was 'Jaadoo Ki Jhappi' in Munna Bhai and 'Gandhigiri' in 'Lage Raho', similarly here we have a new phrase 'All Izz Well' used in 3 Idiots to woo the audiences. So I somewhere felt the basic framework of the movie written around the same commercial elements used in Munna Bhai.Secondly the pregnancy sequence of Mona Singh, where Aamir has to perform as a doctor on the online guidance of Kareena, was a kind of deliberate, filmy and quite far from reality.And thirdly, I couldn't appreciate the way, Hirani hilariously treated the poor family of Sharman Joshi and the character of his paralyzed father. He mercilessly used the poor character as a comedian and made the audience laugh at his helpless situation which I didn't find very amusing. This particular part was not as per the standards set by Hirani himself through his earlier two masterpieces and was an avoidable patch on an otherwise brilliant and highly entertaining flick from the master craftsman.Incidentally, as seen in his previous blockbusters, the master director continues to give you a glimpse of his western influences by using the animated scene of millions of sperms racing towards becoming a baby, which is highly inspired from Woody Allen's 'Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex'.But despite of the above mentioned points, the talented trio, Rajkumar Hirani, Aamir Khan and Vidhu Vinod Chopra have a sure shot winner in their hands, which will be unanimously liked by all the section of the viewers together.",Null,2,7,26 December 2009
The Wolf of Wall Street," Leonardo's another gem of an act in a Scorsese film made on a man whose life had nothing to talk about other than money, drugs and sex.
","To straight away give you the gist; here is another gem of a performance by Leonardo DiCaprio in the maestro Martin Scorsese's film which unarguably can be included among the best acts of the talented actor's illustrious career. In fact in the last decade, Leonardo remains one of those few big names who have constantly delivered some great performances in his well chosen films, reaching new heights of the art in an exceptional manner. So to be precise, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is undoubtedly a Leonardo DiCaprio movie right from its first frame to the last with surely an Oscar-worthy performance as they say.Based on the real-life stock broker Jordan Belfort's own memoirs, the film talks about a particular time-period of his life, when he got insanely rich in just few years through some clever stock scams and then had so much money around him, that he started calling them 'Fun Coupons'. Having nothing else to do, he just started spending that money lavishly on booze, heavy drugs, big parties, hookers & expensive purchases like a giant yacht, a helicopter, a huge mansion and much more with a group of his chosen friends. Hence in short, this can easily be called an unpleasant yet engaging black comedy about a man who was completely dishonorable yet had a magnetic personality to know, due to his own guts and spirit of taking big risks.Director Martin Scorsese tries to being in a fresh novelty in his treatment which works superbly but is also pretty bold or even obscene in its few scenes. And that is why the Indian version of the release gets few clear cuts made in between its sexual scenes quite brutally. At around 174 minutes, the film is a bit over length and becomes monotonous too since it doesn't have anything new to say after a while. But still you don't lose the interest mainly due to the splendid act of Leonardo and some fabulous supporting acts too like Matthew McConaughey as Belfort's mentor in the opening scene, Jonah Hill playing his first associate as Donny Azoff, Kyle Chandler as the FBI agent and Margot Robbie playing Belfort's stunning trophy wife providing all the sensual moments in the film as required.The eye-catching camera-work gets a great support from the intelligently designed background score & a crisp editing which makes the narration going without any major drop. And that is why Scorsese's latest venture largely comes out as a winner due to its absorbing execution and entertaining performances throughout its three hours.But despite all the merits mentioned above, thinking about the film as a whole, I was really confused as I couldn't really see anything great or worth telling in the life of this immoral person called Jordan Belfort. In other words, as the end credits started rolling, I was finding it hard to find any reason that why on earth they decided to make a film in such a style on this Belfort, who had nothing in his mind all his life except money, drugs and sex like a careless, disgraceful creature.Perhaps Scorsese just wanted to give his viewers 'a high' without taking any pills or powder with just his powerful screen presentation only. So (keeping that in mind) do watch THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, for Leonardo's flawless performance alone but please don't search for any basic purpose or human factor in the film, as there always is in such major biographical ventures.",7,1,3,31 January 2014
Lucy," If only you can watch it for Scarlett alone.
","'Humans only make 10% use of their brain and what if there is a drug which can trigger it to 100% usage in just a few hours?' - That's the basic thought behind this science fiction cum action thriller cum philosophical film incorporating many vague metaphors at times conveying nothing.Revealing its basic plot, LUCY is about a beautiful girl, who unintentionally gets caught in the international mafia trap and is given an unsafe drug which in turn enhances her body function drastically. The drug starts increasing her brain power in an unusual manner and she soon explores some exceptional super-powers much beyond the known capabilities of a normal human being, which in turn help her to break through the mysterious nexus of underworld, drug mafia, police and more. Her brain usage keeps on increasing as the film progresses further and it all ends when she eventually reaches to the maximum level of 100%.Now the short synopsis shared above sure sounds pretty interesting but I wish the film was equally engaging too justifying its novel concept. It has a promising start featuring a betraying friend and the Chinese don but soon starts giving away due to a weak script and too much focus kept on its style and presentation. The film actually doesn't work because of its thin storyline stretched for long and an unconvincing narration, despite having some excellent production values and superb graphics.With an otherwise fine performance by Scarlett Johansson, who later fails to leave an impact due to the ineffective culmination of a great plot, LUCY also wastes Morgan Freeman as the professor/researcher working on the brain concept. The film doesn't explode later as per the expectations raised in the first ten minutes and hence can easily be rated as a flat science fiction which keeps on giving some forced philosophical lessons at regular intervals in vain. In fact LIMITLESS (2011) made on a similar concept was a far better entertainer comparatively.In short, LUCY's brain might have reached its 100% in the script, but the film couldn't even reach 50% in terms of satisfaction offered, honestly. So you can opt for it only in case you don't mind watching Scarlett alone for those 90 minutes.",4,1,8,3 September 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," It reminds you of the simple, enjoyable spirit of the original 3 part series as a tribute, without any new or path breaking surprises.
","Taking you back in time, the original trilogy of this probably the most popular science fiction series till date began with Star Wars or Episode IV – A New Hope in 1977, followed by Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI - Return of The Jedi released in 1983. A prequel trilogy to these original three films was released later as Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II - The Attack Of The Clones (2002) and Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith (2005). Here though the response to the first (award winning) three parts remained more than the later ones, still the series went on to become the most successful film merchandise franchise with books, television serials, video games, comics, toys and more entertaining the enormous fan following in the last four decades. Coming to the latest part released i.e. the VII Episode titled The Force Awakens, the film is surely able to deliver the expected content to some extent. But before writing about it in details, let me give you a fair idea about the viewership of this particular much talked about movie, broadly dividing them into three major sections. The first section includes the ones who have fondly seen all the six parts released till date and are die-hard fans of the series eagerly waiting for its VII episode. Second section includes the enthusiastic viewers who have just got introduced to the series and have recently watched the first three or may be the later parts too only a few weeks or days before, only to get the right feeling or mood of the over-famous series and its actual storyline. And the third section is of the viewers who haven't watched any film of the series till now but are still excited to see its latest episode released out of curiosity.Now honestly where Episode VII would largely entertain the first section of viewers on the whole, it will subtly impress the second and would least appeal to the third who have no familiar characters to cheer for as they appear on the screen again after a long gap.In other words, this is a film especially made for the huge cult- following of the series and they are more or less going to enjoy it feeling the good old nostalgia of the gone times. The episode clearly reveals its huge love towards the first trilogy beginning in the 70s with the world created by writer-director George Lucas. And one cherishes seeing the same white masked men, black deadly villain with a heavy voice, the young fighter Jedi, gigantic space ships, emotional link-ups between the characters, the adorable droids and Chewy presenting a simple & predictable adventure similar to reading those entertaining science fiction comic books in the teenage years. The cast enacts their given roles with the much required energy (giving ample space to the female lead too) and the CGI department along with the energetic background score gives you a good time offering a fast paced action show in the space shot with a bigger vision. In short, the director JJ Abrams actually plays it pretty safe here, riding high on the original feel of the series beginning with the same yellow scrolling credits explaining the new adventure. But with no big surprises in store, it does leave you a bit less satisfied in the end as a long time fan since decades. Still, offering the same kind of energy and pull as there in the first trilogy, the latest VIIth Episode overall delivers it fine (if not great), which positively might inspire many first timers to go for the complete series beginning from 1977.",6,2,16,2 August 2016
Happy New Year," Shahrukh certainly deserves much better projects, directors & concepts matching his current status & simply doesn't need to do such poor, repetitive films.
","Unfortunately HAPPY NEW YEAR fails to deliver even a fairly engaging time and remains amongst the weakest film of the actor as well as the director post their entertaining OM SHANTI OM. To give you a fair idea, Shahrukh's CHENNAI EXPRESS still had much more enjoyable moments than HNY featuring a confident charmer Deepika Padukone with her fresh south Indian accent. But sadly, even Deepika is unable to save this pretty long, completely predictable and uninteresting film with her tapori mannerisms.Clearing the speculations being made around its inspired status, HNY has nothing to do with the films with the same title i.e. HAPPY NEW YEAR (1987 - English), HAPPY NEW YEAR aka LA BONNE ANNE'E (1973 - French) or the Spanish heist film LADR'ON QUE ROBA A LADR'ON having few similar characters. In fact this is a poor mix and match of our own several Hindi films since the main revenge plot straight away reminds you of DHOOM 3 and many dialogues make you remember the previous films by the team quite clearly.Beginning with all grand looks of the Dubai hotel, the makers keep stressing on the BODY structure right from the first few minutes itself and then go on giving the introductions for a good long 45 minutes. Looking for something fresh, one desperately starts expecting Deepika to come in fast to offer the much needed relief but such is the (all clichéd) below average script progression of the film that even her decent performance is unable to become the saving grace. The comedy barely works in only a few scenes and the dance competition before the intermission exactly looks like watching any mediocre movie unexpectedly.The long and lazy sequences continue to test your patience in the second half and (once again) the heist is so easily done as if the owners were just waiting for the diamonds to be stolen in advance. Particularly the elements of 'not in use' AC duct & the excessive water involved in the act were just mind blowing throwing away the logic as always. Next the painfully stretched climax trying to pump in some fake patriotism simply falls flat and the film thankfully ends raising a big question in your mind that, 'Why did Shahrukh signed this and didn't they all read the script first before saying Yes?' and moreover, 'Why everyone including Aamir, Akshay, Hrithik, Salman & now Shahrukh are all desperately doing the same heist films all of a sudden?'Keeping aside the writing which more or less gets revealed from the description above, I would like to mention the direction which questionably doesn't give you even one impressive or memorable scene in the film to be precise. Refusing to learn from the mistakes of the past, this time Farah makes fun of Saroj Khan in a spoof and with Shahrukh (once again) being present in the act, becomes the 'partner in the crime' unarguably. In honest words, I really cannot understand the need and fail to laugh at any such act disrespecting our veterans, whom we have grown up watching in all the past decades.Other than this highly objectionable addition Farha also brings in some surprising cameos featuring Sajid Khan, Prabhudeva, Anurag Kashyap, Vishal and more. But none of them is able to bring in that much desired laughter in the theater. Plus the overuse of a particular suggestive abusive word in the dialogues seems to be really strange as well as sick considering the King Khan's status. And I would humbly like to ask the Censors that 'Does the committee only understands English abusive words, strongly objecting their use in our films and really not familiar with the Hindi abuse suggestively used in HNY? OR 'Do we have different set of rules for small, medium and big budget films featuring the known names?'Musically, the songs are not able to make any kind of long lasting impact on the viewers and the only catchy number 'Main Lovely Ho Gayi Han' is highly inspired from a Punjabi composition also reminding you of 'Main Yaar Manani Ni' from DAAG (1973). Coming to the other technical departments, a heist movie is largely dependent upon its Background Score which keeps you glued to the screen when the task is being done without any major dialogues. But HNY doesn't have any pulsating Background score to make you feel the excitement and the camera-work keeps trying hard to fill in the missing element through its different angles along with some fine action. Also the editors are not able to deliver a fast paced, engaging product probably because they had to give each and every actor his due scenes keeping the main focus on Shahrukh.In the performance section, I really haven't got much to write as none of the names come up with anything exceptional other than a few scenes of Deepika, Boman and Abhishek. Despite being there in almost every frame Shahrukh doesn't deliver the Khan magic and I truly missed the actor seen in SWADES and CHAKK DE India. BothSonu Sood & Anupam Kher are wasted just for nothing, Vivaan is only there to fill up the space and Jackie Shroff is the same, as seen before playing a routine act.In all it seems that the film was made just for the sake of friendship since in comparative terms HNY is arguably one of the most disappointing films of the year which misses out the opportunity to encash a talented cast ensemble. Nevertheless its pretty obvious that the film will still make a big killing at the box office due to our own gross ignorance and so huge cinema loving population of the country.However signing off on a positive note, I would like to request Shahrukh to please adapt new concepts, new directors and better films in the coming years, since the actor himself and his fans certainly deserve much better films than HAPPY NEW YEAR.",3,4,6,5 January 2015
Godzilla," Despite having three instead of one, it still fails to deliver the thrills.
","Having loved its 1998 version with few sequences resembling the JURRASIC PARK series, I was pretty much excited to see this new upgraded version of the giant after more than a decade and so were the kids eager to see the monster on the screen in 3D. But sadly the experience turned out to be quite weird, since the film was completely different from the expectations raised and went on a surprisingly contrasting path dealing with nuclear plants, radiations, scientific researches and heavy gadgets instead of the monster.In fact the most amusing news is that this time we don't have one but two distinctive varieties of Godzillas (3 in numbers) who fight with each other as rivals. The original monster we saw in the 1998 version plays the 'Good hearted Godzilla' coming out as a savior killing the other two, only to return back into the sea probably for a long rest before the next sequel. Interestingly this second type here is called MUTO which means'Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism' looking like some giant grasshoppers with thin legs. However what hurts the most is that despite having 3 instead of 1, there is no creature to be seen in a major part of the film, especially in the initial hour talking all about the radiations and nuclear energy.Beginning well with some stunning 3D visuals and a brilliant emotional sequence between the couple in the nuclear plant (well enacted), the film goes on and on without introducing the hero (i.e. the Godzilla) for an hour or so. Plus it doesn't offer many exciting or entertaining moments later too, even in the giant fights painfully designed by the exceptional graphics team. As a result GODZILLA remains a major disappointment for most of its time with only occasional good sequences coming at intervals.In short, after AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 this is another high on technique and low on content much awaited project delivering quite less than what was being expected. It has some amazing 3D graphics but remains a non- performer on the entertainment level right till the end, unfortunately. On a lighter note, even the kids said that they wished to see GODZILLA much more than just in a small guest role.And as one of my friends said, the film can easily be summed up as, '250 Ki Ticket Mein, Bas 35 Rupaye Ka Godzilla!'",4,0,3,2 June 2014
Rockstar," It rises above the level of entertainment and is like a smashing mirror on our face making us realize our own filthy self.
","ROCKSTAR is a winner all the way in the first half and the viewers are sure going to enjoy all the proceedings in its first hour with an intelligent direction, entertaining performances, perfect cinematography, realistic dialogues, believable characters and soothingly supporting soundtrack. Narrated mostly in flashback mode, the film is about the journey of a Rockstar who is basically suffering the consequences of his own indecisive character. Taking an inspiration from the real-life story of the famous & charismatic Rock-music Icon Jim Morrison, the script takes you inside the complex character of a popular STAR who majorly gets famous for the wrong reasons. The Ranbir-Nargis pairing looks ravishing on the screen with the traces of 'Geet' from JAB WE MET in the characterization of Nargis. The writers beautifully explain the need of 'Some kind of Pain or Heartbreak' in order to become an artist in a lighter mode, which later on takes a realistic shape in Janardan's life. The transformation sequences of Janardan becoming the famous Jordon are a treat to watch, especially the qawaali at Nizammudin Dargah and all in-studio scenes of Ranbir along with Piyush Mishra and the great Shammi Kapoor. So till the interval point, ROCKSTAR is totally an entertaining venture with something thrown in for all kind of audiences both in the major and the smaller centers (like the adult movie sequence).But all the commercial problems start post intermission where the film takes a drastic turn towards becoming a more enlightening experience than an entertaining one. And that's where most of the viewers are going to find it difficult to grasp as that is nothing compared to anything ordinary or easily understandable. In its second half, ROCKSTAR mostly talks about the inner conflicts of a big star and her beloved who are not ONE at the moment due to their own lack of will of taking the right decisions at the right time.Moreover, the last 30 minutes of the film and its purely enlightening climax, might be equal to the phrase of'Upar Se Nikal Gayi' for many viewers particularly in the smaller centers. Because this very part of the movie takes it to another spiritual level where one gets to see the bitterness in the words 'SEX' and 'GUILT' clearly before his eyes, quite shamelessly. And in all probabilities of the world, where people don't like to get serious or listen to something about their own real life in a film, this abrupt and open ending of ROCKSTAR will not be taken sportingly by majority of the audience as well as critiques.Musically, the track 'Saada Haq, Aithey Rakh' explains the inner clash & tension of a true artist perfectly. It is well supported by a brilliant camera-work equivalent to the International Standards, a superlative musical arrangement by the maestro (including the singing part by Mohit Chauhan) and some truly great lyrics by Irshad Kamil, which pump up the blood flowing in your body and you feel like standing and saying'Saaaaaada Haq, Aitheeeeey Rakh'.However, as a true die-hard fan of A.R. Rahman I would humbly like to say that I was really expecting a lot more from this soundtrack of ROCKSTAR. No doubt, it has got the few gems in the kitty but when it's the musical score by Rahman, of a film called ROCKSTAR, made by Imtiaz Ali, then its unarguably logical to expect something extra-ordinary in its each track. The songs other than 'Saada Haq' and 'Kun Faaya' need repeated listening to become likable and one can only relate with most of them after watching the film.In the performance department, this has a flawless, award winning act from Ranbir Kapoor going far beyond whatever glimpses you may have seen in the promos. Therefore this has to be the movie which Ranbir should feel proud of and only one man would be the happiest person to see this from his heavenly abode..his grandfather, the Legendary Showman Sh. Raj Kapoor. And I am sure that if he was alive today, then without thinking about the box office result of the film, he would have announced a big party calling every single person of the Industry to share this fabulous achievement of Ranbir.Nargis Fakhri as Heer gave me much more than my expectations. Therefore even though many friends may have some different things to say about her but I hugely cherished her performance undoubtedly and also must say that Imtiaz does have a special eye for beauties having a foreign link. So I am all game for seeing more of Nargis Fakhri very soon. Further, I simply loved watching one of my dearest legends Shammi Kapoor coming alive once again on the screen in a truly adorable cameo with his enigmatic presence. Piyush Mishra as the Music Company owner is as usual, fantastic along with another great supporting performance by the actor playing Ranbir's friend-manager. Aditi Rao Hydari becomes the victim of a wrong kind of suggestive characterization but Shernaz Patel does well in her short role. Technically ROCKSTAR excels in its Cinematography by Anil Mehta with perfect capturing of all On & Off stage sequences. The same can also be said about its styling and the dialogues, especially in the first half of the film, which straight away remind you of your own college days.So with ROCKSTAR, Imtiaz takes you onto the journey into the mind of a Creative Musician depicting his inner pain, love and hate in a splendid way. And in the process he insightfully reveals the truth that Yes, its a blessing to be a Creative as blessed by the Almighty. But at the same time, its also very painful to be there where you are given a different eye to look through everyone like a mirror and can feel the pain like nobody else.",8,3,3,2 January 2012
Spectre," With a visually entertaining first half and a routine second, its an above average BOND movie that can be tried once.
","Keeping all the comparisons aside, SPECTRE directed by Sam Mendes with Daniel Craig in the lead offers a fresh visual treat at one side and the usual supposed to be thrilling drama on the other resulting in a mixed bag that can easily be rated as an above average venture that might not be able to satisfy many, especially the Bond fans.Beginning with a terrific opening 10-15 minutes before the famous titles, the film scores a big star right away taking you onto a tour of the festival of the Dead in Mexico City blowing off a whole building post a worth noticing single shot following the Bond heading towards his chosen shooting spot. Further ending the sequence with a sensational scuffle in a dangerously flying helicopter frightening hundreds of people running away on the ground, SPECTRE raises your expectations a lot and then keeps delivering the well shot exciting moments before the 'forced' interval (in India) quite impressively. The plot focusing on a secret message left by the chief pointing towards a funeral that in turn leads to an international syndicate of criminals called SPECTRE lays a fine base for the much needed suspense element in the film. But sadly the same goes missing in its second hour, wherein the pace drops and it all falls down to the same routine stuff with only the cinematography and action thankfully maintaining the excellence displayed in its opening hour.To be specific one strongly misses the suspense factor in its script and emotional depth in the key characters, becoming a major drawback of the film post its initial 50 minutes. Besides the two main attractions Monica Bellucci and Christoph Waltz delivering nothing entertaining enough as per their individual persona turns out to be the biggest disappointment unarguably. On the other hand, its supporting cast plays it fine but a few insertions like the 'Special Car-Buttons' and the huge henchman trying to kill Daniel, does remind you of 'the classic Bond movies' and its famous characters like the one played by Kabir Bedi in OCTOPUSSY (1983).In all, SPECTRE does have Craig in a good form well supported by some spellbinding action, background score and breathtaking cinematography keeping you hooked onto the screen in its first hour. However it's the less enjoyable script losing its charm post intermission, a lengthy duration of more than 145 minutes and lackluster performances of both Monica and Waltz that force you to rate it as an above average venture falling short of the expectations raised.Interestingly the Indian Censor Board has trimmed the duration of 'a long kiss' featured in the film as per their new norms or guidelines raising a relevant question that, 'how long a KISS should actually be in India, giving you the right amount of satisfaction or pleasure?' Hoping that the arguments given for the cut might be having the exact duration mentioned in second or minutes, you can surely try SPECTRE if you are a BOND-series fans since many years, but only for the opening 15 minutes and the visual treat it offers being the two major merits rising above everything else.",6,0,0,2 August 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," An Intelligently directed & well scripted movie but portrays India in a bad taste. (Part One)
","It's the most appreciated movie in the last few months (2008), winning several awards at various film festivals all over the globe. So I was excited enough to the see it, expecting another movie which will be added in my 'Movies to See Before You Die' list. No doubt it is one of the best movies of recent times but sadly I didn't find it worth adding my 'Must See Movies' List and I will surely give you my reasons for that here in the end.Firstly talking about the movie, an interesting observation is that if the viewer is not told about who directed this flick, then, he is bound to take it as a movie made by an Indian or a person with an Indian origin. But surprisingly it is directed by 'Danny Boyle' of 'Trainspotting' and '28 Days Later' fame. Though he has done a brilliant job but in my opinion he selected this subject and directed this movie keeping in mind the festival circuit and attention he would get because of the Indian touch and feel of the movie. You might get my point more clearly after watching it and reading my points at the end of this review.The story of this movie is about a young teenage boy winning millions at a TV Show (KBC of Indian Television) and how each question asked by the anchor has a relation to his past life. He knows most of the answers as all the questions have something similar to the circumstances of his real life. So the anchor at one point of time doubts that he may be cheating in the show. In order to investigate his loyalty, he is handed over to the police for one night, but nothing is found against him and he is allowed to play the game, the next final day.Each question put to him in the game show has a sequence attached to it in the screenplay which is well written and enjoyable. The growth of the children from a small age to their teenage youth is well executed. But the thrill which should have been there regarding the game is missing. May be it's because from the title itself you already know that the contestant is going to win. Moreover, the narration of the movie is more towards an artistic offbeat film (like that of 'Salaam Bombay'), which reduces its chances of becoming a big hit in the Indian circuit (But may do well in multiplexes).Performances wise everybody does a fine job especially Dev Patel and all the child artists featuring in the movie. Their expressions and dialogue delivery has been directed perfectly and they never seem to be acting. Anil Kapoor, Irfan Khan, Saurabh Shukla & Mahesh Manjrekar are just fine doing their parts with nothing extra-ordinary to talk about. But they are lucky enough to get this project which has become world famous by now. One thing i couldn't understand was that why Anil Kapoor did not want the slum boy to win in his show and why he tried to give him the wrong answer. Camerwork showing the slums and riots is brilliant. In fact the opening scene is the most well shot sequence with all the kids running followed by the policemen.Musically, there are no full length songs in the movie and the soundtrack alone is more enjoyable separately. The best song is 'Jai Ho' which was shockingly refused by Subhash Ghai for his movie 'Yuvraaj'. The background music is superb giving an ample support to the direction. A. R. Rahman gives another good score in this International project and has already won praises and awards, making his presence felt in the International Film & Music Circles. We are really proud to have him as a National Treasure.Now coming to the points why this movie could not impress me as expected and why it is not being added to my 'Movies to See Before You Die' List.",6,3,7,21 February 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," It refuses to stop pressing the accelerator once it begins.
","Few rare films are simply not interested in impressing everyone unanimously since they neither have any interesting storyline nor any intense show of loving relationship between its key characters. These are the films specifically targeting the viewers who love watching high paced actions sequences coming one after another in an unstoppable mode making you feel the adrenaline rush providing many electrifying entertaining moments in those two hours. And further can also be compared to an unbelievable roller coaster ride that refuses to stop once it starts pressing the accelerator with a promise to make you scream and yell like hell.So if you are one amongst those who are eager enough to witness this astonishing show of exceptional (or rather impossible) kind of stunts, extremely difficult yet superlative cinematography and breath-taking execution on screen by hundreds of performers together in the location of a hot desert, then just buy a ticket and fasten your seatbelts to have one of the best action-oriented, cinematic rides you might have enjoyed so far.Coming after a few decades of its original Mad Max trilogy, this latest venture surpasses them all with many unreal firsts showcasing an incredible quality-chaos featuring brilliant performances (superbly led by Tom Hardy & Charlize Theron), long car chases, amazing bikers, giant trucks, big explosions and jaw-dropping mad action that forcibly gives you the thought that 'How the hell they could do all this and then capture it on camera too so brilliantly?' Made on an admittedly weak plot of a group of girls being rescued, the film also focuses on the strong women power displayed by its female protagonist. But what actually lifts the movie beautifully along with its action are its meaningful, life teaching one liners included in its short but powerful dialogues. For instance, 'What are you doing?' 'Praying!' 'To who?' 'Anyone who's listening!!!!' OR 'You know......HOPE is a ...... Mistake.' 'If you cannot fix what's broken, you will go insane'Moreover the skillfully composed background score successfully brings you on to the edge of your seats, especially with the 'already famous' rock-star on the truck playing his explosive guitar along with the people hitting the huge drums at the back. Plus this is one of those few movies that remain bright throughout (due to the chosen locations) and never becomes a pain watching in 3D due to its fascinating sequences both shot & performed extremely well.Having said that MAD MAX: Fury Road also might not be the film for the ones not much interested in such pulsating action or a loud, brutal fight for survival shot unbelievably with its own limitations of concept and storyline. But if you really wish to experience many highly charged, thrilling moments in the theatre like never before then do opt for the film, especially on the bigger screen to respect & honour the amazingly mind-boggling achievement made by its entire team.In short, it can also be referred as one of those remarkably conceived, eye-opener films that actually make you realize the huge amount of backstage preparations, hard-work, time, energy and resources required to shoot such a challenging film on location. So do watch it at a must to take your own lessons of film-making from the masters on work both on and off the screen so majestically.",8,0,2,2 August 2016
