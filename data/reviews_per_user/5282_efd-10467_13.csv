Blade Runner 2049," Good, but.......
","Great Sci Fi, but very hard to beat the first and it doesn't. Ridley Scott painted the screen in the first one with his vision of a novel, this one is a new directors version of that one, so as we go away from the source the message is cloudier, but still well worth the watch.Make sure you watch the first.",7,0,2,8 September 2019
The Death of Stalin," Funny, interesting, unique
","A look at the political shenanigans in Russia immediately post Stalin's death, with a cracking script played out by a great cast.I've never seen a historical story handled in such a unique way, very funny at times, disturbing at others. Love the English accents and the razor sharp sarcasm, a lesson in good dialogue well acted.",9,0,0,29 March 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Escapism
","Abandon any intent of a serious plot, this is pure escapism, the music is fun, the look at Europe is funny, the story is silly but so is Eurovision in reality.At times so silly it's a bit flat but also at times really funny, I think it will grow as a cult film. It's quirkiness is its charm, Iceland is the star and at the end you simply think, ' well, what was that ?'.Worth a look, with probably the most enjoyable 'happy ending' I've seen in quite a while.",7,5,6,2 July 2020
The Irishman," A Mixed Bag done by a Master Filmmaker
","There are some great scenes, there is some ripping dialogue, the interaction between Deniro and Pesci, is at times a delight, the latter often stealing scenes.But it's familiar tale and very long, probably too long, Scorsese tends to get lost in his love for this genre and dwells too long past the point where 'we get it'.Technically good with a great cast it's well worth watching, but if your looking for a CASINO or a GOODFELLAS, this isn't it, it simply lacks mojo, it's dour and drawn out.Scorsese can do what he wants, he's earns it and I bet they had a ball making it.",6,2,6,30 November 2019
The Fifth Element," Unique and Fun
","Absolute Science Fiction, written with humour and great creativity. One of a kind here, not following any Hollywood formula, if it's your first time let it flow through and over you, if it's your 50th time enjoy the creativity.",9,3,4,5 May 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Interesting Movie
","No missing Spike Lee's slightly off centre treatment of the topic and story, that added to an honest view on a part of American history makes this an interesting 137 minutes, really enjoyable viewing, a combo of thoughtfulness and entertainment.",8,4,8,26 February 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Lots of Sizzle but not much Sausage
","It comes close but overall it failed for me, Malik's impression is over done except of the stage clips which he does very well. The music holds it together but it feels like a bit of a patch work of Queen and Freddie Mercury, it also fails to connect emotionally, or at least did with me, it has selected the big memorable moments but left out the glue of their lives, whatever that was.",7,1,3,2 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great Story Telling
","Take a bit of fact, add some creative licence, with a great cast and shoot it beautifully, overall a good movie which is a story on the screen.As the story unfolds Brad Pitt steals most scenes but has stiff competition from Di Caprio and Margot Robbie simply looks stunning, it's what movies should be, bold and in your face culture, really enjoyable.",8,1,4,26 March 2020
The King," Good Stuff
","If you enjoy a good historical drama with plenty of blood and guts, this is pretty good. Netflix again produces a movie to satisfy a hole in the traditional formula driven churn.Well acted and well produced, it left me wanting more. Hopefully they pop out a couple more of these, the stories are half written by history, they just need to present it in a professional and entertaining manner, as with this one.",8,5,8,3 November 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Average
","Agatha Christie needs a bit more mystery and depth in a film particularly when the story is so well known. Branaghs's Poirot is more eccentric than brilliant, in fact most of the characters are over played and a bit silly.In the end you don't really warm to anyone or want more, it's very predictable and flat.",6,2,2,24 October 2019
Blade Runner," Up there with the best
","I just watched this movie for about the 50th time and still got lost in the characters, the settings, the story.It has a truly individual look and feel about, totally unique, it's a piece of art.",9,1,2,8 September 2019
Da 5 Bloods," Okay but a bit mixed up
","Spike Lee couldn't seem to make his mind up on what sort of movie this was, a war buddy film, at times an action thriller, a treasure hunt, a road movie, with really obvious political messages interspersed throughout.At times the flashback characters didn't look any younger and a closing still of the 5 American veterans in their youth looked terrible, as if they'd been airbrushed by a high school art class.It jumps from a commentary on black soldiers not getting recognition in the 60's to modern black lives matter snapshots. I think Spike Lee had too much to say, it was at times a bit jumbled.Vietnam looks spectacular, the treasure hunt plot is a great idea, the violence was a bit over done making it seem at times like a Rambo movie.So interesting but confused, probably falls a bit short of being good, he should have streamlined his overall plot and perhaps made 2 movies out of his messages.",7,2,4,19 June 2020
The Godfather," Never Fails
","I must have watched this movie 30 times, yet it is interesting and enjoyable every time. Beautifully filmed and written, it is like reading a great novel, the heroes are villains but you get so lost in the story it doesn't matter, it is a prime example of the art of movie making, perhaps the best.",10,2,2,23 February 2019
