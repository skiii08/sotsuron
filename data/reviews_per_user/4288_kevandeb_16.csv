Child 44," Guns to reviewer monkeys
","The only reason I am writing are view is because some simpletons have actually given this 1 star, what kind of idiot thinks this is 1 star viewing? Do not believe these trolls, whilst I prefer films to be in the local language this does not detract from such a good movie. My only criticism is that the killers reasons are not explored enough and too much emphasis is on the central characters rather than the story line. Having said that, such strong performances easily rate this a 7. Gary Oldman is excellent as usual and Tom Hardy is the thinking persons go to actor, but Naomi in my humble opinion was the standout character and elevated the survival instinct interest inside the USSR to a believable level. Like Downfall,if a Russian version was available this would have made such stronger viewing but I am more than happy with what I saw.",7,5,9,13 November 2015
Shaun of the Dead," hmmmm.....watchable i suppose
","i am sure that whilst the tongue in cheek, jump on the zombie genre bandwagon, appeals to a wide audience...it misses a great opportunity to have been as big of a cult film as They Live & Army of Darkness. these are remembered decades after their release...i say here and now in 3 years people will say Shaun who? always a great supporter of Brit flicks, i really wanted to enjoy this, there were great moments, but like eating a Chinese takeaway you are never fully satisfied.nevertheless a rainy night with nothing to do this film will suffice, but look for more comedic moments in a Christmas cracker might prove more fruitful...!!",6,2,7,16 December 2005
The Secret in Their Eyes," Perfection guaranteed
","It is a long time since writing a review for many reasons and I feel there are many films that deserve a mention that I have neglected. However, having watched this movie, how can I not put down in writing the absolute joy and belief that in 129 minutes this movie demonstrates EVERYTHING that a movie should be. Stellar performances from all concerned and it would be churlish to highlight any single person.... so churlish I will be.....Guillermo Francella gave one of the greatest performances in cinema history, showing everything from comedy to despair. Two weeks later my wife and I are still talking about this movie and it induces so many emotions that I cannot say what is the overriding feeling one is left with. All I can say is that we are still in awe and is now in my top 3 of all time with 'One flew Over The Cuckoos Nest' & '12 Angry Men' A must see film for any serious film buff and a rare film that touches all emotions and senses. We are privileged to have seen this.",10,7,9,3 February 2013
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Film of The Year
","OK, I have not watched that many films this year for one reason or another. However I have watched enough over the years to hopefully know a good film when I see it. The acting was superb and like Benito Del Toro in Traffic, I am sure Frances McDormand is a shoe-in for a few awards, however my standout was Sam Rockwell. A loathsome character, with lots of flaws but ultimately redeemable. Woody Harrelson was his usual laconic joy to watch and keeps getting better.
It might be a tough watch, with barely a character that is endearing or somebody you can connect with, but stick with it, as the layers are peeled away their characters are revealed for what they really are
Loved it, dark enough to be sinister with some acerbic comedic relief.",9,5,11,31 December 2017
The Machinist," This is movies at their best
","Gritty, disturbing, powerful & ultimately everything i look for in a movie. Movies like food can be standard fare, sometimes you expect a great experience and are disappointed, other times you are pleasantly surprised.This movie is easily one of the finest of the year and what is surprising like a great little restaurant, is how come i have never heard of it? Everything was right, the acting, the locale, direction and filming.... Now i always like to comment without mentioning any plot or specific scenes as i believe people should see a film with an open mind and new eyes, not through somebodies likes and dislikes.so whilst people may think the storyline eventually may not be exceptional, as it deals with something experienced by a lot of unfortunate people from both perspectives, how it is told and how Christian Bale relives the experience is without doubt awesome.His appearance in this feast of a film is amazing and i have to really stand in awe of what he has achieved in this movie.without doubt it ranks along the MUST SEE films of all time, and my list is very selective. If you miss this you really are missing a film that sets a standard.",10,1,1,24 June 2005
The Usual Suspects," Yes I Know??
","yes i know.... yes i know what? i know we are all entitled to our own opinion, but this is without doubt my favourite movie, yes i know the story is between myth and reality, yes i know the casting is superb, yes i know Kevin Spacey will never surpass this performance. Sometimes you just get a film where all the elements are unequalled on their own, and when all added together just are astounding. This is one of the few films where it happens....somebody mentions about ALL the killing.....?? this is where it adds to the myth of Kaiser Soze, how else can we build this myth? My only gripe is that it is not high enough in the top 250....c'est la vie",10,0,1,1 April 2004
The Princess Bride," The Perfect Family Film
","I could go on and on and gush about how the casting for the film was the best, especially Patinkin as Inigo Montoya...sheer brilliance. Or go on about the wonderful satirical one liners, but all i will say is this film is perfection and anyone who has a criticism on any scene is being pedantic. A must for any collection. 10/10",10,0,0,17 February 2003
Mulholland Drive," Utter crap
","We have determinedly and desperately tried to immerse ourselves into 'THE EXPERIENCE' the below extract of a 3,000 word review exemplifies my whole problem with the film......'The film is a dream, an illusion, but not in the usual, cheap sense of the term -- it's a MÃ¶bius strip, an Escher painting, a page from Finnegans Wake; it defies waking logic, and yet appears remarkably complete and seamless.' ......and that is nobody gets it!!! probably not even the director himself, it appears a meandering collage of crap that invented itself as it progressed. Attempting to elevate itself into a typical art college discussion group that if you don't get it you are 'outside of the clique' exemplifies the condescending approach taken, delivered and passed on by the small number of radiohead fan base who 'sense the provocative and exhilarating direction taken' (not my words). Don't get me started on Radiohead, who are the worst band ever elevated to cult status by the pure fluke of enough art college students deeming their life is worthless because their parents only bought them a PS2 and not an XBox or a Wii!!! I am sure this will not be well received and that the impression is we are 'Die Hard (1,2 3 & 4)' fans......(which we are to an extent)....... ....but when my 10's include 'Goodbye Mr Chips (1939), El Maquinista (2004), Nil By Mouth (1997), Paradise Now (2005), Withnail & I (1987), Der Untergang (2004) and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (1975), hopefully demonstrates some semblance of sanity when i say this film is an overindulgent, self absorbed meandering film of nothing noteworthy of an otherwise respected Director.",3,2,7,16 January 2009
Here Comes the Boom," Sucker Punch!
","I have to admit I am a sucker for Kevin James, ever since King of Queens was broadcast in the UK I have loved the persona he plays as the 'average joe' he typifies what most of us guys do in life or would like to do and that is to act like a kid, never grow up and do as little as possible!! His transposition to the big screen has not been without troubles and whilst this is a bit kitsch, borrows from other movies, I still will forgive his choices as he is, like Simon Pegg, so likable that watching him gives a warm feeling like a mug of cocoa on a rainy day. Not an Oscar winner but an above average afternoon movie that is easily watchable",6,5,6,20 May 2017
Blood Diamond," Disappointed.......
",".......to say the least that this movie did not figure more prominently in the Oscars. By far Leonardo Di Caprio's finest performance, even down to the accent and use of South African phrases, which my wife remembers from her 27 years in SA. I have to agree with a previous reviewer, and say this is the finest film of the year. Although I have no complaints with the other successes at the awards. I am surprised that Djimon Hounsou did not receive recognition for his performance and thought he was the most 'sure thing' for an award since Benico Del Toro for Traffic. This film is a must for any person's DVD collection and is easily a certainty for my top 100 movies.",9,0,1,12 March 2007
Saw," Watch it....
","Time defining example of great movie making, that will stand with the other movies through the years of what horror movies should be about. ranking alongside defining films such as; The Thing, Exorcist, Halloween, Friday 13th, Elm Street, Evil Dead, Demons and yes even in my humble opinion Final Destination. this has brought something new and refreshing to the Horror genre. The plot is simplistic and that is the beauty of the film. Well acted, with a great storyline. This is a must watch movie, that will keep the suspense until the end, and i look forward to seeing Mr. James Wan's future projects. i just hope we will not be seeing Saw 27 in years to come. please know when to stop.",8,0,1,18 January 2006
Downfall," Never forget....
","History aside, if we can, negative reviews compel me to add some comments, whether welcome or not. I note some reviewers whilst commending the skill of the delivery, condemn certain aspects of the movie, such as showing the ringleaders in a sympathetic light, playing unsuitable music with religious overtones & perhaps not portraying events accurately. I mark this movie highly despite the subject matter not because of it. I believe (personally) the acting to be second to none and rather than feeling sorry for the antagonists, watching them squirm like rats in a tunnel crawling over each other, I take a perverse pleasure in their frantic, brow mopping final machinations to delay the inevitable. The film does not portray them sympathetically, rather, it shows them as weak limbed, weak minded individuals easily led and paying the price of blindly following a distorted belief.",10,2,4,1 October 2010
Signs," Whats all the fuss about!!
","We were told we must see this film, and went along with high hopes, we could not see what everybody was raving about, where was the guise of sixth sense, where was the anticipation of unbreakable....i am sure (have only watched it once) if we saw it again we might have a different view, but at the moment it is not very high on our shopping list.",3,2,3,7 February 2003
The Deer Hunter," Immense poignancy
","I cannot fathom the absolute horror that war brings to a persons life, but never has a film depicted it more harrowing than The Deerhunter. At 182 minutes, it seemed to fly by, leaving me wanting more and wishing this would not end. all facets are explored, all people's emotions are laid bare, not just the combatants. If we obviously did not know better, one would have to say this was a British film, as it has all the best elements that British movie making displays. i can eulogise for hundreds of lines, but this really is the ONLY American movie i can think of (others? apart from taxi driver) that is RAW. A strange word i know but the movie oozes a raw edge to it. Immense performances from all concerned, and if i had to say, i believe i have not seen Christopher Walken in a better role. One of the very few films i deservedly give 10/10. A must for any collection and a stunning example of every aspect of film making coming together, albeit for a sombre depiction of life.",10,118,177,18 January 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Each to their own
","There are three (OK maybe more?) groups of people where these films are dealing with: 1. LOTR fanatics 2. LOTR fans 3. LOTR Couldnt care less....show me the movieI am in group 2, have read the book about 8 times, but do not remember every name in it or every scene from the book. In my (humble) opinion you are never going to please all of the people all of the time, but this trilogy comes pretty damn close. the first apparent thing is it is made/directed with an great love/appreciation of the novel. To appeal to group 1 you would have to make 10 films each 4 hours long, to appeal to group 3 you would need to condense the three films into two 90 minute slice and dice movies, i really do believe these could not be better done, i could have a few needless niggles, but why bother when the overall effect is so stunning. the only sour taste left in ones mouth is what a charade, fix and outright disgrace the awards ceremonies are, as when the Two Towers 'towered' above any film that year it failed, and when it did win all before it, there was some VERY good competition, which was made to appear weak.....c'est la vie",10,1,2,1 April 2004
The Birds," Our feathered friends?
","I cannot say anything more than this is Hitchcock at his sublime best, always a big fan of any Hitchcock film and having seen them all, i believe i am preaching to the converted here and just wish to show my admiration for one of, if not, the greatest filmmakers of all time...As true with any great work of art this really does get better with the more you look at it, a great reminder of the genius of the man.Hitchcock, like Billy Wilder (see Ace in the Hole & The Lost Weekend....and many more) really knew how to grip the audiences attention.I feel like a student trying to describe a Picasso or Renoir piece of art, knowing whatever i say will be inadequate, but wishing to bask in their greatness and to let them know in my own way that this world would be such a poorer place without them....",8,0,0,16 December 2005
