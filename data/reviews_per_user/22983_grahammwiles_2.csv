Hereditary," From good to simply pathetic!
",What a let down. This movie had so much potential. Started off strong and just got more and more daft as it went on. Watch at your own peril!,2,0,2,24 August 2018
Ready Player One," Great Film!
","I didn't even know there was a book until I read the reviews. So this film isn't tainted in my mind by reading the book first.I enjoyed the film from start to finish. Growing up through the video game revolution added to the enjoyment of this film.I'm a Spielberg fan, and once again he delivered a perfect masterpiece! Thank you!A must watch film!",10,2,5,24 August 2018
