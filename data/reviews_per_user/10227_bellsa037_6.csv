Casablanca," Casablanca
","In the beginning of the movie, the filmmaker attracts the audience by telling the story which is about the world war 2. However, I noticed something in the scene that the man who had expired passport tried to escape ,and he was shot, but the people around him did not be frightened or feel anything. After that, the story was focus on the bar, and there was the performing of music that was really fantastic. When the camera moved through the instrument or the singer, you would hear the sound of that thing was louder and louder. Besides, I think the vision of this movie is very clear; I can see many details on the background. Furthermore, the filmmaker added the story about the past; I think this is interesting way to tell a story and create the attention of the audience because the audience has to think what was going on, and this also fulfilled the love story perfectly.",9,0,2,13 March 2010
Full Metal Jacket," Sir ! It is really good war movie. Sir !
","The movie is divided into two parts. The first part is about practicing for being a soldier. I like this part very much, especially the soldier teacher. When I watch his acting, it makes me think of the part of my life when I had to practice in soldier school. In the scene that all soldiers stand in front of their bed and the soldier teacher talks to each person; we can see low-angle shot after he punches his pupil. In addition, we can see the camera cut to another side of 180 degree system while they are talking; I think the director tries to emphasis that the teacher soldier talks very loud near the ear of his pupil. The scene that the soldier practice in the evening time with the sun in background is beautiful scene and this scene gives the feeling of practice hard. Plus, the background musics and instrument(drum)(nondiegetic) are used in practicing scene to motivate the emotion of the audience. Every scene in the first part represents the practicing, so there are many cuts that are discontinuity editing. In the second part, the movie is about war, so the kinetic quality of the movie is high including the moving frame. Besides, there are many special effect scenes. Moreover, low-angle shot is used again when the soldiers talk to the dead people and the camera moves from person to another person.",9,0,0,14 May 2010
Fargo," Fargo
","I feel nobody is smart in this movie. It is different from the crime movies that I have been watched. Normally, they usually have the main character who are smart and fight with bad people. I think the director tries to make the movie is funny by using stupid manner of characters. However, many scenes are cruel, especially the scene that the man kills the police, and many scenes are unpredictable; for example, the scene that kidnapper looks through the window and breaks it out and comes to the house to kidnap. In addition, there is an example of overlapping sound in the scene that the man tries to fix the television. In that scene while the man is fixing the television, the camera is zooming in, and when the television is good, the camera zoom out, but it becomes the different place.",7,0,0,14 May 2010
The Exorcist," Evil Girl !
","The plot of the movie is interesting because it begins with the short story that opens the mysterious thing for the movie. In the important scene of the short story that the man looks at the statue; the camera cuts to the man's face and zooms in after that the camera cuts to the statue and zooms in. Then, the audience can see the shot that they both stand in the opposite side with the weird of sound background(nondiegetic sound) that mixes with the sound of barking (offscreen sound). I think the director try to imply the audience that they both are going to encounter in some scene. In addition, the director uses 'a lap dissolve' to connect between stories. Next, the plot of the movie follows with two story lines, and each story line meets each other in the middle of the movie. Moreover, the director uses the dream of the main actor to urge the expectation of the audience by connecting with the item(necklace) that was represented in the beginning of the movie. Finally, when the girl turn into evil, it looks very scary because the production designer did the good job for makeup. Plus, the director uses the special effect to show the supernatural things(shaking of the bed).",8,0,1,2 May 2010
The Graduate," Great Job Dude!
","The first scene begins with the long take, and the camera moves following the main actor (kenesis). In the same time, the director opens the music with singing that is very appropriate for this movie in both content and form. I think putting the music with singing is a new thing to make a movie run smoothly, and it is definitely a way to promote the song too. In addition, the main actor has the character that is exact in the role of the movie such as his face or his manner that is the same with the concept of flat character. In the scene that the main actor lay down on the swimming pool we can see the switching between the picture of the main actor and the picture of water in the swimming pool. When the picture of the main actor is becoming dominant, the picture of the water is disappearing. When the picture of the water is becoming dominant, the picture of the main actor is disappearing. Moreover, the director use 'Ellipsis Tecnique' to switch the shot between the room and his home many times. I think it helps to reduce the feeling of discontinuity between shots. After the main actress knew about the real between his mother and the main actor, the relationship between shots is not continuity(discontinuity editing) like his life that has no aim. Finally, he did something that is unpredictable with the brave heart that beat the audience mind, and the end of the movie finish with the same song with the beginning.",9,1,1,13 April 2010
Psycho," Really Good Horror Movie !
","It was very surprising when the women was murdered because I thought she was the main actress. In addition, I looked at the bar that shows the time of the movie; it was just in the middle of the movie, this encouraged my curiosity to know what was going on and what would happen to the money. The scene of murdering is really classic, especially when the camera zoom out of her eye slowly. Besides, taking a shower is the time to feel relax, is not any idea or attention in the mind. Therefore, when the murder show up, it break down unconscious and makes the audience feel frightened. Nevertheless, it is weird because we could not see the knife touch her body. Moreover, the scene that after she bought the new car, we would hear the voice of the conversation while she was driving. These voices told the other parts of the story that help the audience more understand. Furthermore, the setting is really good, especially the house with the perfect quantity of the light is very horrible. Plus, there are a lot background musics that make the movie more scary and excited. In the scene that the detective walked up the stair we would the the changing the angle of the camera to be high angle. I think it is very appropriate for this scene that is unpredictable because we could not see what he see.",9,0,1,29 March 2010
