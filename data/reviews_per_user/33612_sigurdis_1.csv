Requiem for a Dream," this is one intense film !
","Wow.  What an intense film.  I saw Pi last year and was blown away by the cinematography and the acting, etc...and this film is just so much better. Look who Arnofsky has to play with! Burstyn.  Can any more be said, than one of the most brilliant, moving performances of her career! Jared Leto, who is highly underrated as a strong character actor.  Connelley...beautiful actress and also highly underrated.  The whole cast was so good, I sat mouth agape during the final climactic scenes.  This is one that I will definitely buy and recommend to others to not miss!",10,0,0,18 March 2001
