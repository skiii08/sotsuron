Lucky Number Slevin," A Copy of an Original
",My buddy rated this film high when he said it's almost as good as The Usual Suspect. That is some rating by any standards. By the time the film ended I could not wait to get up and find something better to do.The style was the first thing that hit me -Tarantino! Tarantino's use of eccentric characters even when not believable never fail to capture the imagination. There just was nothing believable or imaginative about the characters of Freeman and Kingsley. They both came across as annoying most of the time.A decent enough copy. Tried too had to inject a twist and when it came....The film maker's only coup was casting Bruce Willis.,4,1,4,28 November 2006
