The Blair Witch Project," After the hype has died.
",I watched this film last night. I had deliberatley resisted watching it since I first read any reviews. I cannot remember a film being given more word of mouth negatives after many positive media reviews.  So after the hype had died I took the plunge. My bottom line is this. I felt scared while watching this film. The realistic cinematography draws you into the premise that you are watching a real documentary. This film hits the right note. It convinces. This is perhaps the number one goal for any film which wants to scare you. I give it a conservative 7 out of 10. Anyone who likes reading books will have the projective ability to feel the fear of the protagonists in this story. If you need to be told everything in a story then it is not for you - stick to the Hollywood fodder my bovine chum!,7,0,1,13 October 2001
Gladiator," Tragedy of symbolism over storytelling
","The expectations of this film are enormous,, given the hype and popularity surrounding it since release. The acclamation accorded it is , no doubt, explained in part by cinema audiences having been starved of Roman epics for so long. The same phenomena influenced the hype of many early 90s westerns, few of which merited serious attention (Tombstone and Unforgiven)
Anyway, to return to Gladiator the viewer must always be wondering where is the plot, the story?. This is not a movie for the impatient, however, neither is it a movie for a patient viewer seeking true immersion in the story. The story is simply too ponderous. I always felt that I was watching a film and perhaps this is the worst crime any film can commit; the failure to let the viewer escape into its world and pretend for a period that this (the story)is actually happening - now and that he/she is a privileged witness to the events. None of the actors provide their characters with more than one dimension. Russell Crowe looks superb in the stills but in motion he  delivers no more variety of emotion than Dirty Harry (or worse Chuck Bronson in the Death Wish series!) Oliver Reed provides the few positive moments of feeling and passion. Mr Phoenix has 2 superb scenes as he murders his father and later when he threatens his nephew's life. Both are powerful, although the former is derived from Bladerunner - when Roy Batty crushes the skull of Tyrell.In the end we have a film which tries hard; delivering top stars; strong cinematography; an action charged setting but ultimately lets itself down by spinning a boring yarn. For a more entertaining version of similar events see The fall of the Roman Empire (1964).",7,1,2,21 May 2001
