Angels & Demons," Wasted opportunity
","I understand that an adaption from book to movie (especially this book) implies changes and that a movie has to stand for itself alone (and therefore mustn't be compared to the book), but I was disappointed nonetheless.My opinion may be biased because I've read the book, so I'll say only a few things. If you've read the book and are curious how they adapted the various events, characters and story lines, I recommend to you to NOT watch it! Many events and characters are missing completely, sadly.For those who haven't read the book, I don't know if you should watch it or not. The movie has some good in it, but in my eyes misses almost completely the message of the book and leaves a villain whose true motives aren't really explained.The movie contains a LOT of exposition. I think this is inevitable, since the book does so too. But a lot of it felt rushed and pushed in. It definitely works better in the book. Now I stop writing.",5,0,0,31 August 2014
