Deepwater Horizon," Nothing about the consequences, this is another shame on Hollywood
","'American heroes' are digging the Earth because of mean BP guys, so stereotypical it almost made me laugh. I should have known, Mark Wahlberg isn't really known to act in great movies but what is Malkovitch doing here ? And Kurt Russell ? It seems all these guys need more and more cash and are ready to sell every bit of them.Not a single word on the cataclysmic consequences of this ecological tragedy. Sorry, you won't make me cry for ten avid workers that are totally aware of what they're doing to the planet. No surprises, it's a classic bad Hollywood pseudo drama movie.
