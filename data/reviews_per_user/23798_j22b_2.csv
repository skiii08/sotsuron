Mission: Impossible III," Still can't act
","Sorry, but from the opening scene, Tommy still can't act. And there's not enough action in this movie to save it. I don't think we need our action heroes to emote, which is what he director hoped for and got via the dialog. The plot is too thin, to really care about how the characters feel. There's not enough of a challenge to engage the MI team or the audience. Except for maybe 2 minutes of Tom running through the streets of China, there's very little action. Of course, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful, as usual, but he can't save the film. If he bothers to make another 'episode', I hope there's less internal strife and more do-gooding for the world.",4,1,3,12 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not as good as the first film - depending on your age
","As a fan of Johnny Depp, and delighting in his character Captain Jack Sparrow, I refused to listen to review rumors. After having seen the film, I regrettably feel that this second edition is not as good as the first.The performances are fine, the special effects are wonderful. It's a 'very Disney' film - which isn't bad: I just don't think I should be allowed time to think about it while watching the film. There's not enough of the great Charm of Jack Sparrow ... the thing that was so endearing in the first movie.In the theatre, kids of all ages seemed to really enjoy the adventure. I felt that some of the sword fighting and other swashbuckling scenes were too long .. I grew bored and wanted them to end.This is, however, a big screen flick.",5,2,4,9 July 2006
