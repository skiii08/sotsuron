Ford v Ferrari," Just simple and maybe a feel good movie for non-thinkers.
","This is as simple as a kids Movie and the stereotype characters and simple-minded dialogues made me laugh. Womens (beside Ms. Miles) are completely missing. A lot of scenes are ungainly constructet (wheel nut, stopwatch, ...) or just boring. And why the hell Mr. Miles carries everywhere in the world everytime the same coffee pot? And beside all this to me the race scenes weren't really thrilling.",5,27,65,17 November 2019
The Irishman," Visual great. Not all the time boring, but ...
","Technically great with very good acting. But beside this was maybe an interesting political plot 30 years ago, today there is nothing left to conclude or learn about this. So the movie is like it looks - old. shaky old actors who should have been played by younger ones. its not bad that there is less action and more talks. But it is sad that there is no interesting side-plot or moralistic conslusion. Even the development of the characters are poor and barely present. While a period of 30 years? Its just what it is. An old, and slow one-dimensional (true) story. The relation between Frank and his daughter is told too simple and so it doesn't saved the movie. Have I overlooked a human core of the film? Except false pride or loyalty. A patriarchal film that is actually no longer needed today because there are already enough of them.",6,0,2,2 January 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," An Absolutely overrated Movie!!
","There is not much to say about TDKR, because after some days there is not much left in my movie-loving-mind. Not much except this: a disappointing villain, who is beaten in a fist-fight (!!!) and without any cool action which wasn't shown already in the trailer ... a batman who was once struggling about his gone love-of-a-lifetime Rachel but bangs now two girls in a row ... a main villain who suddenly plops out after bane is dead but acts just some minutes as head of the bad ... and a foreseeable average climax with an atomic bomb (how creative is that???). Where was the epic conclusion? where was Batmans inspiration to the people (not just Blake), were was Alfred??? TDKR is technically well done. But thats it. Don't be stupid and let cheat you by that! Not a bad movie. But not more.",5,31,54,1 November 2012
