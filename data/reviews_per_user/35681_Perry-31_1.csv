Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A True Fan w/ a True review
","The Phantom Menace was by far the most anticipated film of our lifetime, no argument there. Thats where the film critics and I for one can agree. But it ends there.To say it was not a good film is beyond me. You don't just watch the film and say it is lousy due to Jar Jar as an annoying character. Thats preposterous. He is obviously focused on the children, and so be it. As a child I loved C-3PO, who we all can now agree is pretty annoying as we've grown older. But it is comical, and necessary. Its called comedy relief.The action was so intense in the climax of the movie, the battle itself could stand alone and rate the movie as a top film. George Lucas took the withering Ben Kenobi, and the inflexible, un-entertaining Darth Vader sword fight to an exciting, fast paced, high action, intense battle. Not involving just swords, but any and every move and technique ever developed in any film. Don't forget, we are dealing with a fighting style of not just one particular technique, but a combination of every Kung-Fu, Kendo, Samurai, etc.. form of fighting, right down to just plain old punch in the face. The sword itself has meaning, especially as it is the most powerful weapon in the Star Wars universe.We finally get to see the Republic as it was, ruled by a controlling governing body, enforced by the most powerful beings  in the universe. We see the true power of the Jedi's in their prime, as well as evil at its highest and most potentially dangerous level. Darth Maul could pass as the Devil himself.This is the beginning to a great saga, all the questions we had of the first trilogy are answered, only to create even more curiosity and questions of the films to come. We see the Emperor and his quest to become ruler, and we can sense why Darth Vader comes of this innocent little boy, with the subtle foreshadowing within the film.Unfortunately, I do admit the special effects were both intense as well as over done, but it comes with the territory of trying to top the greatest trilogy in films. As for those who don't like the film, you either just don't know a good movie for your life, like to just copy an opinion from the so called 'experts', or just don't understand its complete depth. Although this may not be your fault, your missing a good flick. Go see it again, this time know who Senator Palpatine is, the references of the council in Star Wars, the actual true power of a real Jedi (not some boy who blew off training half way through, only to become the strongest Jedi of all), and watch as the explanation of a virgence and how even though he is evil, he truly is the chosen one, as we all know Darth Vader kills the Emperor in the final chapter.I recommend it for any action fan, as well as any Fan of the Sci-Fi genre, or anyone who just wants to be entertained. Its action packed, full of a thickening plot, which in the end only leaves a taste for more, and an anticipation of yet another mind blowing film. The classical scores are mixed perfectly to bring all the senses together into one big feast for the mind on film. Go see it and following along, and you wont be disappointed.",Null,0,0,27 October 1999
