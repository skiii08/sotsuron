Sucker Punch," awesome
","Watching Sucker Punch was like being sucker punched in the face with a fist full of awesome! I've read some of the negative reviews and in my opinion most of them are absolute garbage. First of all, when people say this movie makes no sense, it makes me think this site should test everyone's IQ before allowing them to review movies, because it made perfect sense. The visuals were stunning, the score/soundtrack was excellent, and the acting was superb. The story was rather simple, yet all the nay sayers believe the movie was trying to be more than it was. I don't believe this to be the case. It delivered a good story made possible by excellent directing. I left the theater thoroughly satisfied. If your looking for an awesome movie, don't listen to the negative reviews, see Sucker Punch!",9,7,14,28 March 2011
