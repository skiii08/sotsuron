50 First Dates," Not your typical Sandler
",If you're looking for a typical Adam Sandler gross out juvenile  schtick movie then skip this one.  50 First Dates shows the more mature and sweeter side of Adam that has not been spotted since his last pairing with Barrymore in The Wedding Singer.  They seem to have great chemistry here and I wouldn't mind seeing them paired up again in the future.  While the movie was very funny and heart-warming it also left me a little depressed.  I felt bad for the characters having to deal with her short term memory problem every day for the rest of their lives.  I thought the BoSox part was hilarious and I had to explain to my friend who isn't much of a baseball fan.,Null,0,0,12 May 2004
