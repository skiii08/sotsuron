Mission: Impossible III," what a surprise!
","blimey, i wasn't expecting that! This is actually a good film! I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this after nearly slitting my wrists from watching the first two (especially mi:2), but surprise surprise i loved it! i thought it was superbly paced, and felt like it had a good number of memorable scenes (a lot of action movies just seem to be 'over' before you can really think whats happened). They stuck simon pegg in there too, which is always a good idea. The fight scenes weren't cheesily shot like john woo's one and there were some great 'lost' like set piece shots - particularly during the chopper chase through the wind farm, loved it. Also a few little nods here and there to some french and Asian cinema were quite unexpected, but certainly put a wee smile on my face. Little touches like that really helped give this film some personality, which is what most big Hollywood action flicks desperately lack.",8,0,0,20 October 2006
