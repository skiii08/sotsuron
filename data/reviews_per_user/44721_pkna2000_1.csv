The Blair Witch Project," Blair B_i_t_c_h Project
","Finally we went to see Blair Bitch Project... that Heather girl is so annoying and they keep showing her wide butt on camera... like we want to see that. She just doesn't shut up. By 3/4 of the movie you're just waiting for these idiots to get killed because they're so annoying. And if it were real documentary, you'd totally root for the hairy armed horsefaced woman to go kill these stupid kids. It was such a relief to see them get knocked at the end... too bad the hairy armed troll didn't pick up the camera and film some gore.I can't believe there was so much hype for this movie. No special effects not worth big screen bucks... and what psycho horror!? Yeah, my psycho horror of having to see such a bad movie... totally, not worth it! A waste of $16... wait for it to arrive on video if you really want to see it.",Null,0,1,5 September 1999
