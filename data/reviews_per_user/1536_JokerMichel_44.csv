The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bad
","I said it many times before , I didn't like the whole twillight saga and this movie is no exception at all

The Expendables 2," This one is good
","The Expendables 2 is the best of the trilogy.I like the cast a lot but the plot is still weak and could be a lot better . I would like to see another sequel (Expendables 4) where they make a better plot and develop a better script, this would be nice to watch",6,0,0,15 May 2018

Suicide Squad," I want to suicide
","Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Jared Leto, Cara Delevigne , Scott Eastwood and many more good actors are in this movie 
But compared to the cast the movie is awful
DC tried to make a big campaign to promote the movie more than they tried to make it work
I had really high expectations , and I was very dissatisfied and disappointed 
Why ? (No spoilers)
First, they had a plot but they didn't develop it well , the script wasn't good and left a lot of plot holes 
Second, after what Heath Ledger did with the character « The Joker » DC have to work very hard to develop the character and give him an important role in the film, but they didn't, which made them loose a key element for the movie
Third, the principal villain. I didn't like the villain at all, boring , uninteresting , and not dark or creepy. If we look back to other DC villains like The Joker in The Dark Knight played by Heath Ledger or Bane in The Dark Knight Rises played by Tom Hardy , we see a big difference .Suicide Squad was awful , and I regret watching it. From now on, I will not watch any other DC movie anymore .",4,0,2,13 May 2018
Interstellar," Best sci-fi movie I have ever seen
","Christopher Nolan is mu favorite director. And what I like about him is that his movies are very deep and emotional Interstellar is a great movie built on a very complexe story . It has something special that other movies don't have like:
The background music made by Hans Zimmer 
The great visual effects 
Special cast 
And many more...
The script is very well written thanks to Jonathan Nolan . The development of the relationship between a father and his daughter makes the film even more intersting . It's full of suspense and mysteries Christopher Nolan proved himself once more and Interstellar is an achievement that marked the sci-fi movies categories",9,0,0,18 March 2018
