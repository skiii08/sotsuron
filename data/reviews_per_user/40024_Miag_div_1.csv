The Sound of Music," A journey into the musical world
","I luckily was brought up in a family which is quite broad minded and my parents inculcated the love of music in my mind at a very early age.The Sound Of Music has been an all time favorite film for me. I grew up listening to Do-re-mi and You are sixteen going on seventeen. It was simply great. The reason why we like this movie is basically because it is simple. The storyline , the script are all very ordinary and so they appeal to us.The music has become famous the world over. Why ? Definitely because it is melodious and the other reason is - Because it is that kind of music which appeals to all. Sound of Music is a story which deals with the life of Maria a woman to be made a nun. But the others discover that she is very much unlike them and so she is sent to become a governess to the seven children of an officer . Later it is shown how Maria changes the lives of the children who live a spartan life by teaching them to dance and sing and play . And along with that changes the life of their father by showing him that life is beautiful and lovely. They unknowingly fall for each other and get married . The further part deals with their journey - how they escape from the clutches of the Nazis and then live a quiet life , but a musical one, in the mountains. It indirectly teaches us something. Life is not just living and then dying , but doing something remarkable that will make you be remembered forever. And the love of Maria for music and nature also makes us come close to nature. Her understanding of children makes her seem to be a very beautiful person. And it shows us that children are not brats who do not know anything but if taught with patience can do wonders. The music of this film is still heard by all the world over.And in this genre too. The photography is wonderful. It fills me with wonder to see a movie which can make an impact on people's mind. This film is not just an ordinary one or a one which deals with some issue. It is special because it delivers many messages to us as I already told. A movie to be viewed by one and all !!!",9,2,9,15 October 2005
