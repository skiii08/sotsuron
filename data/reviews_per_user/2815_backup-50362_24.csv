Blade Runner 2049," It's a good watch if you have 3 hours and love terrible endings that make you feel like you wasted 'em
","A nice payoff after patiently sitting for 3 hours is having an ending where it makes you feel like things mattered. You expect 'it's gonna get better' moments but they don't happen. You expect the characters to say or do obvious things that would make sense but they don't.I like how all the reviewers rave about the 'hot chicks' in this movie when only the hologram girl was pretty. The hooker chick looked like a man and so did the overpowered robot woman. I'd rather stroke Jared Leto's beard every morning than wake up next to that smug chin-dimpled edgy face.Aside from this degenerate argument, the movie was way too long and slow. I can appreciate it if that's just how they envisioned it - lots of suspense and nothing. But it didn't always seem nescessary.But you know what I hate? Quiet mumbling for 20 minutes followed by obnoxiously loud music. And this movie has alot of that.The acting was great though, the futuristic concepts were fun, there's alot to like here. You just need to be extremely patient and not mind a bad plot meant for saddness, leading to an unsatisfying destination.",Null,2,8,20 July 2019
It," It far exceeded my expectations
","I've never seen the original as I wasn't alive when it aired and didn't expect to like this movie too much because it appeared a bit childish and unengaging.Boy how wrong I was. When I finally saw it I was stunned, at how great the child actors are, how engaging every scene is, and how fresh everything felt.There are many freaky and creative scary situations which I really liked. Even a little nod to Five Nights at Freddys I picked in one particular jumpscare sound. You'd think this movie will rehash some cliché scary spooks and have terrible child actors like any other movie, mixed with the typical Hollywood 'just gotta send a political message' garbage but no - this is the first film in years that I can recommend. It's 100% clean of Hollywood garbage.The only thing that threw me off is a smirk one of the kids seem to do out of character in one of the intense scenes. It happened for a fraction of a second but was enough to ruin the otherwise flawless pace and realistim of the movie.Obviously we have to mention the shockingly young actor who played the clown (my age) - he did such an amazing job at not being a cliché, I loved the performance. So much that I want to see more of it.Basically, best movie to come out in many years.",Null,3,9,19 September 2017
A Star Is Born," A Cliche Is Reborn
","As soon as I read the premise I thought to myself 'let me guess, he's gonna help her, she's gonna use him to succeed in life, yet he'll end up tragically'.I won't spoil whether or not my absolutely instant thought of what this movie will be like is true or not, but I'll tell you this - the movie sucks.It's been done to death, good acting though, but whoever wrote this dribble needs to run over to the rope store ASAP.",Null,3,9,27 January 2020
Coraline," Boring movie with really, really unlikable characters, bad for kids and adults alike
","Like others said, really dumb characters and boring overall. People are praising it merely for the visuals (which, aside from the character designs, aren't that great).Coraline has to be the most stupid, annoying, bratty, nonsensical character I've seen in a movie. She's constantly reacting ridiculously to insane situations. Was she meant to be low-key mentally challenged or something? Because otherwise she's just plain badly written. Very unlikable and constantly putting herself in danger because she's that stupid (and badly written).And again, overall very boring, with no redeeming qualities, and by all means - not for kids, not only for it's 'horror elements' but out of fear that such arrogantly dumb characters may influence your child during a crucial developmental period.",Null,0,18,19 August 2019
Spider-Man 2," Worst thing I've ever seen in my life
","I'm only 13 minutes in and I feel like I've entered the most crippling depression I've ever been in. The movie throws the most forced saddness for the sake of being depressing immediately, how is that a superhero movie? Spiderman is drooling over some unattractive girl and somehow despite having super powers can't use them to even get enough cash to pay his rent. Every random person is comically rude and it goes nowhere. Thank god James Franco is hilarious, trying to act and all. I love that guy. I don't think I've ever seen him in a good movie and this definitely solidifies that. Doc Oc stole the show.",Null,7,22,8 June 2019
Hot Fuzz," This is what you want from a comedy
","I'm 12 years late, watching it in 2019 but it aged so well, even today I can immediately consider it a favorite right after seeing it.First thing that striked me is how great the editing was, perfect little details are crammed into each scene, and scenes are fused with fast-paced, creative edits in the first half of the movie.The second half is mostly action, which was really rewarding to watch if not a bit too prolonged. But dang... This was overall amazing.The two main characters were really funny and different in a great way, imagine the buddy-buddy cop cliche except good and fun. Most of the practical humor was flawless, but the specifically british humor, as usual, didn't exactly make me laugh. But I was still smiling trough most of the movie which I can't say for any other movie ever.This is definitely a watch I can recommend to anyone, if you don't mind some excessive and out-of-place violence in a generally non-violent (but sweary) comedy, and a bit of not-very-funny-actually-kinda-depressing british humor, everything else in Hot Fuzz is flawlessly done.Absurd, funny, fresh and feel-good.Definitely watch this, it aged well and is so refreshingly actually funny and rewarding...",Null,2,6,27 June 2019
Spider-Man 3," As bad as the 2nd one
","Mary Jane is so insufferable, so annoying, self-centered and badly written. So is Harry.Peter is getting absolute hate and inconsideration from the entire town of NY, as in the second movie except slightly lessAs usual only the villain was kinda fun and interesting, and the guy from Portal 2.Real bad writing.",Null,11,20,11 June 2019
Ready Player One," Way too many cliches and product placement crammed in 2 hours
","I know this was made for 12 year olds but come on, throw in something original. Every character is a caricature - oh the guy who made the game is the most awkward weirdo ever because programmers, am I right? Oh here's the cute 'badass, tough' girl who's constantly rude to the main guy because that's hilarious and totally original, right? Yeah top gamers are totally females. Main guy is of course a clueless thirsty goofy kid because that's super original, right? No, it's a movie full of tired old cliches rehashed yet again, with nothing original to shine. If you've seen older movies like Gamer you probably don't even need to see this. It's been done countless times, it just now has a huge budget behind it and the most stereotypical, overdone characters and setting ever. It's all been done so many times.Of course the main 'badass tomboy' female character turns out to have a little Matrix crew operation and the main bad guy has a generic right-hand female always dressed in black with a black bangs haircut. In the second half you have a little ridiculously perfectly multicultured band of kids solving Scooby Doo mysteries. Atari is of course the console that represents the 'OG gaming times' because it's the only company that's dead and it's name is dirt cheap to license. Seriously I'm not making that up, you've seen all this in every movie ever. Everything is so cliche it's like it's satire.Forgot to add: the racing scene was stolen from Split Second, the programmer's in-game avatar is a stolen Graybeard from Skyrim... yet those games didn't get a dime or a reference unlike the countless other games popular with the pre-teens.Unless you're under 13 and you think Twitch has a future and Fortnite is a good game (both part of the product placement of course), you won't like this. It's long and bad, nothing special at all.",Null,2,7,16 August 2019
Suicide Squad," It's so terrible and female-pandering even the director admits he should've focused on the Joker
","In times when pandering to women exclusively is major networks' first amendment, a superhero movie featuring many superheroes oddly chose Harley Quinn (a female knock-off of The Joker - the original freak) to be the main character?Instead of focusing on the most beloved DC character - The Joker - he's barely in the movie. Along with that, the rest of the movie features annoyingly-portrayed, bland characters and muddy, mind-numbing storyline. Only the Mexican fire guy was like-able and realistic as a personality with no fake or overblown pandering traits.They won't learn from their mistakes either, just going harder at it, they're planning 'an all female- superhero DC movie' next as if this wasn't failure enough. The only reason it was successful is because the IP's are strong and people will watch anything with The Joker in it, even if portrayed badly.Obviously no one will top Ledger's Joker but Leto tried and did pretty well, it seems like he really pushed himself and cared about this (as he should have, he knows everyone has high expectations for this character and people will be critical), his efforts however completely went to waste as a generic 'freaky thinks-she's-so-sexy female Joker character' was what they focused on - yes, a bad Harley Quinn that is.She was played bad and bland, as any female-pandering self-entitled female character in any movie is portrayed exactly like this. No original traits or like-ability.And again, DC won't learn from their mistakes - they'll keep trying to push female characters because 'muh pandering and muh female empowerment' and producing disappointing movies until the whole DC movie universe is completely destroyed trough SJW pandering, just like their comics.What a time we live in. I think I'll just re-watch The Dark Knight.Don't reward the next trash they release with your money, learn your lesson from this one and let them fail by simply not paying to watch the next one in movie theaters. It'll be available on-demand for much cheaper soon afterwards anyways.",Null,3,9,16 August 2016
Suicide Squad," Such a freaking pandering cringefest
","After watching the new Joker I'm on a roll going trough older movies and this was as bad a watch now as it was in 2016...There's so much Harley Quinn worshipping from the writers it's insane. We get it, she's 'hot', stop making all the guys turn around and look at her ass in every scene after she says a cringy line and walks away, ass in camera.But the worst part is how she was explained to the audience as 'crazier, better, braver, *any compliments* than the freaking Joker'. Did you think female pandering to this degree will make this movie magically good? Cause it sucks.I don't know where to start with Jared's Joker, but I seriously believe he was just written so badly, and designed as such a laughable pimp that no actor could have made this into a good Joker.Just an overall trainwreck.",Null,1,3,8 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A friend of mine said he couldn't finish it and walked out of the cinema...
","I figured he's crazy, till I watched it. I had to fast forward a lot... and I mean most of it. The ending had a pretty cool scene but everything else was either targeted at people who live in Hollywood (actors, etc) who REALLY care about the details, or old people who have the patience to sit trough boring, long, long shots of someone driving and nothing happening.This really isn't meant for younger viewers like me or anyone who couldn't care less about Hollywood. Seems to be for past and present Hollywood actors and showmen in general. It's moving as slow as movies did in the 80's back when people had the time and attention span to watch absolutely nothing happening for 3 hours, but it's a 2019 movie. Small tweaks could've made this more inclusive.I can't recommend this to your average viewer simply because you won't finish watching it, the only payoff is the film's climax which isn't that long or rewarding either. If Tarantino still thinks his 1992 style can work in 2019 and beyond - I'm afraid he should be prepared for only his circle of Hollywood yes men to watch his movies.",Null,2,8,19 February 2020
Gone Girl," It's realistic until the ending.
","But I assume we were going for a dark ending no matter what.
This movie shows a completely real part of our world that most movies and media in general are not showing or talking about. It's definitely a must watch, if you're intelligent enough to be able to draw conclusions from it's stronger aspects.",Null,0,3,7 October 2019
Grudge Match," It had it's moments, but sooo much boring filler...
","It had a few creative scenarios at first, but got boring real fast. Are we supposed to buy De Nero as a tough guy? Stallone definitely is still one, but De Nero never was, especially now at age 200.It was cool seeing Joey Diaz (who could kick De Niro's ass anytime) and Kevin Hart had a few funny lines, in between the most generic, overused 'white people this and that' comments.But overall it was a 2 hour slog fest that goes nowhere for most of that long time. There's so much boring filler and low tier romantic drama... Boxing fans might find some value in this but comedy fans and general movie watchers - don't expect much.",Null,0,3,24 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Great visuals, music and humor; terrible pandering and agendas.
","So we've got generally charming, hot and funny guy leads. Of course.Oooh the female lead though... she's always grumpy and a generic badass character with no comedic elements to her because that would be sexist, no, she's only to be glorified and portrayed as a badass while the much stronger guys are thrashed around by enemies and ridiculed by the script.What a pandering sh-t show. Whether this was the writers or the directors - they really shouldn't be allowed to ruin yet another promising movie with their insecurities and agendas.",Null,2,7,5 October 2018
Reservoir Dogs," Doesn't hold up
","Much like Pulp Fiction, this is another mess of a boring movie that doesn't hold up, but I'm sure was fascinating at the time because it was edgy and people weren't used to edginess.From mundane, prolonged, unrelated-to-the-plot conversations about Madonna songs and white knighting about waitress tipping, trough other drawn out, slow, illogical conversations happening in the two or three sets this movie was filmed on... it's just not interesting, I had to skip trough it. And the ending was very predictable, including what I guess was supposed to be a plot twist.Mostly fantastic actors and acting though.
Tarantino's made alot of fun, more recent movies, but his chaotic, sometimes cringy style of trying really hard to be edgy still shines occasionally. It kind of works now that he has the budget to go big on props, sets, effects, etc. But going back to his old movies, I don't like any of them. But I see small glimpses of what probably made them fascinating back in the early 90's.By the way, I don't think a small wooden door of a warehouse that's right next to people's houses and evidently children's parks (judging by the ambient sounds used) is soundproof enough to block all the gunshots and screaming coming from the inside.",Null,1,11,31 July 2019
Beauty and the Beast," The 'beast' isn't beastly and the 'beauty' isn't beautiful
","Chewbacca meets boy-looking girl and stuff happens. It's bad.
Watch the original cartoon if you'd like to be moved by something amazing.
This is just one of those worthless, useless, SJW-y Disney reboots nobody asked for, and it's as bad as everything else Disney's shoved out in recent years.",Null,2,9,17 May 2019
Pulp Fiction," Why the high rating? What am I missing here?
","As someone who first watched it in 2017, I don't see why this is in the top movies list, and that first part of the sentence might be the reason why.This movie's formula: ridiculous early 90's clothing, lots of foot fetish undertones, coked up dumb sluts who'd shove anything up their nose like toddlers, and men being killed in pointlessly excessive ways. Trying to glorify cliché black gang 'culture' and mafioso themes. Weird, occasionally charming but unfitting jokes. Smoking in almost every scene. Insanely long intro sequence. Just as pointlessly long and non-engaging scenes that offer no substance, nothing to get you interested in what they're talking about, just casual chatter stretched over 2,5 hours. I couldn't finish watching it.My only guess is that some parts of the movie were considered 'badass' at the time, it's 23 years old after all, which is why people are so looking at it trough nostalgia glasses. But it definitely doesn't hold up. And my movie expectations are already as low as ever, since nowadays most movies are utter crap. Some of Tarantino's more recent movies at least had some things going for them - gore, humor, cheesiness so cringy that it kind of makes you like it. But this one - doesn't hold up.None of the characters, except maybe John Travolta's are likable or interesting. There was nothing to keep me watching this. As soon as it switched to Bruice Willis' storyline I had to check out. That was just like watching a boring couple trough a hidden camera having a normal day. Wasn't this supposed to be a crime/drama movie? The 'interesting part' never seems to begin. The acting was pretty corny and unbelievable as well.Overall feels like a low-budget 'avant garde' movie shot as a school project, but I know it's far from that. That's just how it looks and feels like.I wanted to like it, but it just can't happen. I thoroughly enjoyed movies from as far as 60 years ago, so age can't excuse it, it was just too focused on that time frame and those cheesy, bland topic points. I don't blame Tarantino, it was one of his early movies, I'm just spellbound at how this movie is so highly rated.People seem to look too deeply for meaning where there is none. And the nostalgia glasses, take them off, it's been 23 years.",Null,14,29,16 January 2017
Joker," Read carefully.
","I can see how a privileged normie will see this and think 'oh no, this will inspire the lower, unprivileged class to be violent towards us' but if you have a few brain cells to scrape together, as well as some empathy you can totally understand what this was about - and it ain't that.A sweet, though mentally struggling, mentally abused man trying to be a light in the darkness of society is only getting punished for it until he's unwillingly pushed into things he would never possibly want to do, such as cause harm.An invisible man becomes visible. There's plenty of us who are invisible, and plenty of you who have your brainless followers and think you're the center of the universe. Even if you're not that famous you're still arrogant enough to consider yourself special because you're in Hollywood. How could you possibly understand this movie?This movie was perfectly timed in an age where mainstream media and Hollywood celebrities who smell their own far7s all day and virtue signal on Twitter while knowing nothing about life outside of a mansion - daily demonize what they view as lower class, and inexplicably, men in general. Especially emotionally fragile men like Joker.
So I see why some of the same mainstream media grasped for straws in order to twist this masterpiece into one of their little 'controversies' in order to deter the same people they hate from watching a movie, finally, one movie, they could possibly relate to - because the struggle to survive and be kind while being deemed a low class freak is portrayed scary realistic.",Null,7,16,12 December 2019
It Chapter Two," Not perfect but still great in many ways, except writing
","Right off the bat I'll say that some of the comic relief was off-place and terrible. Very few jokes landed. Most of the movie was dead air, reminiscing and 'preparing' but really - nothing happened. This movie should've been an hour shorter. The script featured a whole lot of mess that we could've gone without. And the ending was cheesy and preachy. Also, was it really appropriate to have a guy dramatically cry for his just-died friend yet another guy and a girl decide to make out 2 seconds later just because 3 hours wasn't enough for you to space things out a bit? That was a baffling choice. If my friend just died dramatically and another friend was crumbling in tears the last thing on my mind would be making out in front of him with some chick who can't decide who she likes.BUT - all that doesn't mean the music, the occasionally hilarious yet still good CGI, the acting, the emotional moments weren't great, because they were. I appreciated all of this a lot. Bill Hader made me shed a tear! He was that good. Bill Something - the man who plays the clown - obviously way too young for this role when he's playing against people in their 40s and 50s. Even with an old man wig he was still too youthful. Not to say he didn't do a fantastic Pennywise again - he did. Just... his youthful face was less of an issue when he was scaring younger kids. Now he's scaring people over twice his age and even with the makeup you can tell he's much younger.It's so flawed yet so strong in many ways. Confused in it's writing - much like this review. But they both made their points. Definitely still a really fantastic movie, even with it's problems it's far beyond what else is there to watch.",Null,1,3,18 February 2020
The Secret Life of Pets," Predictable, badly written, uninspired
","Even the voice acting was lazy, Kevin Hart was great but most of the other actors clearly didn't put much effort into this. But the writers put even less.The art style is terrible, every human and animal looks awful. Clearly someone talented did it, who could've done better but I suppose someone gave them sketches of those terrible designs to model and animate and they had to. Just skinny-limbed, big-headed freaky freaks.Again though, the writing is the worst. Everything is predictable, every character changes personality instantly when convenient, which is the main reason why no one cares about such characters or cheap movies like that.<ul><li>'Hey, we need a movie idea!'</li><li>'Pets that can talk.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Boring and all over the place
","Not much more to say than this. Also I don't know what's people's problem with Affleck playing Batman, it's not like the guy who played Batman in the Nolan movies set the bar high.I don't usually watch Batman movies without a Joker but this was recommended by a friend and was truly disappointing so I couldn't even watch all of it really. Annoying generic self-entitled female characters, bland, predictable male characters, mediocre acting, story all over the place making no sense, and worst of all - boring and non-engaging...Aside from Batman (somewhat) and Lex Luthor, all of the main characters were bland and forgettable. Stick to the Nolan movies, at least they had good characters.Jesse Eisenberg did a great job and I'm actually looking into other movies with him, he seems like a good, memorable actor who almost managed to make this utterly boring movie fresh for a few seconds with his presence.Overall, what a terrible last few years for DC, they really couldn't sink any lower, could they? Oh wait, of course, an obligatory Wondar Woman movie is coming out. And how could we forget the 'oh so amazing' Suicide Squat train wreck, which was also pandering by making Harley Quinn the main character... Pandering sure goes a long way.

","Yaay, girls screeching at men, 'tough guys' beating up rude men but giving obnoxious women a pass, double-standards all over, and of course - hippies 'haha so funny' because it's the 70's, right?No, it's garbage, and a waste of time. The main two actors did make a decent duo, and the non-Crowe one is a good comedic actor, probably the only good thing in this movie.But overall it was a waste of time, the plot was unengaging and only some of the slapstick humor worked. Most of the movie was just frustrating double-standards at play and boring Crowe talking with his fantastic emotional range of a saltshaker.And don't forget, hurting men is funny! But women get a pass even when they shoot at you. And comedy is dead - that's the lesson of this movie.",Null,3,9,4 July 2018
Warcraft," A visually stunning, but plot line-wise a bit disappointing movie, worth a watch
","I just watched it in IMAX 3D and was continuously amazed at the visuals and grand scenes this movie has to offer, superb sound and good acting as well. I highly recommend this movie just for that, it's a visual marvel, and, as someone who's never played the game, I didn't feel too lost on what was happening, which was good. I was correct to give it a chance.However it's filled with plot holes and it ends with one that's massively disappointing, nearly ruined the whole movie for me; for inexplicable reasons, a certain someone told someone else to do something unreasonable and drastic for no reason whatsoever. And even more disappointingly - they did. This is a case where in attempt to lure the viewer in suspense for the next movie the writer/s instead ruined the ending of this one, and killed any positive feelings I had for certain characters, cheaply. I was enjoying myself trough most of the movie, but after that ending, I didn't feel good as we left the cinema. I spoke with my friends who saw it with me - nobody liked the ending and everybody felt cheated as an otherwise good movie suddenly stopped making sense near the end for the sake of plot twists and a 'to be continued' moment.Not happy with the cheap ending 'twist' at all, but I still recommend watching this movie for what it has to offer visually.",Null,2,6,20 June 2016
