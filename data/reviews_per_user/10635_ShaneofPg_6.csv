Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nowhere near as good as episodes 4,5 and 6!
",I was disappointed with the Phantom Menace-the story was boring and some of the acting was as wooden as David Hasselhoff in Knight Rider. Jar-Jar Binks was a pathetic character and Jake Lloyd who played young Anakin was pretentious. It lacked the flair of the other movies especially The Empire Strikes Back. Darth Maul was cool but he had too small a part in it. Attack of The Clones had better be an improvement on this disappointing long awaited prequel.,7,0,1,16 May 2002
Blade," Blade kicks Vampires asses Big Time!
","I love this movie. I saw it on video first and it was one of the reasons I decide to buy a DVD player. Wesley Snipes was brilliant as Blade and the fight scenes are brilliant, especially in the Bloodbath Rave in the abbatoir. Stephen Dorff was great as 'Frost' too. Sadly my copy of Blade on DVD was stolen recently so I have to go and buy a new one. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy/action movies.",10,1,3,8 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Much better than The Phantom Menace!!
","When I first went to see Attack of The Clones there was a power cut just were Jango Fett killed the assassin who he had hired to kill Amidala. I was very disappointed so I went to see it again while on holiday in Latvia. It was a much better than Episode 1, especially because the extremely annoying Jar-Jar Binks was only in it for a minute. The acting was the usual wooden standard of the series although Samuel L.Jackson was good. The story was better also, but I was disappointed that Jango Fett was killed off too easily just like Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace. This movie was more in keeping with Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back, which is still my favourite of the series so far. All in all a vast improvement on episode 1.",Null,0,1,30 June 2002
Aliens," Aliens is one of the best sequels ever made!
","Aliens is a brilliant movie and I have watched it dozens of times. I have all four Alien Movies on DVD but Aliens is my favourite. It is really well directed and acted. I Love the dropship and the APC and all the weaponry, such as the pulse rifles and smartguns. The atmosphere is so tense when Ripley and the Marines first go in to the complex on LV426/Acheron. I am a fan of James Cameron movies including the Terminator movies, but Aliens is my favourite and I will never get tired of watching it, it has been one of my favourite movies since its release in 1986. I love this Movie!!",10,1,3,11 May 2002
Dirty Dancing," One of the worst Movies of the 80's!
","Dirty Dancing is in my opinion a dreadful, cheesy movie. I disliked it the first time I saw it and my opinion of it has not changed since then! It is a badly directed and produced film and far to sickly sweet. It is an awful movie which for some strange reason was very popular despite its awfulness. Even the song 'The Time of Our Lives' is dreadful, Middle Of the Road bland 80's pop-bad music for a very bad film! If you have any taste whatsoever DO NOT watch this movie!",1,27,79,14 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars-one of the best movies ever made!
",I was seven years old when I went to see Star Wars in the cinema with my brother. I was totally amazed by it and it will always be an exciting memory to me. I grew up watching TV programmes like Dr.Who and which were very cheaply made so I could not believe my eyes when I saw Star Wars. I love this movie and I am a Star Wars fan-though not a fanatic one! Thank You George Lucas for making me so excited when I was seven! I am 32 now and still love this film! May The Force Be With You!!,9,0,0,11 May 2002
