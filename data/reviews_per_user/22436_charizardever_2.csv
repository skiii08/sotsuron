Howl's Moving Castle," Howl's Moving Castle is the best
","I absolutely this movie for it's creative and art style. I have loved this movie every since I was 11 years old. I just love how Sophie starts out as a shy girl who make hats and then turns into this loving brave character by the end because of Howl. As I watch the movie, Miyazaki wanted to make Howl this mysterous character so that you want to learn more about him just Sophie.",10,1,1,29 September 2017
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Why I love 101 dalmatians
","At a young age, I love watching it because of the dogs. Now I love it for it being masterpiece. The movie is about a dalmatian named Pongo who wants to find a partner for this owner or how Pongo calls him 'his pet'. After looking at people walking their dogs, he sees the perfect on, a woman walking her dalmatian. After Pongo sees them walking into the park, he drags his owner out there and gets them to meet and fall in love. As the owners fall in love, so do the dalmatians. After the owners Roger and Anita get married, Pongo and Perdy have puppies and realize that someone wants their puppies for a fur coat. My favorite thing about this movie was Pongo himself. I really enjoyed that because of him, he got his owner a life. Also loved brave he and Perdy are for finding their kids and even bringing back about 84 more puppies to keep them safe. I love this movie and I love the old style of animation. I grew up with this movie and still love it to this day.",10,4,4,21 November 2017
