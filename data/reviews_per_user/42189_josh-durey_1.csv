United 93," BS Propaganda
","This movie only serves to instill a sense of nationalism, and it is based on PURE FICTION!!! The passengers of Flight 93 were ultimately evacuated from the plane once it had landed in Cleveland, and then herded into a NASA research facility. Why? Who knows? Probably to be used for government experiments or something.Don't watch this piece of mindless drivel (although if you're conservative or love country music you probably already have). Instead, watch 'Loose Change 2nd Edition' for the TRUTH about what happened on that black mark in our government's history.Kinda reminds me of when Nero set Rome on fire so he could build himself a palace. He played the harp while he watched it burn. But he didn't stand to make billions of dollars.",1,29,81,29 April 2006
