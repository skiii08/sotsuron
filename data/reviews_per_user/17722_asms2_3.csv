First Man," Dull
","I usually love anything that has to do with space or the Moon Landings. But this movie was paced very slow, and I didn't feel connected to any of the characters. I'm not sure if I can pin point the exact issue, but I felt that the portrayal of Armstrong fell flat.I did learn some interesting information through this film (didn't realize that the astronauts had to be quarantined for weeks after landing). So I enjoyed the informational element. But overall, this didn't connect with me on an emotional level, which was surprising considering the subject matter.",3,2,5,22 March 2019
The Disaster Artist," Watched it twice in theaters
","I had never heard of the movie 'The Room' before seeing this film. So I wasn't sure what I was getting into. But I found myself captivated by this movie. It presents relatable themes set against a fascinating backdrop...a movie set.At its heart, this is a film about friendships and chasing after the American Dream. The fact that this is based on a true story just elevates the impact. It's a crazy story, but a fun one. Well done!",10,1,2,22 March 2019
X-Men: First Class," Generic / Dull
","This movie is missing something to make me care.
There isn't anything original, or interesting in the plot. And the characters felt flat.",3,0,1,2 July 2020
