Blade Runner 2049," worth the 35 year wait.
","Bladerunner 2049 is a stunning sequel made by a director who is clearly a fan of the original and who has a bigger budget to expand the Bladerunner universe. The movie does go a little off at a tangent 2/3 in but quickly pulls it back on track.For me questions that were raised by Bladerunner were re-enforced in this and only confirmed my thoughts on what and who Deckard is. There are nice and clever cameos by Edward James Olmos and Sean Young.For me I still prefer Bladerunner over 2049 but 2049 is a worthy sequel and does need multiple watches to take it all in as dialogue does drop off a tad but this is a minor irritation and you will find yourself waiting and waiting for Deckard to appear.To those who hate the film I guess this is because they are part of the Rabid fanbois who for 35 years have been wrong about Deckard and still can't accept the glaring obvious nature of what he is. Their score and reviews reflect this out. For some this movie is far too intelligent for them, I liked the misdirection and this sequel nails home what most of us felt about Bladerunner from the release of the Final Cut version",8,3,11,6 October 2017
Lucky Number Slevin," Nicely tied together
","Although this type of movie has been done before, Lucky Number Slevin, actually takes the time at the end to quickly tie and summarise all the loose ends, just in case you didn't yourself.All the characters expect Slevin have minor parts in this movie but when they do appear on screen their time is used well and doesn't reveal the twist at the end. OK so its another Bruce Willis Movie with a twist so what, the surprise is well worth it.A little confusing at the start with what seems to random strangers meeting in an airport departure lounge quickly leads on to a cleverly crafted story. The movie has also in parts so very amusing comedic moments with notable performances from the 'Boss's' and the 'Rabbi's' henchmen.",9,1,2,1 July 2007
It," Not scary at all
","Now I have not seen the first incarnation of this film as IT (no pun intended) has never appealed to me. I had a couple of hours to kill and this was the only film I could get to see in the time frame. The problem I had with IT was that the scares were expected and of no surprise, every there was a bang or something was drop or a sudden noise this was a queue card for the next scare. Halfway through the movie I even fell asleep and hoped near the final act for IT to just end.",4,4,10,15 September 2017
Knives Out," Move over hercule poirot
",Daniel Craig steels the screen in this witty Whodunnit that most likely the critics will hate but what do they know.Daniel plays this Quirky Detective Benoit Blanc with what I would say is to applomb with a deep Southern accent who is assisting the local law enforcement in the investigation of the murder of a well known mystery writer. With a supporting cast of Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson it will keep you guessing till the end if the police or Blanc will get to bottom of their joint investigation.Me thinks if this is successful then it's a green light to see Daniel as Detectivie Benoit Blanc again!,9,5,22,27 November 2019
Terminator Salvation," Not bad for a Music Video Producer
","Now some of the critics are slating this, why ? well I think its because they don't like the following.. 1.The Director/Producer has a silly name 2.McG comes from a background making Music Videos so he shouldn't be making movies.Well get over it and comment on the film on its own merits.The premise of this movie is to bring John Conner and his father together in one place so they can be terminated together this ensures that Kyle cannot travel back in time nor can john send him back. OK so the old Time Parodox is 'well we will kill Kyle and then John won't exist' but John does exist in the future so the machines need to make sure they kill two birds with one stone. The machines do this by getting an infiltrator which is an Human Robot hybrid, who in a previous life was executed on death row and donated his body to Cyberdyne, step in Marcus. Marcus thinks he's human and acts human in every way expect his virtually indestructible. He wakes up in the future confused and disorientated and makes his way to the city where he meets and befriends Kyle Reese, who in turn decide to find John Conner after hearing his radio Broadcast.The action sequences in the movie are in the style of Mad Max and Die Hard movies, and exciting to watch. The Terminators themselves are easy to dispatch as they are early pre T800 models. There are things wrong with the film i.e John's wife's unexplained pregnancy and a bit of dodgy camera work.Nods to the previous movies in the Franchise are a plenty including using the soundtrack from T2 and I'm sure that a nod to the Great Escape got in there as well on more than one occasion.As for the Acting I've never seen an Bale film before so I can't judge his performance, but I think the strong parts in it were Marcus and Kyle.As for Arnie fans, he pops up in Cgi and is convincing we know its CGI but it still works.",6,2,3,18 June 2009
Zodiac," Much better than Summer of Sam..But could do better
","As in my summary this movie is better than 'Summer of Sam' which is completely disengaging and uninformative, historical works need to make sense which Zodiac does. Anyway the beauty of this movie is that it deals with the known facts about the Zodiac Killer and does not put its own interpretation or conclusions, it lets you decide.The movie is well shot and does a good job of capturing the time period covered, you can clearly see the strain of investigating the murders on the performance Jake Gyllenhaal, ('Robert Graysmith'), as it consumes him and has an effect on his personal life. On the Negative side the sound and dialogue is hard to follow at times and there are too many throw away remarks,especially from the Character 'Inspector David Toschi', mumbling through the first 3/4's of the film, only speaking clearly at its conclusion, this in my opinion should have been addressed in post production. The supporting cast play there parts well, all giving a commendable performance without and wooden acting.Finally however this movie merits it 7/10..",7,0,1,11 July 2008
BlacKkKlansman," A bit jumpy in parts
","Whilst gripped by this movie at the start especially where Ron Stallworth goes undercover I genuinely felt for the struggle that the black people were facing at that time and indeed now. Midway through the movie I did find myself trying to stay engaged but nodding off, characters were shoehorned in and not really explained or fleshed and the insertion of blaxploitation movie references were not really required. All in all I think BlackkKlansman is more of a statement on Trumps America today instead of trying to tell a fascinating but true story. The move also was supposed to have an edge of humour to it, but sadly it was lost on me for such a serious subject matter, Spike Lee's Jungle Fever hits the mark better",6,1,4,30 August 2018
Rush," Wow I don't watch F1
","So watching this as a neutral I was simply blown away by how good a genre film this is better than Senna to say. Beautifully shot and in good old 2D is I can't say its 100% true to real life events but boy its sure seems like it to me. Unusually its shot from both points of view that been Hunt and Lauda as each are given equal screen time. The Two lead actors are well cast and convincing even the makeup for Lauda's facial injuries are near perfect, it just goes to show that when Ron Howard when he's on top of his game what he can give to the screen.Very little archive footage is used and this is at the end of the film which follows up life after the 1976 championships. The costumes, hair styles and mannerism's of the time from what I remember of the 70's are spot on. 10/10",10,13,22,3 October 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Brilliant
","To date this has to be Bradley Coopers finest work, it just goes to show he can act given a fine script such as this. Silver linings play book is a clever movie where by the camera work is both focused and random all of which appears to be deliberate. The dialogue and script as well is also somewhat random in parts, but this too I felt was deliberate as we are watching a movie about people who have issues on differing levels and it shows that nobody is without their quirks and it gives the sense that you are also in that world to. As the trick here is that is only slightly hinted at what the full gravity of why Pat(Bradley) was in an institution.I don't normally do 'Romance' but this movie is an exceptional example on how not to do just slush but have a well crafted movie on top. Both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are perfectly cast and steal the screen and Robert De Niro's performance is also brilliant and not his usual hard man role.",10,0,2,2 October 2013
Aladdin," A good attempt at a live action film
",Now Will smith has big boots to fill considering that Robin Williams practically freestyled his performance in the animated version of Aladdin. A slow start that needs a little trim but the movie does get very engaging when Will's Genie is released from the lamp.,7,2,2,13 March 2020
Children of Men," Many Many Layers
","This is one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen, as the movie is stacked in layer upon layer of Political, Religious, social and ethical messages.Set in the not too distant future the world has a fertility crisis,the story centers on England where a Fascist regime has its population under government control.The government achieve this (albeit with resistance) by a policy which is strict on asylum seekers and non British citizens is brutal slightly hinting of the way the Jews where treated. Citzens of this future are also encouraged not only to reproduce as society is infertile but also encouraged to euthanase themselves by obtaining an advertised suicide kit. Clive Owen (Theo)is a regular 9 to 5 guy, once was a freedom fighter has since given up and joined the rest of the conforming society, mainly prompted by the Death of his own child. However his past resurfaces when he is abducted by the mother of his dead Son Julian (Julianne Moore).Why ? Juilian is protecting a young Woman called Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) who is special as she is first Woman to be pregnant in 18 years. As forces within Julian's movement want the child for their own Political ends, Julian has made plans to get both Kee and the unborn child to safety from here own organisation, and the government who will not allow the first child to be born in 18 years to come from an Asylum Seeker.Theo is the only person Julian can trust and with the task of getting Kee and the unborn child to an organisation called the Human project and he has the connections to help to do this.On the Journey to safety, Kee escorted to her destination with Theo who is not the unborn's father gives birth to a Son.So the tone of the movie could be that this child may be the second coming of Christ but doesn't explore that in too much detail but it is referenced several times,through remarks an characters names (Theo=God in Greek)what the child represents though is Hope to the desperate situation the world has come to.Cimematically this movie is breathtaking, the camera work and the general atmosphere and breaking down of society is awesome. The sense when kee gives birth and the resulting shots of they baby are brilliantly scripted and shot.The ending too bucks the traditional happy white picket fence ending too, leaving you to decide what happens next.Its no doubt about it, this will be a classic movie, just like Bladerunner and the Shawshank redemption.",10,4,9,26 September 2006
The Green Mile," Beautiful tearjerker of a movie and a timeless classic
","I scored this 9/10 because in parts the dialogue was a little difficult to understand, but saying that this movie is up there with Shawshank, it's such a tearjerker that grabs you by the soul and ruffles you around. Brilliant performances by all and makes you search your conscience on how black people would have been treated.",9,0,1,13 March 2020
Murder on the Orient Express," I liked this remake even more than the 1974 version
",Murder on the Orient Express is an old favourite of mine so I was intrigued to see how they would do this remake. Well I loved it simply because it was given more gravitas and more dramatic experience. While you have to get over the 'elephant in the room' i.e the 'mustache' this version of the film differs enough to maintain your interest. With a good supporting cast you find once you have seen something before you pay more attention to the detail. The film for me was more fleshed out where as the 1974 version cuts to the chase more quickly this version is far superior,8,3,9,6 December 2017
WALL·E," Pixar do it again.
","They gave us Monsters Inc, and now for something completely opposite, as the trick here is most of the movie has no Dialogue, so Pixar have worked much harder, and delivered.The visual gags and expressions from Walle and EVE the two principle characters are brilliantly executed , as the as the audience themselves try to figure them out as well as there is negligible dialogue between the two robots. For instance EVE is busily scanning objects on the deserted earth, but what wonders and Walle and the audience is she looking for then ? It clicks when Walle gives her a Plant that he has found when cleaning up the junk. Bingo She's looking for signs of life, where in return Walle is looking for a Companion.So there's something for the kids and the adults as the central message to the movie, which is summed up nicely by a sign on the moon, advertising an Shopping Mall. Humanity has become lazy, and has ruined the earth so they can no longer live there, leaving the mess to Walle(s) to clean up. Trouble is that the mess is so bad that the Humans who have left Earth over 700 years ago cannot go back. So they wait in space on an large spaceship living a sedentary life, where everything is done for them from the comfort of there arm chairs, they use them to travel eat and sleep, to change their clothes at a touch of a button taking no exercise, which in turn causes their bones to disappear. Instead the robots including EVE do their work for them even taking over the decision making, not to return to earth when EVE returns with the proof that earth can support life.But after a battle with the Spaceships computer, man is now in charge of his own destiny and returns to earth with Walle to start anew.",10,1,3,19 July 2008
1408," Nothing like the 'Bates Motel'
","As Scary movies go this one is OK, but after the first jump out of your seat moment i.e the clock radio switching itself on and playing the spooky Carpenters Song , you sit there expect the other jump out your seat moments which is a shame.On the Positive side, this movie does make good use of the one location scenario like cube, and story wise 1408 does have a point to it i.e the backstory with regard to his Daughter.On the negative is that John Cusacks character does escape the room in the Theatrical version, which misses the point that the room is 1. To Quote Samuel L Jacksons character a 'Its a F**K**G Evil Room' 2. 59 People have not survived it.Pace wise the movie moves along nicely, and due to its one location nature its unfortunate that this makes Mr Jacksons part as Hotel manager small.However its definitely worth a watch.",8,0,0,18 September 2007
Mother!," Awful Awful kind of Rosemary's baby rip off
","This movie is not only tedious but it's full of it's own pretentiousness. My title alludes to a Rosemary's baby rip off which that is my opinion as it seems cultish where as those so called house invaders are coming to see their god and his child, which unlike Rosemary's baby is ultimately sacrificed. Is mother character supposed to be a version of the Virgin Mary. Too many metaphors are abound in what my view is a car crash of a movie.",4,0,1,16 April 2019
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig Succeeds where Dalton Failed.
","Daniel Craig is Bond, James Bond. OK this is Daniels first outing as Bond and he has given the role something completely different to what has gone before, Dalton tried this by added a darkness and edge, but in my opinion his films are not worth another watch.1.The cheesy double double entendres have gone. 2.The Gadgets have been dispensed with, along with Q. 3.The Violence is realistic, Bond gets battered, bruised, blooded and tortured. 4.The Mega rich super villain has been dispensed with, we now have a regular guy who just tries to manipulate the stock market to allow him a multimillion by in to a high stakes poker game.Taken from the mold of the Bourne Films, Casino Royale has a full on Hardcore action sequences, builds a back story as to how Bond gets his 00 status and why he treats women as disposable items.Daniel Craig has Beefed up and smolders on screen, with just his look in certain scenes he doesn't have to say a word, his face tells the cinema goer what he thinks and feels. The fight and action scenes are more realistic no longer does James Bond, emerge from a scrape freshly tailored without a hair out of place, just watch in awe when Bond steamroller's through a plaster board wall.The only criticisms I have are1.Heavy product placement 2.the film is 20 minutes too long.",9,0,1,7 December 2006
Get Him to the Greek," Wooden
","Get him to the Greek I felt got funny towards the end an certainly picked up with the Jeffery Taking and stroking the fur walls scene. Till that point it was Wooden the lead 'Jonah Hill' just seemed out of place and not fit in this film. He seemed to have the same vacant expression all the time on camera, and Russell Brand we know how comedic he can be yet he seemed to be rambling at times was this the script or was it improv ?.Too many bit characters as well that didn't add to the story OK they were part of it but hardly used i.e 'Daphne Binks' and Puff Daddy himself, Jonathan Snow 'Aldous Snow' Father I could list more. It was like they were filming and remember to include them in Post production. Who was the Big African Guy ? Was he Puffs minder he had Dialogue that seemed to serve no purpose. Now I have given this movie 5 stars because I did laugh in parts but it did seem like cobbled gags together from a Sketch show.",5,5,13,4 July 2010
Annihilation," Straight in to the stream
","I saw this on Netflix i.e the streaming service and boy am i glad that i didn't goto my local cinema to see this poor poor film. Visuals good, plot poor absolute nonsense so bad i couldn't watch it in one sitting. I understood the premise it's just such a dull and tedious movie",3,1,4,31 August 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," The best horror flick since Scream
","Cabin in the woods is the best horror movie i have seen since Scream, it takes all the Horror genre's and plays them back not to type. So the movie starts with a office or facility with normal office types engaging in normal general chit chat, which puts us the viewer at unease as we think hey this is a Horror movie whats going on here ?So then we are introduced to a group of Standard Horror characters in your staple road trip to a Cabin in the woods. We have seen this before with the likes of Cabin Fever, The Evil Dead and your Friday the 13th films just to name a few.The horror cliques are played to the max, the geek, the Virgin, the Jock, the easy girl. All enter the cabin and nothing much happens for a while till the observers (those in the office) open a hatch into the Cellar, surely a nod to the Evil Dead ?Everyone knows 'Don't go into the cellar', but of course they will and they do, and this is where the twist comes as unwittingly these teens choose their own demise with out realising it. You see down in the cellar are some artifacts that when chosen of interacted with bring out a certain monster. To carry on and reveal what comes next will spoil a film you simply must see",10,0,3,11 November 2014
Alien: Covenant," Slow Slow Quick Quick
","The problem with Covenant is that its a filler for what has come before and is very predictable cause we know it's a prequel on how we got to where we are. Alien the movie that started it all was a slow ratchet of the tension and got you engrossed in the story that unfolded. Covenant tries to do this as well but runs out of steam and then tries to quickly cram in the reveal in the last act or 5 mins of the film. Covenant also has to explain its self a lot to hook you back in to stop you getting bored, such as at the start of them movie i thought hang on there is massive blooper going on here with one particular character, only for a plot device to be put in to clear that and other things up.I scored it 5 as the pacing is very poor, the visuals are stunning as you can expect from a Ridley Scott movie and the detail was good, though i couldn't help thinking is what I'm watching very CGI.",5,3,6,25 May 2017
