Vertigo," Easily one of the Top Classics in Cinematographic History!
","From direction to writing to cast to scenic locations, Vertigo was/is a top-notch film production. Granted the storyline might be 'culturally dated,' in light of the vast time difference between its release and today (more than 40 years!), however, the delivery and mastery of the art is impeccable. Definitely a must-see film for any serious film buff, critic/reviewer, enthusiast, et al.",10,2,3,4 December 2000
