Blade Runner 2049," A tale of life, struggle, vision an peace
","I was thoroughly surprised by this movie. Won't beat around the bush: it is one of the deepest reaching, most touching pictures I've seen in my life. It is a worthy successor of the original Blade Runner. Just go and watch it. If you're interested in a bit more detail, here you go:the original Blade Runner is a slow flowing picture, that really hits you after the second time you've watched it. That's when the weight of things this classic masterpiece details gets to you. Blade Runner 2049 is the same. It delves deep into questions probably all humans ask themselves at some point in this day and age: what does the future hold for us if we keep living this way? Where does artificial life lead us? Are we ready to be the Creators of life? Should we do it at all? Are we able to accept what we've created, and will we be able to live up to it? Where does artificial life end, and where does human life start? And amongst all the turbulence of the future that awaits us, will we find our own peace?You may or may not find the answers for these after watching Blade Runner 2049, but I'm sure you'll ask yourself some of the same questions.It truly is a visionary picture, which offers a story that will squeeze your throat with sadness at times (quite a few times), others it will make you think about our future, and holds an ending you will not forget: it breaks your heart with a hammer and stomps on the pieces, but at the same time it creates catharsis and offers its own bittersweet happy ending.All this made whole with absolutely fantastic acting from both supporting actors like Dave Bautista, Robin Wright, Ana de Armas, Sylvia Hoeks, Carla Juri, Jared Leto and actors playing main characters like Harrison Ford or the brilliant Ryan Gosling, who gave one of the best performances I've seen in years. The visuals of the movie are worthy of the original Blade Runner as well: a joy to watch, but a pain to imagine it could exist- a perfect setting for the story. The music is disturbing and beautiful at the same time, an organic part of the experience, really enjoyed it.All in all, I loved every single second of it: the heart churning moments, the subtle details, symbolic moments, the slow pace, the eerie yet pleasant music, the golden-dusty visuals, everything. I'd like to say a huge thank you to everyone involved in the making of this masterpiece. This is why I love the art of film. Thank you!",10,1,14,22 October 2017
Wind River," Heavy picture, but worth every minute!
","I knew it would be a strong title going in, since I loved Prisoners and Sicario as well, but honestly haven't expected it to be this good.It was kind of like being punched in the stomach. A heavy topic and a depressing feeling to the whole movie, but I'm glad I've watched it.It really shows that Denis Villeneuve and Taylor Sheridan have worked together for some time now. The whole movie gives you that same familiar feeling you get when watching Prisoners or Sicario, but I have to say, Wind River turned out to be a stronger picture than the latter,as strong as Prisoners with the direction of Villeneuve, and Jeremy Renner's acting was easily as convincing as Jackman's desperate father role, not to mention basically the whole cast. Great actors and performances.No need to stretch it out any more, although it'd be easy to write a lot more about this one. This is a picture you should just watch. Be warned though, it's pretty thought provoking and may not let go of you for a while. Congratulations to Mr. Sheridan for writing/direction and to all the cast for this film. Easily one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years!",10,2,6,10 September 2017
