Mission: Impossible III," Great Movie, A Must SEE
","Just saw the sneak preview for MI III, and found it the best of the three. J.J. Abrams (Alias, Lost) brings the action to a more true (if somewhat loud) level without the unrealistic special kung-fu effects of MI 2. You kind of see some 'Alias' in this movie especially in the computer geek at the HQ.(Marshall) Nice, twisty plot, almost non-stop action, and even a little human emotion is in this show. I was disappointed in the crowd that it didn't sell out for such a blockbuster, but the movie did get a standing ovation usually reserved for movies such as the Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. With the success that this movie should see at the box office, maybe J.J. Abrams can do MI 4....",9,3,6,2 May 2006
