The Legend of Bagger Vance," A damn good flick
","This movie, was in my opinion, just fantastic.  The reviews I read were not so kind, but they must have watched a different movie.  the one I saw had good to just short of excellent acting, memorable lines, truths about life, a romance that is more than just a sidetrack to the story, and best of all it held your imagination and your attention.  All without  the benefit of real action.  The story is not special, a guy down on his luck finds himself with the help of an angelic figure, who then disappears into the sunset. But the way it was told, and the way it makes you feel it, that was its beauty.  That is why i gave it high marks.  You will to if you sit and watch, it leaves you feeling fulfilled, which is what a movie like this is supposed to do.  Bravo to Redford and Co, for this fine picture.  It was not the years best, but it raises the bar for the contenders.",10,0,1,27 October 2001
