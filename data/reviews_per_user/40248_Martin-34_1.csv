The Blair Witch Project," Weird. Different. Creepy. Brilliant.
","It's probably not coincidence that my favourite films of recent years have been independent ones - for example, My Name is Joe, and Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels.This one is on a similar vein - low budget, actors you've probably never heard of, and not necessarily your regular happy ending.  Blair Witch takes it further - as well as enough hype to take it way up the box office charts, you're left wondering 'was it real?'. The actors are credited as themselves, the official web site (www.blairwitch.com) contains news footage of the search for the three filmmakers, and has no mention of actually making the film.  Call me gullible, but I'm still not 100% sure!As for the fear factor?  I saw the movie at a matinee, so the cinema wasn't too full, but even the few folk who were doing a bit of heckling during the film were silent for the final ten minutes, right through the credits, and people only started moving after the lights went up.  I didn't really find the movie too creepy, but 5 hours after I saw it, I've not had time to think it through properly.  If what everyone else is saying is true, I'll have a hard time sleeping tonight.. :)",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
