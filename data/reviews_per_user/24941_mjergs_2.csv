The Blair Witch Project," Too much Hype!
","I have got to say that the Blair Witch Project was one of the biggest disappointments for a movie that I have ever seen in a theatre. I think the biggest reason I disliked it was because of my expectations going in after I heard one reviewer state 'Best Horror movie since the Exorcist.' I like many others rushed to see it the first weekend.I was left at the end saying, 'That's it.' The second reason is I did not allow myself to get into the story. Some people have told me who are campers that they identified with what was going on and actually scared themselves even more. I don't have that frame of reference.I just didn't buy into it, the premise of the plot was original but it just failed to hook me in due to the poor lighting and bad sound. I couldn't hear or see half of the 'scary things' the directors wanted me to see.It anything it had some comedic lines in it. But overall it was a big flop.",4,0,2,14 January 2000
The Big Lebowski," It's one of a handful of comedies that gets funnier each time.
","It's one of the few comedies that gets funnier each time you watch it. I just saw it again a few nights ago and laughed out loud at least a dozen times. It has so many qualities that you look for in being able to watch a movie more than once (memorable lines- 'Hey man there's a beverage involved here!' great characters- when will I see a movie about Jesus the bowling freak and an interesting plot- too involved to mention)The performances by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are just incredible, I could remember after I saw it the first time I wanted to become the Dude. Steve Buscemi is also great in a more relaxed comedic role opposed to his normal freaky type characters. Very original and funny.",8,0,1,7 January 2000
