The Avengers," Perfect at what it's trying to be.
","The Avengers finally assembled this year and I believe as everybody does that it is awesome. It in a sense is a flawless because it does everything that it is trying to and does it well. It's just as good as it needed to be and more. However, is it cinematic genius and one of the greatest films of all time? No. It's loads and loads of fun, the action scenes are great, the dialog is very witty, and the acting is good. But that's pretty much it. I'm not downgrading the movie at all. Everyone should see it and it is great, but it doesn't take any risks. It's a safe film, with nothing really unexpected. Asides from The Dark Knight, it is the best superhero movie thus far(still waiting for Dark Knight Rises), but it's the basic 'take over the world' plot and there's just nothing that isn't surprising in the movie. Is it a good film? Yes. It's even a great film and does what it's trying to do perfectly. But is it the 49th best movie ever? Far far from it. Good, even great, but not cinematic history.",7,1,5,19 July 2012
Interstellar," Wow
","I've been a huge Christopher Nolan fan since Batman Begins. Everyone of his movies (Insomnia being the only one I haven't seen) has been an amazing experience and an absolute joy. I had high hopes for Interstellar. However, for the past week, I've heard many mixed reviews with most saying the movie was smart, had great visuals, a lot of fun, but on the 'ridiculous' side. But after seeing this movie, I must say, once again Nolan's film about Interstellar travel travels far beyond the astronomical bar I had set for it going in. I will not say Interstellar is Nolan's best movie, because you can't compare movies that are on the same, incredibly high level, but this one just might be his most powerful work. I cannot recall the last time a movie moved me so well. While for a lot of the movie, the viewer is left guessing where the film is headed next, or how it will get to a climax, the last 45 minutes will have you on the edge of your seat to the point to where if you fall off you won't even notice because your eyes will never leave the screen. This movie was a complete joy. As nearly all of Nolan's works are, every aspect of this movie was of the highest quality. The actors were fantastic. the visuals put even Avatar to shame. The story is as interesting as they get. The scope and aim is so grand that some may find it 'ridiculous' but anyone with an open-mind will love this movie and every where it takes you.",8,2,7,8 November 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Good, not great.
","The Amazing Spider-Man is definitely the best Spider-man movie thus far. The casting and acting is much much better in this one than the others. Martin Sheen does a fantastic job in his limited role as Uncle Ben specifically and pretty much everyone else does a better job with their roles in this film. The story is better than the original and is intense in places. However, this movie has nothing out of the ordinary at all. Pretty much everything in the film can be expected. I walked into this film expecting a great film, but I got a good one. The story line and plot devices are very ordinary and nothing unexpected from the audience. Much of the story line is very similar to the story in the first film. There are just small things that are better in this film. I expected better but it was still good.",7,1,3,19 July 2012
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Very hollow and muddy
","When I saw this film's trailer I was super excited. Ultron looked like he would be the best villain Marvel has ever had. I thought this movie had potential to maybe be the best superhero movie ever, or at least that some people would think so. After reading some reviews my expectations lowered a little bit, but I was still excited for the film. I can honestly say that walking out of this film, I was surprisingly underwhelmed. I thought this film had a multitude of problems and really felt empty inside. I'll go through my take f each part of the film: 1) Plot: I thought the plot wasn't that great. Ultron looked very threatening in the trailers and looked like a huge threat to the Avengers. There was never a moment in this film where I thought Ultron could beat the Avengers. Every time they come face to face, the Avengers can beat him, and for some reason don't. His motivations, which should be one of the most interesting part of the film, felt very rushed and not examined at all. Even though Ultron's drones are him, which he says at one point in the film, none of them are near as powerful as he is, even in his early states. Scarlet Witch and Vision's powers are never explained, and they end up being like God characters. Also there is a moment where the Avengers hide out at Hawkeye's house after Hulk destroys a city. This is where the movie slows way down. This is where they seem most vulnerable. But Ultron didn't beat them, and by hiding out they allow him to get stronger. They say they can't find him and they must hide because people want to arrest Hulk, but that doesn't mean they all have to hide and not even try to find Ultron. Even if you ignore the plot holes, this is a very basic Plot Line. 2) Acting/Characters: RDJ is great as Iron Man again, Chris Evans is great as Cap, and Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. Samuel L. Jackson is great again in his smaller role as Nick Fury. I've never liked Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, but not because of her acting, more because I haven't loved the way she's been written. I'm not a huge fan of Ruffalo's Hulk either, but for the same reasons that I'm not a fan of Black Widow. They have a relationship in this film, and it is so rushed that it never makes much sense. Scarlet Witch and Quiksilver have very annoyingly stereotypical Russian accents. They switch sides in the film after seeing that Ultron wants to destroy humanity, but once again this is rushed and doesn't make that much sense. Overall, the acting is not that bad, but the writing of the characters doesn't make much sense and seems very hollow. 3) Action: The action is awesome in this film. Some of it doesn't make sense. The Avengers are pretty much invincible cartoon characters. Ultron's drones are so weak it's hard to understand how they are a threat. Scarlet Witch's powers are whatever the plot needs them to be, same with Vision's. Scarlet Witch has a power that you think is mind-control, but isn't. It makes the characters either see a fear of theirs, or shows us their origin story, if we haven't seen it. This is never explained how this is a power, as it doesn't seem to help them at all. 4) Music: Very forgettable, the original Avengers theme that is played ion the first is heard maybe twice in this film. Not really that important to the film, but also very forgettable.5) Cinematography: Lots of CGI but very pretty cinematography nonetheless. 6) Dialogue: Marvel is back with their quick one-liner comedic dialogue, but it is less effective in this film than maybe any other Marvel film. The dialogue was surprisingly bland and very dry. None of it was very memorable. Very disappointing. There doesn't seem to be any theme, message, or moral in this film. There was a lot of potential for this to be a pretty deep film, like The Dark Knight, but it ended up being a very hollow. One hero does die in this film, as was teased leading up to this film. Marvel has yet to actually kill an actual hero in their canon, which is a big pet peeve for me. However, I am shocked about the death, not because it was surprising who they killed, but it was surprising that they actually expected us to care. Joss Whedon is a very talented writer and director. However, I know he had a lot of struggles and disagreements with the studio on this film, and I feel if he was given complete free-reign, we would have had a better film. This film feels like the Dead-Man's Chest of the Marvel Universe. You will probably enjoy the film, especially if you're going just to enjoy a superhero action film, but if you're looking for something more original and innovative, this is not the film. It's not bad, it's just not good either. The first Avengers was very good, not necessarily completely original, but a very solid film that stretched the boundaries of a superhero film a little bit. This one stays within it's own boundaries and in my book. 6/10",6,8,18,16 May 2015
Saw," Incredible
","Wow.....I must admit, I haven't seen many horror movies, but this one has still had the ability to blow me off my feet. Wow. Unfortunately, I had spoiled myself as a viewer by accidentally seeing the plot twist in an post online. However, even that did not spoil this viewing experience for me, as it was still shocking. This is a must see for horror fans and movie fans. This movie has possible everything you could ever want from a horror movie title. I found myself constantly checking off mental check marks for this movie as it continued to just shock me every way. This movie ducks and dives through the conventional plot progression and as an avid movie fan, this was a breath of fresh air, be it, a very tense breath. Wow. I am still blown away by this movie. Just incredible. Wow...",10,2,5,29 June 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Simply Fantastic
","Christopher Nolan was assigned with the job of coming out with a new Batman movie comparable to The Dark Knight. Did he succeed? In short, yes. Is it better than The Dark Knight? No. But is it incredible, awesome, and everything we could have hoped for? Yes. This movie would be the best Batman movie and even one of the best movies ever if Heath Ledger wouldn't have put on the face paint. That's what I think is the biggest difference between the movies. While Tom Hardy's Bane is very very well done and flat out frightening at times, nobody can top Ledger's Joker. But don't think for a second that TDKR is any worse because of that.The Dark Knight Rises brings the biggest threat of all three movies to Gotham in the form of Bane. Bane is Batman's biggest threat he's ever had physically and forces Bruce Wayne to return as Batman after entering an isolated state. Much less happens in this movie than in the previous two and I think it's because of the villains. In Batman Begins, Batman had to fight the Mob, Scarecrow, and Ras Al Ghul. In The Dark Knight, Batman had to fight the Mob, The Joker, and Two-Face. In The Dark Knight Rises, Batman has to fight Bane, and only Bane. From beginning to end, all Batman has to do is figure out how to defeat Bane and stop him from finishing his evil plot. While Batman Begins is some what lessened in genius because it has to tell the origin story of Batman, and The Dark Knight is just obviously amazing to everyone who sees it, The Dark Knight Rises has more of a hidden genius. Most people will miss all the symbols and why this movie is so brilliant and such a masterful ending to the Dark Knight's Legacy. There's so much I wish I can say, but I don't want to spoil it for you. All I should say is see it. See it and be amazed by it. 10 Stars out of 10.",8,16,28,22 July 2012
