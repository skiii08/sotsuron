Requiem for a Dream," Run, Don't Walk, to See
","After sitting through the `Movie-That-Refused-To-End' this past weekend (`Pearl Harbor'), I was disgusted and appalled by Hollywood's continuous efforts to denigrate us.  And then I rented `Requiem For A Dream' and it keeps the flame flickering in my belief that someone, somewhere still makes movies that challenges our intelligence.  Start a word-of-mouth campaign to all your friends to see this movie.  Challenge them.  Ask them which was the better movie; `Forrest Gump', `Shawshank Redemption' or `Dead Man Walking'. Ask your friends to compare `Requiem' with `Gladiator' and `Traffic'.  No competition.I won't divulge the plot of the movie because I want people to experience it like I did.  I popped the DVD into the machine and thought there was something wrong with it.  Should've taught me then that this was something special.Oh, you got to watch the Director's Cut. Would I let my 15-year old daughter see it? Not yet.  But did I let my 17-year old son watch it? Easily, a must see.  He said that after watching the movie he felt sick.  What better rationale or justification is there when asking if it should be shown to children.  The question parents must ask themselves is, Are your children mature enough to handle it? and, When can I show it to them? because they need to see it.I read that `Requiem' only grossed about four million dollars.  It's a shame.  The original NC-17 rating meant that Ellen Burstyn's performance and Darren Aronofsky's direction won't be seen by people.  People whom it could help the most.  People whom it can keep their fires burning.  People whom can demand that Hollywood stop denigrating their intelligence.Is it the best movie ever?  No way.  Is it the best movie of 2000?  By far.",10,0,0,30 May 2001
