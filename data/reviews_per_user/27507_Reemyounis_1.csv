Conquest 1453," Don't waste your time
","This movie was so bad on so many levels that I don't know where to begin. With all the ads on various Arabic TV channels, I mistakenly assumed that the large marketing budget implied a large production budget. I understand that this was the most expensive Turkish film ever made, and had hoped that this would be reflected in the film, but that was not the case unfortunately. The film focused on the gore of war with very cheap looking fight scenes, that were intended to draw in a male audience. A cheesy forced love story was inserted in to the mix to draw in a female audience. A big problem with the fight scenes was that the two main rivals looked like clones and were always scantily clad and oiled up to reveal their six pack abs, hence it was tough to tell them apart. I was hoping to watch a film similar to 'Kingdom of Heaven' even though I knew that such a production budget could not have been matched. This was the antithesis of it. Even the Turkish series 'Muhtesem Yuzyil' seems more coherent and expensive when compared to 'Fatih 1453'.",1,21,41,28 September 2012
