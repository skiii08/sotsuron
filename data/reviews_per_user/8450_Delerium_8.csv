The Blair Witch Project," The best horror movie in ages.
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a horror movie with no big name actors, no special effects, and no big budget. And yet, it is better than any recent horror movie I have seen. The horror is all psychological, relying on our own natural sense of fear.Shot roughly on a Super 8 portable and a portable video camera, it is about three student film makers who travel into the Maryland woods where it is reputed to be haunted. The small town near the woods has a troubled past, and the locals tell tales of the 'Blair Witch', which is a local myth and the subject of a documentary. As they shoot the documentary, they become hopelessly lost, unprepared, and turning on each other as their situation becomes worse. To make matters worse, they discover there really is something in the woods. Because of the rough nature of the film, it is all the more realistic. You feel like you are out there with them, and the feeling of hopelessness rubs off on the audience. And since you are discovering things as they do, the horror is all the more real. As a movie, it is very unsettling and one that is sure to leave a lasting impression. Skillfully directed, and a premise that puts most horror movies to shame. I can safely say that I have never seen a movie like this one. One of the year's best. Funny, but in a summer riddled with big budget action movies and garbage horror movies like 'Lake Placid' and 'The Haunting', a low budget indie film like 'The Blair Witch Project' stands out as the best.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," A Landmark Horror Film,
","'The Blair Witch Project' is a rare gem, a psychological horror film with no big budget, no big name actors, and no in-your-face special effects, and it is better than almost every summer movie possessing all of the above. The hype might be killing it for some viewers, but it certainly is every bit as scary as people are saying. Three student film makers set out to make a documentary on a local myth, the so-called 'Blair Witch'. Their starting point is interviewing people about the myths and legends that surround the supposedly haunted woods near a small town in Maryland. They interview many people who tell stories about the troubled past, with a crazy person (or thing) stalking the woods, child murders, and the fact that the woods are haunted to this day. The film makers treat these tales like myths, nothing to be taken seriously. But as they get deeper into ther filming, they discover something is really out there. Soon, they find themselves lost and running out of food, and patients with each other. Because the film is shot in a documentary style, every event is a suprise. You are discovering these horrors as the characters are discovering it. But in 'The Blair Witch Project', there is no hockey masked killer staking them, no demon roaming around, the horror is all psychological. That is what makes this movie so scary, it feeds off of our own sense of fear. The scenario is our own worst nightmare, being lost in the vast woods with images of wicked witches and ghosts, or possible something worse going through out heads. And as the movie goes on, the sense of sheer hopelessness and fear rubs right off on the audience. By the end of the movie, I was totally unnerved. One thing that should also get special mention is the writing. The screenwriters did a great job of giving the characters a realistic touch. They talk like normal people rather than fabricated cartoon characters all too common in movies these days. One warning, and this has been stated numerous times, if you are going to see this movie, avoid the first 5 rows. The camera shakes and shifts so much that is causes motion sickness. To add the the horror of the movie, there was a sick feeling growing in the pit of my stomach. Or is that supposed to be part of the experience. Most people expect that 'The Blair Witch Project' to spawn a whole score of cheap knockoffs, and will be used as a reference point for modern horror movies, much like 'Halloween' spawned 'Friday the 13th' and a never ending list of  slasher films. I hope that is not true, because 'Blair Witch' is proof that a great movie doesn't need the Hollywood treatment to be quality and successful at the same time. This is how horror movie should be.",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," In this case, as in most, the hype is bigger than the payoff.
","I think George Lucas himself said it best, 'It's just a movie, get a life!', a message aimed at those who have made it their mission in life to see this movie ahead of everybody else.And sorry as I am to say this, it was not that good. In fact, this movie is arrogantly overrated. This is what the first Star Wars movie would have looked like if it had a bigger budget. While the first Star Wars was a groundbreaking masterpiece, 'The Phantom Menace' is simply a retread of all the elements of the previous three movies. While watching it, I felt the strong 'Been there, done that' feeling.There are some good moments, but not nearly enough. The script is surprisingly goofy, with few of the elements that made the first Star Wars so surprising and enjoyable. Even during the best fight scenes I was not thrilled, because it was deja vu, I knew what the outcome would be, and how they reached that outcome is the biggest insult of all. See the movie and you'll know what I mean. Creativity and innovation have no meaning here.As far as scams go, this has to be the biggest cinematic rip-off of all time. People were lining up to get the new toys at one minute after midnight, and then there were the people camping out to get first tickets. All I hope is that it was worth their effort to get the tickets, because it wasn't worth what little effort I put into getting mine. A crushing disappointment.",4,0,1,23 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," As entertaining as movies get
","Trey Parker and Matt Stone's brilliant and raunchy animated sitcom has done what few TV knockoffs have achieved, they made it into a good movie. I was skeptical about how good it would be (usually, what works on TV doesn't work on the big screen, take it as a rule), but this was a nice surprise.The movie starts with Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sneaking in to see the raunchy, R-rated movie titled, appropriately enough, 'Asses of Fire', starring two of their favourite Canadian actors Terrence and Philip (if you've seen even one episode of 'South Park', you know what I am talking about). The movie is so vulgar (including a priceless musical number about incest) that the kids pick it up and start repeating the obsceneties in school. This leads them into trouble with the school, and ultimately with their parents, who launch a crusade against Canada, who they blame for warping their children's minds. Not since Michael Moore's 'Canadian Bacon' has a movie ripped into Canada so fiendeshly. Canada is the main butt of all jokes here. There are some colorful musical numbers in the movie as well, sung by the cast themselves.'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' is one of the most crude and offensive movies I have ever seen, so needless to say I loved it. The humour is razor-sharp, and the vulgaraties come at you at a mile-a-minute. There are so many four-letter words here, and they have spared nobody from their pot shots. There is no word to obscene, and no blow too low. It is obvious that the two creators have attempted to offend as many people as possible: gays, blacks, jews, women,  chinese, germans, everybody. It is the perfect mix of low-brow humor and political satire. It is no secret that the TV show South Park has lost a lot of popularity, this can easily be attributed to that fact that there are no new episodes, and people are getting sick of re-runs.I don't think there were two minutes in this movie that I went without laughing, both because it was pure comedy, other times because I simply could not believe what I was seeing and hearing. Even fans of the show (like myself) will be shocked, yes, the movie is that raunchy. It is the perfect mix of low-brow humour and political satire. I have never has such a good time at a movie. I'll definitely see it again.",10,0,0,4 July 1999
The Mummy," Mindless entertainment, just what the doctor ordered
","'The Mummy' kicks off the summer movie season with a bang, and it is everything you would expect from a Hollywood summer blockbuster: big, loud, expensive, and not a shred of intelligence. Not that that's always bad thing.'The Mummy' combines the plotlines from the 'Indiana Jones' movies with all the typical horror movie cliches. You get five people pitted against the most awsome and supreme power in the universe, and do they stand a chance? Even without seeing the movie you can answer that. In terms of being a horror movie, it delivers a few good scares and some genuinely skin-crawling moments (especially if you are afraid of bugs).The story starts in ancient Egypt, where the lover of the pharoah's wife is put to an extremely nasty death. Three thousand years later, a group of scholars go out in search of 'The Book of the Dead', which is hidden under the lost city dubbed the 'City of the Dead'. They employ the help of a convict (Brendan Fraser) who has been there before. Big suprise, they have some competition. A group of American treasure hunters (looters, actually) are also looking for the lost city. Well, they find the book and unwittingly bring the dead mummy to life, and he goes out into the world to regenerate and to resurrect his long-dead mistress. If he succeeds, the world is doomed.This movie is standard action/adventure, the script is weak, the overacting is painfully obvious, and the attempts at humor wash over you after the first 30 minutes. But not that you'd notice, there is enough special effects here to distract anyone from the films technical weaknesses. But I have to admit, it was entertaining. The Mummy's rotting corpse in the glow of the moonlight is enough the scare the hell out of anyone.It is one of those movies you can only see on the big screen, but it is not a movie I'll be seeing again.",Null,0,0,10 May 1999
Titanic," Possibly the WORST movie of the decade.
","Yeah, you heard right. Titanic, for all it's special effects, obscenely high budget, and no less criminal amount of critic acclaim, is nothing more than a big pile of rubbish. The ship sank, and sucked millions of dollars down with it.First of all, take away the special effects. What your left with is a third rate script. It attempts to mix a period piece with trendy, all too modern dialogue. I have doubts that 'The finger' and the term 'Bum a smoke' existed in 1912. You also get the most contrived love story in the history of motion pictures. There is no way Jack would have even been allowed near where Rose was. Also, I doubt that a girl like Rose, raised in a life of luxury and set to marry a billionaire, would be interested in a bum like Jack. The customs at the time would not have permitted it. What I also have a problem with is the cliches that this script banks on. It is always the rich people who are the villains, and the poor little popper is the hero who saves the day. The screenwriter must have no mind of his/her own.Second, the acting is horrible. Sorry ladies, it's no mystery why Leo wasn't nominated for an Oscar. But Leo can act, he has proven that in the past. But period pieces are not his strength (do I even need to mention 'The Man in the Iron Mask'?). Kate Winslet is the typical strong willed female character made to appeal to the feminists watching this movie. They might have had their feathers ruffled by the lines 'The real purpose of college is to meet a good man', though. She is good, but one good performance in a sea of bad ones.James Cameron is not high on my list of favorite directors, and 'Titanic' stands as the biggest stroke of his ego. Needless to say, I was disgusted by the 'Moment of silence' he made at the Oscars. The only redeeming quality of 'Titanic' is watching the ship sink, which fills the second half of this movie's grossly overlong running time. But it is hardly worth it. And the Best Picture Oscar, god! There is only one way I can say this, 'LA Confidential' got screwed! As did 'Good Will Hunting'.To sum up, I found my 3 hours in the dentist chair last month more enjoyable than this piece of trash. There's a special place in Hollywood Hell for 'Titanic'.",1,3,11,23 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," 'Not Every Gift Is A Blessing'. How true.
","WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD'The Sixth Sense' is a neat little thriller that borderlines drama and a plain, old-fashioned ghost story. It is chilling and effective at certain times, puzzling in others.Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a renown child psychologist who, after an encounter with an ex-patient who he couldn't help, is left mentally scarred and finds the world around him falling apart. He takes on a quiet and alienated young boy named Cole, whom he tries to succeed in reaching him where others have failed. Young Cole is branded a freak by his schoolmates, and everyone believes that his sense of isolation and paranoia is self-imposed, and brought on by his parent's divorce. Willis treats his case in much the same manner at first, but when he admits the truth to him, things start getting really weird. Apparently Cole is gifted in ways few would imagine, he has the ability to see and talk to the spirits dead people. And it is not just the recently dead, he can see deaths that took place many years before. In one scene, his teacher is quizing him on the history of the school, and he casually mentions 'They used to hang people here', drawing many puzzled stares from his classmates. When the subtitle on the poster says 'Not Every Gift Is A Blessing', they mean just that, this turns Cole into a nervous wreck, and he becomes increasingly paranoid as the film progresses. All he knows is that the ghosts won't leave him alone, and they want something from him. Willis soon becomes a believer, and he tries to help him in whatever way he can, while putting on the back burner everything else, including the relationship with his wife.I wouldn't dare give away the ending, except to say that it defies all logic. It will leave you asking many questions as you think back to instances earlier in the movie. For the casual moviegoer, it will give you a lot to talk about after the movie is over.'The Sixth Sense' is flawless in terms of acting. Bruce Willis is very watchable, as always, and he turns in the caring, big-brotherly performance he failed to give in last year's mediocre 'Mercury Rising'. I have always liked Bruce Willis in whatever he did, even if everything else about the movie was bad. It is a good role for him. Young Haley Joel Osment is superb as Cole, and he plays with a perfect sense of timing and depth. He is incredibly believable in his role, and he has turned in what could quite possibly be the best performance from a child actor I have ever seen.Overall, this is a good movie. It has the perfect mix of supernatural thriller and drama, with more emphasis on the chemistry between Willis and Osment rather than distracting the audience with special effects for two hours. It is not a prefect movie, but it makes for one of the summer's most satisfying moviegoing experiences. 8/10",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
The Matrix," Too much fun.
","This is the film that everyone is flocking to, and with good reason. I cannot recall when I have had so much fun at a movie.Usually big blockbusters like this put me off because the need for special effects eclipses good acting and writing. Fortunately, as a pleasant surprise, this wasn't like that. Yes, Keanu Reeves still cannot act, but Laurence Fishburne and especially Carrie-Ann Moss make the movie work on that level..The story is way out-of-this-world. A computer crook seeks the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?', and finds it. What he finds out is that his reality is not actually reality itself. The story gets more complicated than that, and as far as Science Fiction goes, this is as good as it gets.The Special Effects are spectacular. To say the very least. There is plenty of fighting (Keanu's facial gestures during the fight scenes are hysterical), shooting, cool weapons, and some awe-inspiring effects shots to arouse the interest of almost any moviegoer. And all the characters look especially cool in their dark clothes and custom sunglasses. For me, the best parts of the movie were with Carrie-Ann Moss. She is definitely the character every one liked the most in 'The Matrix'. This is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you breathless. A guaranteed good time.",Null,0,0,25 April 1999
