3:10 to Yuma," Stupid, stupid movie
","As I watched the stupidities pile up during this stupid fest, I came to regret agreeing to watch it for free!! In no particular order: A Civil War vet who lost a shin/foot is running and jumping like an Olympic athlete; the leader of a very successful gang who is told the sheriff will be back soon, decides to dally with a saloon gal, then stroll down to the saloon to be 'surprised' by lawmen; a man gut shot at close range, has the bullet removed with tin snips, and 10 minutes walks into a saloon to accuse a killer and a few minutes later, is riding into the desert as if nothing happened; the killer is taken on horseback to Yuma with his hands handcuffed IN FRONT of his body so he can use them to throat stab a lawman, attack the gut shot iron man and toss him off a cliff, grab and shoot guns, and cut people with a knife; the killer, never being tied up or restrained in any way, allowing him free reign to kill as many of the posse members as he sees fit; the killer, after a heart to heart with the Civil War Vet decides to shoot and kill his own entire gang (which has been through hell to save him) then ride off on the train so the Vet's kid can get some money (we are aware the killer will be exiting the train around the corner by jumping onto his horse and riding away); as well as the other absurdities listed in other posts about the people of the town all becoming homicidal maniacs, and no member of the good guy posse trying to stop the killing of their members by shooting the bad guy...I could go on. This film has a IMDb rating of over 8??? I suggest the curious watch this film and play a drinking game...perhaps use each ridiculous moment as a signal to chug a brewski. I expect most people would be fairly well plastered at films end.",3,44,78,29 January 2008
