Blade Runner 2049," Impossible to dislike
","The story was absolutely amazing and in my humble opinion very original. One of the best film I have seen so far . It had everything, action and a little romance. but not enough to distract you from the main story line",7,0,4,4 September 2018
Darkest Hour," a well crafted movie
","This is a beautiful, touching film. Yes, it is slow--but it's supposed to be slow. It's very reminiscent of real life occurrences . For people who have trouble appreciating the pace, this is how a professor once explained it to me: When you're watching a football game on TV, often they will do instant replays in slow motion so that you have time to examine the action. Think of the slow pace in that way. Don't just sit there thinking it's slow and boring, try to take advantage of the time they give you to examine and reflect on the story.",7,0,1,4 September 2018
"I, Tonya"," I highly recommend viewing this movie
",This is awesome & show you the way to go. Very Powerful film.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Simply one of the best movie ever made
","This film is a mature masterpiece which fulfills the true function of Art-to reflect the mystery of Life and Living back to You. Enough Said-Go, its a movie to watch",9,0,2,4 September 2018
Get Out," Intriguing, loved the turn of events
","I sat and watched the entire film. Why had I not heard of this before? The film was so fascinating, in so many ways. The director takes his time, and I never felt that the film was proceeding too slowly, or that any scene could have been cut or shortened.",6,0,2,4 September 2018
The Shape of Water," Loved it to the moon and back
","This is a wonderfully idealistic, sentimental meditation on what it means 'to live'. Are you missing your own life, and will you one day discover that you've never really experienced it? Will your discovery come just in time, or too late? Watch this movie and take the opportunity to reflect on how you may be running through your brief years with little to show for them...Though at times rather heavy handed and didactic, the vitality and generosity of this movie are a wonderful antidote to our cynical age, and the performances are quite good. An excellent movie",8,2,4,4 September 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," The truth is, in other words, Art!
",Over the years I think I've devoted nearly half a day of my valuable time watching and re-watching this multi-layered masterpiece. One of its main messages to me is : what would I do in a similar position to the protagonist of the story?,9,1,3,4 September 2018
