Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Let down
","I expected it to not match to hype but I had no idea it would be this disappointing. For any other movie it would have been acceptable but this is Star Wars. First of all the thing was like watching a cartoon. The original Star Wars effects were much better, even with the primitive technology. Lucas has begun to rely too heavily on computers and digital magic and lost sight of the fact that maybe a guy in a costume would have been better. In the original trilogy when you saw a ship or a storm trooper it seemed somehow more real, not like this computer animated garbage that was thrown on the screen for the 'Phantom Menace.' But more importantly is the lack of any strong characters. Before you had a whole cast of interesting and full characters, now we are only left with computer enhanced cardboard cutouts. Before there was Han, the Princess, C3P0 ect. now we just have a Darth Vader look alike that has maybe 5 lines in the whole picture. Also gone is the clever and well thought out dialogue. In 'Episode I' the closest they get to being clever is stealing lines from the original 'Star Wars.' And I won't even start with those amphibion people who were not only annoying but you couldn't understand a word they said. All in all it was simply eye candy, which may have been enough in any other film, but this is Star Wars.",6,0,1,19 May 1999
Battleship Potemkin," Must See
",'Battleship' is the best example you will see of the montage editing used by the Russians in the 1920's. By using a series of simple images they where able to communicate complicated ideas to an uneducated audience. Now seen mostly in TV commercials montage editing has been very influencial in the US. 'Battleship' is a must see for anyone interested in film history.,7,7,11,12 February 1999
Man on the Moon," Great Start, Standard Finish
","Man on the Moon is a great film, but one that could have been better. The opening sequence with Andy saying the movie is stupid and rolling the credits was incredible, but I wanted more. Instead it turns into a very good, funny but ultimately a very conventional biopic. I wanted 20 min. of the 'Great Gatsby,' I wanted half the theater to walk out and the other half to give a standing ovation at the end. Andy was someone who screwed with your mind but this movie, one that was supposed to give you a feel for who he was, didn't do that. I guess it's asking a lot for a studio movie to put the film out of frame during the scene about the v-hold on his TV special but it would have been great. Something along the lines of 'Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould' but about Andy was what I guess I really wanted.",9,0,0,23 December 1999
