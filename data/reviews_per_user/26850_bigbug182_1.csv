Requiem for a Dream," holly hell this film is a true masterpiece
","requiem for a dream was very unusual when i saw it the first time about 3 years ago......... and when i saw it that time i thought:' god it makes you feel so real so emotional...... after couple of years when i saw it again i thought:'god it makes you feel so real so emotional.......' but something had changed. in my opinion requiem was masterpiece and it still remains in this category........ Darren Aronofski is a genius no arguments about that but if you doubt this fact, rent his first film 'pie' and you will definitely know what the hell i am talking about......... i give it 9/10 (it is in my top 5)",9,1,2,11 August 2004
