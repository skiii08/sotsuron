The Blair Witch Project," No slashers, no demons, just horror!
","The Blair Witch Project is a throwback of sorts.  If you are looking for a slasher flick like Nightmare and Elm Street, or Hellraiser, prepared to be disappointed.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a psychological thriller along the lines of Psycho you will be pleasantly surprised.The Blair Witch is a breath of fresh air to a currently stale and predictable movie industry.  It is nice to see a film without a forced sexual relationship, and awful tag-lines do well in Hollywood.
This movie seems incredibly scary to me, because it is so realistic.  Not only because of the plot, but because of the style in which it was pieced together.  I could see myself in the same scenario as these three students lost in the woods.  Would I lose my cool?  Yes.  Would I start fearing for my life?  Yes.  And that is what makes this movie so interesting. I can see where many people have been and will continue to be 'fooled' by the realism of this flick.  To this day I have co-workers, and friends trying to convince me that what happened was real.  I guess they are going to be surprised when they see one of the three student film-makers staring in the latest, summer blockbuster in the year 2000.",7,0,0,15 November 1999
Antz," Adults will like this more than the kids.
","It seems to me that Antz is one of Hollywood's first attempts at making animation for adults on a grand scale.  For years other countries like Japan have understood that it is not the medium in which a film is created, but the story behind it that counts. Antz has taken that concept to the U.S. and I am very happy that they did.  I have nothing against Disney animation.... as a matter of fact, I enjoy most of it, but Antz is definitely not a Disney film.  It is an adult film that children may enjoy.  It is aimed at the adult, but marketed for children.  Woody Allen was his typical neurotic self.  Sly Stallone played one of his best roles in years. And Christopher Walken was great as usual. Check it out if you get the chance.  P.S. This movie may not be a great idea for extremely young children.  There are a few brutal war scenes which might scare a young child (the termite battle for those of you that have seen the movie).  You may want to view it before showing it to a child, just to make sure it isn't too violent for them.",7,0,0,15 November 1999
Unbreakable," What if Comics Were Real?
","I have been a fan of comics all my life. I have always wondered what if there were really superheros? What would they be like? Would they fit in, or would they be considered freaks? I think Unbreakable portrays how a superhero would find out he is actually one, and how he responds to it rather accurately. Of course this is just speculation, but it sure comes off very believable.I have heard many grumble that this movie was too slow and boring.  I did not feel that way. I thought this movie was a great throwback to great directing like Alfred Hitchcock's films. I am not a professor of film, but I know I like the way the movie feels. The pacing, the dialogue, the cinematography..... it all feels right to me.",8,0,0,20 September 2001
Memento," Not confusing if you pay attention.
","I have heard so many good things about Memento before actually seeing it.  I feared I would be let down since the hype was so great. 1 minute after watching the ending....or should I say the beginning, I was a little frustrated since I too am programmed by Hollywood to expect the expected once in a while.  Then I thought to myself for a few minutes and it all came together. This is the type of movie that doesn't end when the lights go back on. It sticks with you. It makes you think. And best of all, it makes you want to discuss it with others who have been lucky enough to see it.The performances given in this movie were fantastic. All three of the main characters were interesting, and had two faces. Check it out, and you'll see what I mean. If you enjoy movies that make you think like Jacob's Ladder, American Psycho, and Fight Club then this is for you.",9,0,1,20 September 2001
Battleship Potemkin," This is a cinematic masterpiece, way ahead of its time.
","There are only a handful of movies that were made on such a grand scale and made such a difference in the art of movie making.'Bronenosets Potyomkin' is one of these movies, and it should be on anyone's list looking to learn more about the history of cinema.  
Grigori Aleksandrov & Sergei M. Eisenstein directed this groundbreaking film that documents the horrors taking place on a Russian battleship. When the sailors finally retaliate against their superiors, the locals embrace the them, and support them. Things get ugly when a group of soldiers are sent to the small town to take care of business.  What follows is one of the most imitated scenes in the history of cinema. Anyone who has seen 'The Untouchables', and 'Bronenosets Potyomkin' knows exactly what I mean.Overall I think this movie raised the bar for film making just as 'Intolerance' did a few years earlier. If you do not mind silent films, do yourself a favor, and see 'Bronenosets Potyomkin'.  If you don't like silent films..... watch 'Bronenosets Potyomkin' anyway.",8,18,21,10 December 1999
Elf," Elf Will Be A New Christmas Classic!
","After seeing 'Elf' last night (special preview screening) I am happy to say that I, as well as my children left the theater feeling full of Christmas cheer. I do believe that this movie will become a Christmas classic. I can see this movie being viewed by millions each year on TV just like 'A Christmas Story', and 'It's a Wonderful Life'. Was the movie perfect? No. Will it win an Oscar? Of course not. Did it make me laugh, and feel good while looking forward to another Christmas this year. Without a doubt.
7 out of 10 Stars.",7,5,5,31 October 2003
Cast Away," Hanks says a lot with so little, but what is in the box?
","I was so upset when I saw commercials for Cast Away. I mean, how much of the movie do you have to let me know about before hand?  I would have enjoyed the movie more if 80% of it wasn't shown to me in the commercials. That being said, Cast Away was a very enjoyable movie. Especially since Tom Hanks is such a brilliant actor. He says so much without saying much at all. He is a very expressive actor who lets his facial expressions and body language tell it all. The movie was actually well paced. I have heard many complaints that this movie was slow and boring. As I have said before (in other reviews), if you can not enjoy anything more thought provoking than the latest N'Synch album or the latest episode of Dawson's Creek than this movie is not for you.
I do have one question though? What is in the box? I guess I'll have to scour the DVD for an easter egg with that information. (Hey, maybe I've watched too many episodes of Gilligan's Island. Yeah, that's it... I'm all screwed up like these N'Synch fans... just in a different way.",7,2,4,20 September 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private is quite possibly my favorite war movie of all time.
","First, let me explain that I am not a big war film buff.  I liked Platoon, and a few other films of this genre, but generally I do not enjoy war films. I think the reason for this is that most war films seem to glorify the act of war.  They try to make war look fun and cool.  Saving Private Ryan on the other hand shows you just how brutal war is.  It puts you right into the middle of one of the most deadly battles of the entire war, and makes you glad that you are not one of the soldiers on that beach.  This movie makes me appreciate our veterans and their struggles even more than I did before.  But most of all, it makes me appreciate how lucky I am to not have to risk my life for everything I have.  Our veterans have already done it for us.",10,0,0,15 November 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Martial Arts Masterpiece for Open Minded Viewers.
","If you are one of those people who has seen commercials for Crouching Tiger and thought to yourself... 'that flying looks ridiculous', or 'I'm not sitting through an entire movie in subtitles', then please do me and yourself a favor and stay away from this movie.  As far as the flying looking ridiculous.... how many of you complained when Superman carried Lois Lane through the sky in Superman? Why should you be upset when Chow Yun Fat soars over rooftops? How can people watch movies like Jurrasic Park, and never once say....'Oh, that could never happen', but get upset when Michelle Yeoh scales a wall. This is fantasy, people. Some of us are able to go with it, and enjoy it for what it is.  If you want reality, try staying home and watching the news.As far as subtitles... don't be afraid of a little reading.  It might actually do you some good. Remember, reading is fundamental.Now for those of you who are still reading this and willing to watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon... you will not be disappointed.I am far from a martial arts expert, but this is one of, if not the best martial art films I have ever seen.  The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed, and lightning fast.  The acting was superb, and the soundtrack fits the movie as well as humanly possible.I was enthralled by the relationship between Chow Yun Fat, and Michelle Yeoh's characters. They are both strong, dedicated, and loyal individuals that have an unbreakable bond. One should be so lucky to go through this life with such a 'partner'.In closing, you do not have to be a Kung Fu, or Karate film buff to enjoy this film...... You just have to be open minded and willing to be immersed in a world of fantasy.",8,0,0,21 June 2001
This Is Spinal Tap," Every musician should be forced to watch this film!
","Spinal Tap is one of the funniest and witty films ever made.  Every musician I have ever known has seen this film and loves it just as much as I do.  I am afraid that non-musicians, or at least those not into music will not appreciate this film's humor.  There are so many 'in' jokes about the music industry, that people who only listen to the radio while driving their car will not 'get it'.For those of 'us' who 'get it', we realize that Rob Reiner, Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest have created a film that should be on display at the Smithsonian (or at least the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame).McKean, Guest, along with Harry Shearer have tricked many people into believing that they are a legitimate band.  Come to think of it, they could be. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie.  If you are a musician, go and buy the DVD.",10,0,1,4 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's Final Disturbing Yet Enthralling Masterpiece
","Stanley Kubrick's last film is one of the most tense films I have ever viewed.  While watching it, I felt things were moving slow at times. Thinking back... I realize the tempo of this film was necessary. His directing style is similar to a composition played by a great musician. Just as the notes not played by a musician are as important as the notes played, Kubrick's sense of space and moments of silence are equally important. These quiet 'disturbing' moments build tension, which would otherwise be lost, if continuous banter took place in its stead.The acting in this film is very well done and appropriate, but the real star here is Kubrick. Everything in this film gels just right. The lighting, framing, and melding of scenes are just perfect. The music also suits this film perfectly. Never has one sustained note meant so much to a film. Even the look and feel of New York is dead on even though the film was done entirely in England. The only thing I disliked about this film was realizing it would be Kubrick's last masterpiece. It is a shame that great things must come to an end.",8,0,0,11 October 1999
The Iron Giant," This is one of the best films I have seen this year.
","The Iron Giant is a masterpiece.  I brought my child to see this film and found myself enjoying it more than they did.  As a matter of fact I think I enjoyed it more than anyone in the theater that day.  The Iron Giant will make you laugh, and it most certainly will put a tear in your eye.  This is the most heart wrenching and exciting tale I have seen this year.  When this movie is released on video I will be the first in line to buy it.  It not only is a beautiful film to look at, but it teaches morals like no other animated film I have ever seen (and I am a HUGE animation fan).  Do yourself a favor and buy this film when it becomes available. This film deserved a better treatment at the box office.  I only hope that video sales will help to make a profit for this great film.  If not, Warner Brothers and other studios might be afraid of losing money on other similar movies and that would be a shame.",10,1,2,15 November 1999
True Romance," The best Quentin Tarantino film yet!
","This film is nothing short of brilliant because of Quentin Tarantino's dialogue.  This film is brutal, funny, and intelligent all at the same time. I have an affinity for Mr. Tarantino's films, but none more than this one. Everything about this movie is fantastic.  Christian Slater leads the all star cast.  Other actors include Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, and too many others to mention. In layman's terms Christian Slater plays Clarence a comic book store clerk who is down on his luck.  He meets Alabama (a hooker, unbeknownst to him) and falls in love.  When Clarence tries to make an innocent woman out of her, all hell breaks loose.  Murder, drug deals, and more murder take place. Somehow Quentin (the screen writer... he does not direct this film) is able to pull this off while making us (at least me) laugh the entire time.Like other Quentin flicks this movie is not for the weak stomached.  For those of us with a good constitution, this movie is delectable.",10,0,1,15 November 1999
