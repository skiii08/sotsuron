Black Swan," Trash
","Avoid any film where the director or production team or cast have an ofsky or escu or iski at the end of their name. Mind numbing, pretentious trash.It is to be hoped that Vincent Cassel sees the error of his ways and returns to France tout suite. If it's supposed to be a melodrama about somebody going mad to achieve perfection they could have made a film about Jimmy my mechanic. He has the same smashed up fingers and toes and scraped shoulders from crawling under my Mercedes. He also goes off the rails when he can't find the faults. 20 cigarettes later he gets over it and his ready for his next flounce. Pas de Deux my foot, more like Pas De Dah.The film could have been cut in half to tell the same story. As for the mother figure - she should have been axed to death to some Beethoven music.If Natalie Portman needs any spot removing cream I'm sure my Jimmy will oblige.Mr.Aronofsky use your talents elsewhere and leave the intelligent horror style films to Dario Argento or Guillermo del Toro. At least they know what they're doing.",1,11,19,15 March 2011
In Bruges," A Stroke Of Genius
","I rarely heap unqualified praise on a film as I can generally find something to get my claws in but not with 'In Bruges'. It is a masterpiece of black comedy. I loved it so much I watched it twice in seven days and could watch it again and again and still laugh.It is one of those films where, as they say, the chemistry is perfect. Gleeson's performance is stupendous. A large brooding man with a soft interior acts as the perfect foil for Farrel's almost manic character. The script is superbly crafted and the timing of these two actors would put many a stand up comedian to shame.I admire the director for selecting Bruges for the backdrop. How many more 'cockney gangsta' films must we see that are shot in London? He has broken the mould.I have to admit I have no liking for Ralph Fiennes. How could anybody like a pratt that insists on being called Rafe and not Ralph? Conceit or what? Having said that his character performance is brilliant. It goes from parody to menacing and his face and accent for the role fit the bill perfectly.I think it's going to be a long long time before I see another film of this calibre.I would shower this film with awards and it is to be hoped the Director/Writer gets busy with some more high class entertainment.Excellent!",10,4,7,20 September 2008
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen Films Are Now Made In China
","That's right, you read it correctly. Woody Allen's films are made in China. Somewhere on the outskirts of Beijing a small factory is churning out Woody Allen films by the million. They are not too hard to make. Just get a few actors, tell them it's a gab fest add a few neuroses, some middle class food and music with a splash of wine and you have the perfect Woody Allen film.Had it not been for my liking of Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz - see Almodovar - I wouldn't have watched this film. No doubt Bardem will put this on his list of bad memories. Ditto Cruz.It is truly atrocious and so dated. It says nothing. The most annoying part of the film was the commentary running over some of the action. Did I say action? I apologise. Maybe Allen as aimed this film at people who are stupid or suffer from dementia. I have never felt so patronised by such an inane commentary and it wasn't even funny.Next time I want to watch a film centered around Spain it won't be directed by Mr. Clich√©.",Null,4,11,25 July 2009
