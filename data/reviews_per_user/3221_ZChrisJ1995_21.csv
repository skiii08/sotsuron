The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The inevitable calm before the storm
","The Games may be over, but the revolution is just beginning. 'Mockingjay - Part 1' repeats the same formula present in many of these current two-part adaptations of popular literary works: a slow-paced, exposition-laden first half that will be undoubtedly contrasted with its fiery, action-driven conclusion due to be released next year. Although the decision to do this makes 'Mockingjay - Part 1' so far the weakest in the Hunger Games quadrilogy, solid performances and an overbearing sense of dread still make 'Part 1' a worthy installment in the dystopian series. As the twelve districts amass against the oppressive Capitol, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) finds herself being used as a propaganda tool to garner support for the revolutionaries. She also finds her loyalties divided between those she is being encouraged to inspire, and those who are held captive in the Capitol, including friend/love interest Peeta (Josh Hutcherson).Like with the previous two productions, much of the film's success rests on Lawrence's more-than-capable shoulders. Her character shifts effortlessly back and forth from a reluctant victim of circumstance to a full-fledged freedom fighter. The actress can be just as dedicated in roles such as these as to those for which she has been Oscar-nominated (Winter's Bone, Silver Linings Playbook). Many of the other previously prominent characters, such as Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Peeta, are relegated largely to the sidelines in this installment, though they surely will receive their fair share of moments in the concluding entry. By taking a much slower, introspective approach, the film is perhaps able to reach a much deeper form of social and political commentary, as well as further insight into Katniss' now even more flawed psyche. Clear comparisons can be drawn between the turbulent climate Katniss is thrust into and the current relationships between first and third-world civilizations. Though this setting already provides an unnerving cinematic experience, the similarities displayed in real life make it all the more closer to home. The decision to split the final book adaptation into two films inevitably deprives 'Mockingjay - Part 1' of a sufficient third act. We get a great build-up, but no pay-off, something which will unfortunately have to wait until next year. However, as far as build-ups go, 'Mockingjay - Part 1' does the job well, refamiliarizing its audience with the chaotic world of Panem, its pivotal characters, as well as effectively raising the stakes for 2015's even-more-anticipated climax.",7,4,20,27 November 2014
Captain Phillips," Intense, well-acted thriller that packs a punch
","I was initially skeptical upon hearing that Tom Hanks was cast in a depiction of the Maersk Alabama hijacking, expecting that the result would be an overly sentimental, overly sensationalized presentation of the events that transpired. Nevertheless, I was happy to find that 'Captain Phillips' is a realistically acted and surprisingly intense film that sits along the likes of 'The Pianist' and '127 Hours' in the survival film sub-genre. Hanks portrays the titular captain with ease and competence, convincingly giving the impression of a perfectly ordinary man placed in extraordinary circumstances. As the situation he is placed in becomes more and more desperate, Phillips in turn becomes more desperate, which is once again executed brilliantly by Hanks. Barkhad Abid, in his first role, is almost flawless in his portrayal of Muse, the pirate leader. He remains both sympathetic, as well as utterly terrifying, like a wild animal trapped in a corner. I consider it highly likely that both of these actors will receive Oscar nominations for their performances. The film does quite a good job at presenting both sides of the story, ensuring that the pirates are not seen as purely evil. However, this could have been a bit more successful if more time was spent displaying the conditions in which the Somalians live, in order to achieve maximum sympathy. Paul Greengrass, like his involvement in the Bourne films, directs the film in a grounded, realistic manner, with consistent use of hand-held cameras making the film feel like a documentary. The pacing likewise adds to this sense of realism. Roughly half of the film occurs on board a lifeboat in which Phillips has been taken hostage, yet the result is never boring, as the sheer intensity of the experience had me at the edge of my seat constantly. 'Captain Phillips' is an excellent film, both in regards to its acting and pacing. The end result is an intelligent, grounded and thoroughly exhilarating production that makes good use of the talent involved, both on screen and off.Recommended viewing.",8,0,3,27 October 2013
The Expendables 2," Delivers exactly what you expect - a big dumb action movie
","What I love about this film is that it offers no pretenses or attempts to be something that it's not. The Expendables 2 is a big dumb action movie - exactly what its audience wants. After the events of the first film, Barney Ross and his band of mercenaries are once again called into action, this time to retrieve a top-secret device from a military plane that was shot down in Albania. Unfortunately this plan goes awry and one of their own is killed. The Expendables then must pool their resources and skills together once again in order to combat their new nemesis, Jean Villain, played by the Muscles from Brussels himself, Jean-Claude Van Damme. I enjoyed that in this film The Expendables were motivated to act by revenge as opposed to money, as in the first film, as this makes their mission much more sincere and personal. Likewise the humour in this film is cranked up a notch, both physical and verbal, a highlight being Dolph Lundgren's Gunnar Jensen delivery of many pathetic attempts at seduction to Yu Nan's Maggie Chan, to the audience's amusement. Whilst much humour can be found in the film, there are many flaws with the script, ensuring countless cringe-worthy moments, for example the consistent use of Chuck Norris jokes in relation to his character Booker. Likewise, I found myself awkwardly shifting in my seat during the scene in which the mercenaries recount what they wish their last meal to be, with Maggie Chan describing a traditional Chinese dish as 'sexy'. It's a welcome sight to see so many action movie icons condensed into one film, although some, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris, are not given enough screen time, and seem to be randomly thrown into the movie as deux ex machinas. Nevertheless, it still is a wondrous sight to witness Schwarzenegger, Norris and Bruce Willis standing side by side, mowing down rows of bad guys with automatic weapons. As can be gathered, the action (and violence) is extraordinary, with bombings, airplane crashes, knifings, shootings, decapitations and neck-snappings filling up the screen from start to finish in its infinite goriness. The Expendables 2 really isn't a film for the faint-hearted. Whilst the script and some of the characters need some obvious refinement, this is expected. It shouldn't come as a surprise that The Expendables 2 isn't nominated for a Best Original Screenplay award. Rather, it fills this void with a plethora of classic action stars and stunning, testosterone-fuelled action in a tribute to the action genre and its place in the 1980's. This is exactly what its audience (and I myself) wanted and expected when watching this film, nothing more, nothing less. 6/10.",6,1,3,27 September 2012
John Wick," A solid return to form for Keanu Reeves, and a rare standout action flick
","After a recent barrage of rather forgettable action films, it's refreshing to see that 'John Wick' provides excellently-choreographed, energized fight sequences as well as elaborate chase scenes, in addition to a likable protagonist who you can easily root for. In essence a revenge flick, 'John Wick' details the titular ex-hit-man's mission to hunt down the people that stole his car and killed his dog, the latter being a final gift from his deceased wife. As it turns out, the people he's pursuing are related to his former employer. I'm not the hugest fan of Keanu Reeves as an actor, but he nails the role of John. It's largely a physical performance, with John being a seemingly introverted, rarely talkative individual. This sympathetic, almost vulnerable side is juxtapositioned effortlessly with the brutal, merciless part of him that reawakens on his quest for vengeance. A great return to form for someone who hasn't really had a decent role since 'The Matrix Trilogy' or 'A Scanner Darkly'. A lot of the other cast members, such as Willem Dafoe and John Leguizamo, as well as a surprisingly large amount of people who have worked on HBO programs, receive very limited screen time considering their impressive portfolios. Nevertheless, they are all still able to maintain a hefty screen presence. Being directed by a stunt choreographer, it doesn't really come as a surprise that 'John Wick' has some ridiculously well-made shootouts and car chases. A highlight is John's rampage through a nightclub, gunning down countless dozens of thugs in his pursuit of his dog's killer. As opposed to a lot of the uninspired, uninventive cinematic action releases of recent years, 'John Wick's' set-pieces maintain a highly fluid and energetic quality.The film itself has an interesting portrayal of the complex criminal underworld that lies right on the brink of normal society, a world that John is forced to return to. Everyone appears to know each other (John included), from 'waste disposers' to bartenders to hotel guests. It comes across as an unorthodox (yet welcome) hybrid of Guy Ritchie and David Lynch tropes. On the whole, 'John Wick' is a standout production in a list of otherwise banal recent action films, aided by its excellently-crafted actions scene, and a solid protagonist in the form of Keanu Reeve's John.",7,24,50,10 November 2014
Fury," A perfectly competent war film, bolstered by impressive performances and fierce action set-pieces
","While nowhere near as good as it obvious influences, such as 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Fury' is still an effective and competent entry in the war genre, aided by its talented cast and intense, harrowing battle sequences.'Fury' follows the five-man crew of the titular tank as they travel across Nazi Germany during the later days of WWII, focusing on the atrocities they encounter, and sometimes generate themselves. Though the performances of all five primary actors are great, the two that stood out for me were Logan Lerman as Norman, who gradually evolves from an inexperienced typist to a battle-hardened warrior, and Joe Bernthal as Grady, a brutish, ill-tempered loader who constantly mumbles. Brad Pitt does his usual leading man gig without difficulty, and Shia LaBeouf and Michael Peña aren't given enough screen time, but work well with what they're given. The film's numerous set pieces are brilliantly choreographed and stylised but claustrophobic and intense at the same time. The scenes in which Fury's crew take on a German Tiger, as well as its stand against 300 Nazi soldiers, are some of the most effective I've seen in recent years. Like many of its forebears, 'Fury' strives the capture the insanity and chaos of war, not only that created by the 'enemy in the distance' but also by Allied fighters. Just as Nazi soldiers are displayed gunning down civilians, in several scenes Fury's crew harasses German citizens and coldly executes captured unarmed soldiers. In contrast, there are other scenes where not only Fury's crew, but also German soldiers, are seen acting selflessly. The message would appear to be that war can bring out both the worst and the best in people, regardless of their affiliation. Sure, it doesn't have as much emotional impact as say 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Platoon' in this revisionist, attemptedly unbiased approach, but 'Fury' still manages to be a hard-hitting, perfectly acceptable modern war film that doesn't shy away from portraying its protagonists in a morally ambiguous light.",8,33,65,28 October 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Solid Sci-fi Escapism
","After a four year hiatus, J.J. Abrams has brought out a sequel to the critically acclaimed Star Trek reboot, and on the whole it is a satisfying return, if not as fresh.After a series of terrorist attacks by former Starfleet agent 'John Harrison' (Benedict Cumberbatch), the crew of the starship Enterprise launch a mission to retrieve the fugitive and make him face justice. As can be implied, there is more to Harrison's plot than mere anarchy, and returning leads Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto), are forced to face their own motivations and allegiances in this high-stakes sci-fi adventure.What is always good about sequels is that, having already introduced the primary characters, the film can warp straight ahead (see what I did there) into the narrative. In doing so, we are treated to an awesome opening sequence, in which the Enterprise's crew must save a primitive civilization from an erupting volcano. This gives an idea of the overall pace of the film, one that hardly relents in its breakneck speed and overall aura of suspense and excitement.The clash between Kirk's hot-headed approach to problems and Spock's logical conclusions is no longer one of the primary focuses of the film, though their unusual relationship is still covered, with humorous results. Scotty (Simon Pegg) is in fine form once again as a strong source of the film's comedy. Other crew members, such as Chekov (Anton Yelchin) and Sulu (John Cho), aren't given an awful lot of screen time, which is to be expected in a film that has just over two hours to explore multiple planets and plot devices.The real highlight in terms of performances, however, is Benedict Cumberbatch as the elusive John Harrison, who obviously has much more significance in the Star Trek continuity than his name initially implies. Harrison is both brutal and demented, as well as sophisticated and ingenious, a kind of warped, evil version of the Sherlock Holmes that he is renowned for playing.Michael Giacchino's score, as in the first film, is utterly fantastic, evoking the tone of epic swashbucklers and classic 80's blockbusters. The set pieces as well are well above the quality of those in most recent multimillion dollar action films. There is the odd moment where a reference to previous Star Trek films or series a thrown in awkwardly, though this is only sporadic.On the whole, Star Trek Into Darkness is a commendable, solid action-adventure which I would rank more or less on par with its 2009 prequel, with highlights including Cumberbatch's performance, and the scale of some of the action sequences. I would recommend this for most cinema-goers who are looking for a fun escape that has a great balance of humour and action, something which J.J. Abrams has pulled off successfully numerous times.Final note: Though not ESSENTIAL, I would recommend viewing the 2009 film if you have not already. It gives a proper introduction to many of this film's characters and provides a proper context for the reboot series' continuity.",8,3,6,22 May 2013
Taxi Driver," Stunning portrait of an alienated sociopath
","Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is a disturbed man. Stricken with insomnia, he decides to enrol as a taxi driver in order to pass the time. What follows is a descent into madness, brutality and vigilantism. De Niro portrays the titular protagonist/antagonist in what can only be described as a masterpiece, both for him as an actor and for Martin Scorsese as a director. The film's intense depiction of urban decay, and Travis' equally intense reactions to this corruption, have gone down (and will continue to go down) as a milestone in cinematic history. Initially, it is relatively easy to sympathize with Bickle. He is a lonely man, lost and without purpose. After several failed attempts at socialization, he finally manages to acquire a date with a beautiful political volunteer (Cybill Shepherd). When this ends miserably, Bickle's personality takes an even more twisted turn, with him becoming increasingly concerned with ridding the streets of New York from the scum that inhabit them and his taxi. His actions (and his motives) become more and more elusive. By the end of the film, amid all the bloodshed and mayhem, it has become nearly impossible to understand Travis. Scorsese's use of New York City is remarkable, with obscure angles and shots highlighting and contributing to the alienation and seediness that Travis and the audience are made to feel. Bernard Herrmann's ominous score likewise punctuates this overbearing feeling of dread and despair. Performances from now-veterans Harvey Keitel and Jodie Foster all help contrast with De Niro's. Whilst Sport and Iris thrive and survive by indulging in the corruption of the city, Travis attempts to destroy this corruption, yet in doing so becomes something far more sinister. The film's ending has inspired countless debates as to its meaning, with critics and audiences seeking closure. In my opinion, this lack of closure is a perfect ending, as we are left to decide whether Travis is at all redeemable, ultimately an unanswerable question. If I have one complaint (and this is only a minor one), it is that the violence, due to the inevitabilities of time, has lost a bit of its impact. Today, you'll be hard-pressed not to find a modern mindless blockbuster that contains more hard-hitting violence and gore. Yet, the film's message (and a depressing one at that) remains as strong as it was thirty-six years ago. Must-see viewing.",9,1,2,24 October 2013
Interstellar," A terrific addition to the science-fiction genre
","Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' is arguably his most ambitious film yet, traveling beyond the relatively grounded settings of his Earth-based productions for a film of much more galactic proportions. The result is probably not his best film, but still an immensely impressive sci-fi production that will likely stand the test of time to be included as a solid example of the genre. The film follows the crew of the Endurance as they attempt to find a habitable planet to replace a gradually dying terra firma. Incorporated into this include wormholes, black holes, time dilation and extra-dimensional beings. Stylistically and structurally, the film is similar to '2001: A Space Odyssey', but also appears to draw inspiration from various other sci-fi classics such as 'Contact' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. Unlike other modern sci-fi productions that seem to consist largely of unsubtle, action-oriented alien invasion flicks, 'Interstellar' goes for a much more minimalist, slowly-paced approach, in accordance with its above-mentioned inspirations. The result is a film that is much more cerebral and emotionally-balanced, as is to be expected from Nolan. Matthew McConaughey delivers the role of Cooper without fault, effortlessly portraying a man who is forced to leave his young family behind, a period which becomes decades on Earth. This inner turmoil grows gradually across the narrative. Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain also have their moments, but a lot of the cast exist largely as plot functions, their dialogue consisting predominantly of exposition. This is naturally expected though, for a film of this scope. A certain A-list actor appears roughly halfway through the film as well, and is also an unexpected highlight. As with other Nolan films, the score provided by Hans Zimmer, as well as the impressive visuals and cinematography flawlessly compliment each other, building up gently before reaching a grand crescendo in the film's metaphysical climax. Zimmer appears to go for a more lighter score this time around, as opposed to the intense, bass-driven soundtracks of 'The Dark Knight' and 'Inception', which ultimately works well with the film's melancholy atmosphere. The film's third act introduces a lot of plot twists and turns, which inevitably requires some suspension of disbelief. The laws of physics, time and space are bent to their limitations, which may be intimidating and overwhelming for some audiences but never failed to impress me and others due to the sheer scope and imagination of the final sequences' architects. 'Interstellar' is a mind-bending journey into the far reaches of the universe, as well as an emotional expose of the lengths the human race is capable of going to in order to ensure its survival. Though perhaps relying too much on previous sci-fi classics, particularly in its final act, it doesn't exactly reach the heights of some of Nolan's previous films. This isn't saying much however. The film's ambition and concept, its cast, visuals and score all will inevitably ensure that 'Interstellar' stands out in a wave of mediocre modern science fiction films, as well as all sci-fi films in general.",9,1,5,11 November 2014
Nightcrawler," An eerie neo-noir production featuring Jake Gyllenhaal at his creepiest
","'Nightcrawler' details the exploits of Louis Bloom, an emotionally disturbed and likely sociopathic yet highly motivated young man who takes up freelance crime photography after witnessing cameramen taking footage of a car crash. As he propels through the ranks at the local news station to which he sells his films, he becomes more and more directly involved in the crimes that he documents. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a highly disquieting performance as Bloom, in what is arguably his best role yet. Though Louis immediately comes off as friendly and charming, you can't help but feel that this is just a mask, and that something much more dark and sinister bubbles just below the surface. This becomes much more apparent across the course of the film, as Louis freely extorts and manipulates others to get to his desired goals, without a shred of remorse. Virtually no backstory is granted for him, making him, and all of his unique tics and traits, all the more enigmatic and creepy. Other key characters, such as Nina (Rene Russo) and Rick (Riz Ahmed) are forced to play into Lou's plans, with great dramatic effect. The majority of the crimes that Lou film are only clearly shown through the grainy footage that he provides to his go-to news station, making we, the audience, feel as if we are also perpetuating and participating in his depraved acts. This coupled with Lou's gradual transition from passive filmmaker to borderline crime instigator makes for an uneasy viewing experience. Like Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Drive' (2011), 'Nightcrawler' has a distinct 80's neo-noir vibe, with a stylistic use of minimal lighting and synthesizer-driven soundtrack, which all help contribute to the production's haunting atmosphere. The end result is a hard-hitting, compelling film that forces audiences to question their own obsession with violent media and sensationalist news production. This, combined with a bold yet brilliant performance from Gyllenhaal makes 'Nightcrawler' must-see viewing.",9,2,3,2 December 2014
Gone Girl," Another stylistic masterpiece from David Fincher
","David Fincher's career has been defined by grim, bleak productions with an underlying dark sense of humour, and 'Gone Girl' is no exception. While not as good as the likes of 'Se7en' and 'Fight Club', 'Gone Girl' is still an excellent production, and up there with the year's best films. The initial premise of the film is whether Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) has murdered his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). However, the film takes multiple plot twists and turns, making the matter much more complicated than it initially appears. The two leads are fantastic, but Pike is the real highlight, flawlessly portraying a woman who has some serious relationship problems to say the least. A potential Best Actress nominee. Other stand-out performers include Neil Patrick Harris, who takes a rare serious role without any difficulty, as well as Tyler Perry as idiosyncratic defence attorney Tanner Bolt. 'Gone Girl' carries on Fincher's current tradition of a highly polished visual style juxtapositioned with its morbid subject matter, complimented by its crisp editing and cinematography. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who provided the soundtrack for both 'The Social Network' and 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' are likewise a familiar addition, with the score provided by them being mostly minimalist, yet perfectly tied-in to the on-screen occurrences and the film's grim tone. As an adaptation of the popular 2012 novel, 'Gone Girl' doesn't disappoint, removing certain elements that are superfluous or unnecessary, yet still strictly sticking to the unique plot structure and maintaining the novel's cynical view of marriage and long-term relationships. It would seem that Fincher and author/screenwriter Gillian Flynn are a match made in cinematic heaven. Highly-recommended viewing.",9,3,15,2 October 2014
The Bourne Legacy," Not really a Bourne film...
","If you're looking for a prime example of an unnecessary sequel, look no further. Though Edward Norton's Byer states that 'Bourne was just the tip of the iceberg', The Bourne Legacy, instead of going beneath the surface and exploring more of the story, chips away at a completely different iceberg, and in the end has very little to do with the original trilogy of Bourne films.Brief clips and flashes from The Bourne Ultimatum incorporated in here reveal that due to Jason Bourne's actions, shady government organisations must terminate all evidence of Treadstone and Outcome operations, including test subjects, in order to escape exposure. One such target is Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, who is now meant to be Matt Damon's successor in the franchise. Here most of the similarities between the original films and Legacy cease, and the film starts to go off in its own direction. Cross must now evade assassination and find specific 'chems', pills that allow him to retain his physical and mental superiority.Though Renner in recent years has proved himself as a formidable action star through the likes of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol and The Avengers, he is by no means Jason Bourne, and the film consequently is left with an evident Matt Damon-shaped empty space. Likewise, Rachel Weisz's love interest, as opposed to Franka Potente and Julia Stiles, doesn't do much but stand there and scream for the majority of her screen time. This is a shame, as both actors have proved themselves over the years as being quite skilled in their craft, but unfortunately they have been thrown into unsuitable roles. Likewise, whilst Joan Allen and Albert Finney (veterans of the previous films) make appearances, they could have had a much more significant screen presence. Edward Norton, as well, feels significantly underused.The gritty, 'shaky-cam' cinematography utilised by Paul Greengrass is sorely missed in this film, thereby depriving The Bourne Legacy of its sense of realism, effectively giving it the appearance of just another action movie. Whilst the set-pieces in the previous film's were at least moderately plausible, action scenes in Legacy seem just plain silly. For example, Cross forces a large, vicious wolf to swallow a tracking device before it is annihilated by a military drone. It is also has a hideously anti-climatic ending, especially seeing the amount of plot points and twists that it sets up.Don't get me wrong, The Bourne Legacy is not a bad film. The story itself is quite riveting and exhilarating, and some of the action scenes, such as an intense motorbike chase through the streets of Manila, are amongst some of the best I've seen in recent years. The problem is that the Bourne Legacy, though standing by itself as a component action film, doesn't have a significant role or position in the Bourne series. Whilst Identity, Supremacy and Ultimatum are a succinct, well-structured and written series of films that are a unique addition to the spy sub-genre, Legacy feels out of place, and in many ways inferior in comparison, not to mention having little to do with the other films. It would have been much better if they retitled the film completely, for instance calling it The Cross Conspiracy, and severed it from The Bourne franchise.The Bourne Legacy, despite being a decent action/thriller film in its own right, lives in the shadow of its predecessors, and suffers from the absence of Matt Damon. It is a prime example of a studio trying to milk a successful franchise, and though it should be viewed for its interesting storyline and its substantial action, should not be considered a serious addition to the Bourne series.6/10",6,0,4,28 September 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," The Marvel formula brews magic yet again
","If you enjoyed 'The Avengers', 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier', or any of the numerous Marvel Cinematic Universe productions, inquire no further. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' maintains Marvel Studios' solid winning streak with its vibrant mix of action, humor and heart. Out of the five titular protagonists, it's Rocket, a hyper-intelligent, hyper-cocky raccoon, and Groot, a sentient humanoid tree, that steal the show, however all of these misfits receive their time in the spotlight, with their unique personalities and traits. This is countered by the film's overly one-dimensional, archetypal villains. The special effects are fantastic, the screenplay is witty and pop- culture savvy and the fight scenes are inventive and well-choreographed. As opposed to a largely orchestra-driven soundtrack, 'Guardians' makes a bold choice of using '70's pop music, which ultimately fits in well with the film's happy-go-lucky tone. Certain actors, such as Benicio Del Toro and Glenn Close, don't receive nearly enough screen time that they deserve, but work well with what they're given. In terms of the MCU, 'Guardians' introduces concepts (and refers to devices present in other installments) that will obviously make a greater impact further down the road, such as out first decent look at the MCU's Big Bad. This is what the Star Wars prequel trilogy could have (and should have) been like. Recommended viewing.",8,1,4,8 August 2014
The Imitation Game," A fascinating portrait of a troubled innovator
","The life and career of mathematician Alan Turing would have always made an excellent biopic, so the success of 'The Imitation Game' in terms of its narrative shouldn't come as a surprise. This is coupled with a masterful performance from Benedict Cumberbatch as the enigmatic Turing. Though featuring little to no battle scenes in a film centered on WWII, 'The Imitation Game' rarely has any trouble depicting the high stakes facing its protagonist and his peers. Every second they toil away in their attempts to crack Nazi codes means more and more lives lost in the brutal conflict encompassing the globe. Cumberbatch portrays Turing as a brilliant if highly socially awkward innovator. He twitches and stutters constantly, with all of these seemingly insignificant physical traits and tics contributing to this depiction. As he struggles with external forces attempting to clamp down on his work, as well as his repressed homosexuality, Turing becomes, and behaves, more and more erratically. In recent years Cumberbatch has established himself as an acting powerhouse, and his role in 'The Imitation Game' will surely be added to the top of his portfolio. Many parallels are drawn between the revolutionary Nazi code-cracking computer Turing designs and Turing himself, an individual who at many points is deemed by his peers to be more machine than man. The supporting cast help strengthen this image, their unique, bubbly personalities contrasting with Turing's withdrawn nature. Like 'The Social Network, 'The Imitation Game' functions as both a terrific historical account of technological innovation, as well as a fascinating character study of the depths one will go to to ensure the survival of their work. However, unlike The Social Network's Mark Zuckerberg, who is presented largely as a Machiavellian antagonist, Alan Turing is presented as a tragic hero, a man who helped save possibly millions of lives, but was ultimately punished ruthlessly for his personal life.",9,3,9,12 January 2015
Whiplash," Intense performances and a brutal outlook make this a must-see
","'Whiplash' concerns the efforts of Andrew Neyman (Miles Teller), a jazz drummer student who desperately wants to become 'one of the greats'. This desire is fiercely challenged by his perfectionist, borderline emotionally abusive conductor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). The performances of the two leads are simply fantastic. Miles Teller, relying on small mannerisms and facial tics, is flawlessly able to come across as a highly introverted, yet highly motivated protagonist. JK Simmons on the other hand, excretes aggression and confidence to deliver one of the most terrifying and captivating cinematic roles I've seen in recent years. An almost definite Best Supporting Actor nominee. The film perfectly captures the intensity and ruthlessness surrounding those trying to break into creative industries. As opposed to going down the cliché-ridden path of showing Andrew being gently fostered and motivated into the jazz scene by a kind, caring professor, 'Whiplash' shows the protagonist being relentlessly put down again and again, almost reaching psychological breaking point in the process. In adopting this brutal, cynical approach, 'Whiplash' takes what could have been another generic, bland music-themed film and turns it into an intense psychological study of the lengths one can go to to realise their dreams, giving it all the suspense and potency of any classic Hitchcockian thriller. Must-see viewing.",9,1,5,21 October 2014
The Conjuring," A rare decent modern horror film
","Over the past 10-15 years, cinema-goers have been subjected to an endless parade of bland, watered-down and just in general uninspired horror films, with pathetic remakes of previous classics being a common occurrence. Therefore it's a pleasant surprise when a contemporary horror film pops up that actually provides decent scares, as well as a convincing plot and commendable cast.The Conjuring tells the apparently-true story of the Perron family, who are terrorised by various malevolent spirits after purchasing a new house. Gradually these experiences become more intense, so much so that they employ the services of two paranormal investigators, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, to help diffuse the problem. The film is excellent in terms of pacing, with there being a heavy reliance on the building of suspense, as opposed to resorting to cheap jump-scares every five minutes, a vice that most other modern horrors bear almost like a badge of honor. Small bumps in the middle of the night steadily mold into much more terrifying occurrences. I would liken the experience to the pacing in other evil spirit-related films such as the original Amityville Horror and The Exorcist. The characters themselves are surprisingly more than just sex-crazed, teenage chainsaw-fodder. The various members of the Perron family all have unique personalities and traits, making them believable, and therefore relatively easy to relate to. Likewise, dialogue between the two demonologists, as opposed to just providing plot information, gives the impression of a genuine, loving couple.The cinematography and mise-en-scene is perfectly suited for the film's creepy atmosphere, with dark, misty lakes and uncomfortable wide-angles and close-ups contributing to an overall, over-bearing feeling of dread.The film also successfully uses new techniques in terms of generating this deep sense of fear and unpleasantness, with for instance the game of hide-and-clap providing one or two memorable instances. Ultimately, The Conjuring is by no means on par with classics such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Evil Dead, but nevertheless it is a drastic improvement on the standard toned-down, unimaginative rubbish that is repeatedly churned out today. There is a real sense of nostalgia for horror flicks of the '70's within the film, which were clearly used as inspiration for James Wan when creating this above-average shocker. Recommended viewing, for both fans of classics and new audiences.",7,1,2,31 July 2013
The Water Diviner," A solid directing debut from Russell Crowe, and an effective antiwar statement
","Often I'm skeptical when a prominent actor tries to transition into the director's chair, but luckily Russell Crowe does a decent job in his first motion picture behind the camera (as well as in front of). What I liked about 'The Water Diviner' was its mostly successful balancing of both the perspectives of the citizens of Australia and Turkey. As opposed to merely painting the Turks as the anonymous 'enemies-in-the- distance' that appear frequently in many Gallipoli-centered war films, the Turks are portrayed predominantly in a positive light, with Crowe's character forming many close relationships with them. Many vital Turkish cities and landmarks such as the Gallipoli peninsula and Istanbul are utilised well in order to both highlight and give respect to Turkish culture and history. Russell Crowe plays basically the same role he does in every other film he's in, a stoic, blokish man's man who relentlessly searches for his sons who went missing in combat in this foreign land. The film is also helped by an impressive supporting cast, with Cem Yilmaz being a highlight as a compassionate Turkish sergeant. However, you can't help but be surprised at certain points why certain Australian and international actors were cast as Turkish characters, though these roles were still executed quite well. Like many war/postwar/anti-war films, 'The Water Diviner' can occasionally dip into some overly sentimental, melodramatic territory, however these are overshadowed by some truly hard-hitting, harrowing scenes. One in particular, during the last act of the film, really packs a punch (you'll know it when you see it). Now nearly at the 100-year anniversary of the failed Gallipoli campaign, it seems fitting that 'The Water Diviner' contains a much more retrospective, melancholy depiction of the conflict. There aren't really any winners in war. On either side fathers and sons disappear off the face of the earth, leaving gaping holes in the lives of those that remain. With careful, considerate storytelling and directing, 'The Water Diviner' is able to convey this message.",7,7,22,7 January 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," A Brilliant Conclusion to an Amazing Trilogy
","Having stepped out of the cinema on premiere day, I was overwhelmed by the sheer scale and emotional resonance of what I had just witnessed. The Dark Knight Rises, the final instalment of Christopher Nolan's celebrated Batman trilogy, has not only met my expectations but in many ways has exceeded such.The film replaces much of the humour of the previous two in favour of a grim, melancholy tone, though this in no way negatively impacts on the final production. Bruce Wayne, both mentally and physically, is a broken man. Having given up the Batman mantle 8 years previously in order to take the fall for the crimes of District Attorney Harvey Dent, Wayne has lost direction in his life, resolving to live a hermit-like existence. His solidarity is broken by the arrival of Bane, a mysterious, physically-imposing mercenary with strong ideological motives, alongside Selina Kyle, an enigmatic cat burglar. Bruce Wayne must once again become the Batman in order to save Gotham City from the wrath of Bane and his followers.Tom Hardy, due to wearing a large facial mask, develops the character of Bane mostly through his eye movements and uniquely-crafted voice sounding like a blend between Latino and British, which is sometimes inaudible yet I could still pick up the gist of what he was saying. Though he in no manner matches the level of menace and terror created by Ledger's Joker, Bane still proves to be a worthy opponent of Batman, and a terrifying villain nonetheless.Likewise, Anne Hathaway, as Selina Kyle brilliantly executes her character, displaying both vulnerability and seductiveness. Her performance in many ways excels that of Michelle Pfeiffer in Tim Burton's Batman Returns.Regulars such as Gary Oldman and Michael Caine give in my opinion series best performances, their characters Jim Gordan and Alfred, respectively, showing emotional strain and despair after many years of hiding their secrets.Other new characters, like Joseph Gordon-Levitt's John Blake and Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate, receive insufficient screen time and probably would have benefited more if they had been introduced in the previous films.The action set-pieces and battle sequences take The Dark Knight Rises to an entirely new level, with city-wide assaults, car/hovercraft/motorbike chases, riots and hand-to-hand combat scenes dominating the screen, proving this film to be the most action-packed of the series.The Batman costume itself only makes several appearances throughout the film, the first being nearly an hour into the screening. But, like the depressing tone of the film, this in a way enhances the experience, showing a hero who is well and truly on his last legs. Out of the two possible endings that I was expecting for this film (which I won't reveal here), Nolan gives us an entirely different ending, which may polarise some viewers, though I appreciated it immensely. Ultimately, The Dark Knight Rises is about pain and redemption, themes which I feel would appeal to most audiences.In my personal opinion, the Dark Knight Rises is not as good as The Dark Knight (10/10), though it is better than Batman Begins (8/10). Having said that, the film is a brilliant, near-flawless achievement, which provides a stunning conclusion to a trilogy that all involved with its production should be proud of.9/10.",9,4,9,18 August 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Saga Reawakens
","'The Force Awakens' does a fantastic job of recapturing the light-hearted, adventurous tone of the original Star Wars trilogy. While the prequels were bombarded with hammy, melodramatic dialogue and dull and stilted performances, this new instalment features rapid-fire, witty lines and more grounded and likable characters that helped make the originals great. The plot at some points is way too reminiscent of 'A New Hope' (Did we really need another Death Star?), but this was, I suppose, necessary to bring new fans to the fold. There are other points where the film's use of humour overplays its serious elements, but this only happens sporadically. And the film certainly doesn't lack in its hard-hitting, emotional content, particularly towards the end. The new leads do a terrific job of taking up the mantle previously held by Luke, Han and Leia. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is basically a female Luke, but is still able to inject enough originality and believability into her role to not be a cut-and-paste. John Boyega as Finn likewise bears a lot of similarities to Han Solo, through his initial desire to ensure his own survival, yet once again brings plenty of charm and individuality to his role. Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron doesn't get too much screen time in comparison, which is a bit of a shame considering his acting credentials, but this will likely change in the sequel. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) makes a pretty solid villain, but nothing will ever really beat Vader. Unlike the original Dark Lord of the Sith, who remains largely cold and emotionless (at least in the original trilogy), Ren is much more erratic and driven by his emotions, making him a much more unpredictable antagonist. Unlike Luke and Leia, Han gets quite a lot of screen time, taking the form of a sort of mentor figure in the vein of Obi-Wan for Rey and Finn, and at more than 70 years of age, Harrison Ford proves that he's still got it. The set design, visual effects, score and action sequences are all top-notch, with an emphasis on practical backdrops over the heavily green- screened prequels. Regardless of how good 'The Force Awakens' was going to be, I doubt anything would ever top 'A New Hope' or 'The Empire Strikes Back', just based on the sheer cultural impact these earlier films had. It's much better than the prequels, but the film's plot similarities with episode 4 (and to a degree 5) leave a little bit to be desired, as it seems at times like a reboot of the franchise rather than a continuation. Nevertheless, 'The Force Awakens' ends at a point that suggests that the sequels will move off in a new direction. The film's emphasis on likable characters, dialogue-driven humour and old-school thrills ultimately makes it a worthy instalment in the Star Wars saga, and I'm definitely looking forward to what they come up with next.",8,4,19,21 December 2015
Looper," Best sci-fi film of 2012
","Over the years there have been many 'high-concept' sci-fi films to hit our screens, some brilliant but many mediocre. Looper fits the former category, and will in the years to come sit along the likes of The Matrix and Inception.Essentially, the film concerns a titular 'looper' named Joe, whose job is to execute people sent back from the future by criminal organisations. One day, Joe witnesses his future self being sent back, who escapes. In order to protect his life from his employers, Joe must hunt down and kill his former self, who has big plans of his own.Looper has the huge potential to turn into just another shoot-em-up action flick, but luckily the action isn't the primary focus, though when it is present, it is executed well. The film utilises interesting cinematography techniques to give its action scenes a distinct art-house feel, and doesn't go over the top in this sense.Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been repeatedly proving himself as a formidable actor who is willing to tackle difficult roles. Though I wasn't entirely convinced by his makeup, he was flawlessly able to manipulate Bruce Willis' voice and mannerisms. The character Joe himself is likable, with his younger self being motivated by money yet not lacking his humanity. Alternatively, Bruce Willis' performance is reminiscent of his previous portrayal in 12 Monkeys, a similar time-travel film, with his Old Joe being a man tormented by the past and desperate to change it in order to affect the future.It was also interesting seeing Emily Blunt in a role unique to her previous performances, this time as an independent farmer who is haunted by her past treatment of her young son. Here parallels can be drawn between her and Old Joe, both of the individuals being defined and motivated by the past.As with any decent sci-fi films, there are multiple twists and turns in regards to the plot, and this enhances the audience's experience, with the film actually requiring its audience to think as opposed to sitting back and absorbing the action. The concept of time-travel assassinations is interesting enough, though other plot devices such as telekinesis and themes such as redemption are made present, once again enhancing the experience.If I had one complaint, it would be the execution of the conclusion, rather than the conclusion of the plot itself, which I thought was excellent. I'm trying to not reveal too much here, but although the final twist or plot device is delivered brilliantly, the film finishes abruptly after.Through its interesting cinematography techniques and equally thought-provoking concept and plot line, Looper reveals itself as a much welcome addition to the science fiction film genre. Rian Johnson's direction and script, coupled with brilliant performances from the three main leads places the film at the top of this year's sci-fi films, if not the top of this year's films in general.9/10",9,1,15,29 September 2012
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Hyperviolent cartoonish fun
","The second film directed by Matthew Vaughn to be based on a Mark Millar-penned graphic novel series after 2010's insanely brilliant 'Kick-Ass', 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' maintains the former film's stylish mix of pitch black comedy, ultra-violence and creative narrative twists. Essentially a send-up of many classic British spy franchises (most prominently 007), 'Kingsman' focuses on a veteran secret agent (Colin Firth) taking on an inexperienced apprentice (Taron Egerton), with both individuals coming up against a diabolical billionaire (Samuel L. Jackson). The plot's been done to death thousands of times before, but 'Kingsman's' unique self-referential humor and willingness to cross narrative boundaries and defy genre clichÃ©s makes it stand out amid a sea of mediocre espionage films.I was initially worried that Eggsy, the apprentice and the film's main protagonist, was going to be unlikable due to his somewhat arrogant nature, however ultimately Egeton is able to make him a worthy hero by providing the right amount of charm and vulnerability. Colin Firth fits right in as the old-fashioned, gentlemanly Harry Hart, but in some places leaps out of this familiar territory to become a ruthlessly brutal action juggernaut. Samuel L. Jackson is also a terrific watch, with his prominent lisp and aversion to the sight of blood making him a highly unconventional but highly watchable and entertaining villain. As mentioned earlier, like in 'Kick-Ass' before it, 'Kingsman' is genuinely shocking and brutal in certain stages. At other points, over-the-top, ridiculously well-choreographed violence is fused with the film's morbid sense of humor, providing yet another unique viewing experience from Matthew Vaughn. Like his other productions, the success of 'Kingsman' lies largely in its ability to not take itself too seriously, as well as its tendency to both pay homage to and make fun of the other films that have inspired it's creation.Even though it's still relatively early to tell, 'Kingsman' will easily be considered one of the best action films of the year.",8,2,10,13 February 2015
The Hangover Part III," Flawed, yet worthwhile return
","The wolfpack is back, for the last time apparently. But whilst The Hangover Part III is definitely an improvement over the series' carbon copy first sequel, on the whole it still is just a shadow of its former self. Don't get me wrong though, it does have its moments, and is a worthwhile experience in the end.After a rather gruesome incident involving a giraffe, it is decided that Alan is to be placed in a mental home. Of course, Phil, Stu and Doug accompany him to this location. Along the way, they are attacked by a group of criminals who take Doug hostage and threaten to kill him unless the remaining trio retrieve a recently escaped Mr. Chow, who has stolen a substantial amount of money belonging to the criminals.Perhaps after the critical panning that the second film received, Todd Phillips has decided to move in a more original direction plot-wise, completing removing the titular hangover element, in which the protagonists are forced to retrace their steps from the drunken night before. This is quite risky, as it deprives the film of its unpredictability, and instead gives the impression of a standard chase film. Nevertheless, the formula still works, if not as well.In terms of the characters, Ken Jeong as Chow seems to have taken over the comedic role usually played by Zack Galifianakis, who is now reserved to the odd awkward one-liner or moment. Though I loved Chow in the first movie, it does get quite tedious watching him repeatedly yell out phrases such as: 'I LOVE COCAINE!', all for the purpose of a cheap laugh. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms aren't given enough comedic focus as they could, which is a shame, as they are both quite talented and capable of such, as shown by the first film.It's nice to see a lot of references to the previous movies, with appearances from Black Doug, and even Carlos, or Tyler, from the first film. This, alongside the presence of Las Vegas in the final act, is quite a nostalgic turn, inspiring good memories from the original Hangover. The comedy is quite darker than the previous films, which I found worked quite well, even though it sometimes leaned into more of an action-thriller category rather than a standard comedy.Ultimately, although The Hangover Part III does falter, I would recommend viewing it, if anything to say a final farewell to the characters that we have grown to love over the past few years. Though not as funny or as insane as the first film, it is still decent viewing, and there is the odd flash of brilliance, which is something I can't say as sincerely for the second film. It is quite a melancholy, bittersweet affair, as the final scenes do truly indicate that this is the last time we'll see the wolfpack. That is, until the box office returns are revealed.Final note: There's a mid-credits scene which in my opinion is the funniest part of the whole film. Make sure you stay back and watch it.",6,1,2,23 May 2013
