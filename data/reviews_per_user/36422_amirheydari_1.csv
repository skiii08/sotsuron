The Perks of Being a Wallflower," my opinion about actors and the story
",I think it is one of the bests.I saw this movie because I like Logan Lerman a lot.But I don't know why all his films should have a bad end and I should cry every time |: . If i want to recommend a movie to a girl actually I recommend this. Bur if I want recommend to a boy I will show him Fury. It is as nice as this of course. Emma Watson was good too but better than Mr.Lerman But there is some mistakes.In theater we can see some Ideas that advertises Sexual promiscuity.Or having freedom in everything. It cant be true and I disagree.But I learned a lot of lessons of this movie.Being happy...showing my feeling without fear or anything else.Thank you to read,10,1,2,13 August 2016
