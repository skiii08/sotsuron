The Ring," Why this movie is crap
","First of all, as it was said before, this movie is a remake of the excellent Japanese movie 'Ringu' by Hideo Nakata. I saw 'Ringu' several years ago and really enjoyed it. So when I heard about this American remake I was expecting the worst, and sadly, I was right. 'The Ring' isn't worth 'Ringu'. It's just crap compared to it, and above all, it's not scary an inch ! 'Ringu' is really scary, but this remake has lost all that made 'Ringu' so good. The work that Hideo Nakata made on 'Ringu' is pure genius, whereas 'The Ring' is just another bad Hollywood horror film with only a bit of originality since the story is Japanese. The music that tells you when it's going to be 'scary' before it happens..., the same shots seen a thousand times as in all Hollywood horror films..., the roughness, the crudeness, and the gore effects that are supposed to be terrifying..., this is only a glimpse of what makes 'The Ring' so dull and stupid. Of course if you haven't ever seen any Japanese horror film and only know the Hollywood turkeys, you may find 'The Ring' scary, but it's nothing compared to how terrifying you'll find 'Ringu'. Watch 'Ringu' and you'll see what Hollywood can't do and why Hollywood horror films are so pitiful compared to the Japanese ones. I therefore strongly not recommend 'The Ring', and recommend instead the brilliant 'Ringu'.",1,0,2,24 January 2007
