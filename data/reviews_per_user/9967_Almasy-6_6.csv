Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," IS NOT THE BEST IN TERMS OF STORY, BUT DEFINITEY THE BEST ON TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY, WORLD AND CREATURE DESIGN
","Hi. I'm Joan Paolo De Luca, from Venezuela here. I Just saw The Phantom Menace, after more than a month from its release, I've read about a hundred comments, as well as movie critics, and seen all the shows about the movie on E!.Let me say that all the ones that gave this masterpiece of entertainment ,THE most expected movie in the history of Cinema a bad comment are just f...ing crazy. Some of those comments really suck: they are pointless, untruthful, exaggerated, unsensible, underrated, flat, subjective ... etc, just plain stupid. I don't know what you guys expected from the movie, it is just another Star Wars movie, and that's it.I couldn't  believe when a read a comment from a guy saying that he couldn't stand the whole picture and left the theater before finished; man, I wanted to throw up!!, And HE calls himself a Star Wars Fan.Some other miss a Han Solo kind of character, but what the hell, this is not a new version of Episode 4 'A New Hope', and for all of you guys, I think that Qui-Gon is a bit like Han Solo: A guy who's always challenging the system, he's a rogue Jedi, he only follows his instinct, not a damn Jedi Counsel.Ok, I admit it, the movie is not perfect, at the beginning the editing is too anxious to reach Tatooine and find Anakin, traduction: is goes too fast. Jar Jar Binks is cute and sometimes funny, and I understood mostly everything he said, but is true that they focused the camera too much on him, especially at the beginning. I read he will be back in the next movie, but less annoying and more important to the plot.Despite what people say, I liked that Darth Maul dies, he looks cool, and fights cool, but didn't have much of a personality, he'd only do as the emperor says,  I wouldn't like him as a fulltime bad guy, as Darth Vader was, the fact that he dies leaves much ground to plant on account of bad guys. After all, the next two movie will be full with great Jedi Battles, with all the Clone Wars and all. Perhaps Darth Maul will be back as a clone.The acting is quite good, Not BAD as people say, but after all, Star Wars hard point wasn't precisely in the acting. Liam Neeson is not bored as some guys say, it's just that Qui-Gon is too calm... too focus... too good a Jedi Master, more of a teacher than a fighter, he nevers gets nervous, or sad, or worried, except at the end, when he dies, he's only worried about Anakin's future.  Ewan McGregor is acceptable, his character doesn't do much at the beginning but at the end he becomes really important. Jake Lloyd did a great job, after all, he acted as a child, exactly as George Lucas wanted it, his lines are pretty flat sometimes, but after all, kids are never very elocuent when they talk, you always see those movies where kids are so clever, they outsmart the adults, that's not true, George Lucas stopped making movies 15 years ago so he can spend time with his children, so I believe he knows how a kid behaves. I also hate when people say that kids can't act, even acting as yourself is difficult, believe it or not, try it.I'm IN LOVE with Natalie Portman, she did a great job 'cause she encarnated two characters: the beautiful, charming, and intelligent Padma; and the Queen, a very serious and focused girl, her performance is the best in the whole movie, as well as Pernilla August's, too bad she has few scenes, I know she will be back in Episode 2, when Anakin returns to free the slaves. Ian Mcdiarmid was also great, he steals every scene.Two great things about the story: Chancellor Palpatine dark scheme, it was not til' the end that I realized HE is THE Emperor and that he used the Queen to get that post, Hey!! I knew that Palpatine is Darth Sidious, but his performance is so good that it still confused me. And R2D2 introduction, I had goosebumps when a saw him saving all the main characters (again) at the begininng of the film when all the R2 units go outside the ship to repair the shields and he alone remains safe and sound, there we get to see (or remind) how important that little droid is for the Star Wars movies.The movie is full of details, you have to see it at least three times to fully catch all the creatures and little details in every frame. Lucas outdone himself. Every creatures design looks great, the effects are so thoroughly well put together I didn't find any glitches. I think Lucas focused so much on the worlds because he couldn't in the other three because of the technology, here he show us that there is no limit to his imagination.I'm also a  Huge Fan of John Williams, I own almost all of his known soundtracks, and right know 'my precioussss' (in gollum's words)  is The Phantom Menace, the song 'The Duel Of Fates' (The Lightsaber Battle) is a masterpiece, I've hummed it almost every day; The 'Anakin's Theme' is simply marvelous, the last four notes are from the Darth Vader Theme, that is really a genius job. All the other music establish a great atmosphere to the movie, many fanfares and marchs, as well as some very nice reprises of the Force Theme. Too bad the CD lacks a big amount of music of the movie: the battle in the desert, the goodbye scene of Anakin with his mother (which is extremely beautiful), the jedi counsel, etc. I applaud his work, again... and again... and again.People can't expect this one to be the best, it can't, and is NOT. This is just a come-back from Lucas, a movie with thousands of  F/X, many new characters and creatures, plots and subplots. And the plot holes are there on purpose, so they can be filled in the next two.After all, as a story: it IS a prequel; but technically: it IS a sequel. The movie prepare us for the next two, which I think will have less F/X and more story. I can't believe We have to wait for three more years, 'it's a sin... it's a sin' (in Alex's Words).Mark My words IMDB, this movie will be nominated for all these Oscars: Best Sound, Best Sound Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Art Direction, Best Music,   Best Special Effects.I don't know which one will win, I'm sure about Costume Design and Art Direction. The F/X award is going to be battled between this one and The Matrix at those Oscars.",8,0,0,16 July 1999

The English Patient," TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT. DON´T BE OBTUSE.
","I Love the Internet Movie Database, it's the best site for movie freaks like me. I also love to read comments of my favorite movies; I'm very objective in that matter, everyone is free to say his own opinion. And in the comments of  movies like Star Wars, A Clockwork Orange, 2001, Alien, Titanic, Citizen Kane (some of my favourite movies) I've read some likable comments and some disgusting points of view, but I accepted their opinion. But When I got to read The English Patient (Which, if you read my name at the title of this comment you'll see how fan I am) comments I couldn't stand it anymore, I have to make you all understand why this movie deserves NINE Oscars. This goes out especially to the people out there that sympathizes with Elaine (from Seinfeld) opinion of this movie. When 2001 hit the theaters in 1968, many people hated it, they said it was boring and too long. Ok, it didn't win nine oscars but its considered the best science fiction film of all time; its funny the fact that it was a boxoffice success because of the hippies who loved the coloured psychedelic journey. What I mean by this is that when you see a movie first of all you gotta know previously what kind of movie you are going to see. If is a movie like Independence Day or Twister you should expect explosion, great SFX, cool dialogues, and an acceptable running time. But if you´re going to see a movie named TEP, 2001, The Godfather, The Thin Red Line, you got to have a open mind about the whole context of it.  That´s why I can see almost every kind of movie they´re showing, except musicals (I hate musicals).The English Patient opens with a beautiful image of a brush painting a figure we don´t know what it is yet. A woman's voice begins to sing---Szerelem, szerelem, she cries in a haunting lament for her loved one. After the credits we realized the figure is a man swimming (we´ll see where that comes from later). Then we change our view to THE DESERT seen from the air. An ocean of dunes (remember the swimmer) for mile after mile. The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black and makes the dunes look like bodies pressed against each other. An old AIRPLANE is flying over the Sahara, there is a woman who appears to be asleep, behind her the pilot , a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet. He is singing, too, but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's plaintive voice.This are the first images of TEP and believe me it captures my attention simply because of its beauty; maybe because I love the desert. I own this movie on DVD and every frame of the cinematography is worth pausing and admiring. TEP is a movie about mature and intellectual people who are caught up in a time of barbarians who only think about making history by obtaining power over the world. The team of International Explorers are only thinking about making history by contributing with proofs of ancient civilization. They don´t care about countries, or frontiers. You have to be very observant in a movie like this. Watch every frame, it doesn´t matter who long does it last on screen, in a movie like this is not there just because of a bad editing. Think about Hana for a moment, she´s the most naive character in the movie 'I don´t know about anything' she say to TEP when he´s talking about Herodotus, but despite of this she´s the most sympathetic character in the film. Catherine and Count Almasy are the main love story, they are intelligent and passionate characters. She´s married to a clown and sees in Almasy a mysterious man who talks many languages (but doesn´t like to talk), knows many cultures, doesn´t have a home, has got a beautiful handwriting, wrotes poems and its passionate about beauty and art, and if that wasn´t enough he´s handsome; what more do you want?. Many people just sees those two like a lustful couple who have no really interest in the other but in sex. That´s an easy answer for somebody who don´t understand them. When they met they have a discussion about an essay Almasy wrote, there they have their first chemistry shock. When they are telling stories in front of the fire everybody male (except Almasy) is telling a funny and shallow story, but when Catherine´s turn is up she impresses everybody (especially Almasy) by telling a story from Herodotus about a king named Candaules (who is a metaphor of Clifton) who is too proud of his wife and he´s showing her to a subject naked and by that shaming her.  Almasy is mighty attracted to her and that´s why he doesn´t want her to stay when Clifton leaves for an errand, and that´s why he´s rude why her whenever she tries to talk to him or give him the paintings of the swimmers from the credits. This is not an ordinary couple, this is a mature couple of two adults who feel an enourmus attraction and by that betrays everything they know by being together, although she (being a woman) has more integrity at betrayal and leaves him because she knows that´ll never work. I don´t know about you but I have 21 years old and I´ve been in those situations when you are so attracted to a girl, and also is she but cannot be together because she is already taken and cannot betray the man that she loves (or once loved for that matter). The Ending is what I call total climax. There is our Count Almasy running in the desert to save the woman he loves, and maybe he´s thinking that if he does they can be together, and believe it or not they die together (metaphorically). Honestly, If I was going to die of love, I hope it´ll be like that. I´m not going to tell the whole meaning of every part of the movie, I will leave it here. I hope it makes you think more about movies and especially this one. Why if any of you people didn´t like '2001, The Thin Red Line, and The English Patient' think it won so many Awards?, you just have to look further deep. You cannot expect to be told everything in the script or in the images (although they have).",10,1,3,13 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," STAR WARS IS BACK. I give it 8 out of 10. Considering Ep. 4 (9), Ep. 5 (10) and Ep. 6(8) and Ep.1 (7)
","When I saw Episode 1, I was so excited I didn't see its flaws. I still love it but when I see it I can't help to be bothered by Anakin, the Midhiclorians, and the fact there isn't much feeling with all the force and the jedi stuff. But it's still a Star Wars movie, Darth Maul is great, and the way the introduced the Droids is very funny and even nostalgic, and I can't help to be happy every time I see.Now that I've seen Episode 2 I was glad that my pal George Lucas have grown up a little bit. I enjoyed EVERY LITTLE BIT OF IT. The movie is full of inside jokes that ARE the comic relief this time, without needing Jar Jar to make stupid things in order to make us laugh. It's full of action sequences, and MY GOD, MY GOD, YODA KICKS ASS, everybody was JAW DROPPED during that scene. The romantic story is very cliched, sometimes it seems like a tribute to all the classic romantic movies. The acting (as always) is standard, except of course for Yoda who always takes every scene. I didn't hate Hayden Christensen acting, sometimes is really lame, and sometimes he manages to act as the classic teenager confused and arrogant, but he must put more heart if he is going to convince us that he IS Darth Vader in Episode 3.The Best thing is the special effects (as always) and many of the story plots and revelations. I won't tell you what they are, but I bet you will be excited when you find out many of the reasons why the empire got the be the empire and why the Jedi were beaten in the first place. And Thank God, It all made sense to me.One last thing, don't worry: There is VEEERY little Jar Jar and NO Midhiclorians whatsoever.I predict AND HOPE this movie will be nominated to Special Effects, Sound, Sound Effects and Costume Design in the Oscars next year.",7,0,0,4 July 2002
The Truman Show," Originality At It Best
","Who Are You?.... I'm Your Creator.... Then, Who Am I?.... You're The STAR. Those are one of the last lines of The Truman Show,  and     simply one of the best lines in the whole movie. Jim Carrey and Ed Harris takes us to an odyssey of moral issues; You can never think yourself as a God, because the more you believe it, the less your sons adore you. When I saw this film I was in the biggest state of awe i have ever been in a long time in a movie theater, I LOVE all the camera angles in every frame, the Director Photography must've had quite a lot headaches trying to satisfy Peter Weir demands, and in my opinion, deserves and Oscar, as well as the Editing, Art Direction, and Music. Not to mention the great performances by Ed Harris (who should've won the Oscar a long time ago) and Jim Carrey (the first time he actually attracts the audience not only by his jokes and charm but also by his heart). Many people disagree by the ending, the believe to be frivolous and incomplete, but I believe they are wrong, the whole movie IS THE TRUMAN SHOW, and after Truman leaves the set, THE SHOW IS OVER, that's the whole art of the issue, If we get to see him in the outside world, it would be some kind of sequel, not precisely THE SHOW. This is one of the most original movies of the 90s, anyone who adores the art of making movies out there as much as I do, don't miss it.",10,0,0,31 January 1999
