The Avengers," Simply Awesome!!!
","But then again anything with Robert Downey Jr. in it is Simply Awesome!! I am also now interested in Thor. My title pretty much sums up what I think of this movie! I will gladly watch another one, if I can find out if another one is being made or not?I'm going to watch it again on Netflix. I would like to know if this is the only one out there? The avengers and if there is going to be another The Avengers, as well. I will watch that one too! Normally, my genre of movies is Paranormal, Syfy or Stephen king related, but this works for me, as well. I will now look into action films, as being my second favourite Genre of movies and television!..;)",10,1,4,15 June 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Best classic movie!!!
","I love Morgan Freeman and have been to the Mansfield reformatory once. It was closed for the season. This Prison, has been used in multiple movies. Anyhow, back to the rating. I give it a 10, i love movies with a narrative setting. Also, loved the fact that he was in prison for a crime that he didn't commit, and he was able to have posters, especially of Rita hayworth in his cell. I didn't particularly, care for the SISTER'S theme, but I do know it happens in prisons, so i can appreciate the set-up for that scenario. I love how Tim Robbins character, developed a relationship with a younger guy so he could mentor him, and then he got killed by the warden's guards. I also loved the ending, when he got revenge on the Warden, and was able to escape with all of the warden's money. Best classic Movie!!! I do end up not watching the Sister's scenario, but other than that this is truly, one of the best classic movies EVER.",10,0,0,9 August 2018
Annihilation," Horror, but Not Horror!!!
","It takes a lot to scare me. This definitely was NOT horror. I know everyone has their own favourite Genre of movies, typically horror, paranormal anything related to those topics, I'm all over it!!! This time, I pretty much demanded 1 1/2 hours of my life back. It jumps all over the place. First, Natalie portman plays a biologist, who investigates everything upon going into the Shimmer. Natalie portman always plays, best of the best roles. Nothing less than a dr or a scientist for her. Granted she IS a great actress, but she should of stuck to Star wars or Marvel Cinenamatic Universe. I grew very tired the first 20 minutes, when she was having flash backs of her husband, before her husband went into THE SHIMMER. The monster or MUTATED BEAR that ate her colleague, that also used the voice of her dead colleague, was LAME. Then it goes back to her sleeping with a black guy that she had an affair with. This movie is also pretty much PC to the point, of 'I am woman, here me roar' theme is growing old with me. All female, military, and big role playing, for dr. physiologist, etc. Hollywood needs to lay off that, and just make descent movies. So, if you're into the MUTATED theme, this movie is for you. If not, don't bother you will get bored the first 20 minutes, with repeated flash backs of Natalie portman's character having sex with her husband and affair that her character had with a black guy. It left us hanging with her asking if the clone was her husband Cane. Yes, this movie also made clones after she destroyed THE SHIMMER. I'm sure that the book was better. The Movie did no justice, to the book and I haven't even read it. Mutation and clones, but it definitely was NOT horror. I have a feeling there will be an Annihilation II.",1,2,3,10 August 2018
