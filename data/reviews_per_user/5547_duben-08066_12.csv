It," Beep Beep Ritchie
","When I was growing up and watch the original made-for-tv it I always wanted to see a premier version. They did not disappoint it was creepier and bloodier and better than I would have ever expected it to be. King's novel sealed my dislike for clowns, the 2017 edition made me feel 10 years old all over again because I have been expecting Pennywise to jump out of my basement since I watched this reinterpretation. It's funny though because I'm in my 30sðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ Loved this movie and have watched it 8 times and always catch something new",10,0,0,14 October 2019
It," Blows the made for t.v version out of the water!!
","I'm a grown man and this movie had me shook, Pennywise is super creepy and of course the movie is scary as hell! They have made Stephen King proud with this adaptation for sure!",10,0,3,8 September 2019
Bird Box," Netflix killed it!
","Great movie very tense and creepy. I'm impressed plus the had MGK in a small role, so I liked when more",9,0,1,8 September 2019
Split," M.Night had put together an excellent flick
","He has made it hard to tell if I will actually enjoy his'twist'
This makes up for The Village for sure",10,0,0,8 September 2019
The Shining," Stanley Kubrick at his finest.
","The movie is a classic, there are so many terrible movies made from Stephen King novels. The Shining definitely stands tall in the category. The son was creepy as hell, he talked to his finger!!! Many nightmares when I was a kid but still a movie I watched several times.",10,1,1,22 October 2019
28 Days Later...," Truly one of the greatest 'Zombie' films of all time.
","Super underated it's a step away from the slow dim undead. The Walking Dead either paid homage it stole the hospital idea when the first season started. It's the complete end of humanity story! If you haven't been lucky enough to see this film, do yourself a favor and sit down and watch it.",10,0,0,6 September 2019
Aladdin," Will Smooth looked crazy blue!!
",Well done. I am not the biggest Disney fan but it was very close to the cartoon version,7,1,2,6 October 2019
The Lion King," Very impressive
","I'm not a fan of Disney movies, I'm also a got in my mid 30's so they just don't interest me. But, I grew up with the original cartoon Lion King and they basically nailed it shot for shot and James Earl Jones was (Mustapha?) Again so yeah definitely worth watching..",8,0,2,22 October 2019
The Mist," If you have read the story prepare for disappointment.
","The movie isn't horrible but they throw a'twist' ending that completely ruined the film for me. Like Dreamcatchers and many other Stephen King stories, Hollywood should be ashamed for putting out such  poor movies! This is the Master of crazy Horror, give his writing some Justice #Tommy Knockers???? Really",5,0,5,6 September 2019
Zombieland," Bill Murray is the MAN!
","I loved this movie, my favorite horror movies are mostly George Romero Soo it was right up my alley. Super funny but not dumb. Excited to see sequel. Bill Murray's cameo was classic, I hated the fact that he voiced Garfield so it was awesome to see him make fun of himself.",8,0,1,22 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Hard to follow the first chapter, but still well done.
","I was glad the director choose to follow the novel a little closer then the 90's version. They also brought the original kids back for flashbacks we didn't see in the first one. It was a little long but jammed full of creepy Pennywise moments. I was so excited to see the reboot I was very happy with both films. The 1st chapter was so perfectly some I expected this one too fall short. I was wrong. The scene in the hall of mirrors is probably my favorite from both movies, Bill Scarborough is a super creepy as dude and much better casted for the role. He made his eye look off to the side when he is talking to anything he is wanting to eat, super creepy!!",8,0,0,22 October 2019
The Conjuring," Possession movies are plentiful,,,,
",This movie was on point It was super creepy and the mother was is a fantastic actress!!! Definitely something I have watched a half dozen times and it still gets me. Can't wait for the third film,9,0,1,8 September 2019
