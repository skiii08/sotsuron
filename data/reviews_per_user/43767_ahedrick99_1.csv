Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat is a steaming pile of crap.
","This film is VILE. I was completely disappointed. I love to laugh at myself and my culture. I really do. That's why I was eager to see this film. But from start to finish in this film, I was bombarded with graphic sexual conversation and racist idiocy. There were funny parts, yes. Borat's 'religious conversion' was pretty funny. And the utter ignorance of the people he met....racist, ethnocentric, incredibly naive. It said a lot about the state of our country. And I will say this much for Borat: the film is an equal-opportunity mock-fest. No one is safe. Not even themselves. But these modest up-sides were immeasurably outweighed by the vulgarity and overall disgusting tone of the film. And for crying out loud, what is up with the insipid, gratuitous, ridiculously long male nudity scenes with the simulated male-on-male sex positions? Freaking gross. And no, I'm not a homophobe. No one will be going to Borat to see that. It was shocking and completely unnecessary. I have a pretty high gross-out factor, but I tell you the truth, I was covering my eyes and looking away for a big chunk of the film. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why I didn't walk out of the theater. Save your money and your brain cells. Borat SUCKED.",1,12,25,6 December 2006
