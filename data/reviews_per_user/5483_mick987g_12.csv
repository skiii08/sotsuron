Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Think I'll pass
",We had HBO free weekend awhile back and this movie was on. What I caught of it was disgusting. Two naked men on a bed and then the chubby little guy chased the tall skinny guy into a reception hall screaming 'Eat my !@#' I couldn't hit the next channel button fast enough.I saw trailers on this movie as well. I didn't find them that humorous either.Sasha Cohen was on the junkets in full character as well. I didn't really see what the big deal was with this guy.Mind you I have a very warped sense of humor. But this was not funnyI will pass on this should it come on again.,1,2,6,13 May 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," Reminds me of a 1940's type of movie
","This movie was very good, it sort of reminded me of a 1940's fast paced movie. The almost 2 hours of film went quickly It is a simple tale of a man Slevin, mistaken for his friend by mob bosses; Freeman and Kingsley.It seems that the friend owes money and Slevin being mistaken as said friend is forced to talk to the bosses in nothing more then a bath towel and slippers for a few moments Lucy Liu adds a light touch to this movie.Bruce Willis breezes in and out a like a ghost.Through flashbacks the whole story starts to weave itself together.It's a very good movie as far as I am concerned Either see it at the theater or rent it when it comes out for home viewing. I feel it is worth the coin.",7,1,8,22 April 2006
Silent Hill," Was it supposed to be funny?
","This isn't my usual type of movie. But for lack of nothing better to I decided to go with a friend of mine.Mostly this is a story of a women running after her daughter. For most of the movie Rose is seen running from the town hall to the school to the hotel to the church. She is joined by a female cop on a bike who reminds me of Chynna the wrestler.And I would like to know why the director choose to steal themes from Time Machine, the Birds and other older movies. And what is the deal with the calf high boots on these women?There were points where I was laughing at this silly movie. But then again I think most horror movies are just plan out silly anyways If theses are your type of movies then by all means go see it.The main thing is that you be entertained",2,3,13,22 April 2006
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," This is so not a black comedy for sure
",I like Frances McDormands acting and I was very curious about this movie. I read that the category this is a black comedy . I found this to not be comical at all. I was quite dark indeed.I was glad that it was on my cables free weekend. I hung in there till the end but it wasn't easy .,1,8,13,21 January 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," This is not your fathers Captain America
","I am a Die-hard Captain America fan. I had my doubts reading the premise of the film. They took quite a few liberties with the characters. There are some that I can see to tie in the upcoming Avengers movie. For those of you who do not know Nick Fury was Sergeant in World War II. As we can see Nick Fury as portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson and an Afro American while the Marvel Comics version of Sgt Nick Fury was a Caucasian. Also James 'Bucky 'Barnes was quite a few younger then Stephen Rogers, not the same age.So I went into the movie a skeptic. I came out a convert. They did a very good job of staying as true to the Marvel version as they could. I also realized that this in the Ultimate's Version of the Captain America, not the Cap or Yore! If you like action this movie has it, granted some of it may seem a little corny cause part of the movie is sent in the 1940s or BCP(Before Cell phones).",Null,3,5,3 August 2011
The Dark Knight," See it on the big screen
","Went to see the Dark Knight today. Everything I had heard about Heath Ledgers performance, as 'The Joker' was true.As I watched him in his last role, I could utilize Caesar Romero as the 60's Joker and Jack Nicholson's performance as the 80's Joker. Then made the role his own.Anarchy is Jokers first rule, as many know from the Comic books.Maggie Gyllenhaal did a fine job replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes Aaron Eckhart came into play Harvey Dent the coin flipping Gorham District Attorney.Christian Bale, Gary Oldman Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman return in their roles as Bruce Wayne/Batman, James Gordon, Alfred and Mr. Fox respectively Eric Roberts role as mob boss Salvatore Maroni is okay, but he is nothing more then a set up man for Ledgers 'Joker' 'The Joker' is sort of a mirror of 'The Batman.' I enjoyed the bat cycle. Bale says there is only one man who can drive that cycle and he wasn't one of them.There were some tense moments with the citizens of Gorham but in the end good won out over evil.See this on the big screen it is worth the coin Now the next question is will there be a third Batman movie who would play 'The Joker?' Will they bring in the Cat woman character? I am thinking a good choice would be Jessica Biel.",10,4,9,19 July 2008
The Departed," About time he won the Oscar
","I waited a long time to see this movie. I thought it would be a good movie what with Nicholson, DiCaprio, and Matt Damon. Usually a Scorsese movie is intense but worth the watch.I wasn't wrong on it either. I loved one cop was in mole in the mob and another cop was a mole for the mob.Who ever casted this movie did a fine job. Besides Nicholson , Dicaprio and Damon you had Martin Sheen , and Mark Wahlberg, who I think is coming into his own as an actor.It kept twisting and turning.I can see why Mr. Scorsese finally got the Oscar he has long deserved.If you liked his other movies or just want to see an old-fashioned mob movie this is it.",9,0,2,26 March 2007
1408," Not Cusack's best work(this could contain bits of a spoiler)
","I looked at my watch at least a dozen times during this movie. The more times I look at my watch the worse the movie It is two hours of my life I cannot get back.Don't get this wrong I love most of John Cusack movies. From 'The Sure thing to Serendipity. He is a very underrated actor.But this is one movie I think he would like to forget.He lays Michael Enslin a cynical writer who debunks a lot of these so called haunted houses and the people claim they live in.He gets a post card from 'The Dolphin Hotel ' telling him to not stay in room 1408. After many calls from him and his publisher's lawyers he goes to the hotel and asks to stay in 1408.The Manager keeps telling him not to go into that room, any room but that room since there is pure evil in this room.It keeps you wondering what is really and what is not. It twists and turns away too much and Mr.Cusack seems to overplay the part in this one.My suggestion rent it when it comes out in a couple of months. It is so not worth the $10 dollar ticket or what ever you pay for movie tickets in your area.You really want to save some coin, wait till it comes to your local library in a year or two.",1,2,10,24 June 2007
Iron Man," Downey does it again
","When I first heard that Robert Downey Jr. was chosen for the role of Tony Stark, I said 'Excellent choice.I still hold that belief to be true.Downey played the role of billionaire playboy to the hilt.The writers updated the story and instead of being in Vietnam, it is now Afghanistan.For those of us who read the Iron Man comics as children we know his heart is damaged and a kidnapped doctor keeps him alive by using a sort of pace maker.Stark is forced to work on weapons of mass destruction for the rebels. But instead makes a suit of armor, similar to the knights of old.He escapes and decides that WMD's are not what he wants to build anymore Jeff Bridges plays the character of Obadiah Stane as one deceptive bad guy.Gwyneth Paltrow is very good in her role of Pepper Pots. She and Stark have a good relationship that has an underlying sexual tension In the end, however the sexual tension is delayed by a battle between Stark and Stane.Just a quick note to those of you who walk out during the credits thinking the movie is over better not as there is a teaser for the sequel.Hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did",9,2,4,5 May 2008
Casino Royale," This isn't your grandfathers 007
","This new version of Casino Royale is not your grandfathers James Bond Daniel Craig plays the latest version of James Bond.It has a harsher edge to it. More grit then the previous Bonds. More along the lines of the Timothy Dalton movies.He is shot, knifed, poisoned, stripped, and tortured And on top of all, that he falls in love and then is betrayed by a woman but that is nothing new for Mr. Bond.It was cool to see they have sort of updated the characters to the 21 century. They kept the great actress Dame Judith Dench as M. Felix Leiter is now a black guy.So yes, I hope they make a couple of more with Mr. Craig. But we will see",7,0,2,26 March 2007
The Matrix," Keep on Dreaming Ted Logan esquire
",Friends of Mine have told me that this is a great film.  It was on TV one day and I took a look.  I couldn't get past the first half hour of this movie.It was one again just a few days ago and for the sake of my friends I would give it a second look.  Since The Matrix reloaded has just been release. I found it very hard to follow because of the scene shifting from reality or what Neo thinks is real to him being deprogrammed in a sterile room.   It seemed to jump too much for me.I am also not a big fan of the slo mo fight scenes and etc.  In real life I kick to the head takes microseconds not 4 minutes. This series of movies is being compared to a new age Star Wars.Who knows you may find this series to be enlighting.  Just not my kind of movie,Null,0,1,18 May 2003
Click," Life's Most important lesson
","As many of you know from some of my previous reviews, I am not a big Adam Sandler fan.In all his movies, he always has to beat the living daylights out of someone in them.In Click, he does not fail to disappoint his fans.With this out of the way, I can give you my review of the rest of the movie.Sandler plays Michael Newman who's goal in life is to succeed but at the cost of his family life.He suddenly finds his life being in an overblown stage. So one night he travels to find so peace and quiet and encounters Morty placed by Christopher Walken.Morty gives him a new remote but this remote is for life entertainment.As Michael learns more about this device he learns to mute his sister in law or fast forward through parts of his life he doesn't like.As he uses it more he realizes that maybe this remote isn't such a good thing after all.He learns life's most important lesson, which I will not reveal here.Most of this movie is your typical Sandler comedy with a dash of drama included.What really made this movie great for me was Kate Beckinsale in boxer shorts and a muscle t-shirt A little eye candy is a good thing.If you rent this movie, I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.",8,0,1,16 October 2006
