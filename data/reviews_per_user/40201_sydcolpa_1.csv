","This is disappointing in so many ways. The visual style was early 21st century X box and editing consisted of long hold shots which revealed nothing of the character's motivations. The dialogue was execrable at times and the sound design and music too loud and badly over played. The plot was weak and the sets and overall tone of the work left a lot to be desired. Even the CGI was of a lower standard than I expected. My overall impression was that the director did a rush job and was hamstrung by the studio. Now we get to the worst things in the film. The acting. Ryan Gosling was badly miss-cast and could not transcend the limitations of the script. Jared Leto is not an actor and this again was shown in his exaggerated tics and pompous delivery. The other actors tried hard but had no inner motivation or arc. The story. Incomprehensible at times. Why did Wallace kill the replicant he had just complained of not having enough of. Why did Angel become this Terminator like monster. Why when they had captured Deckard and incapacitated K did they not kill him? Only so they could have a stupid fight scene a the end? What was all that about slavery? Why was Harrison Ford in the movie at all except as fan service? Why would a replicant fall in love with a hologram? Why, when the new models are obedient do all of them not follow orders? I could go on and on - I can't wait for the director's cut - it should be an hour shorter and even more disjointed.",6,4,7,30 October 2017
