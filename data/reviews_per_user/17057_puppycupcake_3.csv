Insidious: Chapter 2," If you were a fan of the first, you will love the second installment
","The movie picks up right where the first left off, and really gives you the back story of the family and why they are going through everything they are going through. They style is very similar, and there is so much originality and style that you just don't see with today's modern horror story flicks. There are plenty of scares, plot twists, surprises, a-ha moments, and plenty of tense moments and horror. I really enjoyed it just as much as the first. I got to see The Ultimate Insidious Experience which was a back to back double feature which was really cool to refresh what had happened in the first. There are moments that explain cleverly scenes that didn't make sense in the beginning but are cleverly resolved in the end. I have always loved the first Insidious and the second is equally as good in my book. If you didn't like the first, you won't like the second. It's just a great spooky, scary, haunted house, ghost, abandoned hospital story that is well-done and leaves you very satisfied at the end. They leave it open for further sequels that are sure to follow. A definite must-see for any horror movie fan.",10,120,203,12 September 2013
Little Miss Sunshine," Mistake in character listing
","I was not able to go onto the goofs section to make a note of this. But I have a comment about a possible error. Frank was Sheryl's brother, yet he is listed as having the same last name as everyone else. He would have a different last name. Besides that comment, I have to say that this was just an excellent movie. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when Olive started her act. Every time anything happened, you wanted to laugh, and just cry over how sad and pathetic their lives are. I loved the ending. Any mainstream movie would have had Olive pull some fantastic talent out of the sky and beat all the other girls out. The love that they had for each other was also touching. They loved each other and they knew how pathetic they were as well.",10,1,4,22 September 2006
The Descent," The goriest movie I have EVER seen!!!
","The Descent is a very tense movie and definitely keeps you jumping throughout. And although I am a full grown adult, I kept my eyes and ears covered throughout a lot of the film because it was so gory and graphic. This movie is definitely not for the squeamish. Blood and guts, blood and guts, blood and guts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The plot was interesting and disappointing. I didn't like the ending, I didn't really understand the final shock. I didn't like what happened to Juno. What she did was an accident and she didn't deserve to be disabled just before the end of the tunnel. I also thought that a lot of the sets were very primitive and looked like cardboard boxes with paper mache. In addition when one of the girls is stuck in a tight place you can see the rock above her head giving with her movements indicating it was made of foam. At one time in the movie one of the girls remarks that they are two miles underground. Completely impossible. If I remember correctly, the Carlbad Caverns elevator at the end is billed at 300 feet underground or possibly the tallest room was , either way two miles would be almost 6000 feet. Could be a hyperbole. I would wait for video if I were you. A good movie for friends over that like to scream with gratuitous shock scenes.",4,0,3,11 August 2006
