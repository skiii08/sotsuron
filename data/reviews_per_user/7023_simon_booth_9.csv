Casablanca," It's a classic, no question there
","I'm a bit late catching up with this film, and wondered if I could enjoy it having seen/heard so many clips + quotes over the years. The answer is 'yes'! Even though everyone on the planet must have had the ending spoilered for them by now, the film still delivers entertainment and quality in spades. The script is deliciously witty and full of drama, the characters wonderfully crafted and 3-dimensional, the cinematography and sound as classy as anything in its day. It's fascinating to compare a film like Casablanca to the dross Hollywood produces these days... so much more money, technology and every other resource available, and they can't produce anything remotely as good!",10,1,3,5 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Far from what it could have been
","I struggled with myself to give this movie a 7/10, against impulses that were saying '2 or 3'.  Trying to be objective, I will admit that the stupidly named movie is better than the average junk that Hollywood tries to pass off as entertainment these days.  It's actually quite entertaining, and features some fairly spectacular special effects.However, for an entry into a series with as much world-wide fanatacism as Star Wars, I cannot help but consider it to be a terrible disappointment. Not as disappointing as 'The Phantom Menace' I'll admit, but then I was more prepared for disappointment this time.Whilst it has splendid CGI that creates some luscious science fiction environments and spectacular battle sequences, George Lucas really should have surrendered script (and probably directorial) duties to somebody younger and more talented.  Given that everybody on the planet will probably see the movie at some point, there's no real excuse for not spending money on the best and brightest out there.  But it's all too painfully clear that Lucas wanted to keep the spotlight on himself - a spotlight he simply doesn't have the talent to fill.The basic story for 'Attack Of The Clones' is not bad - there's some intrigue, some heroism and some evil.  You can see the pieces falling into place that explain how the situation arose that we find ourselves in at the beginning of the first Star Wars.  The script that delivers the story is just awful though.  It lumbers along like a blind elephant, clumsy and contrived and corny as hell.  And the dialogue - ouch.  Tedious and inane. A good script writer could have turned Lucas' story into something majestic and moving, but Lucas only manages to hover between 'passable' and 'really embarrassing'.  Perhaps it's because I work in the industry, but I also found it embarrassing where Lucas has clearly planned his action scenes with an eye to the spin-off computer games that pad his wallet even further.  Be sure there'll be at least half a dozen different games released to capitalise on the movie financially.This in itself would have been enough to make the movie disappointing, but our disappointment is further compounded by the acting/casting.  Who chose Hayden Christensen for Anakin?  *Why*?  The lad is completely wooden, and totally devoid of charisma.  His delivery of the already bad dialogue is so monotonous that he seems to be sucking the life right out of the viewer whenever he speaks.  This is meant to be the young Darth Vader?  The rear parts of my anatomy would have played the part better.  Hayden Christensen is definitely the final nail in the coffin of any hopes that Attack Of The Clones would be a worthy successor to the Star Wars legacy.  Ewan McGregor helps to hammer that nail in too.  He can act very well - he was a great smack addict in Trainspotting - but he is terribly miscast as Obiwan. Lucas' dialogue for Obiwan is already bafflingly juvenile, and McGregor's delivery adds further incongruity to the character Alec Guinness made legendary.So, yes Episode II is better than average - but the average Hollywood movie these days is completely dreadful, so this is not a great accolade.  With the money Lucas had available to spend, it should have been so much more - but he was obviously unwilling to sacrifice some of the limelight by spending the money on writers with talent.  Ultimately, I'm sure he'll make enough money not to care too much, but let posterity show him to have grown to be something of an ass.",7,0,1,27 May 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Impressive
","Finally got round to watching Saving Private Ryan in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of D-Day.  It's quite an impressive film, sustaining a long running time with few weak moments, and presenting an entirely new level of realism in the depiction of the battles.  The violence is quite shocking, and it's not often you can say that given the exceptionally high level to which our depiction of and tolerance of violence has been pushed in recent years.One thing that bothered me though was that the film-makers appeared to be unaware that quite a few non-Americans were involved in the D-Day push too. No disrespect to those brave Americans that gave their lives, but it would have been nice to have the film acknowledge the sacrifice of numerous other countries too.",9,2,3,6 June 2004
Hero," Impressive
","It sounded like a HK Cinema fan's ultimate wet dream... Zhang Yimou to direct a martial arts epic with Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Leung Chiu Wai, Zhang Ziyi and Donnie Yen in the cast, Ching Siu-Tung doing the action, Christopher Doyle the cinematography and Emil Wada the costumes. What more could you ask for? (Well, Brigitte Lin coming out of retirement and Yuen Wo Ping and Sammo Hung sharing the action director credits, perhaps).I guess we have CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON to thank for making the wu xia world bankable again, and generating the interest and investment required to bring a project of this stature together. There's no doubt that the US Market was a major target, and US$ went into the funding. Given this it's a tragedy that Yimou let Miramax get their paws on it and effectively ruin any chances it had of major US successApart from Zhang Ziyi and the Tan Dun soundtrack (a terrible choice no doubt enforced by US investors), CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is not a good reference point by which to evaluate HERO. Much more appropriate is Wong Kar Wai's ASHES OF TIME, with which it shares two lead actors and a cinematographer. HERO is definitely more commercially oriented, but shares a beauty and philosophical richness with AOT, and a certain melancholy mood.The story of HERO starts off quite simply, as Jet Li begins to recount his martial triumphs to the Emperor of Qin. The tale is told in flashbacks which revisit and re-evaluate the same events, elaborating on and changing the story as we learn more. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, and is a great way of developing a mystery thriller. Zhang Yimou handles the building of the tale expertly, as one would expect from such a master film maker.Zhang Yimou himself is such an accomplished cinematographer he hardly needed to hire somebody else for the job - but if there's anybody better than Yimou it's Christopher Doyle. I wonder how much conflict there was on set though, as I am sure each had very strong visions of how they wanted scenes to look. The result doesn't show any signs of it if such a conflict occured though, as the visual style seems exceptionally strong and focussed throughout. A large part of this is Yimou's use of bold colours to delineate the different sections of the story (The green, the red, the yellow, the blue, the white). With Emil Wada's stunning costumes and the great choice of locations, HERO is almost as rich in stunning imagery as ASHES OF TIME. It's a true work of art, harking back to Yimou's older films like SHANGHAI TRIAD and RAISE THE RED LANTERN - I'm really pleased to see him making such visual films again. The visuals are sometimes let down by some unconvincing CGI effects, unfortunately.Zhang Yimou has never directed an action movie before, so people were clearly worried he wouldn't know what to do with the fight scenes that a wu xia movie needs more than anything else. It's been quite a few years since Ching Siu Tung has produced any really impressive work too, so I was rather worried - especially when I heard (from good authority) that Yimou had Ching had clashed on set. Apparently Zhang wanted more grounded, realistic kung fu, which really isn't Ching Siu Tung's thing (should have got Sammo or Yuen Wo Ping!). I guess Ching got the upper hand in the end, as the fight scenes are certainly not grounded or realistic - they're very much about the twirling and whirling and the graceful flying that Ching Siu Tung virtually defined. They're not as manic as he usually makes the action when he directs himself, though - a fact that sometimes makes the wirework look a bit awkward.A real surprise is that the weakest fight scene of the film is that one that pits the two best martial artists together. Jet Li vs. Donnie Yen opens the film with some sword vs. spear action. There's some beautiful moments, but I felt the scene lacked impact and featured some awkward moves too. Oddly enough, the fight I enjoyed the most featured no real martial artistry at all - Maggie Cheung vs (well, you'll see) in a beautiful autumnal scene of falling leaves. I guess that's because Ching Siu Tung is really not working to his strengths when he tries to do 'real' martial arts.I had held off watching HERO for months, because as soon as I got the first released DVD (the DVD-5 from Guang Dong Face Ah) it was announced that the extended version of the film would be released in a few weeks. It's generally well known now that Zhang Yimou was persuaded to cut about 20 minutes from the film by the hatchet men at MiramAXE, who really must die first when the revolution comes. I figured the first time I see it I should see the best possible version, for maximum impact, so I was willing to wait. Well it's been 2 months now and the extended version is now indefinitely delayed due to legal issues, so I finally gave in and watched the DVD I'd had lying around for so long. Now that I've seen it I have to say I don't really see what another 20 minutes would add to the film - it seems quite complete and well paced at about 95 minutes. A little more development of Donnie Yen's character would be nice, but other than that it's hard to imagine what is missing. Longer action scenes maybe? Or perhaps just 20 minutes of Christopher Doyle's beautifully composed landscape shots, or close ups of Maggie Cheung dying.I'm glad I waited to see the film anyway though, as it allowed all the hype and anticipation to die down.  Unfortunately, when a film is as highly anticipated as this it's inevitable that there will be 'backlash syndrome' as people feel let down that it wasn't the ultimate movie of all time they heard/hoped it would be (it was amusing to watch the reviews on CROUCHING TIGER swing between 'incredible' and 'awful' as hype waves ruined the experience for many, and I'm sure the same will happen with HERO).Zhang Yimou is an extremely talented director in many respects, but perhaps the greatest is his ability to get incredible performances out of his cast. With such an illustrious cast on board he perhaps felt he didn't need to try as much though (or they weren't willing to listen), as the acting isn't as powerful as I had expected. It's still of a very high quality, but doesn't evoke the same strong emotions as some of the performances in ASHES OF TIME. Leung Chiu-Wai gets the top award for acting though, which will surprise few people. Zhang Ziyi only has a small part, but shows a lot of talent too - nice to see such skill in somebody that still has most of her career ahead of her. Of course, it was Zhang Yimou that discovered and nurtured her talent in THE ROAD HOME.There are only two disappointments in HERO, for me. One is the special effects, which aren't up to the very latest standards. A little less use of CGI would have made it go a lot further (like in CTHD). The other is the soundtrack, which is really just much too similar to the Crouching Tiger soundtrack. It doesn't fit HERO as well, but it is still pretty evocative and effective - just too similar to CTHD.I still intend to pick up the extended version of HERO when it's released, to see what Zhang Yimou's ideal vision for the film was. Even running shorter than he really wanted it's a mighty fine film though, and one I have no hesitation in recommending if anybody hasn't seen it yet. If MiramAXE ever do get round to releasing it in the US, I hope it does well.",9,107,160,10 May 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not as good as I hoped
","Well, maybe it's backlash syndrome, but I spent most of Kill Bill's 1h50 thinking 'when can I leave?'. Although there were a few great moments (especially the anime section, and the fight with Chigusa from Battle Royale - i.e. the parts where QT had the least direct involvement?), I thought it was mostly... self indulgent, and unengaging?The biggest problem I had was with the dialogue - is this really the same guy that rewrote the book on dialogue in Reservoir Dogs? Some of it is just so banal I wanted to throw things at the screen. The editing of the film is also suspect - some scenes are interminable, and the mild non-linearity seems contrived and accomplishes little. I know we're only half way through the story, but I still have *no* idea who The Bride or Bill really are, anyway - the only character in the film that gets any real development is Lucy Liu's.I never thought I'd hear myself saying this, but the violence and swearing just seemed gratuitous too. I have nothing wrong with enormous quantities of both when used well, but here it just didn't seem to serve a purpose or achieve anything.So, maybe it's just that my expectations or hopes were too high - I guess the film is more interesting than most Hollywood efforts, and there were some things I liked - it was cool seeing people like Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu up on the big screen, the soundtrack was v. good, the anime section was superbly done, and most of the fights were good.I'll be going to see Pt. 2 in February anyway, and will probably pick it up on DVD, but I was hoping for something more.",6,0,2,12 October 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," Unmatched accomplishment
","Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species.  For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as 'boring' they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making.  Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority.  Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic.  This is the film that put the science in 'science fiction', and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day.  It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film.  The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes).  The film's greatest strength is in the details.  Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey.  To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.  The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development.  It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going.  Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future.  Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue.  There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel.  I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.",10,1331,1871,17 June 2003
The Fountain," Vacuous and trite
","A brilliant scientist is absorbed by his work searching for a cure for cancer, whilst his artistic, spiritual wife is dying of... well, guess. A more trite scenario can hardly be imagined, but it is from this platform that Aronofsky delivers vacuous symbolism to make his case that religion is better than science because religion can make death more bearable, whilst science can't even find meaning in life. Whilst this may be true, it doesn't change the fact that religion is a load of made up nonsense whilst science has at least produced some cool toys like the cameras and computers Aronofsky uses to ply his trade. If you believe in some form of religion already, you may well enjoy this affirmation - otherwise, you might enjoy the pretty CGI but the banality of the film is likely to annoy.",3,3,8,12 June 2007
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Impressive war film from Korea
","I'm not a big fan of war films, unless the war in question was at least a couple hundred years ago or somewhere in the future, or the stars - but I did enjoy SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, if 'enjoy' is the best word to use for such an experience. Apparently, director Kang Je-Gyu (SHIRI) enjoyed SPR too, as its influence on his Korean war film TAEGUKGI is impossible to deny. SHIRI was the South Korean film that probably did more than any other to bring the country's cinematic new wave into being, and especially into the field of view of the rest of the world at large. Its main accomplishment was, arguably, demonstrating that Korea could make a film that competed head on with Hollywood product, in terms of slick production values but also perhaps in terms of vacuous scripts Although it is rather shallow compared to other Korean films, though, I think it's safe to say that SHIRI had more depth than Hollywood would have injected into a similar story.TAEGUKGI is his first film since SHIRI, and he's definitely playing the Hollywood game again - tackling Spielberg head on this time. Like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, TAEGUKGI attempts to humanise war by giving us some specific characters to focus on (in this case, two brothers played by Won Bin and Jang Dong-Kun) - and then uses our personal connection to show us that war is actually a dehumanising experience. The film also spares no effort in showing us the ability of bullets, knives and bombs to turn human beings into squishy piles of gore.There's a fairly obvious political symbolism in the story of two brothers and the effects the Korean war has on their lives and relationship - I don't know if it would be fair to read the ending as a view about the conditions under which Korean reunification might occur though. The ending of the film won't come as much of a surprise, since it's basically foretold at the start with a scene set in the present day. The exact details might be a little unexpected though.If you like your modern-ish day war films, and specifically if you liked SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, then there's very little doubt that TaeGukGi will impress. It's big, slick and well put together. Since it's not my favourite genre or topic of interest, I can't say I loved it like a brother, but was sufficiently satisfied with it given what it is.",Null,72,92,11 December 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Good at the time
","Well, when I was young I thought this film was the bees knees, but now I'm older and wiser and I can see it's just quite good.  Harrison Ford & Sean Connery are great actors with tons of charisma, but the story is rather weak and shallow.  The production values are very good, as you would expect with Spielberg behind the camera, but it's just a Hollywood adventure story. Give me Michelle Yeoh in Magnificent Warriors instead any time.The frivolity of the film is summed up in the amazingly anticlimactic ending.  **SPOILER** Can you imagine how p*ssed off you'd be if you'd been guarding some holy artefact for 700 years, and the first American that comes along loses it after 5 minutes :p  **END SPOILER**",7,0,2,8 November 2003
