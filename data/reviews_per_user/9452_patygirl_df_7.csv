The Devil's Advocate," Polemic and sensational
","An excellent story line, brilliant performances and amazing sequences made this film a surprising success in 1997. The director Taylor Hackford transformed the Andrew Neiderman's novel into the most incredible story about human weakness.The film stars Keanu Reeves as the lawyer Kevin Lomax that receives a great offer by the unpredictable John Milton (Al Pacino) to work for his big company in New York. He and his wife Mary Ann (the young and talented Charlize Theron) leave Gainesville and see their lives transformed into the most terrible nightmare. The dialogues between Kevin and Milton are extraordinary, specially the last one when the Devil says that Kevin was responsible for every bad thing that happened to him. God gave us free will and he could have made other choices, but he was too ambitious to do so.Although the story line is terrific, the best thing about this film is Al Pacino. The star of `Scent of a woman'(Oscar for best male performance) is simply perfect as John Milton. His performance is so convincing that I have seen the movie more than five times just to admire his talent and that is why I recommend it.",10,1,1,27 February 2000
American Beauty," What a wonderful movie
","I had a teacher (Shirley) who gave me a text about how society was terrible and how we can change it. The world is incredibly beautiful and we can't waste our lives living the way we do. A few months later I saw that text gain color, images and movements. A wonderful picture, excellent performances and a script never seen before made of `American beauty' one of the most successful movies in 1999 and the 2000 Oscar winner. The great insight was to make a comedy instead of a melodramatic movie. `American Beauty' can entertain and cause emotion at the same time. The story of a man who realize his life is terrible and try to change it after fall in love with his daughter's friend is fantastic. Some people didn't understand and thought it was vulgar, they didn't know that it's a satire. In a melodramatic movie the reason he would change his life would be different, since it's a comedy that's why he does it. Some people thought it was merely a critic of the American style of life. It's a critic, but not only to the USA, it's a critic to all the world. In this world everybody is pretending to be something they aren't, like in the movie. Lester pretends he is happy because he has a beautiful family and a good job, but  he isn't. Carolyn pretends she is always successful, it's one of the requisites of her career, she says. Angela pretends she is an experienced woman who has had relationships with boys in her age and now is looking for somebody with experience. Ricky pretends he is a good and innocent son, when he is actually a drug dealer. Jane is kind of authentic, but until she meet Ricky she didn't know what she wanted for real. And that's how the society is, we have to pretend, we have to adapt ourselves to the world forgetting who we really are and what we really want.
To became a good friend we have to abstain of some of our ideas and desires and always agree with our friend. To became a good professional we have to forget about our ideals and do whatever is necessary to succeed, whether we agree with it or not. Our differences are repressed to make of this world `one united world' with no wars and nobody against the rules of the society. Rules that were made by the ones who have the power and benefits of this rules.The union of the world can't be done this way. We have to accept all the differences and learn how to live with them. All defects we can easily find in the people around us is also found in ourselves. Everything we think is the truth may not be for other people.Everyday we pass through all the kinds of natural beauties and we didn't realize that. We are living like robots, with no feelings, no wishes, no wills, no desires. Live like it's the last day of our life doesn't mean we can't make plans to the future, but it makes us think what we would do if an angel appears to us and tell us it is going to be our last day on Earth and we can do anything to spend this day here. We live like this life was eternal, we really want to do something, but we forget about it, `maybe another time', we think, it may not be another time. Lets do it now!
Everywhere we go seems to be enclosed by imaginary barriers that keep us in the way they traced and there's still people who think we are free. I wanted to became a lawyer but then I realized I would never make real justice, I would just adapted myself to this world. Then I found out that the only way to escape of this whole thing is through the art. A movie like that can open people's mind and together we can try to do something. Funny how many things we can think about just by watching it. And I think each time we see it, we think about other things.
With all this about the script, seems like the other aspects of the movie aren't so great. Everything about this movie is wonderful. Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch,  Mena Suvary and Wes Bentley are all magnificent. It's a masterpiece of the seventh art. Don't miss it!",Null,0,0,21 July 2000
Moulin Rouge!," The 'Moulin Rouge!' is Spectacular!
","'It's quite new what I do, but if you are open, you might enjoy it'. This description of Christian's poetry can be applied to the own movie. If you are open, you'll not only enjoy it, but completely fall in love with it. You'll watch it over and over again. You'll pay a lot just to have the dvd. You'll run to find the soundtrack and the original versions of all the songs. You'll read every single material you find about it. That's the only way to like it. You must really dive in. You can't just enjoy it. You can either love it or hate it. If it's possible to hate it? Unfortunately yes. If you're not open, if you're not an uncurable romantic, if you're not a dreamer, if you are as cinical as the World let you, you'll hate it. You'll think its musical dialogues are boring, you'll think the roof scene is ridiculous, you'll think its plot is predictable. Thank God I'm in the first group.We, I'm sure you are one of us, love this movie so much that we can not explain. 'Because those who loves never knows what loves, or why he loves, or what is to love' Fernando Pessoa. I can name a number of reasons why this movie is so great, but I won't know how to explain the reason why. When you watch 'Moulin Rouge!' you leave your place as a simple watcher and you became part of it. You live all the experiences together with those characters, you really dive into that World of fantasy.When you watch it for the first time without having a clue about what you're going to find, you have a mix of sensations that goes from anxiety to a 'funny feeling inside that we can't easily hide'. Soon you'll be introduced to the Moulin Rouge with a magnificent entrance. We go crazy when we recognize our favourite songs. Then a magnificent Nicole Kidman appears from the top. Then we'll go from scene to scene being surprised each time. 'Your Song' enchant ourselves in every possible way. We can't believe what our eyes are seeing when they dance on the roof with an umbrella just like Mary Poppins. Then the 'Elephant Medley' give us a knock out. From this point on if we were captured by it, there's no way out. We've became one of them. If we didn't, we'll only want it to finish as soon as possible.I have a number of friends that are just like me, film buffs that love 'Moulin Rouge!', I mean really 'love', it's not like they've seen it and 'loved' it, they still do, and will always do. But, I have a few friends that against all odds didn't like it. It's really hard to review on a film that cannot be described. I guess I could say how wonderful it's scenery, visual effects and figurine are, but I think you all know that. To talk about the cast is totally unnecessary, everybody knows how they sing, act and dance like complete artists, that old fashioned ones. I'm pretty sure that it wasn't just with Ewan McGregor not to be nominated to any award, Nicole Kidman was nominated. I could go on and on talking about my favourite movie in years, but I guess I've said enough.",Null,1,2,22 July 2002
Pretty Woman," What's your dream?
","There are movies that are perfect, the technique, the performances, the directing, everything... other movies are horrible, we can find a lot of defects everywhere. However, some movies are beyond this whole thing, we simply don't care about the details, they are more than perfect, they are wonderful. 'Pretty Woman' is one of those. Who loves this movie can't say why. It's some kind of feeling we've got after watching it, we just want to see it over and over again and we want to supply our desires and dreams. Life becomes tasty, great, marvellous.I know that a critic would find a lot of reasons why this movie shouldn't be so over rated, but when it comes to art, I don't think it should be rated by the technique but by the feeling of the public.",Null,0,0,7 July 2000
Scream 2," Do you remember me, Sydney?
","The formula is the same as the first one, but it doesn't let us tired. First of all, the excuse they give to make the sequel was the most creative I've seen: Gale, one of the survivors of the first movie, made a book about the massacre and now it became a movie.`Scream 2' tell us the `rules' of a sequel with the same sarcasm of `Scream' and it also proves that this is the only successful teenage horror movie. After `Scream' the cinema was invaded with lots of worse copies of it, but none of them could repeat its success. If you watched the first and liked it. Don't miss this one, it will prove that is not always that sequels follow the rule of being worse than the original movie.",Null,0,0,19 July 2000
Scream," Do you like scary movies?
","My usual answer to this question would be no. I always thought horror movies were silly. Just a lot of blood and idiot characters who just scream and do the most stupid things while getting away of the killer, who never dyes. `Scream' doesn't deny that. On the contrary, the great thing about this movie is exactly that: it plays with the `rules' of horror movies.Movies that take a silly plot serious doesn't work. `Scream' is always laughing of its own plot. In the middle of the movie Randy tell us the rules of his own movie. People talk about a horror movie and right after it, Tatoon appears dressed like the movie character. The parody doesn't end here, during all the movie Kevin Williamson comes with more sarcasm.The cast is great. Beyond all the people who dies, there's Neve Campbel as Sydney Prescot. Courtney Cox when I didn't know her yet, totally different from Monica as Gale Wethers and her future husband David Arquette as Dewey.
Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven had a great idea and made a wonderful job with `Scream'. It was the first time a entertaining movie about teenagers being frightened by a killer actually gained the critics applause. Bravo!!!",Null,0,0,19 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," Frightening, intelligent and sensitive
","Three were the numbers of times I watched this movie till I get the conclusion that... it's perfect. Before I watched it for the first time, I already had great expectations, what is not good, the chances you have to be disappointed is much bigger then. But the opposite happened: I left the cinema wondering how M. Night Shyamalan could do something so perfectly arranged and also coherent. And I am not just talking about the plot, the soundtrack, the camera movements, everything seems to be in the right place.Cole is a twelve-year-old boy who would be like every children in his age if there weren't this simple fact: he can see dead people! The story is focus on Cole's little issue and how Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) will find a way to help him. The movie also has beautiful background themes like: love, losing a close person, familiar relationships, human cruelty, friendship, human rational beliefs and how people always try to find reasonable explanation for everything, beyond of course the relationship between doctor and patient, how they have to be confident with each other to find out the answers.It's not a movie to make people scared like horror films, but it has the elements that can make you jump out of the chair and fell chills in your neck whiling watching it. The bad news is after this movie you might have another opinion about chills ... The same thing will happen about things we can't find anywhere... Never mind, when you see it, you'll understand what I'm talking about.The three things I admire the most about this movie, one for each time I saw it, are: the Haley Joel Osment performance  an Oscar deserved one, the techniques  how it really keeps the watchers attention, and how everything directs to the amazing surprise at the end. Go see it!!!",10,0,0,21 July 2000
