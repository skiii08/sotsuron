First Man," Easily the Most Boring film of 2018
","Drawn to see this movie not only because of my love of all things Space, but the previews showed what looked like a dramatic, exciting experience. Instead, what we watched was them discuss a swingset longer than they discussed any part of the actual moon landing.
Zero drama, acting the equivalent to watching people on high doses of prozac, shaking a freaking camera on a closeup over and over and over to demonstrate what it is like being in a rocket.
HATE does not come close to how I and the 12 other people in the theater felt. When he dropped his daughter's bracelet in the crater on the moon, all that was left in the theater was the popcorn on the floor to watch the ending.
Everyone had had it. Done.
ANGER. Yeah...a great if not THE greatest moment in history as seen by someone without a clue.
I'd bet every great review by a recognized critic was paid for by the movie studio.
Avoid it. Avoid this when it comes on streaming. Buy it as a Christmas gift for someone you secretly hate.
I could go on and on...",1,1,4,12 November 2018
