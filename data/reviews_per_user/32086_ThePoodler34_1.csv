Gremlins," My All-Time Favorite Movie!
","Everybody has that one movie that they never get tired of seeing.  It's usually the same movie that you can quote line for line.  For me, that movie is 'Gremlins'.  This movie has everything.  Comedy, thrills, and a wonderful cast.  Joe Dante is a genius when it comes to directing and the sequel 'Gremlins 2:  The New Batch' is a worthy followup and is also a mustsee. If you have never seen this movie or if it's been a while since you have, I would recommend picking up the Gremlins Special Edition DVD.  ***** out of *****",10,2,3,17 June 2003
