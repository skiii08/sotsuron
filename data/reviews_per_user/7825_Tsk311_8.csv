Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Critics are like the weather men, THEY ARE ALWAYS WRONG!!
","I wish not to ruin this movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, so I won't, But, to say the least...THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE.  People who constantly 'dog' or criticize Star Wars aren't true movie goers or lovers. These mindless critics need to first understand film in order to appreciate it, and someone who instantly regards the film as pointless and bad truly does not comprehend the art of what George Lucas is trying to bring to his audience. Lucas is a creative dreamer, these are fantasies and dreams of his inner child. He has made them as realistic as possible in order to entertain( at free will) society across the Globe, and whether you like Star Wars or not, you need to appreciate this film, as well as the other three. Star Wars is for Lucas  like Goonies is for Spielberg. Its a story, and not every one may like it, but if you don't, then come up with something better.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
U-571," Too many cry-baby comments on here.
","Im getting sick of reading all these repetitive statements 'It was too dull'....'It didnt live up to current events'.....'It was the british'. BLAH BLAH BLAH. This was a good movie, you know why, becuase it will make over 100 million dollars, Look up Das Boot, i guarantee you it didnt make more money when it came out. Its a fact, this movie is good because people, millions of them will pay to see it. PERIOD. THis is a fun movie to enjoy as long as you arent the over-analytical, cry-baby, hypercritical, non-sense, bitter type. Great film, go see it. Great suspense.",10,3,13,22 April 2000
Saving Private Ryan," This is the Greatest movie of all time.
","With out a question this movie is the best of all time. It has touched and affected so many people that have seen it, emotions run rampant, tears fall, people are in suspence. Any movie that can make old WWII veterans leave the theatre because of its realism has got to be number one. It was brilliantly directed, brilliantly written, and the acting was superb. SPR is the best of the best, better than the Godfather, better than the List, better than any motion picture of our time. This movie is simply surreal. GO SEE IT IF YOU HAVENT, buy it if you have. With out a doubt it proves that spielberg is one of the greatest directors of all TIME.",10,0,0,22 April 2000
Mission: Impossible II," I will tell you why this movie is so good.
","OK, First off, I would like to comment on the you people who claim ' This movie was awful, John Woo is terrible'. First of all, if you dislike John Woo so much, STOP SEEING HIS MOVIES, you paid your money to see it, obvoiusly you liked something about it, even it was just Thandie Newton. Which leads to my second point, this movie was AWESOME. Why?. because it topped gross ticket sales this week, and will surely make over 200 million dollars. THAT IS THE SIGN OF A GOOD MOVIE. People will pay 9 bucks to see it. SOunds like a good movie to me. So please, all you wanna be critics, go research and learn more about film, because from what comments i have read on here, all of u that have bashed this movie, really dont know that a good film is. Anyways, go see this Film , it was pretty good, 8/10",Null,0,0,25 May 2000
Titanic," Good Special Effects, bad storyline
","I will admit it, I got sucked up into the Titanic hype, and went to see the Movie with my girlfriend. We were both disappointed. Yes, the visual effects are good, but the true story behind Titanic is the astonishment and shock of the worlds most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage. The fact that it was labeled unsinkable, yet sank! All the unfortunate victims of its doomed first and final voyage. Not about two kids who boink in the back seat of some jalopy! It needed to show more realism, the truth, and have a much better, stronger story. The movie was simply filled with too much cheesy acting, and not enough facts. I'm not saying this cause I'm a guy, I'm saying this because it is what was evidently clear in my eyes when i saw this film, and is congenial with the eyes of many others.",1,5,11,21 May 1999
Final Destination," An orginal clever thriller that will get into your head.
","After seeing the trailer to this movie, I thought at first, 'New teeny bopper horror flick, And i was worried i was going to see 'I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID THESE PAST TWO SUMMERS', thank GOD that wasnt the case. I was reluctant too see Devon Sawa in another horror flick becuz after seeing IDLE HANDS, i figured his career wasnt going anywhere fast, But this movie was very different. The story line and originality in its script is very clever, and suspense inducing. The music that correlates with each scene of horror and suspense is typical, yet very well orchestrated. True, the actors arent necessarily the best when it came to dialogue, but its a Clever horror movie, and not one intended to go to becuz of skilled acting, although the kids in the movie do a well job in their parts. Theres one useless scene where at first you think maybe 2 kids will get on each other in a coffin in one of those chessy horror movie sex scenes, but then They run into an incounter with the 'CANDY MAN', which might have been worse, but luckily its short and brief. Over all this film i thought was one of the better, if not best teeny horror movie ive seen in a while, and it can make you jump a little. Want to scare your girlfriend, and then get lucky afterwards, GO see TITANIC again, just want to scare your Girlfriend, go see this movie, its impressive.",Null,0,1,17 March 2000
Gladiator," Potential to have been a great film, just potential, that is all
","You know, this film was brilliantly directed. The shots, the angles, the lighting, was stunning. The Acting was superb, i couldnt have asked anything more from Crowe. The story, though a kind of a clichÃ©, was good. And the writing was even good, TILL THE END. I really get pissed when i go see a movie that has it all, so much potential, superb acting, great action, and then get so dissappointed when i see what kinda of ending the produccers or whomever tied it all together with. What kind of crap is this, its like Disney produced the movie, Did anyone ever see that awful flick END OF DAYS, do you see something similar here!!?? 'GO to them'....what kinda of cheesy line is that??WHAT KIND OF LAME ENDING IS THAT? I just couldnt stand it. Be more orginal Dreamworks, you are a great studio, don't think you are, NO YOU ARE...(see, now that is cheese). 5/10",Null,0,0,13 May 2000
The Godfather," THis movie is almost as long and boring as Titanic
","I guess i can see why some people like this movie, a boring film will attract boring people, But i am an adventurist, and if it takes more than 3 hours to tell a story, then i dont want to hear it. This movie put me to sleep, and i can honestly say i had a wonderful NAP while this movie took place. The story is slow, not very eventful, just has the sparatic havic scenes like the bad al pacino movie HEAT. Anyways, if you like pacino, fine, be my guest, But this film is far from number 1 in my opinion",Null,1,4,7 April 2000
