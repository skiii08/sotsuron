The Rock," I Strongly recommend seeing this movie!!
","This is a great movie, Jerry Brukheimer and Don Simpson are Geniuses. Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage display a stunning performance in this movie and they both kick a lot of butt together. I own this movie, and it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I would greatly encourage anyone else to buy it also, it ROCK's!!",10,2,2,26 March 2002
