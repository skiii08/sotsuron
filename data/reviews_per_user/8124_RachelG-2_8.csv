The Blair Witch Project," Disappointed
","I like to think that I have a fair amount of imagination and haven't been deadened to good movies by the usual dreck that Hollywood churns out, but this movie was a total waste of money.   The acting wasn't terrible (as far as acting upset and screaming a lot went), but overall I wish I had the money back.  I was really disappointed in this film.  I kept waiting to be scared, or for something vaguely spooky to happen, but it just didn't work for me.  Oh well.Although it was nice to see an actress who didn't look starved  for a change. :)",Null,0,0,20 September 1999
Fight Club," Not what I expected
","After my fiance pestered me for 3 weeks about how great 'Fight Club' was, I finally saw this film.  Yuck.  I thought this film was a big ol' waste of time, and I could watch Edward Norton do almost anything on film and be entertained.  It wasn't what I expected, I was prepared for the violence and general dark atmosphere of the film so that was fine, but the plot was so whacked that it was ludicrous to even try to follow it.  C'mon, with that kind of ending, do you really expect me to think that was a natural conclusion after the rest of the film?  Please.I know there are 'guy' flicks, just like 'chick flicks,' and I strongly suspect that this is a guy flick all the way.  Women, I warn you that you will probably be wishing for something else to do about 1/3 into the film. Bring a book.",Null,0,1,5 June 2000
American Pie," Who needs homework?
","I expected little of this film and I got it.  I saw it at a friend's house when everyone else decided to watch this movie, and it was like being trapped in a frat house for 2 hours (not a good thing.)  And did anyone in this film actually do any homework (besides the 'tutoring episode)?  I'm 23, young enough to remember high school, and I don't remember having this much time to worry about 'getting some.'  Darn extracurriculars.I will admit that the dancing kid at the end did sort of crack me up, but otherwise this film really was a piece of dreck.  Maybe if I were younger I'd like it.",3,2,4,12 January 2000
American Beauty," Great film
","I am extremely impressed with 'American Beauty'.  My fiance and I finally got a chance to see it, since it took forever to get to our little town, and we both thought it was terrific.  What a great film.  Everyone in it acted well, the details were perfect, and it didn't wrap up with some cheesy happy ending like so many midlife crisis films do.We live near the area code displayed on the real estate signs, and were wondering if they had purposely picked that area code (847).  (This is the code for the north Chicago suburbs.)Special commendation for Kevin Spacey for his performance.  I believed that he -was-  Lester in every minute he was on film.  I never felt that he was acting.  He definitely should be nominated for an Oscar, at minimum.There's nothing worse than being ordinary...",10,0,0,25 October 1999
Titanic," Thought I would hate it
","When this movie first came out, I thought it looked like a piece of romantic, girlie-movie drivel.  After at least 20 people told me it was great, I convinced my boyfriend to go with me.  We got to the theater ahead of the adolescent mobs and settled in, me praying that it would at least be OK.  Wow!  This movie was WAY better than I ever thought it would be! Although it's a Hollywood movie in every way, especially in the plot and mediocre writing, I admit that I was sucked in.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It reminds me a lot of old-fashioned Hollywood movies, where the whole film is out to blow you away and actually succeeds.Yes, some of the acting is, well, subpar, and the dialogue has some truly cringe-inducing moments, but overall, this is a darn good film.  It's nice to see it now and again, not to criticize or play erudite film scholar, but just to enjoy a movie.",8,1,3,23 March 2000
The Matrix," It's all effects
","Somewhere along the line, someone planning this film forgot to put in a plot.  It's worse than 'Twister' in that respect.  Ooh look at all our fancy camera tricks and weapons and weird sci-fi stuff that really makes no sense. But it's loud!  And that makes a good film, you know.  And I would love, just once in my life, to see Keanu Reeves not play a blank-faced doofus in every movie he's made since 'Bill and Ted.'In short, I absolutely and totally hated this film.  My fiance loves it and watches it at least once a month, but I would rather clean out a cat box every hour for the rest of my life than ever see this film again.",1,38,95,10 May 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Pretty funny
","I've seen this film about 6 times over the past 10 years, and for whatever reason I always think it's going to be funnier than it is.  Don't get me wrong--I enjoy the film and the goofy stuff that's going on throughout it, but I think that 'Holy Grail' has been somewhat overblown by its fans. There are parts of this movie that are kind of boring, but it's still a good watch, especially the Camelot dancing scene.  I've always found that scene just hysterical.A good film overall, except the ending.  Feh!  What the heck was that for an ending?!",8,0,0,10 May 2000
High Fidelity," Not that great
","I saw this movie last weekend, pulled in by the trailers.  Unfortunately, the trailers showed the best parts of the movie.  I normally like John Cusack as an actor, but this movie was a real turn-off.  Took forever to get started, to the point that I almost dozed off in the beginning, and I cared very little about any of the characters.  Why was Rob so hung up on Laura when she was such a yutz?  The only character I liked at all was the Michael Stipe lookalike, that was all.  I wondered if I would have liked this film more if I were older and remembered all the music.  I just thought this film was really dull and the characters were not people I would ever want to know.Not recommended.",5,0,0,24 April 2000
