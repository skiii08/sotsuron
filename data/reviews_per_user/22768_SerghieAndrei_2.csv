Howl's Moving Castle," Amazing
","This is one of the best animation that I have ever seen. Of course, the other ones are also directed by Hayao Miyazaki. I was tired to watch animations with the same plot and the same action, until I found this one. This is a masterpiece. The script is original and the story is one of a kind. I can watch this one over and over again.",10,0,0,11 July 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," 'Spooky'
","I know this movie since I was just a kid. I grow up with movies like this.
I can watch this over and over again without getting bored.
I think that this is the most mysterious part of the franchise.
It has a 'spooky' way to capture you. And the soundtrack is just amazing.",10,0,0,11 February 2020
