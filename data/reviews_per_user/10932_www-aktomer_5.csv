Miracle," An Inspirational Movie
","The movie shows the hard work and dedication required to 'perform a MIRACLE'. It only takes one visionary to set the eye on the impossible, and if you have the means and the heart to achieve it, there is no such deed as impossible. That's the gist of the movie.
One of the best sports movie to watch.",8,2,2,24 May 2019
Happy Gilmore," An average comedy
","A typical Adam Sandler movie, with some typical jokes and some genuine ones. Not a 2-time watch. Also, Julie Bowel looks hot in the movie.",6,1,3,22 May 2019
We Are Marshall," Over portrayal of emotions
","Don't get me wrong. I feel for the people who suffered. I commend on the theme of the movie, that fighting on is more important than giving up, even when the odds are against you. But what bothers me is that you don't have to do that for 130 minutes straight.
The cast have done a fabulous job and they have given their best. Kudos!!",7,0,0,24 May 2019
Ratatouille," Awesome movie!
","I generally like animated movies more, so my review might be biased a little. But overall, the movie was great. It was very relatable. Not a rat cooking in a kitchen, of course, but in breaking out of mainstream, going against the wind, breaking the stereotypes. That kind of stuff.
Going to my all time favourites definitely!",10,5,5,4 June 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Continuation of Part I
","Baba Yaga continues to hit it. Whenever I''ll wanna watch John Wick, I'll binge watch both the parts. Action packed Part II. Awesome!",7,0,1,22 May 2019
