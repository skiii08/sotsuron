The King's Speech," On the edge of your seat drama
","This film is one of the best movies I have ever seen in a long while. There are few movies out there that have had me on the edge of my seat at the start. You are so moved as soon as Colin Firth (Prince George) says his first word. The hairs just went up at the back of my neck watching him. The performances of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are just mesmerising and you just feel the electricity of the two actors together. They just click and you are so much taken along for the ride. You can't help but feel for Colin Firth's character in this as Prince George with this huge fear, the temper and the embarrassment of his problem. There is quite a bit of comedy in the film so it's got everything really. Some of it really makes you smile.A special mention needs to be made about Helena Bonham Carter as the queen mother Elizabeth. So much likeness and sweetness to the character but a steely nonsense too. She's amazingly - spot on. The ending is just breathtaking and so touching. It's fabulous. The supporting cast and the direction by Tom Hooper just make this a one in a million film. 10/10 love it",10,1,2,28 September 2015
2012," How Oliver Platt is not punched in this movie is beyond me
","This movie is hilariously stupid! It's laugh out loud so over the top with its disasters happening and so quickly too and it takes way too long to get its message across. The only stars who hold the movie are John Cusack, Woodly Harrelson and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Thandie Newton tries her best with the female lead but isn't up to much. Oliver Platt boy do I want to punch him in his great big teeth or wish it was written in the script for one of the characters to do so. I know it's his character Carl that grates but do you not want to hit him in the whole movie with the heartlessness and just overall cruelty?? Awful movie - don't bother wasting your time. Gets me down totally. No happiness to it really",4,1,4,4 June 2016
The Green Mile," A real tearjerker but undoubtedly spellbinding
","This movie is gripping from the minute it starts until the credits roll. Yes it is over 3 hours long, but you are so taken in by the ride of the film the time has gone before you can blink. I am not going to spoil it as I think watching is better to find out what it's like yourself. I have always been a huge fan of Tom Hanks and his performance is just flawless, maybe one of the best I've seen made even better by the amazing supporting cast. A special mention has to be made about Michael Clarke Duncan (John Coffey) and also Michael Jeter (Edward Delecroix) on their supporting roles in the film loving them acting opposite Tom Hanks - sadly wishing they were both still alive with us to this day making more movies.Brutal Howell (David Morse) to see him playing a good guy but having that powerful screen presence to support the characters in the movie is mesmerising to watch.I also loved the overlooked probably forgotten Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper) and Harry Terwilliger ( Jeffrey DeMunn). Jan Edgecomb (Bonnie Hunt), Hal Moores (James Cromwell) All their supporting roles really help the film move along so brilliantly. The cruel prison guard Percy Whitmore (Doug Hutchison) and William Wharton' Billy the Kid' ( Sam Rockwell) give brilliant convincing scenes in the film as the main antagonists. You really feel their vile natures come across here. Frank Darabond as Director is second to none. The sound and picture I am lost for words on. Just a perfect movie, a showstopper with a needing of tissues at the end. It's enough to crack the hardest of hearts 10/10",10,1,2,27 September 2015
