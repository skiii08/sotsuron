The Longest Yard," It was worth the Admission
","I am a long-time fan of the original, and I was thoroughly prepared to hate this remake...However.Adam Sandler pulled it off. He not only retained the spirit of the first one, but also added some great bits to the film. The least of which was the pill switch with one of the guards. A gag that gets laughs throughout the movie. Mr. Sandler also earned points in sneaking in actors from the original film, and not re-writing 'history' to update the film for the younger audiences. Kudos and huzzahs all around for this one.",9,1,7,27 May 2005
