Requiem for a Dream," Requiem For A Person Who Waste His Time And Money
","Whatever if you take good actors or not, it's just extremely ridiculous ! Here is the scenario: three idiots decide to take drugs and drugs and drugs...What happens to them ? Oh, my god ! they suffer! They become addicted, nervous, get crazy, but it's just so ridiculous, there's no scenario, if Clint Mansell didn't have write that very good music, the film would have been so much dumb, it would be as slow as Titanic ! Don't waste your time and your money in this bullshit, Darren Aronofsky shows us that he doesn't have any talent, because it's too much straightforward to show dumb people always getting in bigger and bigger problems , until madness of addictions! And Requiem For A Person Who Waste His Time And Money is not 'the most shocking film ever', so, are you shocked, now ?",1,4,8,1 June 2013
Fight Club," A very smart and useful movie(waring, readers! spoilers ahead!)
","I knew this movie for years before i watched it recently, and i can't help but thinking about it to motivate myself, since this movie is especially about the true power of mind and body. The story of a man who discovers that there is no cure to his insomnia. One thing after the other, he will meet dangerous people and will do bad things, he will learn about himself and become someone else, someone he always wanted to become. when his flat burns out, he asks his new friend for some help. This one accepts, but only at one condition: he must hit him. Fighting in front of a bar, two guys see them and, together, they create the Fight Club, which fights occurs in the basement of the bar. t It's smart, funny, and, sometimes, so clever and well-thought, you forget the rawness of the whole movie, and you just follow the story that goes very, very far...! Edward Norton is so great, so entertaining, and Brad Pitt is also so, so truly a legendary actor! And even though i've found, i think, some mistakes in the movie, it doesn't prevent me from loving it and saying to the people around me that Fight Club is one of the best film ever made. At one point, it just plays with your mind and tricks it. See it! Go see this movie!",9,0,1,30 October 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Fascinating action thrilling-chilling out scenes.
","First things first, this movie isn't shot as a movie. I explain: if you see the scene where Captain is fighting is enemy(scenes totally shown in the trailers), you'll see that Joe and Anthony Russo shot this film as something new, something revolutionary. Just a moment ago, i watched again and counted(I may have mistaken), 71 shots in that scene. This film isn't just taking itself seriously, it is a serious film, it really is. In the theaters, I was divided between fascination and incomprehension. Absolutely incredible. This is more than what I could have ever imagined. This is the best superhero film i have ever watched in my whole life, even better than The Dark Knight, which was already extremely good. This s pure entertainment for superhero fans. Conspiracies, betrayals, friendships, leaderships...But personally, this movie is a true source of motivation, the fact that they are 'super humans', that their body steams regenerate, that their endurance is, like, four times increased, and that they simply have a better resistance to everything that hurts. Because a movie isn't just a pictures-gathering: it's a mentality that leaks through those same pictures, those characters, those stories. And that's what gives this film: a motivation, a true symbol of hope. Oh, and the music of Henry Jackman is so outstanding. Also, the technology here is wonderfully used. Everything is simply perfect!",10,0,1,3 June 2014
The Evil Dead," Disturbing bloody-disgusting gore.
","Sam Raimi directed the first biggest horror film ever. The Evil Dead is fascinating, the cabin is really old, the script is awesome; but beyond all this, you have one of the most disturbing film ever. Indeed, you don't show this to children. Some scenes are violent, some others are completely mad, but, you're still able to enjoy it, watch it many times, again and again, with passion. Not the funniest movie ever, right, but, as i said before, some mad scenes, by the extreme of the thing itself, can make you kind of laugh. The Evil Dead, considered as the 'perfect horror film', deserves this title, by his originality, his bloody brutality, and his frightening story. You won't stop the film while you're watching it, you won't forget it, but you'll love it !",10,0,1,26 March 2013
Godzilla," Totally overrated, don't trust any rate under 8 out of 10!
","Thank you so much Gareth Edwards for this stunning movie! This is what Godzilla fans(and movie monsters fans as well), were waiting for! And even more!It represents extremely well the force of nature as it was planned to do. A great scenario for great actors and actresses. Epicness, pure madness, some really poetic moments of destruction and of freedom.Sometimes, when Godzilla roars, I was(and it's true!), holding the armrests of the sit as he was taking his breath; and when he finally releases his roar, this is purely astonishingly awesome! Everything is here to spend two hours, (not that long, actually), in a really great joy. They show us that despite the fact they are monsters, the closest living creature from the Mutos are the spiders, and Godzilla, the lizard, obviously; this shows us one thing: the monsters(all of them), are humanized. But i won't tell more to avoid any spoilers. The man is the species which is actually shown like the real monster, with all those nuclear weapons unfairly threw on innocent people. Just go watch this movie in theaters, without 3d, it will give a better look at the special effects, especially for the monsters, I believe!",10,3,7,3 June 2014
