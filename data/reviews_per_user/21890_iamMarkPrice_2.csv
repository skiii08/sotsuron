Hereditary," Average horror film or a compelling drama?
","Set in modern day, Hereditary tells the tale of events that set upon a family of 4 following the death of grandmother Eileen. With solid pacing and dramatic cut sequences the editing does it's very best with what are otherwise less than compelling visuals and an overall absence of tention. Scenes tend to either be visually empty or far to visually dense and distracting, with few examples of middle ground throughout. Casting is adequate with performance from Toni Collette that is easily amongst her personal best. Character development is quite strong, with relatable moments and fantastic dramatic subtexts. Humour and symbolism are used well, helping to keep the balance. However, cliches do exist here most notably the use of a Donny Darko style light in a much to overdone and obvious way. This film likewise abounds with foreshadowing making it wholly predictable, which just might be the point. Overall, like those who have come before from A26 a film worth watching once, but probably not a second time.",4,1,3,15 September 2018
A Quiet Place," Frustratingly Cringeworthy
","A quiet place tells the story of an isolated family surviving in a desolate world marred by silence. To make a sound means near certain death, in what should be a suspenseful thrill ride but completely misses the beat. Best described as an emotional drama rather than a thriller, a quiet place is racked by pacing issues, sub-par acting in a script with almost no dialogue and above all else a plot so poorly thought out that you'll question your anti-piracy stance when you remember how much you paid to see this. A clear contender for worst film of the year, this film is coma inducing levels of slow to progress with long spaces of nothing happening. The brief moments of action are, sadly, no savior instead leaving one groaning at the neon plot holes that riddle this film. Creature design is especially poor, neglecting key features of real biological entities making them less believable and thus far less threatening to watch. All in all I spent more time with this film as an outsider looking in, than lost inside the story. ----------
*Spoiler* 
-----------
Central to the films demise is the ambiguity towards the types of sounds these creatures attack, verses those they do not. Something dropped in the opening scene threatens to bring attack, but the sounds of paper rustling in the breeze do not? Footsteps, only when convenient to the story either draw them or do not. But most of all, no one apparently thinks to weaponize sound to draw them to an IED. 
-----------In summary, a quiet place reminds us that even if you through money at a bad project so that it looks pretty, it will remain a bad project.",2,1,4,9 June 2018
