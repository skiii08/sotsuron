Catch Me If You Can," what a delightful surprise !
","I passed this by when I saw it on the racks because I had never heard of it and because 'Titanic' ruined Leonardo deCaprio for me. However I caught a trailer for it at the beginning of the film I wound up renting that day, and was intrigued. It was my subsequent rental, and turned out to be a delightful surprise, and one of the best movies I have seen lately.Right at the start, Spielberg is making a nostalgic gesture towards older days with the elaborate, whimsical title sequence. The title sequence became a whole deal unto itself in movies of the 60's & 70's (take, e.g., Saul Bass's great work in this area for Alfred Hitchcock), but has pretty much disappeared nowadays. It was nice to revisit this experience, with John Williams' playful score augmenting the visuals. An auspicious start.DeCaprio's work here makes me revise my low expectations of him. He does a fine job here as the driven Frank Abagnale. Likewise for Tom Hanks as agent Handratty, my only complaint with whom is his phony Boston accent. The chemistry between the two is great.The excellent script and Spielberg's direction keeps the movie going at a good clip and definitely keeps us on the edge of our seat as we see Frank artfully keep one step ahead of the dogged Handratty. The film is richly textured as well. It works as a suspense/intrigue movie, but also shows us Frank's complex motivations and confused family life. It also skillfully interweaves some delightful moments of ironic humor. Mention must be made of Christopher Walken - a fine and underrated actor - who here does a superb job as Frank's well-meaning, but doomed-to-failure father. Walken does a great job of making us feel sympathy for this man who never seems quite able to get his life together, but whose intentions are always good. On the whole, an excellent movie which takes us back to simpler days when moviemakers found fascinating stories about interesting people and told them as entertainingly as they could.",8,0,1,1 July 2003
Child 44," not what I expected
","As a devotee of Soviet history I expected this movie, from what I had read, to be a look at the treatment of orphan children under Stalin's regime. I guess I didn't read closely enough. What begins as a decent portrayal of the cruelty and brutality of Communist Russia evolves, slowly and interminably into a Slavic episode of 'Law and Order,' except that Law and Order did not have so many gratuitous and drawn out fight scenes. Unlike other viewers, I applaud the Russia accents, as unevenly as they are executed. The dialogue could use some brushing up. I don't think the idiomatic expression 'a complete wash' was in use in Russia at the time. Basically however, the movie descends from a decent beginning to a mundane murder mystery with too many improbable turns to be convincing. And it's too damn long.",4,0,3,11 February 2016
Spartacus," simply grand
","One of the best of the post-WWII historical epics. The grandly sweeping vision of the film is matched by few others (Lawrence, the deMille spectaculars, etc.) and the movie, in my view definitely sustains its length. Superb acting all around from the leads, and Peter Ustinov is wickedly delightful. Definitely has to be seen in the restored, letterbox version; to watch it in TV size format is to miss half the movie. It is quite possible that battle scenes such as the climactic one here might never be filmed again. Devotees of the score are directed to jazz pianist Bill Evan's treatment of the love theme in his great recording, 'Conversations with Myself'. A classic; yes, even a 'timeless classic'.",9,0,1,30 June 1999
Unbreakable," a total stinkeroo
","An overall 7.2 rating? What a commentary on popular taste.This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. There was, after all, Plan Nine from Outer Space, Lost Horizon (1973), Pi, Lady in a Cage, and other assorted atrocities. But it definitely is in the neighborhood.If this an example of this Shyamalan fellow's supposed genius, I am decidedly unimpressed.Let's start with the pacing, which is on the level of watching paint dry or corn grow. Then there is the central plot idea, which goes way beyond suspension of disbelief. The concept is just simply preposterous.Bruce Willis appears to have been sedated. Samuel Jackson does the best he can with the ridiculous lines he must read. And as far as the supposed 'surprise ending,' give me a break, please. And the phony closing wrapups which try to make us believe this really happened, puh-leeeez.Fortunately I had nothing better to do during the time I watched this dog, otherwise I'd be looking for a way to get my 106 minutes back.",2,1,4,20 January 2017
As Good as It Gets," huh?
","I can't understand the raves this one got. The relationship between Nicholson and Hunt is unconvincing, unlikely, improbable, incredible, unbelievable, and any other synonym you can come up with. It simply doesn't ring true that she could possibly tie up with him after the wretched treatment he dished out to her. And as their relationship is the main line of the story, that doesn't leave much else. I gave it a 4.",4,1,5,18 June 1999
Seven Years in Tibet," seems like seven hours of tedium
","Despite the sumptuous photography, and a score - almost unnoticeable - by John Williams, this movie can only be recommended to fans of Tibetan culture or those interested in the history of the Chinese invasion of Tibet. It is based on the true story of the 1940's Tibetan sojourn of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber. The movie is too long, and too many events are crammed into the first half-hour. Pitt, doubtless chosen for his blond Nordic good looks, is spectacularly miscast here; his Austrian accent sounds like Sylvester Stallone doing Colonel Clink. I learned more than I wanted to know (gag) about Tibetan funeral customs. The movie has the best of intentions, but....",5,4,12,30 June 1999
The English Patient," takes plenty of patience to make it thru....
","I finally rented this one to see what all the fuss was about. I am still wondering. That this flat, boring, glacially-paced, lifeless, leaden effort should be considered one of the great movies of the age is a depressing thought. A great film leaves itself imprinted in the mind; I saw this several months ago and I remember a) the opening plane crash & b) the closing death scene. The interminable 2+ hour (seemed like 4 at the time) gap in between is just a blur. So much for moviemaking in this day and age.",4,5,11,30 June 1999
Billy Elliot," simply superb
","It is a crime that this movie didn't get an Academy Award. You don't have to be a ballet fan to be enthralled by this story of a poverty-stricken kid in a grungy Welsh mining town who completely by chance becomes enthralled by the world of dance, and to his instructor's amazement and his father's and brother's dismay, has the talent and ambition to want to go all the way with it. The movie is really about the triumph of the spirit and about family love and sacrifice. It's a beautiful, yes even uplifting and inspiring film. The kid who plays Billy does an absolutely phenomenal job, way beyond his years. Don't miss it (caveat: the accents are a bit thick, and it is essential to the plot to know that the word 'pouf', used a lot here, is analogous in the UK to our degrading American terms 'fag' or 'queer'). This is a film that will last through the years.",8,0,0,8 June 2001
Ed Wood," offbeat gem likely to become a classic
","'Ed Wood' is one of the most unusual and entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. Wood was director in the 50's of the notoriously wretched 'Plan Nine from Outer Space', which has achieved a reputation as possibly the worst movie ever made. This off-the-wall quasi-docudrama - appropriately shot in black & white - relates Ed's travails in the movie business producing these masterpieces of schlock, as well as chronicling his friendship with Bela Lugosi, with whom he became friends long after Lugosi had become an aging, ailing, drug-addicted Hollywood has-been.One would expect the tone of such a movie to be one of ridicule, but there is a kind of zany respect here for Wood's sincerity. He may have had lousy taste, limited imagination and non-existent talent, but he never stopped believing in what he was doing. Watching his career unfold is fascinating; like a train wreck, you can't stop watching.Martin Landau is absolutely brilliant as Lugosi. Aside from the masterful makeup job, his performance as the ravaged actor is by turns hilarious, touching, and tragic (I believe he got an Oscar for best supporting actor for this). Landau is truly one of the best actors around.This is a must-see movie.",8,0,0,16 June 1999
Insomnia," excellent
","I found this movie to be a big cut above the run-of-the-mill shoot-em-up thrillers churned out nowadays. The creepy atmosphere of this remote Alaskan town in the far north country where the sun never sets is captured very well and creates an unsettled and unnerving undercurrent. Pacino's and William's work is very good here. The story, in addition to being a superb crime drama, is an excellently crafted tale of moral ambiguity, as the policeman's fate becomes slowly and inexorably conflated with that of the perpetrator. A movie for grownups, I think.",7,0,0,27 February 2003
Midnight in Paris," annoying exercise in name-dropping
","I am a Woody Allen fan and yet I must be the lone monotone in the chorus of praise here. The gorgeous opening cinematic montage of Parisian scenes, accompanied by what I have to believe is Woody himself on clarinet in the musical accompaniment, leads us to believe we are in for a Gallic 'Manhattan.' But this movie is several steps down from Woody's brilliant love letter to New York. That movie had a credible and engaging - if morally questionable - plot, about a middle age man dating a high school girl (little did we know at the time). But the story here, aside from its fantastic elements, is thin and without dramatic direction. Once the initial time travel back to the Paris of the 20's happens, there is very little else of consequence. And the film has to be completely meaningless to anyone without a solid historical knowledge of the intellectual scene in Paris in the Roaring 20's. As a matter of fact it doesn't take long before the film becomes a pretentious exercise in name-dropping that actually becomes annoying. Gee let's see if we can name the next writer/artist/playwright/musician that's going to walk in the door. And Allen's political beliefs, which, if they were touched on at all in previous movies, were treated with subtle whimsy, are here wielded like a two-by-four. And I find Owen Wilson completely unsuited for the role of Allen's alter ego. He just doesn't have the feel for the Allen persona, and I'm sorry, but he should get that broken nose fixed as all it does is distract. I was vastly disappointed, and am at a loss to explain the rave reviews this movie has received.",3,21,37,9 January 2012
Youth," only the scenery is worth watching
","I wonder if either Michael Caine or Harvey Keitel regrets having made this movie? One wonders what they thought of the project when proposed, and what they thought after seeing the result. I don't know about Keitel, but Caine certainly doesn't need the money, so one wonders why he signed on to such a pretentious, artsy-fartsy piece of balderdash. Unless, as I say, the project sounded different when presented. First of all, there is no coherent story line. Oh there' s plenty of family acrimony between father and daughter, and some confict between a pair of lovers splitting up, and a scenery-chewing scene between two elderly, separated show business types reaching the end sof their lives and careers. And of course the reference to homsexuality that is de rigeur nowadays. But they are presented as isolated threads with no unifying theme to draw them together. Then we have the pretentiousness. A plethora of cryptic and obscure scenes with weird stagings oddly shot, reminiscent of Fellini, are scattered throughout the film, like trash over a landscape, and make the viewer wonder just what the hell is going on at that particular moment. It wasn't quite bad enough to make me stop the film in the middle, but that is only because of the gorgeous cinematography of the Swiss landscape. Still, I wish, as they say, that I could have my two hours back.",3,1,2,21 April 2018
Gettysburg," a contrarian opinion
","The makers of 'Gettysburg' are to be commended for releasing it on video in 'letterbox' format to preserve the broad sweep of the cinematography as seen in the movie theatre, which is especially important in the battle scenes.This is a looooooooooong movie (over 4 hours) and I wish I could say it didn't seem that long, but I can't (It took me 3 nights to get thru it, so maybe I missed the continuity that would come from a continuous viewing). I have mixed feelings about this movie, which I wanted and expected to rave over, but something about it is lacking. It never seems to rise above being a good documentary to the level of conveying in a fully involving way, emotionally and intellectually, the full historical significance of this seminal battle in a seminal war. One wonders what a David Lean would do with the subject.Part of it was the score, which I found sadly lacking. This subject needs a John Williams and a full symphony orchestra; the producers settled for a synthesizer and a composer not up to the task. In many cases, I found the music inappropriate in mood for the particular scene, and the pacing of the score overall did nothing to build the dramatic tension. There were lapses in the accuracy of the speech patterns for the period (I don't think 'how ya doin'?' was in currency as a greeting at that time). 'Meaning' is provided by the heavy-handed insertion of many dialogue scenes, so we have a disjointed effect of action-dialogue-action-etc. The script in the dialogue scenes is, overall heavy-handed and obvious.Good acting all around, especially Sam Elliott as Gen. Buford and Martin Sheen as Robert E. Lee. But the standout is Richard Jordan, who brings real emotional impact to his portrayal of Gen. Armistead (his death shortly after the movie was finished, gives an added poignancy to his portrayal).No quibbling about the battle scenes, which are played by hundreds (thousands?) of history buffs from clubs which regularly recreate Civil War battles. In particular, Pickett's charge, the climactic point, is powerfully portrayed in all its horrible and tragic grandeur.'Gettysburg', flawed as it is, is none the less essential viewing for Civil War buffs. But if you aren't one, you'll never make it through all 248 minutes.",5,1,4,8 July 1999
The Best Years of Our Lives," all it's cracked up to be
","Nothing to add, really, to the encomia of praise contained below. I had missed catching this iconic flick several times on TCM and finally caught up with it. I had feared it might be somewhat of a soap opera, but it is an exemplar of the type of film that is able to make the viewer care very deeply about the characters portrayed. The bond that is clearly shown between the three central characters - men who had not previously known each other, either at home or during the war - shows us what a powerful bonding experience fighting for one's country is. They clearly 'know' each other in a way that transcends geography and class. In a certain way this movie tells us more about WWII than many of the overtly action flicks.Another thing that this great movie brings home is the sad difference between moviemaking then and now. What we have here is clearly a powerful story about a shared national experience, with great relevance to people's lives and a strong social commentary, done up as a work of cinematic art, and Sam Goldwyn, William Wyler and all involved knew it. Compare this with the crass way that today's Hollywood churns out the dreck it calls 'product', with its eyes on nothing else than the bottom line.
A note: those not familiar with the story of Harold Russell, the amputee who played Homer Parrish and went on to found AMVETS, would do well to look it up. His is a fascinating story. (And IMDB is just the place to look it up!)",7,16,29,3 June 2003
Glory," glorious!
","This story of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first all-black unit to fight in the Civil War, will appeal to Civil War buffs and history fans in general, as well as devotees of war movies, and those drawn to the social aspects of the story.The film deals with the difficulty the regiment had in dealing with the entrenched antipathy of the regular troops, the public,  and the War Dept. in accepting an all-black unit. They were formed with reluctance, given supplies grudgingly, and were at first used only for manual labor in the war effort.Due to Shaw's persistence, however, they were finally given combat duty, in which they demonstrated exceptional bravery, winning the respect of all concerned.It's an excellent film all around; good performances (I expected Broderick, with his youth, to have trouble with the part of Shaw, but he turns in a very creditable performance), good script, good photography, and the battle sequences are truly blood-curdling.Historical accuracy was obviously important to the makers of this film. A battlefield guide at Gettysburg informed our party that 'Glory' was the most accurate Civil War film he had seen, far exceeding the much-vaunted 'Gettysburg'.The movie lags just a bit here & there, but overall it is gripping and inspiring. It's a must-see.A note for metropolitan Boston residents: Shaw and the 54th are commemorated in a bronze bas-relief by the sculptor St. Gaudens on the Boston Common, facing the steps of the statehouse (the sculpture forms the backdrop for the final credits).",7,1,2,9 July 1999
The Caine Mutiny," It was the strawberries!!!!!
","This one thoroughly deserves its reputation as a classic, but it must be borne in mind that this is fiction. How such a case would have resolved itself in actuality is open to debate. Aside from such quibbling, the story is gripping and builds nicely to the climactic courtroom scene. Good work all around from Fred McMurray (whose memory will unfortunately always be sullied by 'My Three Sons'), Jose Ferrer and Van Johnson, and of course Bogart in his quintessential role as Captain Queeg. Robert Francis as Ensign Keith is a tad too earnest, in a Boy Scout sort of way, for my taste, though this is doubtless what they were looking for in the part (I note thru IMDB that his career ended with his untimely death in a plane crash shortly after this movie was made). This really is - to use the overworked term - a classic.",8,1,1,27 March 2000
The Thing," Maltin's wrong
","Maltin is completely wrong when he says the effects in this '82 remake of the '51 classic overwhelm the suspense here. The effects are without question fabulously gruesome but they add to, not detract from, the suspense. The creepy 'what's going to happen next?' mood of the film - set at the beginning by the enigmatic appearance of the dog hunted by the crazed Norwegian - is never curtailed by the gory proceedings. The film works itself slowly and inevitably towards its grimly dark conclusion. This is simply one the best of its genre, for my money (and I see my opinion is shared by most of the commenters here).",7,1,3,23 October 2000
Trouble with the Curve," trouble with the flick
","'Gran Turino' this ain't. In that movie Eastwood's crotchety old man routine was effective and necessary to the plot's theme of redemption. In this dog, it's just threadbare and hackneyed. Everything about this movie is formulaic, predictable and manipulative. None of the characters has any depth - they are all cardboard cutouts. Every plot development can be seen coming a mile away. All that's missing is black hats and white hats to mark the good guys and the bad guys. I take some consolation in the fact that Eastwood's contribution to the flick was as actor only. If he had had any input into the script or the direction, I am sure the results would have been better. As it is this movie is almost unwatchable.",2,2,7,28 April 2013
Salt," puh-leeez !!!
","A previous viewer was spot on when he or she said that no one with a mental age higher than 12 could enjoy this movie. Even action/adventure movies need some minimum degree of credibility, and nothing, absolutely nothing in this movie rings true. The story is the worn out cliché of a plot to get the U.S. and Russia to attack each other. 'SPECTRE' in the James Bond flicks ran that one ragged years ago. And the James Bond flicks were meant to be viewed as cartoons, so the over-the-top charades in them could be enjoyed for the fun they were. The same shtick in a movie that wants to taken seriously as an action flick simply just doesn't work. It starts right at the beginning with Jolie's character escaping from a high security facility and jumping onto vehicle after vehicle from overpasses with nary a bruise, then later dispatching dozens of armed thugs with a few karate kids. Fuggedaboutit. The really depressing thing is that dreck like this can be swallowed by the viewing public.",2,2,6,13 August 2011
No Country for Old Men," A lot of hype and a big hit, but in the end disappointing
","I was happy to find copies of this flick on the video store shelves after all the hoopla about the movie, and I looked forward to seeing what all the brouhaha was about. After viewing it I have to register a negative opinion. From the start, the movie does indeed draw the viewer in to what seems to promise to be a pretty good - and very well made - action, adventure, mystery (&c &c &c) flick. We do, however, sense a dichotomy here. One part of the movie seems to want to be an action thriller, as the bad guy tracks the good guy and we all get enthralled with who will outsmart the other. I just wish they had followed this line through to a logical conclusion. The other half of the movie seems to be devoted to enshrining Tommy Lee Jones on Mt. Rushmore, and pursuing some sort of barren vision of the Old West, with dry, acerbic, minimalist dialogue that seems at odds with the advanced firepower of the two guys trying to kill each other. I like Tommy Lee Jones, but it seems sad that he is content to make movies where the producers know that his wizened visage and past filmic history will draw viewers, even if all he does is mutter (and I do mean mutter, in that a lot of his dialogue is unintelligible) formulaic bits of Old West wisdom. Robert Duvall does this sort of thing better and more intelligently. There is also a major editing break towards the end of the film, where a lot of plot threads seemed to have wound up on the cutting room floor (e.g. the mother's death) and the viewer finds himself at a loss. Sheriff Bell's dry conversations, in the last part of the movie, with various hard-to-identify people do not, in the end, compensate for the great question the first half of the movie raised, i.e. 'WHERE THE HELL DID THE 2 MIILLION GO?'My last adventure in watching highly rated contemporary flicks, the overrated 'Michael Clayton' led to the same disappointment. As an old fart, I'm going back to 'Double Indemnity' and 'White Heat.'",4,2,5,20 April 2008
Zulu," hard to beat for its genre
","I found it most interesting to read the comments of British viewers more conversant with the history of the battle of Rorke's Drift, on which this wonderful movie is based. I learned a few things, but my admiration for the flick is undiminished by the few historical liberties I learned the movie takes (although evidently Hook's descendants should sue for slander).The stunning sweep of the cinematography makes the letterbox version (which is available) essential in order to sense the vastness of the African countryside and the turmoil of the battle scenes.A wonderful script is brought to life by some great acting, the greatest of which is by Nigel Green as Colour Sgt. Bourne. His portrayal of Bourne as a seemingly impossible combination of stern disciplinarian yet gentle paterfamilias to his men, some of whom are barely past boyhood, is powerful and downright moving in places; it ranks as one of the finest screen performances I have seen, and makes the movie worth seeing for it alone. If his work here is indicative of his ability, I am at a loss as to why we never saw more of this fine actor. Also notable are Patrick Magee as Surgeon Reynolds, and Michael Caine in his first screen appearance. Richard Davies and Denys Graham provide understated comic relief as a sort of Welsh Laurel & Hardy. And Jack Hawkins scenery-chewing job as the sodden Witt - 'You're all going to die!' - is worth the price of having no basis in the historical record (his presence here as a sort of prophetic voice is well-justified dramatically).In short, in the genre of historical battle flicks, 'Zulu' is in the top ranks.Has Leonard Maltin actually seen all the movies listed under his comments??? His reference to Richard Burton's 'narration' gives one pause. Burton's brief voiceovers at the beginning end amount to no more than a total of five minutes of speaking, and can hardly be called a narration (which would have killed the movie anyway).",8,0,1,31 January 2000
Lawrence of Arabia," a memento from the days when they made real movies
","It is, in a way, depressing to watch this movie today. One winds up contrasting it with the sort of technologically slick and aesthetically shallow spectacles, like 'Titanic', that garner the sort of adulation that a truly great movie like 'Lawrence' received in its day, and one realizes how far we have fallen.Ignore David Lean's painterly technique, the way he fills the screen like a canvas. Ignore Freddie Young's stunning cinematography in fulfillment of Lean's vision. Ignore the fabulous score by Maurice Jarre. Ignore the stupendous cast. Ignore the topnotch script.What we have, beyond all this, is an absolutely gripping and psychologically perplexing character study of a uniquely enigmatic individual that keeps us on the edge of our seats for the full length of the movie. 'Lawrence', at over 200 minutes, goes by faster than many a movie of half its length, due to Lean's brilliant pacing and direction, and superb acting all around. To make a comparison in the world of music, this movie, like Mahler's 8th symphony, is a universe contained within itself.Of course, it is an exercise in self-denial and philistinism to watch this movie in anything other than the wide-screen - or 'letterbox' - format, due to Lean's complete use of every inch of the wide screen. To watch it otherwise is to miss half of Lean's intention.To use a hackneyed phrase, they simply don't make 'em like this anymore.",9,384,530,15 June 1999
JFK," paranoid fantasies served up as a documentary
","I have not seen this movie. How can I therefore render a judgment on it? I have not read any material on Holocaust denial, nor have I read deSade's 'Justine', nor the Nazi Racial Purity laws either, but that does not prevent historically informed and morally centered persons from making judgments on those. The febrile fantasies of Jim Garrison, a sadly deluded and pitiable figure, have been rejected by the overwhelming weight of respectable reportorial research; his delusions are accepted only by those unfortunates like Oliver Stone whose minds, having wandered too long in the jungles of left-wing paranoia, are now hopelessly lost in the fever swamps of conspiratorial hysteria.A schizophrenic cannot be faulted, I suppose, for viewing his world as fact; it is, after all, the only reality he knows. But Stone, as a skilled film maker, can most definitely be faulted for making a film which interweaves historical film footage and documented fact with fictional material. The result - as Stone certainly knows - will be accepted by 85% of the American booboisie, to use Mencken's phrase, as a documentary. Thus will a great proportion of those who view this film come to believe, despite a shred of supporting evidence, that Lyndon Johnson, the CIA, and the military were complicit in the Kennedy assassination. To thus propogate such a monstrous historical falsity is to commit a perfidy of Brobdingnagian proportions.Stone is to be reviled for making this film, a fitting companion piece to 'Natural Born Killers' for the Movie Hall of Shame.",1,2,16,21 October 1999
Behind The Candelabra," repellent
","This is truly a repulsive piece of film making. Contrary to all the highfalutin hoopla about making a movie about 'the truth,' this rancid flick is a poorly disguised piece of soft core pornography which luxuriates in emphasizing all the tawdriest and most sensational aspects - of which there are plenty - of this lurid tale. Everyone knows that Liberace was gay. This movie certainly tells us about his sex life, or at least the version of his sex life as told by his paramour Scott Thorson in his tell-all book. There are always two sides to any story about a relationship, and here we never get to hear Liberace's. The fact that by all accounts Liberace was a generous contributor to charitable causes, encouraged rising talent, and was a congenial and loyal companion to his many show business friends - all of this is absent from this shockfest, or maybe shlockfest. As far as the acting, I was curious to see how Michael Douglas, whose work I admire, would handle the role. He turns in nothing more than a simmering, mincing, lisping, one-dimensional caricature. Evidently movie makers will sink to any depths to make a buck, and this is Exhibit A. Avoid this disgusting piece of trash at all costs.",1,13,34,17 November 2013
The Man Who Would Be King," unquestioned masterpiece
","Four things combine to ensure this movie's greatness - the literary craftsmanship of Rudyard Kipling, the directorial stature of John Huston, and the incandescent chemistry of acting greats Sean Connery and Michael Caine. The broad, sweeping vistas of south central Asia, magically photographed, add to the allure. This is a morality tale of human greed and ambition run amock, but Kipling's light touch keeps it at the level of a black comedy, not a tragedy. Huston did not change the dramatic viewpoint, and he includes ample touches of comedy. Though the movie is a grand lark, a gripping adventure, and a rollicking good yarn, at the end we feel both emotionally drained and wiser than we were. Largely overlooked, this movie aspires to level of some of David Lean's masterpieces, and, if not quite entirely making it, comes damn near close enough. A must-see.",9,3,6,6 January 2000

Lincoln," a great film
","No question this film will endure as one of the great historical/biographical cinematic masterpieces, right up there with 'Lawrence of Arabia,' 'Becket,' and 'A Man for all Seasons' (the version with Paul Scofield). First off, Daniel Day Lewis' performance as Lincoln is stunning, fully demonstrating Lincoln's indomitable will, his political cunning, and both his humor and his melancholy. Sally Field as Mary Lincoln shows she is a great actress. Tommy Lee Jones shines as Thaddeus Stevens. The host of great supporting actors is too long to enumerate. Then there is the script, a slap in the face to the mindless pablum so common to movies nowadays. Tony Kushner has written an extremely intelligent, historically informed script about Lincoln's struggle to pass the 13th amendment, and all the legal and moral complexities involved in that struggle. It is truly aimed at thoughtful, intelligent adults. This is simply a must-see film.",9,4,6,27 May 2017
Rules of Engagement," a big thumbs up
","I can't recall seeing such a wide diversity of opinion for a flick in this space, and I can't help thinking that the disagreement probably splits between those who are sympathetic to the military and its traditions, and those who view the military as anathema. I side with the fans of this movie. I found myself thoroughly engrossed, from beginning to end, by a completely plausible story (with one or two weak spots) well acted and told without cheap plot devices. Tommy Lee Jones plays against type here; contrary to his standard screen persona of agressive alpha-male types, here he plays a man plagued by self-doubt and lack of confidence. It is an excellent portrayal. Samuel Jackson acquits himself with honors as well. Also notable are Guy Pearce (an Englishman!) as the prosecutor, Major Biggs, and Dale Dye who makes an awfully convincing Major General Perry (it seems that Dye has an extensive military background himself). As far as the weak spots, there are any number of crowd dispersal techniques - e.g., CS gas - which, in a real confrontation, would be used prior to resorting to live fire. And the little closing tag-lines telling us what happened to the protagonists are indeed a stupid touch in a fictional film, as a previous viewer commented. On the whole, though, this is one of the best rentals I've seen in a while.",7,0,1,3 January 2001

","Pretentiously annoying artsy-fartsy pseudo-philosophy with a seriously deranged main character. Okay, he's brilliant, too; so what? It's still irritating to watch this nutcake sweat and shake his way through this tortuous exercise in mental flagellation. The totally unbalanced, disjointed, and grainily photographed (my, how gritty!) story will no doubt draw oohs and ahs from the arthouse crowd, but the rest of us will feel like taking a long walk in the sunshine after seeing this dog. I'm far from being a philistine, but pu-leeez!!!",2,4,7,12 May 1999
Donnie Brasco," superb
","Definitely a movie that bears rewatching, Donnie Brasco, is - as the consensus of opinion here says - among the top rank of mob films, right up there with the Godfather epic, and certainly superior to the cheap, flashy and overrated 'Goodfellas'. I would say the character development and moral ambiguity in this movie is even more well-developed than in the Coppola movies. To repeat yet again what has been noted below many times, the venerable Al Pacino is at his best and Johnny Depp shows his chops as one of our best young actors, and the way they work together is one of the most superb instances of screen chemistry. Multi-faceted, gritty, realistic, touching, suspenseful - this movie is not to be missed.",8,1,2,24 June 2003
This Is Spinal Tap," sure to become a classic
","On the chance that there's a few out there that haven't yet seen 'This is Spinal Tap', do yourself a favor and rent this hilarious film.Directed by Rob Reiner, it is in the form of a documentary on the first North American tour of a fictitious rock band ('Spinal Tap') which is rapidly plummeting to the bottom of the charts. It has more riotously funny moments than even some of Mel Brooks stuff. My favorites - the amplifier ('but this one goes to 11'), the Stonehendge set, 'what's the name of that tune you're playing', the airbase concert, and on and on. The dialogue is brilliantly funny, capturing perfectly the egotistical pretentiousness and intellectual vapidity of many of those in the entertainment industry. Rob Reiner himself plays the documentary film maker, and watch for cameos by Ed Begley Jr., Billy Crystal, Patrick Macnee (remember John Steed?), and Paul Shaffer.Rumor has it that the documentary style of this film was so convincing that a good many shall we say cerebrally challenged viewers thought it was real, a fact which only adds to the hilarity. As a result of this film the 'band' members (all of whom actually play) started doing actual appearances as Spinal Tap, and the big question is how many attending their concerts are aware that it's all a put on.'Spinal Tap' is going to become a classic comedy, and if you haven't seen it yet and are looking for some laughs, rent it.",8,0,2,9 July 1999
Where Eagles Dare," eagle droppings
","OK, I confess - I used to like this movie. I first saw it in an army movie theater, and the projector bulb blew out just as the bus drove onto the runway. (The projectionist was out for coffee and was damn near hanged when he returned) At the time it provided an enjoyable three-hour respite from duty, but the movie sure doesn't stand up to repeated viewings. A commando team penetrates a mountaintop Gestapo HQ accessible only by tramway, kidnaps a prisoner, and escapes intact after practically blowing it up??? Puh-leeeez. Richard Burton, who I suspect was in his soused period here, sleepwalks through the movie. Clint Eastwood is horribly miscast. Derrin Nesbitt's SS officer is right out of a comic book. The showdown scene in the interrogation room has more twists and turns - all ridiculous - than a bowl of linguine. I admit I still have a soft spot in my heart for this adventure flick, but I can't see myself getting through it again. For fictional WWII yarns, Maclean's 'Guns of Navarone' is far superior.",5,7,19,22 February 2000
Some Like It Hot," What more can be said?
","Hard to add anything that hasn't been said before. This is definitely one of the classics - in the truest sense of an overworked term - of cinematic comedy. Everything works in perfect synergy here - casting, acting, writing, direction, music, and the choice of black & white is absolutely correct. And the script! This movie is definitely a 'drag', and anyone who has not seen it is living a deprived life.",8,2,3,23 March 2000
Titanic," redeemed only by the effects
","It is a sad commentary on contemporary taste that this movie has received so much critical and popular acclaim. It is redeemed only by its admittedly spectacular special effects. The acting of diCaprio & Winslet is sophomoric. The romantic storyline is improbable and saccharine. The Billy Zane role harks back to the ridiculous mustachioed villains of 19th century melodrama - laughably unbelievable. The score is a disgrace; a movie which aspires so high deserves a symphony orchestra and a John Williams, not the synthesized tin whistle effort it received. The portrayal of social class (everyone in First Class is an evil, repressed, sneering Capitalist Oppressor while everyone in Steerage is a vibrant, life-affirming peasant saint) is right out of a Marxist primer. diCaprio teaching Winslet to spit over the rail is both ridiculous and disgusting. And as for Cameron's ballyhooed fetish for historical accuracy, there is absolutely no evidence that any ship's officer committed suicide during the sinking (but it sure works great on screen, doesn't it?!). Further, he neglects to give a name to the infamous ship that lay 10 miles away and watched the Titanic sink while doing nothing (it was the Californian). And this is the 90's so we have to have our obligatory and gratuitous nude scene and sex scene, don't we (can't make a film without one nowadays)? Those with an interest in the Titanic (possible as a result of this movie) are directed to Walter Lord's incomparable book on the disaster 'A Night to Remember', and the 1958 J.Arthur Rank production of the same name. Although the effects are not as great (it's 1958 after all) they stand up well, and the script, acting and whole tone of the movie are superior to this bloated and overrated 'blockbuster'. And those who glibly call this 'the best movie of all time' are gently advised to go out and rent one or more from the following list - 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Spartacus', 'The Bridge on the River Kwai', 'Citizen Kane'. 'Treasure of the Sierra Madre', 'Patton', 'Sunset Boulevard', 'The Quiet Man'....",4,2,3,22 April 1999
Enemy at the Gates," disappointing
","I can do more than echo the sentiments of the many viewers who criticized the contrast between the excitement of the opening battle scenes and the way in which the movie bogs down in the middle, as it changes to a cat-and-mouse story. The opening battle scene does indeed give the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan' a run for its money, and the portrayal of the devastation visited upon Stalingrad is indeed ... well, devastating. However, the movie is simply too long to sustain the battle-of-wits story it becomes.",5,1,3,15 August 2001
The Bridge on the River Kwai," one of the best from one of the best
","That a director could make such a superb movie as this and then surpass it with 'Lawrence of Arabia' is astonishing, but such was David Lean's accomplishment. Just as in 'Lawrence' the superb cinematography and gripping action never detract from the fact that this is, at its core, a psychological drama. Alec Guinness is a true genius; anyone who can portray Colonel Nicholson like this, and then go on to the Gulley Jimson of the Horse's Mouth and the Jock Sinclair of Tunes of Glory has acting talents verging on the supernatural. The rest of the cast is just as exceptional, especially Jack 'jolly good show!' Hawkins, and the movie is visually stunning. A true 'desert island' film. Would that they made them like this nowadays.",9,0,1,18 June 1999
"Hail, Caesar!"," offbeat and intriguing
","This is certainly one very oddball movie but thoroughly intriguing. One can understand the many viewers who basically couldn't figure out what the whole point was. Basically, this is a paean to movie-making, which is not just a craft, but a business which sometimes necessitates a lot of shady doings to keep things on track. I did not know that the movie was based on the experiences of an actual person. It is interesting that the character of Mannix is a sympathetic one. Despite all his questionable dealings he clearly is motivated by his desire to see things get done, and it is interesting that he is portrayed as a man of sincere faith. The analogies to the religious themes of the subject of the current production, 'Hail Caesar' is obvious. It is also noteworthy that the cowboy actor, so bumbling on the set, turns out to be one of the most likable characters, and actually the 'hero.' The allusions to so many older movies are fun for cinematophiles to keep track of, and all the production numbers are clearly a celebration of movie-making. It is also so very refreshing to see the Communist penetration of Hollywood portrayed as not just a joke but an actual phenomenon, right down to the never-named but clearly recognizable Dalton Trumbo. One senses that this a very personal movie for the Coen brothers, and we sympathize with Mannix when he turns down the job offer and sticks with the frustrating job he clearly loves.",7,2,4,13 August 2016
The Wrestler," worth a see
","I hate wrestling. That kept me from watching the flick, despite the good reviews. I'm glad I did finally go for it. The movie makes no defense of professional wrestling, but does show us, behind the scenes, how wrestling really works, that it's all theatrics. The excellent behind-the- scenes look at the wrestling life is one of the best things about the movie. It has been said that the movie is formulaic, and that's true to an extent, but formula is not bad in and of itself, only if it's worked out poorly. In that respect I would say that 'The Ram's' relationship with his daughter is the weakest part of the film. On the other hand, the analogy between himself and Marisa Tomei's character, a stripper, is very powerful in that they are both people past their prime who are using their bodies for cash (and it's cruel to realize that Tomei is actually 45!). Mickey Rourke's wonderfully understated performance is, in the end, what makes the movie. We see here a good man trying to do his job, his work, the thing that is all he knows how to do. One criticism - the business of shooting the main character from behind throughout the film is an idea that is useful at first but eventually becomes an annoying mannerism. On the whole though, this is a movie that makes us care about the people it portrays.",7,1,1,29 July 2009
The Terminal," wonderful !
","A truly delightful movie that has the increasingly rare ability nowadays to leave you feeling good. Doubtless the screenplay plays fast and loose with the true story on which it is based, but who cares. They have come up with a charming sort of Everyman story about the human ability to survive in the face of soulless bureaucracy. Family devotion and loyalty play a huge role also. It is becoming increasingly clearer that Tom Hanks is ascending to the ranks of our foremost actors today. In his portrayal of the well-meaning, naive, yet resourceful and stubborn Victor Navorski we have what I'm sure will become one of the memorable characterizations of the decade. Truly a movie that deserves more than one viewing.",8,1,2,1 November 2004
Paths of Glory," phony
","I had read all the hoopla about this being one of the seminal anti-war films of all times and, upon finally seeing it, was astounded at how overrated and poorly done it is. The movie is less a drama than a Victorian melodrama. All the generals and officers are the mustachioed villain and all the soldiers are the sausage-curled maiden tied to the railroad tracks. The dialogue is farcically unrealistic; General Mireau's lines, in particular, are of the 'Aha, my pretty, at last I have you in my clutches!' variety. One almost thinks that the director is trying to make the audience hiss. Character development is non-existent, as is subtlety. The ballroom scene, in particular, with the grandly attired generals dancing to Strauss waltzes in luxurious surroundings with elegantly attired women is - get it? - supposed to be a contrast with the misery of the soldiers; the point is made like being hit on the side of the head with 2-by-4. Kirk Douglas does the best he can with a limited part. The denouement with the German girl (a prisoner? a prostitute? a lost civilian? just who the hell is she?) singing is both baffling and unconvincing. One keeps waiting for some kind of closure and - bam! - 'The End' comes up. This is not a quarrel with the theme of the movie, just its execution. For a truly brilliant treatment of the same theme - the scapegoating of soldiers by an uncaring and expedient power structure - see 'Breaker Morant,' a movie with complex, fleshed-out characters, realistic dialogue, and true emotional and dramatic depth. And, for good measure, a court martial that puts the one in 'Paths of Glory' to shame.",4,18,48,19 September 2002
Mr. Holland's Opus," a bit long-winded
","I can see why this movie was such a hit, but it's a bit difficult for me to sympathize with someone who treats his kid so badly. Also, there are a couple of big errors which any musician should pick up instantly1) emotion is never a substitute for technique. Saying to a student in a lesson 'play the sunset' just doesn't happen2) 'Stravinsky was the music of the Russian Revolution, so what do you think of that?' says Holland to his uptight vice principal. Actually, no. Stravinsky was an emigre from the revolution, whose music was officially disfavored by the Soviet regime. They must have meant Shostakovich. (What the hey; they both begin with 'S')3) Mr. Holland's long-awaited 'American Symphony' was a tad short to be called a symphony, and its musical qualities suggest it would work better as background music for an airline commercial than as a vehicle for the concert hall.Having said all that, the movie does have its moments. Its montage of news clips shows the passage of time quite effectively, and the growing friendship between Holland and the coach is nicely portrayed. Also Richard Dreyfus conducts quite convincingly; most actors who are called on to perform this arcane skill - Yul Brynner, Cary Grant, and John Cassavetes come to mind - do it wretchedly. Best line: 'We think our football team is lacking something, Mr. Holland.'  'Yeah. Touchdowns.'",7,1,4,18 June 1999
Ben-Hur," look up 'spectacle' in the dictionary and you'll find this one listed...
","What can one say about this iconic film epic? It has it all -  breadth, sweep, grandeur, a sense of space and time, and a gripping story of hatred, forgiveness, and redemption. Seeing it in anything other than letterbox format is to miss the whole sense of the film. You can't call yourself a movie buff without having seen  this one. They don't make 'em like this anymore, fer sure.",9,1,2,30 August 1999
Sweet and Lowdown," nice effort from Woody
","[possible spoiler] Woody's movies have certainly been uneven of late but I would rate this as one of his better recent efforts. His love of the jazz of the 20's and 30's is clearly evident in this film; it is as much at the center of 'Sweet and Lowdown' as Manhattan was in 'Manhattan'. The fictional Emmett Ray is one of those frustrating characters you want to like but whose egregious behavior keeps you at arm's distance. Like so many great creative personalities (Allen himself, e.g.) his great artistic gifts seem counterbalanced by character flaws that destroy his relationships with people. In the end we - I, at least - cannot help sympathizing with the driven Ray as he realizes he has destroyed his chances for happiness with the one woman who could accept and love him for what he is. The scene where, returning to Hattie, she tells him she is now married put me in mind of the scene at the end of 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' where Hally (Mia Farrow) tells Cliff (Allen) that she is engaged to the repulsive Lester (Alan Alda); the heartbreak on the part of the losing men is silently and powerfully communicated. The film is beautifully shot and - as has been remarked - the period flavor is superb. The faux-documentary style - reminiscent of 'Zelig' and 'broadway Danny Rose' - works here to unify the episodic story. Sean Penn is very effective in this atypical role. For my money not as good as 'Mighty Aphrodite' but far better than 'Bullets over Broadway' and 'Manhattan Murder Mystery'.",7,0,0,23 March 2001
The Replacements," really bad
","I rented this not for the football but for Gene Hackman. He does as good as he can with what he is given here, but the flick really stinks. Starting out with a decent premise - team is close to making it to the playoffs when the players go on strike - the movie soon becomes completely predictable. I kind of lost interest when the 'sumo' player threw up in the huddle (we couldn't see it coming when he was stuffing himself with boiled eggs before the game, could we?). Keanu Reeves should be able to make a decent name for himself as soon as he takes a couple of acting lessons. Best part by far was the erotic routines of the cheerleaders, but you can get better in any decent porno flick. Avoid this one. (Incidentally, I was surprise to find Jack Warden here; I thought he was dead. I'm still not sure.)",3,2,6,15 December 2000
Gladiator," sure to last
","I have to take issue with the previous viewer and, for once, align myself with the conventional wisdom on this film; i.e., that it's a keeper. Especially compared with the slick, technology-infatuated, sex-and-violence saturated dreck coming out of Hollywood (not that this movie does not have its share of violence and gore, but always in context and never, in my view, gratuitous) it is refreshing to have a historical film with sweep and grandeur about real characters with some depth. I found Gladiator thoroughly engrossing and beautifully made, although historically it shares some of the fictions of its predecessor The Fall of the Roman Empire ('64) - e.g. that Marcus Aurelius was a patricide (not true) - although to my thinking it is a far superior movie in every respect. Russell Crowe is simply super here - he deserves a Best Actor nomination, no question. My only quibble is that the movie deserved a grander score - John Williams was needed for this one. But all in all, a great show.",8,0,0,31 August 2000
Goodfellas," a repulsive movie
","Here's a contrarian opinion: GOODFELLAS is to be avoided unless you have a strong stomach and a proclivity towards sadism. A basically tawdry and sleazy story about a tawdry and sleazy bunch of mobsters is turned into a garish comic strip that is never quite funny enough to overcome the truly revolting violence, which is portrayed in as hideous a manner as possible. It might be argued that Scorsese is trying to make a moral point here, but it just doesn't wash. A truly repulsive film.",3,19,51,20 May 1999
The Birds," sorry, but this one is (you guessed it) for the birds
","I'll have to be the turd in the punchbowl here and insert a contrary opinion among the critical encomia. I finally managed to see this one from beginning to end in American Movie Classics's Hitchcock retrospective in early summer 2000. I had had my doubts about the flick from the bits and pieces I had seen earlier, and seeing it entire did nothing to change my opinion, despite the fact that Camille Paglia thinks this is one of cinema's great masterpieces. I found nothing remotely frightening here; the whole thesis of the movie is laughable, and the sudden stop ending is unsatisfying and anticlimactic. And wordy??? Talk, talk, talk, and more pointless talk. Tippi Hedren ? I think Hitch's erotic fascination with her overcame an objective assessment of her acting abilities (her post-Hitch career includes such gems as 'Teresa's Tattoo' and 'Return to Green Acres'). One curious fact about this film, and one which I have neither read nor seen any comment on, is the glaring omission of a musical score; there is nary a note of background music. I would love to know Hitch's rationale for this choice; in any case Bernie Herrmann might have been able to pump some suspense into this dog, er, bird.",4,7,15,19 June 2000
Beetlejuice," lasting charm and offbeat humor
","[possible spoilers] Having nearly forgotten this 13-year-old film, I recently took it down off the shelf  to watch it again, and  was reminded of its enduring charm.  An offbeat and original story line, an intelligent and witty script, some truly off-the-wall special effects and scene-setting, and an essentially warmhearted and gentle tone make this a movie that has possibilities of attaining the status of a minor classic.  Michael Keaton of course steals the show as Betelgeuse (pronounced Â‘beetle-juice') an indefinable creature of the nether regions, whose manically offensive crudeness comes close to moving beyond repulsive to endearing. It is a unique characterization, but then never before - or since - has such a character been committed to cellulose. Provides a very enjoyable evening's entertainment, and leaves a surprising feeling of well-being, as ghosts and humans live happily ever after.",7,1,2,30 November 2001
The Soloist," a poisonous message
","I really wondered what the point of this movie was, and about two-thirds of the way through the light dawned. This is a 'message' movie, and the message is a poisonous one.Sometime in the 60's we as a nation became revolted at conditions in our mental institutions, which were indeed horrific and grotesque. This is where society had warehoused everyone whose mental conditions were so extreme that even their own families could not cope with them. Government being what it is, it was never to be expected that these poor souls would get compassionate treatment.So it was decided to grant these individuals their 'rights' and release them all to the street. There was supposed to be a wave of neighborhood mental health clinics to look after them; that never transpired. As a result these poor souls now live in the street and often pose a safety risk to others. Jails and prisons are now the front line in dealing with the mentally ill.Unfortunately a whole movement has arisen advocating for the 'rights' of these people to live as they are, i.e. as mentally unbalanced people. The sad thing is that, with proper medication, many of these folks could be restored to some semblance of normality.In clearly siding with the 'right' of Nathaniel not to be medicated, this movie, in my view, sends a very toxic message whose upshot is that these people should be allowed to live their lives of misery and to continue to pose a threat to - dare I utter the word? - 'normal' people. The issue of how we deal with our mentally ill is a complex and thorny one, but I don't think it's useful to maintain that it's just dandy not to treat them.",1,7,12,26 December 2016
