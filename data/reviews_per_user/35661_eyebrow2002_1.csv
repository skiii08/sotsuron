Mission: Impossible III," A huge let down considering how good the first two were
","I have just been to see it and I'm fuming, spitting bile here it was that awful.I should have known it really, all the signs were there. The studio wouldn't give the previews out on time so a lot of the 5* reviews were done without seeing the film. All the interviews were people going on about the 'story' which usually means there isn't one. Plus they were hammering on about how many stars were in it{Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Lawrence Fishburne, Ving Rhames, Michelle Mohegan, Jonathan Rhys Meyers (big with the Irish), Simon Pegg (big with the English), Maggie Q (absolutely huge in china)} Usually there's loads of unknowns (think of the last two films) but they made a point of boasting about star power with this one and studio's only usually do that to distract you from a terrible film.Anyway problems with it: [*]special effects for effects sake, this sounds stupid but they just kept blowing stuff up too much. in the first rescue you didn't know what was getting blew up. trust me it's idiotic and bored me [*]the bird in it is a moose, she looks like cruise's bird Katie Holmes(and she's a moose with a bog eye). the bird in it looks too ordinary. she's not 'hollywood fit' so you're not bothered about her [*]daft ending, the last two films had amazing final sequences but they sacked it off in this one [*]lame story, this was the biggest problem. The story is essentially the same as the first film...no scratch that IT IS THE SAME AS THE FIRST FILM! but it's not even well done, the first film did it much better. the only difference is they've added some little side plots that have been blatantly grafted off TV series. The plot from 24 series 2 and 5 is thrown in there. They don't develop characters well, you're not fussed one way another if anyone dies (EVEN THE BAD GUY, WTF IS THAT?!?!) and you walk out thinking where's the rest? [*]They wrapped everything up all nice and neat in a bun at the end but it was oversimplified and just a carbon copy of the end of the first film. [*]The bad guy Phillip Seymour-Hoffman was almost a cameo, he made some threats then got killed. WTF?It was crap crap crap and if I saw Tom Cruise walking down the street I'd ram a placenta down his throat the horrible jargonautOnly good parts:[*]Ving Rhames was great, when it was just him & cruise on the screen the banter between them was great. But it's not a buddy cop film and banter cant save this [*]the Lambo [*]Simon Peg, but even that I reckon Peg could have been better usedSorry to rant but it really was that bad. Gutted cos I loved the first twoPS anyone who likes Lost can jog on to high heaven cos the guy who made that directed this so I hate him now",1,3,9,5 May 2006
