The Blair Witch Project," Interesting for a film student, a failure for most other people.
","If you're expecting this film to be the scariest movie you've ever seen, don't hand over the money because it ain't in the least bit scary. What's more interesting about the film is the intensely naturalistic acting and dialogue and the blatant attempts to manipulate the audiences' fear through them. We are presented with a supposedly true story (not once is the third person used in the narrative) and this is what's supposed to be so scary about the movie. The sense that these were real people is heightened by the fact that the only 16mm photography we see is on their 'documentary'. This is what the makers of this film wanted us to think. Unfortunately, it just doesn't come off.As a scary movie and just that, it doesn't really work. If you want to see a movie using every cliche and convention of psychological horror in the book, accept no substitutes.",Null,0,0,24 September 1999
Elizabeth," Beats the crap out of ordinary horror films.
","In the same way the opening 26 minutes of Saving Private Ryan beats the shit out of conventional horror movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer for scaring the crap out of you, so the opening of Elizabeth is utterly terrifying, setting the tone for a dark, broody epic bursting with energy.Blanchett's sardonic Elizabeth sparkles, her relationship with Fiennes a fascinating study of forbidden love and Geoffrey Rush's turn as a sinister henchman is simply fantastic, if only because it provides so much contrast from his other high-profile roles. And, the French guy from L'Appartement turns up as a hilarious comedy trans-sexual prince.Top Draw.",Null,0,0,7 June 1999
Notting Hill," Superlatives do not do it justice
","An absolute peach of a film. With the characteristic Curtis  dialogue in tact from Four Weddings, and the heart strings tugged with even greater skill, Notting Hill is a film from which you walk away feeling warm inside. Enormously funny, beautifully photographed and with a fantastic soundtrack (the Elvis Costello track, 'She' is the stand-out), in many ways it is a film that superlatives do not do justice.Grant is superb, in top hesitant Englishman form. Julia Roberts emanates both confidence and vulnerability and Emma Chambers also does her customary mad woman. This may well be a film of performances made before, but when they're this good they simply make the film shine.Finally, the direction oozes confidence. Michell makes one of the most peaceful shots ever commited to celluloid, when he pans upwards from a communal garden on a hot summer night.Simply marvellous. See it.",Null,0,0,4 June 1999
Velvet Goldmine," From what promised so much, emerges a great steaming turd
","An absolute shambles of a film. As a depiction of an era it fails. As a study of egotism it fails. As a coherent film it fails. In fact for me it just about fails on every level. With an utter lack of any sort of coherent narrative, terrible performances (see particularly Jonathon Rhys Meyers who appears to think that pouting is a substitute for acting) and unremarkable direction make for an utterly dull movie. Ultimately it is trying to depict an era in a gay context (that many would argue never existed), an era that fizzled with creative energy and of great diversity in music. The cast and crew of the Velvet Goldmine try to communicate energy by letting Ewan McGregor get his penis out yet again. Utter unmitigated pants.",Null,1,5,5 June 1999
Goodfellas," Scorsese shows he's more than a wise guy.
","A film of epic proportions, titanic performances, one of the best single shots in movie history and the greatest final 45 minutes on celluloid.",Null,0,0,3 June 1999
