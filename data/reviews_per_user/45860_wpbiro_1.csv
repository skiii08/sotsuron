The Finest Hours," Fascinating and Intense
","I found enough that was fascinating in it, both in the characters and the action - each scene gave my imagination time enough to roam and wonder. There were certainly gripping moments, both with the action and the emotional, and even the sweet romantic clich√©s worked as intended. Characters: They were period-fascinating, offering enough variety to engage one's wonder, and they were quite believable in character - I was taken back to those times in several ways. Action: Bring a winter coat - just watching the cold and frozen scenes will chill you to the bone. Story Line: They took a few liberties in order to place more focus on the main characters - I did not notice, but those who had read up on the story did, and it will be those people who will drag you to go see it. I don't regret going - it is the kind of movie that will define a region, time, and people for you (that you probably will never visit) for the rest of your life.",9,4,14,29 January 2016
