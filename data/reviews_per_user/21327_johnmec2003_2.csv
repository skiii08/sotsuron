50 First Dates," Love overcomes handicaps
","I enjoyed very much this film. It is a comedy and many could argue that not a good one.. The movie will not get you rolling on the floor with laughter, but most likely smiling every now and then.The story is about a lady's man that accidentally falls in love with a girl who suffers a very incredible handicap. She loses her memory every day when she goes to sleep. Now there is a lot of distasteful ways in which this movie could have exploited this premise.. However after seeing it, I get the impression I saw a good movie about the power of love.If you are in for a romantic comedy without any high pretensions and full of good values, take this one, you will not regret it.",9,0,0,22 September 2006
28 Weeks Later," Excellent gripping zombie movie
","The movie is a worthwhile sequel to the original 28 Days Later. Never mind the logic of why the military or anybody would want to come back to infected London or UK. There can be logical explanations, but the fact that the director does not take the time to show that, does not make this less of a masterpiece. A good explanation might be the sense of lost of many of those who left families behind. They would be eager to return as soon as they were allowed (having lost all of their loved ones plus all earthy possessions). The movie explicitly mentions that the military has proof that all the infected died of starvation, 5 weeks after the outbreak.Zombies in this movie are ruthless and sick human meat scavengers. The movie portraits like no other zombie movie the fear of the victims and their desperation. The action in this movie is more believable than in its predecessor, since there is not a single all-mighty hero that comes to save them all. Both, military and 'good guys' decisions are not infallible and because of that the film short range shots gain immensely in credibility. When things can go wrong they go wrong, Murphy's Law style. This is not a violent and gory movie, like many other zombie movies. I would say is nothing suitable for your children. Unlike other zombie movies the violence is not laughable, but gruesome and unpleasant like a news report from Iraq.. Also non-violent scenes are loaded with a tension that will make you remember this movie for a while after you are done with it.",10,13,28,10 September 2007
