"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," A nice, easy comedy
","Run Fat Boy Run is predictable. In the last half hour or so, there is an immense amount of clichés. There is also a lot of laughs in this movie, the first to be directed by David Schwimmer.Dennis Doyle ( Simon Pegg ) is a down and out security guard. He left his wife Libby ( Thandie Newton ) at the altar 5 years previously pregnant. Suffice to say that he is not the most reliable nor up and coming man on the face of the Earth. However he is galvanised into action when Libby gets a new boyfriend Whit ( Hank Azaria ) who seems like the perfect catch: rich, sincere and who runs marathons for charity. Dennis declares his intention to run in the marathon as well, in order to prove to Libby he can commit. He is helped in this enterprise by his friend Gordon ( Dylan Moran ), who also has an ulterior motive as he has bet all his cash on Dennis completing the race.Run Fat Boy Run has got a cast that all works well together. Simon Pegg reprises the sort of slacker role he played in Shaun of the Dead, while Thandie Newton is lovely as the torn Libby. Hank Azaria plays the affable but somewhat irritating Whit very well and Dylan Moran excels as the seedy Gordon. Add to that a hilarious cameo by David Walliams who looks like he just walked off a Little Britain set as well as Harish Patel as the landlord/assistant coach and there isn't a moment of this film that the cast seems to be slacking.Run Fat Boy Run is a great film to watch, despite of its formulaic structure. David Schwimmer may have found a new career.",8,2,5,21 March 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Will tie you over until your next superhero movie
","The Incredible Hulk is the second film to come out of the newly formed Marvel Studios and as such it would always be compared to the phenomenally successful Iron Man. It would be a brave studio then that deviates too much from what seemed like such a winning formula in Iron Man and Hulk doesn't. Like Iron Man, there is questions placed over the morality of armed forces, though more directly in the shape of General Ross ( William Hurt ) and like Iron Man there is a love interest in Liv Tyler playing the part of Elizabeth Ross. Like Iron Man also there is a villain which comes as a sort of deformed reflection of the hero which comes in the form of Emil Blonsky ( Tim Roth ), a Special Ops operative who gets obsessed with the idea of becoming bigger and better. Furthermore, like Iron Man it has a very commendable lead, with Edward Norton playing the tortured Dr Bruce Banner.So surely it should be a great movie like the aforementioned metal dude. Well unfortunately, the one thing that the Hulk lacks that Iron Man oozes with is charm. This is a superhero movie that isn't really dark enough to taken totally seriously and so it badly needs the odd one liner or two. Unfortunately though, while in Iron Man they are fast and furious, in Hulk they are very, VERY sparse. Then there is the fact that Bruce Banner simply is not as likable as Tony Stark is, and the flaws which make Stark so endearing are nowhere to be seen- nor is anything else for that matter.But the Incredible Hulk has still got some nice fight sequences ( though being the Hulk they do seem to entail finding different ways to smash things...) as well as some nice acting. This will at least keep you sated until THe Dark KNight if nothing else.",7,2,5,29 June 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Frustrating and Annoying
","The first three or four minutes of this movie promises something that should have set it far above the other two Mission Impossible films- a real sense of danger and loss. But as the movie goes on these promises become lost in a movie full of unnecessary twists and pointless plot lines in order to get to a happy ending. A shame really.The plot revolves around Mr Ethan Hunt again, who is now settling down into the role of family man with his fiancée. Unfortunately this is all interrupted when one of his pupils is captured behind enemy lines by one Owen Davian- an arms dealer who is after something called the rabbit's foot. Unfortunately Ethan soon finds himself in the position of exchanging said rabbit's foot for his fiancée's life in a race against the clock.The film is shot in all sorts of exotic locations and uses all sorts of whiz-bang gadgets, but really, there comes a point where whiz bang gadgets have to take a back seat. Admittedly there is an excellent sequence in the Vatican with the construction of one of the famous masks but otherwise the gadgets seem now to be standard fare.Tom Cruise sleepwalks through the film on two cylinders, almost as if he's waiting for the paycheck. Much more convincing is Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Owen Davian who acts Cruise off the screen in their scenes together and Simon Pegg who provides comic relief as the IT specialist back at HQ.The fact of the matter is, that if the writers to the risk of actually perhaps going the extra mile and leaving the first sequence as it was ( I don't want to give too much away ) instead of tampering with it afterwards with what seemed like little more than a disclaimer, there could have been a good, maybe even a great movie here. Instead the last third of the movie, though throughly improved by the performances of Hoffman and Pegg, was basically wasted.",6,4,8,10 May 2006
I'm Not There," The Postmodern Biopic
","I'm not there is a complex movie about a complex character in Robert Allan Zimmerman- better known to the world as Bob Dylan. What it attempts to do is focus on this complexity by picking it apart, slicing the periods and aspects of Dylan's life apart into separate people.We have Ben Whishaw as Arthur who throughout the film, acts as a sort of compass to Dylan's mind and ethics by telling truisms; some contradictory. Christian Bale is Jack Rollins, representing not only the early 60s Dylan, who was held up as a reluctant folk martyr, and who is born again as Pastor John, representing Dylan's own spiritual dabbling in Christianity.Marcus Carl Brodie plays Woodie Guthrie ( not the real one ), a young boy who evokes the mysticism of Dylan's youthful years. Cate Blanchett is Jude Quinn, representing Dylan's turn from folk martyr to rock storyteller, much to the chagrin of both the press and the folk community. Heath Ledger also turns up as Robbie Clark, whose movie career is balanced out by the break-up of his marriage, reflecting Dylan's own personal life as his ego got bigger and bigger. And finally Richard Gere represents Dylan the old exile through the character of Billy the Kid, who once again rises up to face those who would do people wrong.The cast in this movie are very good, with Christian Bale excellent ( though underused ) and Cate Blanchett simply amazing as the defiant Quinn, seeming to ooze Dylan's personality with every pore of her body. However the fact of the matter is they have split up Dylan into 6 different people and while this seems like an interesting idea for a movie, none of these characters really is three dimensional enough to be seen as little more as examples to prove a point. The point may be an interesting one and very well made, but you still feel a little dudded.Having said that though, I'm not there has some wonderful music and some great acting. Although the 6 personalities does get a little tiresome, it is an interesting way to look at a man who is hard to sum up as any.",8,2,4,2 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," At least as good as Number 1
","It was always going to be a bloody good movie to knock V for Vendetta off its perch as 'Best Movie of 2006' and Pirates 2 just about does it, with another rollicking adventure full of fun, thrills and laughs.The plot this time around once again centres over Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp ), who finds himself owing a blood debt to Davy Jones ( Bill Nighy ), the captain of the Flying Dutchman and guardian of the Kraken. Once again tied up in this adventures are Will and Elizabeth ( Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley respectively ) who find themselves in the shadow of the gallows unless they can acquire Sparrow's compass, to which the new Governor has his own reasons for wanting. All this adds up to 150 minutes of great cinema with a final shot to leave you breathless.Once again Johnny Depp excels as Sparrow, showing the swagger and the panache that stole the show in the first movie. Knightley and Bloom play straight woman and man to this well, but Bill Nighy truly steals the show as the menacing villain of the deep in Davy Jones, giving him a truly evil feel, and the scenes with him and Depp are truly ones to behold.Pirates 2 is an amazing movie that you will enter in as a adult and leave as a kid. I can't wait for 3.",10,3,7,7 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," OK, but that's all.
","Narnia is a OK movie and it will entertain children from ages of about 10-15.However what must be remembered is CS Lewis was a good friend of Tolkien, the man whose books were recreated masterfully by Peter Jackson. One gets the nagging feeling that Lewis wanted a different interpretation than the syrupy tripe that Disney manages to offer.Firstly, the two eldest children are not even endearing for 2/3 of the movie and it makes the idea of empathy and being brought along this world with them all the more difficult. The character development is thin, with the idea of Peter suddenly becoming the hero that he is, isn't really explored.Secondly there is the idea of casting. Tilda Swinton doesn't seem all there as the White Witch and doesn't seem as menacing or masterful as Voldermort, nor as drunk with power as Saruman, and it is somewhat difficult to see how she got the power in the first place. However, the animals are good and Jim Broadbent though underused, is good as the Professor.Finally there is the Americanised tripe that Disney seemed to plow in just to please. This comes in the form of Santa Claus, who turns up to give the children presents ( in the form of weapons ). There are more scenes like this one and it truly takes away from what could have been a great film, but instead seems to trip over itself.This is no Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, and nor should it have been seen as such, but while these two movie franchises had intricate plots, great casts and memorable dialogue as well as Spectacular, but not OTT effects Narnia drowns the audience in syrup and it only half comes off as it at the expense of characters and plot. A shame , as this could have so much more...",6,2,4,2 January 2006
Pirate Radio," Good, honest fun.
","Richard Curtis' first 'non romantic comedy film' is really another romantic comedy film- it's just that the romantic bit gets swamped within 20 other sub-plots so you try and not notice.The Boat That Rocked sees Carl ( Tom Surridge ) go aboard Radio Rock- a pirate radio station owned by Quentin ( Bill Nighy ) whose DJ's (Phillip Semour Hoffman, Rhys Ifans, Nick Frost, Chris O' Dowd, Rhys Darby, etc. ) broadcast 24-hour rock and roll music to the UK. They are adored by the populace but hated by the government, including the Minister of Communications ( Kenneth Branagh ) and his chief subordinate ( Jack Davenport ) who aim to shut them down.If that was the extent of the plot then it would probably be a 100 mins film. However the Boat That Rocked has so many little sub-plots- many seeming like excuses to put in another montage or cameo cast appearance that the time has ballooned out to 154mins and it does tell at times. Furthermore, while Richard Curtis is entitled to look back on these days with an air of nostalgia, he sometimes seems to get a little too weepy eyed with the story.But these faults are more than made up for in the performances; all of which are good- and some are outstanding. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Count is a lovable character who approaches everything with great gusto, while Chris O' Dowd's Simple Simon has a wonderful part in the middle section of the movie which brings a little bit of emotion to what is a pretty emotionally vacant movie. Nick Frost is cheeky as Dr Dave and finally Rhys Darby- fresh from Flight of the Conchords- simply shines in his role as the unpopular and daggy Angus who nonetheless gets arguably the best line in the whole movie.Overall the Boat That Rocked is silly and entertaining fun. It does get overweight by a looong script, but the soundtrack and the cast are good enough to carry it through.",8,64,102,14 April 2009
Hot Fuzz," The best movie of the year so far
","Hot Fuzz is fun. Amazing fun. While Shaun of the Dead is a tribute movie to zombie films, Hot Fuzz is a tribute to the action genre while poking fun at Agatha Christie/Midsomer Murders.The plot revolves around Nicolas Angel ( Simon Pegg ), a top policeman whose record in the Met is becoming an embarrassment to the other policeman; so much so the the Chief Inspector ( Bill Nighy ) transfers him to the countryside village of Samford; where he meets; amongst others his new Inspector ( Jim Broadbent ), Sergeant Turner ( Bill Bailey ) and his new partner ( Nick Frost ). He also meets Simon Skinner ( Timothy Dalton ), a very devilish supermarket conveyor. This sleepy village however, is soon seen to be something more as a mysterious amount of 'accidents' lead Angel to believe that something is afoot at Samford.The acting in this movie is great with numerous comedians and seasoned British actors getting their two cents worth and looking like they're thoroughly enjoying themselves. The script is razor sharp and adds plenty of laughs and the last 45 minutes is fantastic.Movies should, above all else, get you involved, and Hot Fuzz does that in spades. English comedy is ready to kick a** and take names.",10,1,2,17 April 2007
Ed Wood," A lovable failure
","Ed Wood charts the story of Edward D. Wood Jr., voted the worst director in Hollywood. But to say that this story is about his failures and his lack of artistic ability behind the lens would be a total generalisation, one that would not do this film justice. Instead, Tim Burton has filmed a story paying homage to a man, that, despite his many flaws, you truly have a sort of respect for at the end of the film.Burton's film is aided by the listing of a stellar cast, not least of which is Johnny Depp in the title role, who plays Wood as a sort of innocent egomaniac, who while he seems friendly and charming as a man, has absolute conviction in his talents, and never questions them for a second. With Depp is Sarah Jessica Parker and Particia Arqutte as the women of Wood's life and Bill Murray as his confidante Bunny.But truly the star of the show, along with Depp is Martin Landau as the once great horror star Bela Lugosi. Once the toast of the cinema, now nothing more than a drug addled ruin with his career now in tatters.But this isn't a story about falling from grace, nor is it a story about failure. As much as anything Burton uses this film to pay homage to a man who didn't listen to the executive big wigs, nor was tied down by petty changes that had to be made. In fact Burton, deliberately compares him to Orson Welles, showing that although that Wood may not have had the talent, he certainly had the drive and if anything he should be respected for that.This is a movie that shows that the weird is often lovable, despite, if it fails. How else can you explain a transvestite director coming across as charming?",9,0,0,19 January 2006
Terminator Salvation," Hmmm...
","Sequels are a business fraught with difficulty. If you don't have a clear idea where the franchise is going from the start, they often get lost in a myriad of new characters and plot holes. Such is what happened to the Matrix sequels and such is what has happened here in Terminator: Salvation.It is the Year 2018, and Skynet's Teminator program is wiping out the human population that is left post-Judgement Day. In this war scenario we find John Connor ( Christian Bale )- not the messianic leader yet of the Resistance but a leader of his own pocket of hardened veterans. However his faith in his mission is shaken by the arrival of a new figure- Marcus Wright ( Sam Worthington ) whose own agenda and past will force Connor to form an uneasy alliance with him in order to save Connor's father- Kyle Reece ( Anton Yelchin ).Terminator Salvation is not a sci fi/action film- but rather a futuristic war movie that doesn't really add up. By making this movie only M rated ( PG-13 if you are in the states ) the war against the machines is reduced to something quite...tame. Terminators no longer are the ruthless killing machines that they once were and instead are quite content tossing people around a lot. The whole idea of a brutal world seems silly as it lacks the brutal bit. Why don't the terminators simply kill the marines instead of tossing them against walls? Why doesn't Skynet simply slaughter the humans as soon as they arrive? To their credit Worthington and Yelchin are quite good in their roles, giving Marcus and Kyle some good scenes together and managing to find something in what is a pretty dull story. Christian Bale on the other hand is waaaay too intense. Every line is delivered with a frown and a grimace and he doesn't seem to get emotional at all- except to yell.Terminator: Salvation would always get compared to 1,2 & 3- but they've tipped the balance in the machines favour. In doing so the movie doesn't become more interesting, but less.",6,1,2,4 June 2009
Juno," Great...and yet...
","Juno is a very good indy film that shows the trials and tribulations of a 16 year old girl ( Ellen Page ) going through pregnancy and the trials that follow. Involved in this are her close friend/father of the child Paul ( Michael Cera ), her father ( JK Simmons ) and the two perspective adoptive parents ( Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner ).Sounds like a good yarn- and it is. All of the characters are handled with care and there is an abundance of good lines. Both Page and Cera are very good in their respective roles, while out of the adults Simmons stands out as Juno's father. Having said that, it does have a couple of problems. One of which has to do with Jennifer Garner as the prospective mother who at times seems to be totally obsessed with motherhood.The only real problem is that this film at times doesn't allow itself to be different naturally but seems to want ram it down the viewer's throat. The first 10 minutes of dialogue is bizarre for any 16 year old to say ( I'm a 23 year old Teacher and I have never heard anything like that ) and seems only to make people to accept it as quirky when it's going to be different if it's good enough. Juno is a wondefully funny film that is let down slightly because it falls over itself to try and be different.",8,1,4,2 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A great conclusion
","POTC 3: At World's End focuses on the conundrum of Jack Sparrow ( Johnny Depp ) who now finds himself in Davy Jones' Locker. On the way to save him are Will Turner ( Orlando Bloom ), Elizabeth Swann ( Keira Knightley ) and Captain Barbossa ( Geoffery Rush ); all of whom are racing against time to ally with Sparrow, as well as the other pirates lords such as Sao Feng ( Chao Yun-Fat ) in order to combat the growing menace of Cutler Beckett ( Tom Hollander ) and Davy Jones ( Bill Nighy ).Like the first two this one has its share of laughs and spills, but there is also some great dialogue between some of the leads. Depp is great as Sparrow and looks like he could do another 3 movies, while Knightley and Bloom have their moments in the sun. But it is Bill Nighy and Geoffery Rush that really drive this movie forward; with Nighy playing Jones as a great man who lost his way; adding depth to his character and Rush having a fantastic time as the villain turned anti-hero Barbossa. The chemistry that these two manage to generate with Depp and with Chao Yun-Fat ( in the case of Rush ) is great. And of course, finally, the supporting cast of pirates who have been through the movies, led by Kevin McNally as Gibbs are once again wonderful.POTC3 closed out the series very well. Many people will be annoyed by the constant twists and turns, but hey, they're pirates! It's half the fun!",10,1,2,25 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Hmmm....
","I went to see this after seeing the good Spider-Man and its great sequel. Unfortunately this one, while still being OK, didn't quite measure up to the lofty heights of the first two, for a number of reasons.The plot revolves around Peter Parker ( Tobey Maguire ) at a high point in his life- his relationship with Mary Jane ( Kirsten Dunst ) has never been better, he's getting top graders in his classes, and Spider-Man is now regarded as the hero that he truly is. However this is soon shattered as Harry Osborn ( James Franco ) begins to plot his revenge on Parker. Furthermore, Uncle Ben's killer, Flint Marko ( Thomas Haden Church ) has been transformed into something else- the Sandman. Add to that the new black costume, which is much more than it seems.The fact is, that despite it being a two and a half hour movie, nothing gets truly covered well enough and there is the same fight sequence at the end of the movie. The best scene in the whole movie, in fact, involves Bruce Campbell as a hilarious waiter that seems to be channeling Inspector Clouseau. Many of the movies better moments, besides the action sense, involved humour in some way.And then there's Venom, who they don't really know how to design as his head isn't quite big enough to look right. Instead it almost looks like his mouth has been drawn on separately with a life of its own.Spider-Man 3 crams too much into one movie and as such has to use dumb plot devices to keep the story moving ( there is one near the end that will have people screaming 'why?!' ). It moves too fast for the plot to work, but it's the plot's too cumbersome and unwieldy anyway.",6,1,3,5 May 2007
Zodiac," A truly informative and enjoyable film. The best of the year so far.
","David Fincher, better known for the blood fests Se7en as well as Fight Club ( both great movies ) has shown considerable restraint in his newest film Zodiac. Not that this takes away from the drama when the killings do happen; in a way they are more confronting than in the above two movies because of the knowledge that this actually happened. So while Se7en may be about 7 different ways to kill a person, this is about four men attempting to crack an impossible case- a case without precedent.The movie starts with the shooting of the teenagers on Lake Valleho, which then leads to the San Fransico Chronicle. Crime writer Paul Avery ( Robert Downey Jr. ) and cartoonist Robert Graysmith ( Jake Gyllanhall ) become embroiled in the case as they attempt to delve deeper into the crimes. Meanwhile, at the SFPD, Inspectors Toschi and Armstrong ( Mark Ruffolo and Anthony Edwards respectively ) are attempting to wade through a ton of red tape in order to collaborate the pattern of Zodiac's killings, which have occurred in all sorts of jurisdictions. It seems to be a case without answers, as every time a lead comes, there is an expert to tell them to move on. One of the best scenes of the movie is Toschi walking out of a Dirty Harry film as the movie shows a similar letter from the 'Scorpio' killer.Zodiac is a movie that never seems to drag, despite the fact that there is little blood and gore for a Fincher film. What there is, however, is a wonderful true story about how catching a killer is never easy as it seems; no matter what you try to throw at him.",10,1,3,18 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The best musical adaptation going around
","Musical theatre films has been in vogue in the last few years but the thing about most of them is that they are really just a stage show with film cameras and haven't really allowed the capabilities of film to flex it's muscles. Not so with Sweeney Todd; a wonderful marriage between Stephen Sondheim's dark neo-baroque musical score and Tim Burton's visual nous.The thing that grabs you straight away as soon as the film starts is the atmosphere. It doesn't so much introduce itself as grab you by the shirt and immerse you in a dark, grimy Victorian London. Not to give too much away, Sweeney Todd ( Johnny Depp ) has returned after being sent to a penal colony for a crime he was set-up for by Judge Turpin ( Alan Rickman ), in order to obtain Todd's wife. Todd burns for revenge and with the help of Mrs Lovett ( Helena Bonham Carter ), he begins to plot his way towards the evil judge and his henchman, the Beadle ( Timothy Spall ).All very well, but we are talking about a cast that has never sang in film before- a big ask then to take on one of the most harmoniously complex scores in musical theatre. But actually, they do very well. Depp sounds somewhat like an early David Bowie and his performance as Todd is great to watch as he goes from rage to catatonia and everywhere in between. Bonham Carter makes the role of Mrs Lovett hers and doesn't overplay the humour, just allowing the audience to pick up on it without labouring.As for the two villains, Rickman and Spall seem to be having the time of their lives as the repulsive Turpin and Bamford respectively. Rickman's voice is naturally lended to singing bass ( his duet with Depp in 'Pretty Women' is a highlight ) and he does a wonderful job conveying the judge's lechery while Spall is so oily it's almost visible on the screen.The real surprise is Sacha Baron Cohen as Pirelli, who steals the scene in the shaving contest with some great singing and acting.Sweeney Todd does not have the musical talent of the show, but it does have better acting talent and atmosphere. And in a musical like this, that's no bad thing.",10,0,1,2 February 2008
Léon: The Professional," Cool without being shallow
","The Professional is one of those movies that you hang out for. It is truly that good. It revolves around Leon ( Jean Reno ), a 'cleaner' who, when filling out contracts on others, is watching Gene Kelly films or watering plants. His private life is one of total innocence, as opposed to his grisly occupation. This life is rudely disturbed however when his next door neighbour, Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) comes under his guardianship after her family is slaughtered by one Norman Stansfield ( Gary Oldman ), a pill-popping, erratic, Beethoven connoisseur of a cop. He is the exact opposite of Leon; whereas Leon's a innocent in an evil profession, Stansfield has blood all over his hands in a legitimate one. Swearing revenge on Stansfield for the death of her little brother, Mathilda persuades Leon to help her obtain her goal, leading to a curious relationship between the two that sees them both embroiled on Stansfield's turf and sets up for an explosive finale.The Professional is a great movie because of the way it makes the audience think. It has all the action of a good Hollywood film, with all the quirks of a European film. It may not be ripping off a Fish Called Wanda, but it feels in a same vein of Hollywood shootouts and quirky characters. Reno is great as Leon, showing innocence at home and a sort of cold menace at work. Portman shows the acting talent that is still around today and their relationship, while hailed as controversial by many, could also be equated as two lonely people looking for comfort in someone. But it is Gary Oldman who truly makes this movie fantastic, playing a totally amoral character who seems to have no qualms in shooting at old ladies, while commenting on the finer points of classical music two minutes before. Even Johnny Depp would struggle finding this sort of menace out of a character while making him weirdly hilarious; it is truly his role and shows his versatility.The Professional is a near-flawless movie that never takes an easy road, nor paints things in black and white, and is all the better for it.",10,2,5,20 June 2006
Watchmen," Zack Snyder's Watchmen, not Alan Moore's or Dave Gibbon's
","As a guy who has read the comic book and thinks it's the most influential book ever written in the genre ( though I actually don't think it's Alan Moore's best work- I think that title goes to V for Vendetta ), I was both excited and worried. Excited that these larger than life characters would get their shot on the big screen, but worried in that I wondered how such a densely layered text could make the transition from comic to movie without losing its soul.Fortunately though Zack Snyder has done an excellent job keeping the spirit of the book intact- but what must be remembered is that it is his vision of the Watchmen world. If you are looking for Alan Moore's dialogue cramming every scene you'll be disappointed ( though the movie amply borrows lines straight from the text ) and the same goes for the artwork.Acting wise this movie is very good, with solid performances by all the actors- but 2 standouts are from Jackie Earle Haley as the sociopathic adventurer Roarsharch and Jeffery Dean Morgan as the nihilistic, cynical Comedian. Both actors have tough, complex roles but convince you completely ( Earle's voice as Roarsharch is particularly...compelling ). Unfortunately, Matthew Goode as Ozymadias just doesn't manage to pull off the right amount of pathos for his role, which as the movie continues, lets it down slightly.The other little wrangles I have is with the soundtrack which is at times great and at times...mystifying. I like All Along the Watchtower as much as the next guy, but when it begins to obscure the dialogue, it's a bit much. On the other hand, the montage at the beginning with the Times They are a Changin' was wonderfully done; a beautiful piece of cinematography. Again though, the song in the credits sort of ruined the last moment slightly for me. Also the sex scene in the middle went on for too long. I don't know if Zack Snyder was trying to be arty or just trying to express how much they had been aroused but it became boring to watch.This is not my favourite superhero movie of all time- the Dark Knight still holds that title- but what it does achieve is a remarkable attempt to make a truly fantastic novel more accessible to people. There are flaws, mostly due to the changes that have been made in order to make it more accommodating to the film medium, but out of all the Alan Moore adaptations, this is by far the best.",10,3,10,5 March 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," Truly, truly wonderful
","Little Miss Sunshine is in a word, fantastic. If you want in more words, it is the story of a family's journey together; helping each other through their ups and downs and showing that although you may not have everything you want- that does not mean your required to be unhappy. It centres around the family of Richard Hoover ( Greg Kinnear ); a man whose '9 steps to becoming a winner' program is not only a job for him but a way of life. He is truly someone who brings his work home with him; much to the chagrin of his wife, Sheryl ( Toni Collette ) and his children Olive ( Abigail Breslin ) and Dwayne ( Paul Dano ) who has taken a vow of silence before he reaches his goal of becoming a pilot in the air force. Their world is turned upside down when Sheryl's brother Frank ( Steve Carell ) attempts to commit suicide, thus bringing him into the family as a precaution. Also there is Richard's dad ( Alan Arkin ) who was kicked out of a retirement home for snorting heroin.When the family's at the dinner table, the news comes that Olivia is invited to the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant in California- which involves a road trip across the country.However this movie really proves the saying that the journey is as important as the destination, and it is proved by a great cast. But particular credit must go to Steve Carell as Frank and Paul Dano as Dwayne- their scenes together seem to just move so naturally.Little Miss Sunshine is a movie that will help you out of whatever doldrums your in. It's not clichéd or corny nor pious or preachy but it is still heartfelt in a time where these sort of movies are becoming lost to much more Disneyfied shallow emotions.",10,8,15,10 December 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Best of a Great Series
","Harry Potter 3 is the best of the series as it, like the book before it, takes on a much more darker tone as Harry finds himself the target of one of Voldemort's loyal supporters, the evil Sirius Black.This more than any in the series before it had the potential to go seriously wrong as this is the first of the Potter stories to really have more threads than the obvious ones of Harry's immediate quest. However Alfonso Cuaron has done a great job of making sure that these endings are ( mostly ) tied up while at the same time making sure that the main story is not slowed down or lagging.The performances of all of the children actors are good, but it is the supporting cast of the adults that really makes this shine. Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are great in their return as the vindictive Snape and the rough diamond Hagrid respectively, while Michael Gambon, while not having the same presence as the late Richard Harris in the role of Albus Dumbledore, adds something of a twinkle that Harris seemed to struggle with in number two, perhaps because of his illness. Out of the newbies, David Thewlis is fantastic as Remus J Lupin and Gary Oldman is also very good as the enigmatic Sirius Black.Perhaps the last thing that lifts this movie over the others is the special effects, or rather the lack of them. Cuaron has made the use of magic in this one less like a laser show and it gives the whole thing a more intimate atmosphere instead of the slight heavy-handedness of the first two.Prisoner of Azkaban is a movie that is inundated with great performances that, coupled with great, subtle directing lifts it above the other two. I just hope Goblet of Fire is just as good.",9,0,0,30 July 2004
Tropic Thunder," A perfectly fine comedy that does the job.
","Tropic Thunder is not your regular comedy. Nor is it your regular Ben Stiller comedy. Sure, it is crass and offensive at times but it also is massive and dripping with pyrotechnics and an all-star cast.The basic plot revolves around three Hollywood archetypes- the fading action hero ( Stiller ), the comedian whose looking for some dramatic cred ( Black ) and the critically adored method actor ( Downey Jr. ) who are all participating in one of the most over budget and bloated productions- so much so that the production company threatens to shut the director ( Steve Coogan ) down. Said director though gets an idea from the eccentric author ( Nick Nolte ) who inspired said movie and takes the cast out into the jungle to shoot the footage 'guerilla style', inadvertently tumbling across the Golden Triangle in the process.Tropic Thunder could have been a real controversial flop- the film alludes to people with learning difficulties and blackface makeup, but the film manages to tread a line between bad taste and satire that works OK for the most part. Stiller and Black offer up performances that are not particularly new, but are suited to their parts. But it is Robert Downey Jr. as Kirl Lazarus, the Australian Award Winner, who really makes the film come alive. Some of his lines are truly hilarious and he delivers them with such verve that you can't help but laugh. Couple this with great cameos from Tom Cruise as a studio head Les Grossman and Bill Hader as his sycophantic assistant and you can forgive Black and Stiller for acting a little flat.Tropic Thunder is by no means a perfect movie but it is highly entertaining and fun.",8,1,3,20 December 2008
I Am Legend," Good, but could have been even better
","I am Legend is a movie that questions the old cliché 'Hell is other people.' In the 2009, a female doctor ( Emma Thompson, in a star cameo ) creates what is thought is a cure for cancer. However, this 'cure' begins to show dark after effects as it mutates to become a massive epidemic that wipes out almost all the population. A small number are immune to the virus, but they are hunted by the Darkseekers- infected humans not dissimilar to vampires.Robert Neville ( Will Smith ) is one such human who is immune to the virus- perhaps the last one on Earth. He has set up New York City as a sort of massive farm for himself and his dog, which is his only living companion. Three years of solitude are beginning to take their toll on Robert and despite his relentless search for a cure, it's looking bleak. That is, until perhaps a new revelation will give him the strength to continue.Will Smith really grabs hold of this, and has you believing he is the last man on Earth. You wonder how much longer he can hold out with hope. Manhattan, too is transformed beautifully into a post-apocalyptic 'farm' of sorts and it's backdrops enhance the story tenfold. My only real gripe with the movie is the Darkstalkers themselves as they look fairly...boring. All of them seem very generic and bland, and while having fangs, never seem to have them out.However, I am Legend is a good film with some great acting and backgrounds to go with it. Although the villains are disappointing, the first 45 minutes is a truly amazing set up.",8,0,5,4 January 2008
Transformers," Unleash your inner nerd!
","Transformers is a walk down nostalgia lane for some of the 20-30 Generation who grew up when these toys exploded onto the market. Now, decades later, the series has come back again in real time.And it has been worth the wait.The plot basically revolves around a boy and a girl who buys a Camaro unbeknowst that it has in fact got the ability to turn into a robot. The robot, Bumblebee, protects them as the boy holds the key to finding the Allspark, a powerful energy source that the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, want. Unfortunately, there are others who want it too, namely the evil Decipticons, led by Megatron, who begin to pursue, wiping out lots of Earth's communication in order to prepare for a full-scale assault.The plot is not original by any means of the imagination, and parallels can be seen with a lot of other Michael Bay films, particularly in the build up. However the transformers are simply awesome. The effects are truly incredible and you really get caught up as you see the Autobots 'roll out', or the Decepticons lay waste to, well basically everything. The script also manages to fill in a good sense of humour which is sometimes a little hit-and-miss but all the same it's there.This is a truly cool movie, with some great lines and some awesome special effects that are perhaps the most stunning since Jurassic Park wowed us a decade ago. With two sequels to go, I just hope they can keep it up.",10,4,6,6 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Best Superhero Movie Ever
","Most superhero movies are made to give you a feeling of escapism. THat webbing through rooftops or having claws for hands would be great and wishing that you yourself had that power. Not this one. The Dark Knight begins where the last one left off, with the theme of escalation.Batman ( Christian Bale ) and Liutenant Gordon( Gary Oldman ) with the help of the new District Attorney Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) have smashed crime to the point where they are beginning to run scared. Batman himself is beginning to think that soon he may be able to hang up the cape and the cowl for good and reunite with Rachel Dawes ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ).However, the mob has one last resort up it's sleeve, and it's a proposal by a rising criminal known only to the citizens of Gotham as the Joker ( Heath Ledger ). The Joker, however, has an agenda entirely of his own and soon begins to cause terror on a massed scale which has even Batman lost for ideas. The Dark Knight is a really amazing film, which utillises real live stunts to great effect, making seem so much more gritty and dark than it's neon-lit competitors. Be warned that it is not a film for kids, as the violence, in particular perpetrated by the Joker is confronting and at times very twisted. Christian Bale, while still not quite of the level of Michael Keaton's Batman, still does a very good job while Michael Caine is once again great as his stoic butler. Morgan Freeman is good and Aaron Eckhart brings a great element of tragedy to the role of Harvey Dent. But it is Gary Oldman and Heath Ledger who truly excel. Oldman's Gordon is a conflicted character who is put through the wringer throughout the movie by both his allies and his enemies while being nothing more than an honest cop- one of the last ones. But everyone here is playing second fiddle to the Joker. Heath Ledger brings him a menace and an edge which is so tangible that at times it is truly terrifying. His laugh is bone-chilling and his sense of humour is both funny and incredibly twisted as his 'philosophy'. He deserves every amount of praise, as it is a truly awful foe for Batman to face. The Dark KNight is a superhero film full of twists and turns that never lets up. Instead it graps you by your lapels and drags you into its dark majestic splendour.",10,6,13,17 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Best Potter flick so far
","The book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is unwieldy and cluttered, so much so that it is by far the most boring and weak of the books so far. However the movie has taken the ingredients of what could have been a great book and turned them into a great film by trimming off most of the excess fat.The world of wizardry is in turmoil as Voldermort is seizing power once again. But rather than do something, the Ministry has chosen a stance of aggressive denial, where ideas about Voldemort's return are stamped out through the poisonous representative at Hogwarts Delores Umbridge ( a very unlikeable Imelda Staunton ) whist Voldemort recruits his former Death Eaters, including the insane Bellatrix Lestrange ( Helena Bonham Carter ).This is a well-put together story; helped by the fantastic cast, all playing their part, particularly Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. But it is the two polar opposites in Snape ( Alan Rickman ) and Sirius ( Gary Oldman ) that steal the show, both of whom Harry shows very different sides of his personality to- and through which new revelations about their characters are unveiled. Their chemistry with Harry in their scenes together is remarkable.Order of the Phoenix is a great film and it shows that sometimes films can be better than books, even in a massive book franchise like this.",10,2,4,17 July 2007
From Hell," I don't know what it's trying to do...
","From Hell has its moments as a movie. However, it is also an opportunity lost because people wanted to take a safe option instead of the one that was offered to them.The plot revolves around Fred Abberline ( Johnny Depp ), a London investigator who is on the trail of Jack the Ripper as he leaves a trail of mutilated bodies through the Whitechapel district of London. High up on his list seems to be a group of prostitutes- one of which is Mary Kelly ( Heather Graham )- who confides in Abberline in the hope that the Ripper case may be solved. However, soon, both the inspector and Kelly, along with the trusty sergeant ( Robbie Coltrane ), see that the trail may lead to echelons of society far higher than they could possibly imagine.This, in itself, does seem like a good plot for a movie. However there are a couple of big problems that stop it from working. One is that Abberline has 'visions' when under the influence of opium which seem to be a half-baked excuse by the Hughes Brothers to show London in a different light and it doesn't really work. This compounds the second problem, which is that there is no real mystery element to the plot, instead he comes up with a vision which helps him figure it out.The performances are varied with Depp good as Abberline and Graham average as Kelly but it is the English supporting cast of Robbie Coltrane, Ian Richardson as his police chief and most strongly, Ian Holm as Sir William Gull, which makes the atmosphere come alive. To add to that is an amazingly dark score and a great set in Prague which makes Victorian London seem as real and malevolent as ever.From Hell is a sort of a halfway house between a brilliant Alan Moore graphic novel which portrayed things from the view of Jack the Ripper and a straight out period murder mystery and it's this compromise that sees it fail. One wonders if the plot was changed just so they could get someone like Johnny Depp and Heather Graham into the star credits.",7,0,2,21 April 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Indiana Jones in First Gear
","The Da Vinci Code is one of those movies that doesn't reach its potential as a movie because it doesn't realise the depth of character development needed to keep the characters interesting between action sequences. Perhpas Mr Howard should have taken a leaf out of the book of Mr Jackson to get a real view of how it could have been done. Instead, what keeps this movie going is the promise that somehow Langdon would find the secret- a promise that can only take this movie so far.Tom Hanks is interesting as Robert Langdon but the fact of the matter is that his character is too one-dimensional to really empathise with him. The same goes for Audrey Tatou whose revelation at the end is predictable and doesn't really add to the story as much as it should. The supporting cast however does a good job in keeping the storing interesting- with Ian McKellan stealing the show and acting the two principles off the screen. Alfred Molina is a sinister and driven villain as Bishop Arigarossa and Paul Bettany playing fanatical priest with glazed eyes and frightening devotion are also great, though underused.The fact of the matter is that this movie drags when these supporting actors are not on the screen despite its interesting premise ( which, by the way, is not new and has been bounced around historical fiction for a while ).The Da Vinci Code is worth a look if you're interested in history and are prepared to put a hypothetical theory into reality. But don't expect too much as it doesn't move mountains like other religious films, such as Life of Brian.",6,3,7,29 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Good, but not quite Azkaban quality
","I must admit that if I was going to do a Harry Potter film, I would think that the ones that would be the most exhausting would be numbers four and five. Why? Because of the mass of characters that need to be fed into the machine in order for it to be a coherent storyline. Fortunately for HP fans, Mike Newell does a pretty good job, with only the occasional slip up.The great thing about Goblet of Fire is that it is the book that truly turns the series on its head; with the idea of a dark foreboding evil becoming fully realised and Harry's destiny becoming more than just magic and wands. The script is handled well, with the story continuing to adhere closely to the books, with the cutting out of a couple of peripheral characters, allows the story to move quickly and efficiently from scene to scene.The new actors are all very good, particularly Brendan Gleeson as Moody and David Tennant as Barty Crouch Jr. A special mention should also go to Ralph Fiennes who played Voldemort with a very reptilian sort of menace ( he didn't so much move as swooped ) that gave the Dark Lord a quality that is totally unique. His performance helped to really move the film along in the closing stages. All the other actors performed their parts with the usual aplomb, and Michael Gambon has moved beyond Richard Harris to become a new Dumbledore, one that although may seem a little gritty for this film ( though he was still very good ), will suit Dumbledore perfectly in films to come.There were however a couple of things that seemed to irritate me in the movie. For starters, the Yule Ball scene went for too long. It was an event that was important in the scope of the moment, but it really had no consequence on the rest of the film. Secondly Gary Oldman as Sirius Black should have been used more to flesh out the characters of Karakroff, Moody and Barty Crouch instead merely appearing for ten seconds in a fire. Perhaps the scene on top of the mountain in Hogsmeade would have been better to see than the one in the fire, despite the absence of special effects. Thirdly some characters seemed to merely peter out instead of finding out what happened to them; Rita Skeeter disappeared off the face of the Earth, Draco seemed to have nothing to say about the return of the Dark Lord and the relationship between Fudge and Dumbledore if one had not read the book at the end was anyone's guess.But I may be being overly critical as the book is incredibly difficult to do, and for every irritant, there are 4 cool things to make up for it. The Potter series rolls on in good stead, with Harry's destiny before him.",8,0,0,2 December 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Gothic brilliance
","I must admit that I saw this film after reading the book and I was therefore ready to point out any errors that the director/writers made. However to my surprise I found myself really drawn into the world of Francis Ford Coppola and his spin on the classic tale.It must be set from the start that Dracula would not be an easy book to adapt from, as rather than there being one long narration, the story is told through a series of diary entries that sometimes conflict and overlap. However while the story of Stoker's book is not strictly true, the atmosphere that comes from this movie would do no writer shame.This is mainly to do with the cast. Winona Ryder makes an engaging Mina Murray and Anthony Hopkins is very good as the old Van Helsing. It is only Keanu Reeves that doesn't measure up with his performance of Harker, seemingly attempting to cover a thin British accent with a lot of British chiches.But as good as Hopkins and Ryder are, it is Gary Oldman as the Count himself that really drives this movie. His brilliant ability to play both the old and the young count with aplomb as well as his menacing yet somehow sensual demeanor is what really what makes this movie shines. Other actors that deserve mention are Richard E. Grant as Dr Seward and Tom Waifs as the lunatic Reinheld.Bram Stoker's Dracula is a quintessential Gothic film that encapsulates the darkness of the novel. I think it is the best of the tellings of this tale.",9,0,1,6 August 2004
Lord of War," Very Good
","Lord of War is truly a movie that will repulse some movie goers in the same way that Munich will repulse some others. But this does not mean that either movie is bad or morally wrong- merely a view of what has been going on in the case of Munich and what is going on in the case of Lord of War.Nicholas Cage plays Yuri Orlov- a Ukranian who from the ground up manages to build up his gunrunning business to the point where it can decide wars. He justifies his business transactions the same way as a man who runs a diner- claiming that it is a basic human function that humans will kill each other and that you may as well make a buck out of it. It's this sort of amoral pragmatism that seems to stick by him throughout his life, despite the horrendous atrocities he witnesses and commits, including the death of his main rival in Sir Ian Holm. However as the police, headed by Ethan Hawke, hone in on his private life, he finds the complex amount of lies he has spun beginning to unravel.Lord of War is another movie that focuses on some of the problems in our society, by handing us basic figures through Cage's character as well as looking at various dodges, and corrupt sequences that show that no matter what you try to do, money talks, and in arms dealing, it seems to scream.Cage gives a fantastic performance as Orlov, reminding one of Johnny Depp's Agent Sands in Once Upon a Time in Mexico with his pragmatic dialogue. Holm is also great as his rival, giving a concealed menace to his role. Hawke however, seems to want to play the role like a boy scout and so doesn't quite come across as genuinely smart enough to catch someone as slick as Orlov. Other than that though, this movie is truly an eye-opener and should be seen by everyone who has an interest in world affairs, if only for Cage's speech to Hawke in the interview room.",9,2,4,24 February 2006
The Dark Knight Rises," The weakest of the trilogy, but still a triumphant ending.
","Christopher Nolan has finished up the Batman series in remarkable style. Where Batman Begins was about conquering fears and the Dark Knight was about traversing the fine line between order and madness; the Dark Knight Rises seems to be a movie about compromise and acceptance.It has been eight years since the death of Harvey Dent and Gotham has settled down into some semblance of peace. The main instigators of this crime-free age, however, have many scars for their trouble. Bruce Wayne ( Christian Bale ) is a reclusive cripple- with shot knees and scar tissue riddling his body. Commissioner Gordon ( Gary Oldman ) has found his career is now burdened by the lie that he and Batman wove to keep Harvey Dent's reputation spotless- so much so that he is separated from his family. Alfred ( Michael Caine ) despairs about Bruce Wayne's welfare- fearing that his master wants little more than a grand death. And Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) is attempting to stave Wayne Enterprises from bankruptcy thanks to all the money that Wayne has invested into Miranda Tate's ( newcomer Marion Cotillard ) renewable energy source.However a new threat emerges in the guise of Bane ( Tom Hardy )- a massive masked mercenary who has a connection to Batman's past. He claims to want a new Gotham where the 'have-nots' can rule over the 'haves' and bring true justice to the rich and corrupt. Alongside him is Selina Kyle ( Anne Hathaway ) a cat burglar who motives are enigmatic at best. It is therefore up to the old guard as well as idealistic cop John Blake ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) to try and hold Gotham together.Nolan has gone for bigger is better in his third movie of the trilogy and it certainly comes off as an sweeping, epic movie. Christian Bale probably gives his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman and the scenes he has with Caine's Alfred are particularly moving. Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman are both very good also- with the scenes between Oldman and Gordon-Levitt ( probably the best of the newcomers ) nice to watch.But as good as the film is...it doesn't really seem to cover much more new ground. This isn't really helped by their choice of villain. Hardy does a good job as Bane, but he isn't helped by his breathing mask which makes him, at times, hard to understand. Furthermore, while Bane is shown to be dangerous, Nolan seems to be forcing the viewer to show how dangerous he is. Without the personal and affable menace of Neeson's Ra's Al Ghul or the twisted and frightening charisma of Ledger's Joker, Bane's most menacing moments come before the real action kicks off. Furthermore, it's difficult to see why anyone would want to follow him- utopia or not.As for Catwoman, Hathaway is very good in the role, but her character seems to be frustrating at times- seeming to just sit on the fence for the heck of it. Cotilliard's Miranda Tate is a fairly bland character that doesn't add much to the proceedings either.Furthermore, while the movie is indeed epic in scope, it sometimes gets lost in its own arcs in a way that the Dark Knight never did. The twists and turns that would have been seen as remarkable in the Dark Knight in this movie came across as almost unnecessary.Begins was a tight film that revolved around a single plot arc and holds together well. The Dark Knight was the true noir epic- a sweeping tale about morality and order in a insane city. The Dark Knight Rises is a flawed masterpiece- it's achievements not quite living up to the ambitions that it perhaps had. However, any Batman movie directed by Christopher Nolan is probably a good one. This is no exception.",8,20,42,20 July 2012
Iron Man," Best Marvel comic book adaptation
","Iron Man isn't exactly what you would call a 'flagship' hero of Marvel's. With Spider-Man, the X-Men, the Hulk and the Fantastic Four all more prominent, it is little surprise that this vehicle had difficulty getting off the ground- so much so that Marvel got fed up and began their own film company to see it become a reality. What is surprising is that this movie is such a beauty, right up with Batman Begins as the best superhero movie ever made.The story revolves around Tony Stark, a wealthy and brilliant- though also hedonistic and eccentric inventor who is captured by terrorists and is forced to look at his weapons company through the other side. Escaping by means of a revolutionary invention, Stark returns to find that his business partners, primarily Obidiah Stane, are concerned about the direction he has the company going in. With the aid of Pepper Pots, Jim 'Rhodey' Rhodes and a collection of all sorts of robots, Stark begins to perfect his invention to put a stop to the misery that he helped create.This would all count for nought if it wasn't for the performances- and they are brilliant. Gweneth Paltrow give Potts a real verve that sparks off when her and Stark have scenes alone together. Terence Howard is very good as Jim Rhodes, providing a down-to-earth confidante for the erratic Stark while as Obidiah Stane, Jeff Bridges seems to be channeling ENRON executives brilliantly.But it is Robert Downey Jr who carries this film as the man Tony Stark himself. Downey Jr seems to be having the time of his life as he sparks brilliantly witty and fast dialogue- whether it is flirting with reporters, or calming down extinguishers ( you'll just have to wait and see what I mean...).Iron Man delivers on every level. Marvel has obviously ensured that their material is handled with care and discretion and the result is a movie that has a darker tone than any of the others in the Marvel comic book franchise, but at the same time remains much funnier as well. Oh and by the way, stay after the credits for a sneak peak of where Marvel Film may be going.",10,1,3,1 June 2008
300," Stylised history
","OK, firstly, as a historian I recognized the various inaccuracies in the movie. However since I am also a comic book nerd I was more than willing to move beyond them and see what they did to a great graphic novel which is artistically based on the Battle of Thermopylae. For this to work, they would really have to do something different. And they have. The atmosphere that they have created for this film is nothing short of breathtaking. It's not the actors nor the effects, nor the camera work, nor the soundtrack but all of it coming together to make a feeling that is incredibly involving. 300 is a movie that has done for history what Sin City did for Film Noir. It doesn't take it past a point of no return, but it takes elements of a genre and mixes them with a magic ingredient- Frank Miller's mind.",9,3,7,17 April 2007
Sin City," Fantastic!
","Robert Rodriguez doesn't seem to know the word moderation. His movies over the past ten years or so have either consisted of children's flicks like the Spy Kids series or violent bloodfests like the Marachi saga. The idea of an 'M' rated movie seems abhorrent.Which brings us nicely to his latest venture- an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel series Sin City.This is not a movie for everybody's taste; and although the MA15+ may suggest that already, I find it hard to believe that this got away with a softer rating than Kill Bill Vol. 1 after what some of the characters go through. This is not the sort of cartoonesque violence that made Kill Bill so wild and stylish, rather Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino ( as a 'guest director' ) show a much more darker and grittier world of violence that is dominated in black in white, with only the odd emphasis of colour.The plot is actually 3 stories- all loosely connected with one another. Bruce Willis stars in the first one as Hartigan- a cop whose early retirement plans are cut short due to a combination of his own obsessions with justice and his partner Bob ( Michael Madsen ); only to find his obsession later on all grown up in the form of Jessica Alba and his nemesis still alive in the form of what can only be described as something seen to be believed. Mickey Rourke in the second story plays Marv- a convict who is determined to get to the bottom of who killed a hooker that spent the night with him. This perhaps sees one of the most interesting performances of the movie in the form of Elijah Wood, who after Frodo Baggins, plays Kevin- a cannibalistic stalker. Finally ( as if two wasn't enough ) there's Dwight ( Clive Owen ) who attempts to help protect the 'sisters' of Old Town led by Gale ( Rosario Dawson ) from the mob and bent cops.All the cast of Sin City really come to the fore, with Owen and Willis in particular standing out and making the gritty neo-30's gangster dialog come to life. The environment is fantastic and one can only applaud Rodriguez for the time he has taken to recreate the atmosphere of Miller's novels.As I said before, Sin City is not for everyone- but if you can handle violence ( and I mean violence ) then this is a movie not to be missed.",10,0,1,19 July 2005
V for Vendetta," Truly, truly, truly amazing
","Mahatma Gandhi once said that non-violence would work in any society but the totalitarian state. V for Vendetta looks at one can ( perhaps what one must ) do in order to make a difference.I must admit that I had been looking forward to this movie for a while when it had come out. I was certainly gladdened then that if anything, it exceeded my expectations.The plot revolves around Evey Hammond ( Natalie Portman ), who lives in a proto-fascist state reminiscent of 1984. To this end, after a encounter with some of the secret police that begins to turn ugly, she is saved by the mysterious V ( Hugo Weaving ), a revolutionary with a past that he demands atonement for. With Evey at his side V begins to slowly dispatch those who had wronged him in his mysterious past, leaving him as the outcast that he is at the present, while at the same time, beginning preparations to give the government a 5th of November to never be forgotten, in honour of Guy Fawkes.This is not a movie about right wingers against left wingers, or greenies against conservatives. Rather this is a movie about what can happen to a society when fear grips it, when difference is abhorred rather than celebrated. The sequence with the movie director is perhaps one of the most interesting and touching in film this year.What is also great about this movie is the way V is portrayed- he is by no means a good man- he is by all accounts a man who is out for revenge against a government who cursed him for something he cannot remember. He is no Gandhi or Mandela, but a man on his quest for vengeance and Hugo Weaving portrays this immaculately.Portman is good as Evey, though her accent occasionally drops off, Stephen Fry is excellent as her boss, showing comic timing and deep regret in equal measure, and John Hurt is truly frightening as Chancellor Sutler.This is an incredible movie and it deserves many accolades. As Mr Franklin once said, 'He who sacrifices liberty for security will gain neither and lose both.'",9,1,3,10 May 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Obvious humour, but still great humour
","It would be remiss to say that this sort of plot is not clichéd. Man makes it to top of sporting field, rival knocks him off, man becomes despondent and does some soul searching where he realises that he needs to be more unselfish to win. What makes Talledaga Nights different though, is the comedy. Will Ferrell has placed himself amongst a great cast of comic actors; so much so, that he doesn't try and hog the limelight. Instead, Ferrell is funny, but makes the movie funnier by taking a back seat when someone has a funnier bit. And what a cast, including John C. Reilly as his driving partner and team mate and Gary Cole as his estranged father. But best of all is Sacha Baron Cohen as his gay French rival, who seems to be channeling a camp version of Peter Sellers in his voice.Talledaga Nights is easy to predict and there is little doubt what the ending will be. But the comedy is so good that you can't help but get swept up by it and enjoy the ride.",9,1,2,1 October 2006
