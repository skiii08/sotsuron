The Avengers," Only If ......
","you'll only be able to enjoy this motion picture and fully enjoys it,if you believed and processed the idea of gathering all this superheros in one film.it's a film that contain superheros who can fly,be indestructible,turning into beasts,flying from one universe to the another and an army from out of space leaded by LOKI.if you have no problem with this,then you'll love this film.direction was incredible,explosive and smart.every superstar had his time to shine in front of the camera,had his heroic moments.Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo were amazing,they flew amazingly in this film and they were dominant.stark's charisma was all over the screen most of the time.Scarlett Johansson were sparkling,her acting resembles her beauty.Clark Gregg is an incredible actor,who shined in his given little time.LOKI against all the heroes had a strong presence.the movie is filled with action,it's funny.the script is well formulated and well crafted.once you cross th barrier of fantasy you'll enjoy this film,but if you don't like Marevel comics then don't bother watching.",8,2,6,6 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," He's Holmes.....Sherlock Holmes,,,
","Robert Downey Jr. is an incredible actor,you can see and believes the existence of Sherlock Holmes from his eyes...he makes this character so vivid,funny,smart & decisive simply from a diverse eyes and body motions...normally i hate Jude law but i love his character in this film..love he's acting..there is a true chemistry felt between him and Downey ..they make an excellent team as Holmes & Watson... Guy Ritchie gave us his best directional work ever..this film is a directional & visual effects epic,the camera were smarter than ever catching and describing everything and even more ....Rachel Mcadams capture the camera even in those few moments she appears in.....Jared Harris did okay but the we needed a more charismatic villain to cope with Downey....i believe the charisma that Downey Jr. brings to this movie elevates it to the class of the elite legendary hero characters..to the bond's level ... i adore Robert Downey Jr. he's a genius playing Holmes.... i am really hoping that i see Johney Depp as the villain vs Holmes ..it would be something for the ages...",8,4,9,21 December 2011
The Hunger Games," Am I crazy or this is a super boring film ??
","what an overrated movie. This film failed to make any connection with me,it failed to create a bond from any kind with me. The film is slow,had many flows in the script.So many unrealistic details keeps appearing in this film over and over again. The film atmosphere is meaninglessly vague,fragile and depressing. I kept telling myself that some kind of a miracle is going to appear and change what i am boringly observing but what i was waiting for never came. There is no depth in this motion picture in any aspect,on the contrary it's too superficial and naive. All in all i hated it.",4,10,14,15 April 2012
Underworld Awakening," Disaster..
","why is this film made in 3D,i have no idea.so many of the films made today are introduced in 3D with no what so ever need..(only AVATAR were that much great in 3D). The story in this part is very weak.i expected a more convincing script than this one.the idea of being captivated in a frozen form and waking up after a certain amount of time is already worn out. Kate Beckinsale gives a good performance but the film and the screenplay didn't help much,at some times i felt the script was naiive. the movie's duration was very short,i felt it was an episode for television not a full movie. i expected more of this film but i didn't get what i was expecting.",5,89,165,22 January 2012
Salt," What went wrong ?
","what went wrong,this is the question that kept pumping in my head after watching this movie.(Phillip Noyce) directed THE BONE COLLECTOR,(Kurt Wimmer)wrote STREET KINGS,(Angelina Jolie) is a mega superstar & she had a solid cast.the film had all the elements to be totally rocking but it didn't. the script is weak & fragile that we reach a point wondering what is going on,things are not that naive & the sequence of events does not make a lot of sense.the character of SALT is not a superhero,she is not a superwoman nor a cat woman so a lot of the action & the sequence of events in the film is not acceptable nor believable. the action scenes were well directed & the visual effects were good.(Jolie) & Liev Schreiber were good. i don't know if the reason is that i just watched INCEPTION before SALT but i expected something better.",5,12,28,4 August 2010
Avengers: Endgame," Disappointed .....
","For many of the Marvel's fans, this will disappoint you. Let me tell you why.
The movie's lengh is overextended with too many scenes taking more time than they deserve.
The fight/ war scenes should have been more than this giving that this is the finale.
The final battle were done under poor lighting and i expected much more visual effects, the last movie final battle were conducted in so many better ways. The detailing of the battle became so pathetic with people chasing a start's arm with the stones on them.
The final battle's logic which allowed stark to finish everything is really unexplained, a man who posses the power of a god can't save his own life after wanting so much to be there for his daughter.
The concept and the handling of fhe time travel was poorly excuted.
The way captain america appeared in the final scene and the explanation of how he did so is childish.
The hulk role was so much dominished.
Fury had nothing to do with this film, just an appearance in the final scene.
Captain marvel's presence is truly sarcasitc, she appears at weird times and the justification fot this is funny.
Thor became a comic role in this movie, no what so ever strength in his character not even in the final scenes.
Dr strange role was dimished also, he is supposed to be one of the best avengers.
Again the final battle really failed to impress me, which is one of the main reseaons for disappointments.
The emotional scenes in the movie were scattered and undefined, this is sad giving the fact that the movie had all the elements required to deliver great emotional scenes where you can see each character's emotioned in a much clearer display.
I expected an epic film, a solid plot and a flying emotions, this movie didn't deliver any of those to me.",3,115,270,24 April 2019
Django Unchained," If your crazy enough ....this is an epic .....
","Quentin Tarantino , love him,hate him,feel whatever you want towards him ; he's a genius ..crazy gifted weird genius as both a film maker & writer. Always in Tarantino's films you'll listen to great soundtracks , but in this one it's something else ; in a certain time you'll feel your even enjoying the opera ,great scenes along with amazing exquisite music . Jamie Foxx,Leonardo DiCaprio,Samuel L. Jackson,Kerry Washington they were all amazing in fulfilling their roles but the screen breathes ,jumps ,loves and adores the great Christoph Waltz ... Hollywood really lost the years he spent away from it's screen .he's a true titan in this one,he's funny,smart,precise & gifted beyond words . loved the film,music,story line,screenplay,acting,action,craziness ... Quentin Tarantino your a magician ,a crazy unique amazing son of a gun ....",9,1,4,20 January 2013
The Dark Knight," for the love of the joker and ledger
","every thing in the dark knight amazes me,great direction from Christopher Nolan and a deep,amazing and moving script.bale gives us another outstanding performance for Bruce Wayne.freeman,Caine,old man are amazing.Elkhart gives us one of his best performances ever.Maggie is okay as Rachel.but this movie begins,stops,moves,breathes with heath ledger,this movie is about the joker.my god what a performance that challenges all the great performances for the best in Hollywood history how can you fall in love with the villain cause he's that charismatic.this movie is hands down the best in comic movies.ledger showed everybody how to dominate a movie without being the main character and without appearing that much in the picture.most movie lovers will memorize every dialog for the joker.ledger we will never forget you,your gone but your creation for the joker will live on.",9,0,4,18 July 2009
Joker," Heath Ledger is smiling somewhere ...
","Viscous, amazing, scary, flowing, bold; again bold.
What an acting, seems like some movies are meant to be an all time great. This film will challenge DC to provide another one like this, the acting, the direction, the Flowing anarchy that captures and grapes you is really capturing.
Joaquin Phoenix Is a pure great magician.
Heath Ledger has a strong adversary, cause what Joaquin provided in this film is pure magic.",10,3,5,3 October 2019
Inception," NOLAN....your a son of gun sir..
","after i watched this movie i just had certain thoughts 1.how the hell did Nolan wrote such a great complicated script. 2.how did he assemble such a great intelligent cast & crew,that was able 2 understand & perform in this amazingly high level. 3.how did he saw & shoot the film in this mind blowing way. 4.how can u create a movie that people will sit & watch without being able 2 just rest their minds even 4 seconds. 5.Nolan will go among the greatest directors this film making business have ever seen. 6.DiCaprio deserves an Oscar 4 this.(and also 4 SHUTTER ISLAND).THIS MOVIE IS A RIDE,JUST BUCKLE ON BEFORE U TAKE IT..IT'S A MIND BLOWING RIDE..IT'S A RIDE THAT WILL TAKE U 2 PLACES THAT U NEVER WENT..U WILL FEEL THAT THIS A MASTERPIECE ALL THE WAY.. NOLAN THANK YOU.....",10,3,7,25 July 2010
The Dark Knight Rises," Shut up ........
","To all whom may even try to criticize this film i am obligated to tell them this .... why ? cause nobody had ever dreamed of making a batman film that even comes close to Nolan's BATMAN BEGINS ,then he followed it by a masterpiece in THE DARK KNIGHT,then the end had too be great matching those two and he ended it with an epic for all ages,he sat the bar too high for every other director .. How can you make an end this magnificent,incredible,moving,smart....what an exquisite motion picture .NOLAN created a world war batman's film,so many details and yet so little flows in it's execution. The script is phenomenal ...it alone makes you asking to watch it again instantly after finishing it ,Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was unbelievable like it was from outside of this planet.NOLAN'S direction was an epic..No body matches the JOKER as a villain but this film is not about one man,not even batman himself ; it's about the people,chaos,Righteousness chaos and an idol.. Fight scenes were the best ever in a superhero film ... Michael Caine gave his best performance in all batman's butler history,Gary Oldman was a genius,Tom Hardy was terrifying and outstanding, Joseph Gordon-Levitt was very good,Anne Hathaway and Marion Cotillard were both beautiful and shining..for Christian Bale ,this is his best performance of Bruce Wayne ever .. undisputed Masterpiece ....",10,4,11,20 August 2012
Looper," Shallow ..
","this film is not what i expected at all ..mark the following ; 1. in such a city where people kill each others in the streets for one or another reasons,the city is contained by poor people and homeless ,but in the same time killing is very hard cause of the tracing (you can see someone who shots another who took his bag ). 2.so very shallow storyline everywhere in the movie ...the story f his wife and his beloved woman,the kid who grows up to be someone no one knows ''rain maker'' ,why are those people getting killed,who runs such operations,police force showed no sign at all from the technology side that they are that advanced so that they can detect bodies . 3.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is not the young Bruce Willis ..he tried to copy him but no ; you can even feels it when the 30 years were just passing by. 4.in such an advanced city you don't have any advanced weapons,you have motorcycles that can fly but you can't have pistols that are smarter than those. 5.the plot is weak,boring,you can't find a certain rhythm to it . I didn't like it and i felt no story line nor attachment to any of the characters in it .",4,2,4,25 November 2012
The Godfather," Best of the best
","yes it was produced back at 1972 but till now it's the best movie for all time.what an epic,once you open this film you will take a trip to the mafia world and you will be a member of the corleone family.I felt that Coppola was drawing this movie with his hands,he was like a magician playing with his tools.brando gives us the best performance maybe in cinematic history.i can't believe that this was the first movie(worldwide production)for Al Pacino,he was iconic,the way his character alters alongside the film was nearly impossible to be performed by anyone and be convincing but Pacino did it like he was born for it.Duvall was so smooth and Caan was so serious that you feel they are those characters at real life too.every single actor deserved an Oscar for there performances in this masterpiece.Mario puzo created a perfect novel and then made an even better screenplay.Coppola handled this film like he was waiting and preparing for it his whole life.",10,0,1,7 August 2009
