The Blair Witch Project," Sooo scary!!
","NOT!  Our 10 year old even watched it.  Scary to think there is a sequel! The only thing great about this movie was the end.  In that, it was over, yaaaayyy!!!!  The whole film was nothing more than useless people being lost in the woods and whining about it.  Oh, my gosh, I am so scared of strange rocks!!!!  Good thing they didn't go camping here, where there are raccoons....heart attack city!!!",Null,0,1,3 September 2001
