The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," The Fourth Color: Gold
","Krzysztof Kieslowski loves to delve in the idea of chance versus fate versus free will. The Double Life of Veronique is a haunting musical epiphany and with such visual poetry, it is filled with symbolism, some frank eroticism, and a slight dark humor. Kieslowski loves to filter colors to have an effect on his films, if it was part of his Three Colors Trilogy, it would've been 'Gold'. The photography was nostalgic, the lighting gives different shades on different moods of the characters. Irene Jacobs was enigmatic and sensual in her role as Weronika and Veronique. The story is simple, but there is more than the plot here, Kieslowski is more concerned in the visual rhyme, and his mystical narration of the story. He kind of connect the whole film together with strings but still leaves it like a scattered puzzle, it encourages uncertainty, and that is what I really liked about it. It leaves us with haunting questions that remains for us to answer, maybe in our own lives, rather than making us a complacent viewer that understands everything about the film and the world. I admire how Kieslowski made the film a reflection on the possibilities that the film indicates a reality beyond physical mundane lives. This film is both delicate and mysterious. I'd love to watch it again anytime, in a calmer and peaceful place with a cup of coffee at my hand.",9,1,3,1 April 2015
Walk the Line," Inspiring Biography.
","Review: An inspiring true story of the legendary 'Man in Black' Johnny Cash. The first time I saw this film, I have no idea who's Johnny Cash. When the time I finished watching it, I searched for the name Johnny Cash and became a fan. Now I listen to his songs and relived his memories. Joaquin Phoenix did his best performance of his career and should been the best actor. And of course Reese Witherspoon, she looked like and sounded like the real June Carter, only more beautiful. And maybe Johnny Cash inspired Joaquin Phoenix to gave up acting and to become a songwriter like him. GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN. An inspiring true story of the legendary 'Man in Black' Johnny Cash.

Spartacus," Another 10 stars from Kubrick.
","'When a freeman dies, he loses the pleasure of life. A slave loses his pain. Death is the only freedom a slave knows.' Before the groundbreaking sci-fi, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick did an unforgettable 3-hour classic epic about a slave who inspired other men like him to fight against the indestructible Roman soldiers headed by Crassus to gain their freedom. Kirk Douglas (Paths of Glory) starred as the man who fought bravely for his life and love, Spartacus. The battle scenes were brilliantly executed. Spartacus's will to give freedom to his fellow men (though he didn't achieve it) and his model as a leader to them made him one of the best of all Kubrick's characters in his films. This film had had more dramatic scenes than all of Kubrick's films put together, including the last scene. It is truly hearth wrenching when Crassus offered them to live and to be slaves again if they bring him the body of Spartacus, but in surprise they all admitted that they were Spartacus, they rather be crucified till death than to be slaves again. Spartacus's character is unbreakable and undeniably strong. Crassus did kill Spartacus, but he didn't kill the legend of Spartacus. Perfect!",10,1,3,9 December 2010
Memento," Nolan's 3rd best film, Brilliant
","A confusingly brilliant master creation by Nolan (Batman Begins, The Prestige). I have to read the plot in its chronological order just to understand what really occurred at the events. You can't solve the puzzle by just watching it once, you should watch it various times to put the pieces in order, and you should really stay focus. This is the first time I watched Guy Pearce, and I thought his performance is very realistic. This is the real thrill!! Suspense at its best!! I watched it like I have a short-term memory loss, I want to start it all over again and again, even if I stored all the scenes in my head. I gave it a 10/10.The Prestige - 10/10 Batman Begins - 10/10 Memento - 10/10 Insomnia - 9/10 The Dark Knight -8/10",10,1,4,10 November 2008
Iron Man 2," Iron Man = Good, Iron Man 2 = Better!
","It doubled its predecessor. Bigger and better, this sequel is getting close to somewhere. Mickey Rourke was perfect in his terrifying villain, Don Cheadle earned War Machine's suit, Scarlett Johansson looks so hot in her acrobatic scenes, and Jon Favreau (the director) enjoyed his part in the movie, he gave his character (Happy Hogan) a bigger role than his previous cameo in Iron Man. I watched the first installment and the sequel both in the theater, and I must admit that I enjoyed this one much more than the first. It fills every gap in the first movie, a more startling opponent matched by upgraded weapons, the action takes us to a new level. This one is thicker than the first. I'm getting excited for Avengers, scheduled to be release on 2012.",8,18,36,4 May 2010
127 Hours," Danny Boyle's first 10/10 for me.
","Do I believe in fate? I don't know, but Aron Ralston do, he accepted the fact that that rock stuck on his arm is waiting for him all of his life. We tend to think a lot more when we are stuck with life itself. Aron Ralston had so much to think in what he thought was his last days. He thought of that party he was invited by the last two people he saw, he thought about his memorable and happy days with his family, he blamed himself, for being selfish and for being stuck there, well he can't blame the rock. He had so much time to think that he felt guilty of some of the things he took for granted. Well, that's what we're going to feel when we're helpless and waiting to die on our own mistake. Danny Boyle, after his Slumdog Millionaire won the best picture two years ago, had come back with another brilliant film, but in a different set of standards, for me this is his best so far. This is not boring, considering one location and one actor present on almost the whole duration of the film. That's not only because of Danny Boyle's techniques but also because of James Franco's outstanding acting, he's best performance of his career. He plays the cocky athlete who lived to tell his agonizing experience. It is a torture both to the audience and to Ralston throughout the film. When the fact that he's not going to be saved by anyone became clear to him, he is faced with two choices: Lose your arm or lose your life? He's got the courage to live and he deserved to be alive today. Maybe he was meant to be in that situation for him to start a new life, a more cautious life. In his first attempt of cutting his arm, I was thinking: Don't do that, that's nasty and real painful, there's no way that that tool will gonna cut it, just wait for somebody. But the second time he tried it I really knew he was going to do it, it's sickening and disgusting but there's no other option. I can't imagine myself in that situation, because it's hard to lose any part of our body, especially the arm, especially when you're the one doing it. He had no third choice, time is a factor, he had to let go of his arm rather than letting go of his life. After watching this film, I thought that life is beautiful just to let it go when you've got a choice to keep it. You've got to give credit to James Franco, he played it with the confidence of his character and with a convincing detail. I haven't seen yet the performance of the two actors nominated in this year's Academy Awards, Javier Bardem in Biutiful and Colin Firth in The King's Speech, so right at this moment I have to say that James Franco did better than Jesse Eisenberg and Jeff Bridges, but Colin Firth has the upper hand because he had already won on the Actors Guild and Golden Globe. I have to see The King's Speech as soon as possible, so that I can know who I'm going to support. But talking about courage, Aron Ralston got a heavy dose of it, as he continues to do the thing that makes him happy, mountain climbing. No pain, no gain.",10,1,10,7 February 2011
My Neighbor Totoro," Miyazaki's best work, simply fantastic!
","Hayao Miyazaki didn't go extravagant like he did in his most critically acclaimed works such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. My Neighbor Totoro is simple but still imaginative like all his works, and it is quite simply a masterpiece. Even though Totoro doesn't seems he wanted to be lovable, even though he looks scary because of his huge eyes and large mouth, he remains to be one of the loveliest characters of Hayao Miyazaki, quiet but unforgettable, he is like a Teddy Bear. If Satsuki and Mai was amazed when they saw Totoro the first time, well I'm astonished when I saw the half-cat, half-bus creature, it is magical to see that. He didn't go far in this one, but it's the first film that I've seen from him that has a heart.",10,3,4,7 February 2011
Deadpool 2," This is the sequel we all need.

Snatch," 'Less entertaining in the third time.'
","The first time I saw 'Snatch' three years ago, I was intensely amazed. It's a unique fine film, one of a kind, but it was then when I haven't seen 'Lock, Stock' and now that I've re-watched both films in order, I realized that 'Snatch' wasn't the first film with this theme, although it was both directed by Guy Richie. So I've decided that they're equally great, and I'm putting it one notch below my original rating to be fair, but it will remain on my all-time favorite films and it will never leave that list. I very much enjoyed this film, but I must say it wasn't as exciting as the first viewing, it's my third time watching it. There are films that even though how many times you've seen them will still remain as effective and fresh like the first viewing, like 'Taxi Driver' and 'Fight Club' which I have repeated the most. And there are some films that are effective in the second viewing, like 'Dog Day Afternoon' and 'Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels' which I've re-watched recently and I was more into it than the first time, it's maybe because I wasn't in the right mood then. 'Snatch' is still a clever film, a brilliant creation by a creative director, Guy Richie. 'RocknRolla' is my highest rated Richie film, and maybe I need to watch it again and see if it's still as great as it was a year ago, the reason I loved it very much although it's now a familiar theme and it's only a recycle of his first two films, is because I missed the style and the almost-clever-more-lucky characters that he has in this kind of films. If Tarantino has 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' Richie got 'Lock, Stock' and 'Snatch.'",9,0,2,2 March 2011
Taxi Driver," One of the Greatest Film of All Time
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is an overwhelming reality of violence, and remained as one of the darkest picture about the transformation of an innocent being due to the environment that he's in. Opening with a lot of smoke, the taxi looked like it was emerged from hell. Travis Bickle is the one that's driving that taxi, he lives alone in his messy apartment, he's an insomniac, he eats a lot of junk foods and sugar, and the only show he knows to watch is pornography. At nights, during Travis' working hours, we take a look at the saturated color of New York, the dirty streets filled with all kinds of scum in Travis Bickle's deep paranoid eyes. During the day, we see the hope in living at a place like this, until Travis was rejected again by the society that he declares like a union, cold and distant. Travis' downward spiral cannot be stop, each time he is going deeper into violence. Travis' confrontation with violence is beginning to be excessive, hearing the words at the backseat by some mad husband planning to kill his wife with a .44 magnum, and in the streets some mad man shouting 'I'll kill her, I'll kill her' only deepens Travis' idea of the bloodbath in the brothel later. He asks some advice from a fellow cab driver, Wizard. But they ended up not understanding each other's point, this is a critical moment for Travis, he seeks for clarity but did not get it, he was saying 'I've got some real bad ideas in my head.' And that idea will come to life, as he buys his own .44 magnum and different kinds of pistols, he gets his first kill on a small store trying to save it from a robber. Scorsese effectively isolated Travis from the society in each distant shot. Not only that Travis Bickle was influenced by Norman Bates, in Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, but almost the whole film is Hitchcockian, from Scorsese's cameo, the homage on Rear Window in one scene and the frequent over the head shots. But at some point, Scorsese rises up from his master. In the second part of the film, Travis Bickle became John Wayne, trying to save a young prostitute from her pimp, a mirror plot from The Searchers. He acts again like a sane man, but he is slowly being dragged away from the reality. In the bloodbath, violence exploded, released from his captivity, he doesn't know what he is doing, but planned this thing obsessively and now that it happened, it is ironic that he was praised as a hero who rescues a young prostitute. The final scene as he drove Betsy into Manhattan, he seems like that he is back into sanity, but again he gave us a paranoid threatening look at the rear-view mirror, like the one he's been giving through the whole course of the film, and you know it might not be a happy ending after all. Bernard Herrmann's last score was truly a magnificent piece, it colored and shaped the image of Taxi Driver, haunting and unforgettable jazzy score. Martin Scorsese, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro all in premium shape and at their best in this agonizing dark masterpiece. Taxi Driver is so affecting because this story is all too real, Travis Bickle is not just a character in a movie, he is the character of the society, he is the voice-over of the isolated humanity, victimized by the system of the world.",10,1,1,16 January 2011
Corpse Bride," Burton, almost brilliant in an animated feature.
","I guess it has all the potentials for becoming better than it was. The animation is pretty cool in Gothic and Johnny Depp's voice was clumsy and very young that fits in his character. But the only problem is, it was too rapid and almost a half-baked animated film. Burton looked like he haven't got sufficient time to make this more astonishing! The film was completely fast and unable to touch the spectators. The tale is wonderful and clear but unfortunately fast, it could've been more dramatic if it emphasizes more on the tragic love, so the happy ending is much more felt by the watchers. You couldn't ask for more, the story was sure excellent, but what I'm asking is, to make it more lasting and enduring. It could've been great but it was fine.",7,0,0,7 August 2009
Justice League," There's no justice in Justice League
","The only thing worth seeing is Gal Gadot's disarming smile in the horrendous climax. The most unforgivable thing about it was my favorite superhero growing up was murdered by an annoying performance courtesy of Ezra Miller. His counterpart in Marvel comics, Quicksilver is so much better portrayed, Evan Peters' performance was effortlessly agreeable while Ezra Miller tried so hard to be likable.DC's extended universe is nowhere near the worst entry in Marvel's cinematic universe.There's no justice in Justice League6 out of 10 stars is an average rating for many people but it is a very low rating in my book.",6,0,0,28 November 2017
Control," One of the best rock biopic.
","Control is a rock biopic about Joy Division's frontman, Ian Curtis. It is filmed in brilliant black-and-white, with superb performances from Sam Riley and from the two-time Academy Award nominated actress, Samantha Morton. The photography was superb too, it set the right tone for the era, it was bleak and depressingly beautiful. The director Anton Corbijn has photographed Joy Division in his early years, so he's familiar with them and he definitely knows how to handle a film about Curtis. It was also based on the book 'Touching from a Distance,' written by Curtis' widow Deborah.Sam Riley who was relatively unknown in that year put on a brilliant act as Curtis, while Samantha Morton became the emotional center of the film, this is the first time I saw her, and I was really amazed with her performance and so I searched her films, and I found out that she's got a great list and she had been nominated twice for best supporting actress in the Academy Awards. She played the affectionate and loyal wife, Deborah.The film starts in the year 1973 in Macclesfield, England, 'I've wanted to escape it my whole life,' Curtis said. And it ends in 1980, the year when he escaped, by suicide. Curtis is gifted with poetry, and he's got some good taste for music and films. He became the vocalist for Joy Division in their short-run. At about the age of 20, he discovered that he is epileptic, it ruined his life, made him more depressed. His marriage is also falling apart, he can't accept he's a father now, he feels that his life won't go that far, and he started to have a secret relationship with another girl, Annik. His wife had found it out, I was very sad for Debbie because she was so loyal and always caring, and she's right about what she said, 'I don't deserve this.' Curtis is so complicated, it was always his melancholy that killed him, his band was rising into fame when he took off. His bandmates and friends tried to help, but he is unsalvageable. He doesn't want to be in the band anymore and he is pressured by his life and his disorder. No one can really decipher another person, and although there are times that I felt the same way as him, I can never really perfectly understand him. But maybe just because I'm no expert, but I feel him, at some point in his life and mine, we felt the same.The actors played some of Joy Division's songs, the film is filled with their live performances that again showed Sam Riley's terrific performance. The members of the band were played by James Anthony Pearson, Harry Treadaway, and one of my favorite actors, Joe Anderson. Toby Kebbel played the band manager, Rob Gretton.I discovered Joy Division when I was searching 'Most Depressing Albums' in the internet, I saw 'Unknown Pleasures' and 'Closer' in one of the list I stumbled with. I downloaded 'Closer' and listened to it, then searched for the band, I was surprised that they've had only two albums, and I found out that their vocalist died at a very young age, and that caught my attention because I was interested with depression and suicide, then I found out that there is a film about him, and that is how I discovered this film. I really loved their song 'Love Will Tear Us Apart.'By the way, the last film that Ian Curtis saw was Stroszek, a film that belonged to my list of greatest films.",9,1,1,8 August 2012
Batman Begins," Nolan transformed a new Batman.
","The first time I saw it, I knew it was the best film in the Batman Franchise. Not only because today we can do whatever we want to do because the film industry broaden its limitation, and taken a new step in visual greatness. If we compare the four Batman movies in today's, the special effects had improved and if Batman wishes to blow up a solid concrete in the rooftop, he can easily do so, very realistic and not cartoonish. But I don't really care about the special effects they put in the movies. It's not the point, the real reason why I love this film is because it was directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Prestige); with his powerful style of directing that will blow you away with its amazing lines, and his cast did a very very strong acting, including the veteran actor, Michael Caine as the ever faithful Alfred Pennyworth, the butler of the Wayne family. And of course the supporting actors, Gary Oldman as Sergeant and soon-to-be Lieutenant Gordon, Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox (same with Q in the James Bond movies). Christian Bale's Bruce Wayne exceeded all the actors that had played it (Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, and George Clooney). He did a great job of being a billionaire and a playboy, and of course being his alter-ego, Batman. Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher had handled it, but no one does it better than Christopher Nolan! Batman Begins is all about conquering fears and preventing Gotham City from self-destruction. It was delivered to us wonderfully entertaining like Nolan's other films. The transformation of Bruce Wayne to the creature he had feared all his life and his reason for being the Gotham City's Dark Knight is so powerfully shown to us. The Gotham City is dark, dirty and full of criminals everywhere like it always was. Nolan's Gotham City structure is quite amazing, it is darker and had a more realistic tone than the other Batman movies. The film focuses on its people and the humanity. Hans Zimmer's score brought a heavier theme. Batman's first contact in the screen was one of the finest moments in the film, you don't know where he is, where he's coming from and who's his next target. The scene where Batman was talking to Gordon, and when Gordon replied to him he's gone is a cool thing, he did it many times in the film. Whenever Batman is in the screen you can't stop watching him, he's a powerful force in the screen, and he'll just let you drop your mouth when he's making his moves. There are many great scenes in this film, keep a good look at those when you watch it, I've already seen Batman Begins five times, and it's not hard to tell that I'm a big fan of Batman. Scarecrow is the perfect antagonist since it is all about fear, he completes the entire idea of the film. But who's missing in the film? It's the crazy freak, Joker, the archenemy of Gotham's Dark Knight. In the last scene you'll know that he will be the next chaos maker in the next picture.",10,0,0,4 January 2010
Avengers: Infinity War," MCU didn't push any safety buttons, they went beyond your conventional superhero movies.
","I've never thought, ten years ago, that this is even possible. But thanks to the brilliant minds working in the MCU for piecing together all ten years of work into one grand film, and to the Russo brothers for doing their job again.This is not your conventional superhero blockbuster, MCU didn't push the safety button here, they went beyond anything we've ever experienced in a superhero movie. And they know they need to step up because this isn't an ordinary movie event, forget about the Justice League.From the opening scene, you can already sense the dread and the heaviness of this film, the humor is still there and the 'relief' in comic relief is more apparent this time because you can feel an air of unease throughout the film.It felt to me, though I'm not sure if it's intended, that Thanos is the center of the film, it was all about his character and his quest. And I liked that idea, it gives Infinity War another twist.I've got so much to say here, but I'll leave it in my second viewing.",9,2,7,25 April 2018
The Bourne Legacy," No more sequels.
","Not as exciting as any of the first three films. Even though Jeremy Renner gave a fine performance that for me is still considered below Matt Damon's, the whole movie is lesser, in the plot, in the writing, in style, in wit, and in almost every way you look at it. The second part of the movie became totally different, and it was packed by chase scenes that just wanted to fill in for the last few minutes of the movie. For me it didn't felt like a 'Bourne' movie. I was really looking up for Tony Gilroy who had brilliantly written the three films, they wanted to equal the first Bourne films but they fell short. In my opinion, the weakest in the series. Please no more unnecessary sequels.",7,4,13,9 August 2012
The Hurt Locker," Best Picture?
","An incredible experience, I have found what I'm looking for this year. One of the few great films this year and maybe the best. The short participation of Guy Pearce, David Morse and Ralph Fiennes was a little unusual but the three key characters really stood up in the film. A documentary style full with emotion and breathtaking shots which show us how truly dangerous are the tasks that the elite soldiers are performing in the hot country of Iraq, disarming very dangerous bombs. You can feel every character of every person in the film. The new leader James, a wild man taking every risk possible in the combat changes the whole situation in his two men in the team. Doc is the only friendly soldier you can see, likely to an adviser like him, and the sudden explosion of the bomb next to him is bizarre, he joined them only to grant the request of Specialist Eldridge, whom he felt he need to see what fear Eldridge is experiencing in the action. This powerful film evokes a lot of emotion to the viewers, the fear of ending your life so quickly like breaking a toothpick every time you go and act upon your duty is clearly stated. Near the ending, James tells us that the only thing he loves is the job that he's doing with his fellow soldiers, risking his life with dangerous bombs and saving other lives. After his days with the Bravo team, he joined another year of hell with Delta. It's not a big surprise if I'm counting for this film to win the best picture.",10,4,14,4 January 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Fincher is best even at another genre.
","Review: After 9 years, Brad Pitt and David Fincher collaborate once more for their 3rd film, and it's good as the last two films, but in a different genre now. It is a great and original story written by Eric Roth, a man that ages backwards. This is I think the first drama by Fincher, cause I know almost all his works are either thriller or suspense. But then again he made this incredibly wonderful. They may compare it to 'Forrest Gump' in terms of style (Narration about his adventurous life, etc.) but with no doubt, this is much better. I hope this film wins an Oscar. After 9 years, Brad Pitt and David Fincher collaborate once more for their 3rd film, and it's good as the last two films, but in a different genre now.

The Adjustment Bureau," Simply Fantastic!
","Basically, I didn't' know what was going to happen in the plot, I thought it would be another one of those tiring political thrillers, but it's completely upside down, I didn't expected that it would be so different and that the next minutes of watching this film would be another great experience. This film is plain fantastic. This is an outstanding romance/sci-fi film, without being too romantic and too science fictional. It isn't perfect, there might be some plot holes, but I just got tired of finding one in this film, because it appears all my questions had disappeared right after it ended, and when I though about it again my questions were answered when I tried to investigate deeper. Just one question remains, were they that advance in technology during early times, were they using those notebooks way way back then. But that question is just for being curious. But if you find one or more plot holes, I will remind you that there isn't a perfect plot, especially if it's a complicated one, so why spend so much time finding a smudge in a plot when you can't even start up your own beautiful idea. This film reminds me of Wings of Desire and Bruce Almighty, and a little bit of Dark City. I love fantasy or science fiction films that doesn't detach itself from reality, for example Nolan's Inception, these kind of films can build up a notion in your mind that maybe it's real, it's not impossible in a world like this, yes it can be true, but no one knows, and it's more likely to be impossible but it can be possible nonetheless. Now, The Adjustment Bureau is a heart-pumping suspense thriller too, it goes so far for being an adrenaline rush without using any type of guns at all, which is unusual in action movies. But can it be called an action movie, I wouldn't call it one, but it's far more exciting than trigger-happy action movies. The running scenes are far more better than car chases. I will not elaborate the story, but it does have a religious blend. But what I like about it very much is, it didn't advertise nor did it destroy one's faith. It's just fair. It's engaging, moving, affecting, sometimes a bit hilarious, and there is a point that it's a bit depressing too, it's an edge-of-your-seat thriller, and it is insightful too, all these great things in one film. I love the story, the plotting, the writing, and directing, it's not the greatest film, but why should I not rank it among the best. I will not let any critics or friends influence me in the way I rate a film or a movie, I'm going to be honest from now on. I love this kind of work, it rejuvenates my soul, it makes me smile inside, it's a relief from a hard life, and the stress is gone for a while. I love great films. I can't, I wouldn't let anyone stop me from watching films.",10,0,3,7 December 2011
Alice in Wonderland," 8 stars, maybe because it's my first 3D experience..
","My first digital 3D experience, every scene fulfilled my visual fantasies. The dramatic visual effects take you so far into another world called 'Wonderland.' Technology is advancing everyday, every decade has its own stage and style. I can see the vast improvement of film making from watching the first feature length film watching the newest jaw-dropping films of today. I know that the technology in film will continue to improve even though it doesn't need any and despite the fact that it looks so perfect right now. What will be the new thing in watching a movie after 10 years, 20 years and 50 years from now? I can't imagine such additions. Johnny Depp, again, plays an interesting character in a Tim Burton picture, this time he is wearing Mad Hatter's costume. This is not an unusual character to him, and he is so used to playing this kind of role that he does not need any effort in acting, but the thing that caught my attention from the beginning was the make-up, they did a wonderful job on Carter's Red Queen too. Looking deeper into the film, I can see that it started and ended a bit fast, I think that that's what happened to Corpse Bride too. I craved for each character's personality and identity but it is so sudden that we don't get to know them much. It was a victorious ending in the Wonderland, but I didn't feel so victorious because it is not a surprise to us that Alice will be triumphant in the end. Maybe Tim Burton lacks emotional approach to his audiences. His tricks work in some cases, but all in all something is lacking and I needed a little a bit more. Summary: The story is good and usual, but in some areas 'Alice in Wonderland' is lacking but not visually.",7,2,3,16 March 2010
Prometheus," Not quite what I was expecting from a great director.
","The opening scene promises another visual greatness from the director that brought us 'Blade Runner' and 'Alien,' and yes it never failed in that area. After three decades, Ridley Scott's Prometheus served as a prequel to his classic 'Alien' film.It is filled with colorful stars including Noomi Rapace, whose talents were discovered by way of her role as Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium Trilogy. Here she is the equivalent of Ellen Ripley in the Alien Franchise, but maybe it's not right to compare them. She is joined by a robot just like Hal 9000, but you can say that he is 'more human than human,' he is played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender in yet another unique role. The other cast includes Idris Elba, the captain of the Prometheus, that's the name of their spacecraft and obviously the title of the film, Charlize Theron in her villain-like role, she is employed by her father to monitor and to control the situation at every move, her father played by Guy Pearce in make-up, is the elderly founder of the corporation that funds the spacecraft and the one who sent them off to mission, to find the mysterious origin of humanity. The plot is pretty disappointing when you've arrived at the revelations.The other characters played an inevitable role that requires them to be the casualty in a kind of film that needed a body count to develop the uprising of terror and deliver us to its climax. The story seems forced, and at times confusing. The script is poorly written, giving characters dry exchanges in their dialogue. Aside from Shaw (Rapace) and David (Fassbender), the other characters are just member of the crew waiting to be killed, and they act like one, and I didn't like it because it's predictable.Prometheus didn't answer the questions it dared ask, but adds more questions, Ridley Scott at 74 is still searching for the answers in the world he created, or maybe he had found the answers but is expanding his thoughts before revealing it to us, I admire his brave mind, but maybe it's time to move on to a new idea. We expect in this prequel that our question may be finally answered, but we were wrong, some of it were answered, like what made the Alien exist, but generally I didn't like the answer, the story wasn't impressive for me, and I just think that it's better if it was left unanswered. The problems in the story development and the script prevented Ridley to give us a great sci-fi, though there are few scenes that caught my eye, including the scene where Shaw took out her baby alien. It's a fair sci-fi film, but it's disappointing coming from a great director, I expected so much more.",8,1,2,8 June 2012
Raging Bull," Scorsese's Anti-Rocky.
","Considered by many as Scorsese's finest film and even as one of the greatest films of all time, this autobiography of the pugilist Jake LaMotta (played by De Niro with utmost intensity) was not about his fights inside the ring but inside his paranoid, inarticulate, and jealous mind. After a disappointing turn in their last film together that almost ended the director's life, the one-two punch duo of star and director returned in the screen with force and bravura, earning Scorsese his first Oscar nomination for Best Director and De Niro his second Oscar win.One of the many reasons this film worked is because the themes that Scorsese had dealt with in his more personal films are present here, blending his style with a brilliant black-and-white photography from Michael Chapman, and Schoonmaker's Oscar winning work in the editing room.'Raging Bull' is the anti-Rocky, although Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff who both produced the uplifting boxing saga re-united here, in a bleak high contrast black-and-white film about a former contender who ends up as a bloated washed-up nightclub owner.",9,3,5,26 July 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," A worthy ending.
","The Dark Knight Rises, unfortunately (not hopefully) the last film of Nolan's Batman Trilogy, is a worthy conclusion. It lacks a better villain, but doesn't need one. Bane is a perfect choice, and the only choice they have if they want to keep this film realistic and in a different tone from the last one. Batman's villains are mostly twisted and insane, but Bane maybe twisted but not really insane, all other villains are colorful and weak physically (we've already seen the wits of The Joker just to watch another ingenious villain such as The Riddler or any other Arkham Asylum freaks) and they won't fit this massive conclusion to the Batman legend. Bane lacks charisma, he's not as entertainingly good as The Joker, but he is as physically strong as Batman. Now, the center stage in this film is not for the epic battle of the hero and the villain, in fact there isn't any epic battle between them, it will be for the hero's inner battle between his will to save the city he loves, the hero's rise from the fall he took and the legend he will forever leave to us.This film is not as heavy as the last film, heavy in terms of its core, its heart and its story. But it easily penetrates us, it draws emotion we've never experienced in the first two films, but basically because it's the conclusion. But Nolan made a difficult task to try to equal The Dark Knight, usually the third installment of a superhero movie or any movie series are trying to double the excitement and action but end up doubling the disappointment. The Dark Knight Rises is in no way a disappointment. But there are few things that kept me from equaling this film from the two other films, I'm not as impressed in the plot as of the previous films. It's challenging but the first part aren't really clear to me, at times I was behind, it was a little bit too complicated, I agree with Roger Ebert about the plot. The writing is a little bit lesser and not as powerful, there are just a few memorable quotes, dialogue is very important, but I'm not saying the script wasn't that great, just a little less great. The first half felt slow but not boring and uninteresting. Batman Begins and The Dark Knight kept me in a rush every minute. Though the second half was excellent and the ending was superb. Well, I was expecting a fresh story in this film, but was a little bit in disagree to find out that it still roots to the first film, but it's not a big deal as long as it fits the film, maybe this one sums it all up.Bale has lesser scenes in costume, a clear indication that this was his best performance in the trilogy, which was surprising too because there wasn't a lot of Batman. Tom hardy played Bane, he speaks in a strange funny voice that you would expect to hear from an old man and not from a huge brute, you'll see his face in not more than five seconds. Anne Hathaway as the sneaky Catwoman, though she wasn't really referred to in that name. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Blake, the heroic and newly promoted detective, who really believes in The Batman. And the beautiful Marion Cotillard as Miranda Tate. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman reprised their roles.This final chapter still delivers hard though not as exciting and exhilarating as the Dark Knight, but it has the emotional chill that The Dark Knight doesn't have. So now let me ask again why do we feel so affected by the characters in this film? And how many times did we feel that way about a character on a comic book? That is the reason why Nolan is different from other directors of this popular genre, he engages us with these characters so effectively, he gave depth to them and then build us so that we feel affected by their situations, we appreciate Lucius Fox's helpful hand, we trust Alfred so much, we care so much about Commissioner Gordon, we sympathize for our hero, The Batman and Bruce Wayne. We look back in their past, how their relationships change in every film, and how their characters transform, different from the last time we've seen them, changed by the situations they're in. At the final scenes of the film, I realized how affected I was about its hero, because I've never cried over a superhero film before, it was truly beautiful, Nolan made a thought provoking ending to his trilogy. I'd like to differ good from great, The Avengers for example, is not very deep but was so enjoyable, I was even surprised because it was what I wanted it to be, but the feeling was different, so much different from this film. This film made me want to lower my rank of The Avengers, we'll see. I will definitely need a re-watch.Christopher Nolan deserves a standing ovation, for he had given as a powerful experience, a greater appreciation for the Batman, he rescued this franchise from the hands of Joel Schumacher. He gave us more than what we deserve as film-goers. He gave us a legend. And I hate the fact that there will be another Batman reboot (will they ever end?) in the future, and it may be already underway. I can't imagine a new Batman after Bale's performance and a new director, well I can't even imagine the guts of the person who will try to fill Nolan's shoes, that would be a hard and scary job to do. I'm sure that reboot won't be even close to Nolan's version, well at least don't make it as bad as Schumacher's version.This is a dieted version of my review, because of the '1,000 words' rule.",9,3,7,23 July 2012
Black Panther," A breath of fresh air from Marvel.
","What truly stands out about Black Panther in particular compared to other MCU entries is the large canvas of characters, yet all fully realized with their own goals and convictions. And finally we have a villain who doesn't just show up to terrorize people and blow things up, here, Killmonger's presence is what causes T'Challa to look within himself and realize his weaknesses. It's also a film filled with timely social commentary, a touch of Shakespearean drama, nuanced and charismatic performances from the cast, and an amazing score from Ludwig GÃÂ¶ransson which featured an overlapping layers of percussion. The only downside of the film is the climactic sequence in Wakanda's dark underground vibranium mine.",9,1,3,10 March 2018
Incredibles 2," A little better than the original.
","I was twelve when I saw the original, and I felt so old when I saw Incredibles 2 alone in the cinema. I saw it twice in one sitting because I've got nowhere to go and the film is so much fun and it brought back memories from a simpler time.You can't admire Pixar enough for what they bring, one example: some action sequences here surpassed most of the CGI-filled battles of live-action superhero movies. One scene in particular reminded me of a scene in X-Men: First Class, impressive.The original was smartly written for a family animated film, criticizing American society. This sequel continued and added smart thematics, wonderful voice cast, richly written characters, and entertaining action.Frozone is underrated and needs his own movie.",9,3,5,26 June 2018
