The Blair Witch Project," Boring, boring boring. Did I say boring?
","I agree with another reviewer. This movie is soooo boring, it's just these 3 people wandering around the woods acting scared. You literally see nothing happening, just some moments where you think something is going to happen but then nothing, back to the 3 people being scared and breathing and crying into the camera. The hype for this movie is really when it was thought to have been based on a 'true' documentary. Otherwise, it's really just pointless amateur video recording like the ones you do for drama class. I think 'Naked and Afraid' is way more exciting, and I've never seen it, it just has to be because this is the most boring movie EVER.",1,5,8,18 July 2018
Deadpool 2," Sequel that didn't copy the original.
","Deadpool 2 is fantastically done in that it retained the style from Deadpool 1 but yet not redundant. No one wants to see the exact same thing they've already watched. It's a different story line and doesn't rely on the first Deadpool to make it meaningful. Yes it has a more serious tone overall but still packs a lot of humor that is more mature and less silly than the first. The action scenes were great, and I don't see the CGI issue that some had mentioned. I don't agree with someone rating the CGI being in the same league as Justice League. Justice League was just awful and lazy, no good fight action just straight CGI. Deadpool 2 is not that. In conclusion, I don't like Deadpool 1 over 2 or vice versa, I think they are both great in their own way. And I appreciate that they have independent storylines and have different takes on the adventure that is Deadpool.",10,4,8,24 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Loved It!
","Loved It. Funny, light and different from the rest of the Thor prequel. Has some intergalactic flair to it, great Sci-Fi/Fantasy mix. Rented it again on Redbox and made my husband watch it because he doesn't like superhero movies, but surprisingly he enjoyed this one very much due to the comedy.",10,3,9,27 June 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Silly...
","I think I'm the only one who finds this movie silly. Super predictable and more like a teen flick than a high budget action adventure movie. He doesn't even have his own identity, he's just Iron Man's puppet. All the dangerous scenarios were cliche with Spiderman unsurprisingly saving the day just in the nick of time. No surprising tension there, nor any tension at all. Even the villain and the twist with the villain was predictable. Everything about this is silly. Just doesn't live up to the rest of the MCU films. Bring the real Spiderman back.",1,4,11,23 April 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Exceeded expectation!
","I'm one of the few that don't like superhero movies, except for maybe the darker, more serious ones like the Dark Knight. Although the world seemed to think that the Avengers was top Blockbuster worthy, I found it to be no different than the slew of over-the-top superhero movies before it like Iron Man and Thor. It did not do anything for me.But Captain America: the Winter Soldier is legit. There were no bad guys from another planet with supernatural powers and such, there were just bad guys who were tough to beat. And the fight sequences in this movie, in my opinion, is setting a new bar for the best fight choreography so far. Amazing fight scenes, amazing stunts, and amazing visuals. All the characters were great and believable, and the acting was top notch(considering it's not so much a script movie as it is an action movie). Have to say, love the bad guys in this one. Go see it, you'll have a great time!",10,2,4,13 April 2014
Bird Box," A copy of the Happening.
","Honestly, not that original. Seems like a copy of The Happening except no reason as to why it's happening or what's causing it. Seems implausible as well, like how did they survive for 5 years? How did they raise the children, they looked pretty healthy for how the world is ending? If you ever had to raise a baby, you will know it's tough enough as it is with the world being 'OK'. So many questions left unanswered. None of the scenes made me feel tensed because I kept waiting to see what was actually happening. The Happening was better executed and at least that explained what was happening.",4,1,2,29 December 2018
Justice League," So Boring...
","Expected more from such a big budget title. Not engaging whatsoever with very unoriginal, predictable plots. The bad guy is a shoddy CGI character that does not elicit any sense of tension or intrigue, just classic villain-wanna-take-over-the-world cliche. The action scenes are poorly choreographed with mostly just lazy CGI that couldn't impress an 8 year old. Flying and jumping and shooting lasers, come on. Seems like there was no effort from production whatsoever, kinda insulting to the audience really. Just the overall quality of this movie is poor. And like one reviewer mentioned, Henry Cavil looked off, and so did Ben Affleck. He looked like he put on some weight, and not very invested in making this movie.",1,2,5,3 May 2018
Jurassic World," Thoroughly Entertained!
","I was not expecting much based on the previews and thought that it would be ridden with CGI, but I have to say that I am really impressed at how realistic the dinosaurs look. Wow, technology just keeps getting better and better.I don't get why all the bad reviews about it being predictable. Like what another reviewer was saying, if you're going to see a Jurassic movie, what were you expecting to happen, that they would just clean themselves in a cage? Yah, that would be totally unpredictable.I also thought the acting for this type of movie was very good, especially from the little boy. Also loved Chris Pratt in this, he was enjoyable to watch. I'm not going to read too much into a dinosaur movie, went to see it for the adventure, loved it and my kids did too. It filled the gap that Godzilla didn't, especially at the end. We had fun so money well spent.",10,62,140,13 June 2015
The Croods," Loved it!!!
","I have never written a review on a movie before no matter how good or bad. But this movie really deserves high praise! I had brought the kids to see a few other animated movies before this like Wreck-it Ralph and Rise of the Guardian, but they turned out to be somewhat boring and unengaged. So I went into this not expecting much, it was more for the kids. To my surprise, I LOVED IT! It's different, funny, smart, and adventurous. I found myself giggling through most of the movies and at other times astounded by the visual effects. I also see my kids and other kids sitting at the edge of their seats at times. It is great for all ages. The picture was stunning and saturated with imagination. Dreamworks has outdone themselves with this one. I highly recommend taking your family to see this!",9,62,84,24 March 2013
Black Panther," Not as good as the hype
","I wanted to love this movie but left the theater feeling 'meh'. It started out promising and lively but then got boring in the middle. Just something about it wasn't as exciting towards the middle to end of movie. Unfortunately, most of it was surprisingly predictable as well. The bad guy didn't sell it for me either. I was confused as to whether he was supposed to be fearsome or admirable, or both, but I felt neither. I guess he was supposed to elicit some type of empathy from the audience or something, but his story was sort of weak and didn't seem the least bit genuine. So in essence, wanted to love this movie but don't.",4,0,1,31 May 2018
Deadpool," Pretty entertaining.
","My son loves Deadpool character and I was worried about taking him to see this R-rated movie. But in all honesty, there are much worse that kids nowadays are exposed to (games and movies). Yes, Deadpool has violence and it is a little bloody, but I think the humor really helps to tone down the heaviness. The violence in Deadpool doesn't compare to 300 or Old Boy, which I would never let my kids see. As far as the sexual scenes, there were a couple of scenes and they are far in between. I do think they can tone down on the 'unnecessary' swearing that seem solely there just for the sake of making it rated R. I'm by no means sensitive to it, but just stating there are many rated R movies that definitely can carry the same message without unnecessary swears every 5 seconds that makes it seem more annoying than meaningful.If they do decide to do a sequel, hoping they will stay true to the character's humor and essence. My son did mention that Deadpool in the game was a bit stronger than portrayed in the movie. Most sequels destroy hit movies by trying to overcompensate and thus going over-the-top with bad jokes, story lines, and more violence. More is not always better. This one was nicely done, but can tone down on swearing a bit. Just keep it simple but effective.",8,1,10,7 March 2016
