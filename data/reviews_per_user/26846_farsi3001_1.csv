Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sacha Baron Cohen is a genius
","I, too, caught this early screening in Marina Del Rey. Thought the film was great... the ending could have had more kick to it and been a bit more drawn out, but I was laughing so hard throughout that I barely noticed. Unlike the other comments I read, the nude scenes and the naked wrestling repulsed me. But there were so many other scenes where I felt like I was going to pass out from the pure ridiculousness of it all. Again, Cohen cleverly draws out the ignorance of so many people from the 'U.S. and A.' and we're left shocked, humbled, more aware, and having stomach pains from the hilarity of how he does it. He again proves what people will do for the camera and how people's true colors shine when they meet someone with more radical beliefs than their own. I left the theater saying 'wow wow wee waaaaa'!!!",9,336,620,3 February 2006
