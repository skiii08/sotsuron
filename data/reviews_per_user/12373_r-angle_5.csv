Blade Runner 2049," TEDIOUS, SLOW - NO THROUGH-LINE
","Horrible. One of the worst movies I have ever sat through. 
Where is the lovely noir story line from the original Blade Runner? 
Where is the emotional depth? 
There are no memorable lines like, 'All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.' 
The greatest thing about the original was its theme: 'More human than human....' The androids were more human than the ruthless humans. Not any more. 
Someone actually wrote this script? Where in hell is the story?
There was a love story. Not here. 
Grrrrrrrrrrrr.",1,3,5,30 December 2017
G.I. Jane," MAKES ME WANT TO STAND UP AND SALUTE
","I am a sucker for these military hero movies. Come from a military family myself. 
This movie is formulaic, follows the Hollywood norms beat by beat. 
But it works! Everyone is excellent: acting, writing, photography, etc. 
I'd watch it again. And again. 
Demi Moore, BTW, is perfect, strong but feminine. 
This time, the hero is a woman. 
Hurray!",8,1,4,21 April 2018
The Hunger Games," VERY DISAPPOINTING
","I saw this when it first came out and was hugely disappointed.
It may have gone over well among teenagers, but it didn't work for me.
It seemed heavy-handed, sophomoric, and ridiculous.
America was founded on a revolution against tyranny.
I didn't believe the people in this movie would allow themselves to be treated the way they were.
Come on, people, show some courage.",3,1,6,19 January 2020
Non-Stop," SOME THRILLS, SOME BAD LAUGHS, SOME TOUCHING MOMENTS
","The stupid moments drag it down. The development process felt rushed.
As the cable guide said, two stars.
There are some suspenseful moments and some mystery elements that work well.
It's OK if you got nothing better to do. A few nice twists.
Good acting. As usual, Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore are both good. She has more to work with here.
Not as good as 'Executive Decision,' which is much smarter.",5,0,0,23 April 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," TEDIOUS, SOPHMORIC, STUPID
","I saw '2001: A Space Odyssey' in Santa Cruz, CA, when it first came out. The theater was full of pot smoke and people were oooing and ahing over the very obvious and juvenile symbols. Maybe if you were 18 years old and stoned, the obelisk and the ape would have been significant. But I was 30 years old and had been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. I had a BA and an MFA degree. I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen.",1,7,17,3 May 2018
