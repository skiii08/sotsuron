The Lobster," What is this?
","Absurd. Pointless. Meaningless. No sense. Choose your word to described this weird film. It goes on and on in the absurd as pass the minutes. It is difficult to understand how that good cast get involved in this awful creation. One of the stranger, boring and ridiculous film I have ever seen. Do not waste your time expecting at least a standard ending.",1,2,2,24 February 2017
