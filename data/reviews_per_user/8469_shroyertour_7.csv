Men in Black 3," Excellent - Definitely would watch it anytime.
","I have been a fan of the Men in Black movies since the original released in 1997. When MIB-II was finally out in 2002, I wondered why it took so long as Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith seemed to work so well together, and their characters had that just right mix of complementing but contradicting personalities.Jones has long been a favorite of mine with some other highlight performances being the delightfully crazy villain in Under Siege (1992) and the hard nosed cop in The Fugitive (1993) and U.S. Marshalls (1998). His ability to make a facial expression the equivalent of the picture's 1000 words imho is up there with Humphrey Bogart.Smith has distinguished himself in action, comedy, and drama films alike. He is a quite versatile actor whose movies I will gladly check out just because he is starring.With MIB 3 coming another 10 years after MIB II, I once again wonder what took so long. While Jones's part as 'K' is not so prominent as in the prior releases, he does well as the present day character. Smith follows the formula as 'J' although the interaction with old 'K' is a tad forced.The pleasant realization is that Josh Brolin performs admirably as the past, younger 'K.' Brolin is certainly a fine actor in his own right, but his effective portrayal of Jones' character is nothing short of remarkable. The key to the plot is that Brolin is 'K' before whatever happened that turned 'K' into such a detached curmudgeon.Also juicy was the villain's part done by Jermaine Clement as Boris (the animal).Besides all the action and suspense you expect with the good guys vs. bad guy alien stuff, and the touches of comedy here and there to break it up, there is a dramatic and quite poignant and touching twist that comes out of nowhere that answers why 'K' appears to be such an unemotional person, and why 'K' has such regard for 'J.' Top quality actors and performances, well done script, yeah, this one's a keeper.",9,29,43,15 September 2012
Source Code," Very Good - Would watch it again and again.
","It has been some time since I viewed a movie I could quickly and easily rate as 8 out of 10 stars. This one is certainly it. It has plot originality, almost constant suspense, on-screen chemistry between the stars, superior supporting acting, excellent cinematography... A film like this makes me wonder why I never heard of it before the DVD release.Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan click almost instantly. Jeffrey Wright and Vera Farmiga deliver fine acting in their supporting roles. Not an easy feat since facial expressions are what their characters have to work with in this quite original script.While this is primarily a Suspense/Drama/Science Fiction flick, there is also some action, mystery, and a tad of romance.Gyllenhaal plays a military man assigned to a computer-created reenactment of recent events with orders to discover who was responsible for a terrorist act. Like many science fiction movies, the 'science' allowing this is a little hard to wrap one's head around. Nevertheless, I found myself OK with it, as more and more details emerge about what is really going on. And when the mystery resolves, what Gyllenhaal decides to do with the information he has acquired makes for a very interesting outcome.This is a very good movie and I would watch it again, even knowing what happens. Highly recommended.",Null,0,1,31 July 2011
Salt," Better - Very Good - would watch it again and again
","In my opinion, Angelina Jolie is one of the most beautiful women alive in the world today. As an actress, she has played so many different roles and all so well that she could recite the alphabet and I would be enthralled and intrigued.All of this is to say that she very well plays the role of a super-spy CIA agent in this action/suspense/spy movie. Adding to the value of this enjoyable movie is the fact that her love interest is a very average looking guy (yeah, and a world-renowned scientist). I'll freely admit that I (an average looking guy) am attracted to movies where the gorgeous woman is devoted to such a guy.Jolie is accused of being a 'sleeper' KGB agent and the movie unfolds to reveal what happens next.And what happens next involves amazing chase scenes, satisfying action sequences, and enough plot twists to make sure that even a non-Angelina fan will remain enthralled and intrigued. There have been enough posts about the plot weaknesses in this movie so I won't go there. Action movies generally require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief but this one clearly requires more. Suffice it to say that this is why my rating was 8/10 rather than 10/10.If you are waiting for Jolie to make a third Lara Croft Tombraider film then check out this movie. If you expect your action movies to actually make some sense then watch this one only if you are a Jolie fan.",8,11,22,2 November 2010
Bad Teacher," Good - Would Watch It Again Sometime
","As I have said in other reviews (see Knight and Day), there is something special about Cameron Diaz. Look into her eyes in a close-up...She is not just gorgeous, she is interesting. And she carries this off again in this enjoyable movie. This time, she is not the good girl, or the good guy's gal pal, she is BAD. She throws herself at anyone with money; she keeps her job as a teacher only because her sugar daddy dumps her right before their wedding. She smokes, she drinks, she does just about anything except f--k. She lives with a totally clueless room mate who thinks she is a nurse. Her initial idea of teaching is to show educational movies... all the time.Her goal is to get a boob job (as if she really needs one) to attract 'someone who will take care of her.' Justin Timberlake plays the role of the guy who is as clueless as he is rich, and her target. Lucy Punch is the goodie-two-shoes rival. And Jason Segal is the waiting-in-the-wings would-be boy friend. The actors all play their roles with skill and precision.This comedy should remind just about everyone of their school days and the one (and only) babe teacher who was the object of their lust, obsession, and infatuation. If so, then the somewhat stereotyped comedy will seem a little funnier, a little more enjoyable, and like a film you will want to watch again.Diaz makes much of her great body, acting ability, and a complicated personality to make this a flick you will enjoy, and enjoy again.",Null,1,4,20 August 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Good - would watch it again sometime.
","This movie is a little difficult to categorize. It's part comedy/romance (ie chick flick) and part fantasy/spoof. The premise is somewhat far fetched in that the hero has to battle and defeat the heroine's past seven exes in order to win her heart. And the stars are not exactly well known, except for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and possibly Michael Cera. And there are a variety of characters here. Besides the hero and the heroine, there are the gay friend (well played by Kieran Culkin) and his friends, the band members, the girl friend (Ellen Wong), and the ex-girl friend.It's use of goofy, spoofy, textual, animated, and pseudo-video game special effects contributes to make it a movie you will either like or diss. I come down on the side of like partly because this is a film where the average guy (Cera) gets the hot girl. And by average guy I mean a really scrawny one who nevertheless seems to possess ninja-like close combat skills. And by hot girl I mean either Wong or the one with purple, blue, then green hair (Winstead).To say this movie is a little quirky would be understating it. To say it is a good, above average, movie is not an overstatement. Quirky or not, the actors give performances that are genuine. They are believable even in their rather unlikely and artificial surroundings. Cera in particular comes across as open, honest, and unassuming. A person who is emotionally defenseless; who does not want to wear a mask, but wants someone to accept him as he is, with all of his faults. And an honorable mention goes to Alison Pill who plays the dead pan, straight faced Kim, the band's drummer and another ex-girl friend. Her performance reminds me very much of Christina Ricci's Wednesday Adams.This movie is definitely not for everyone. But if you can give way to the bizarre physical reality and instead focus on the emotional, this is a movie you will enjoy and watch again sometime.",6,3,12,4 November 2010
I Am Legend," Excellent - definitely would watch it anytime
","Will Smith stars in this latest of the several film imaginings of the 1950's novel by Richard Matheson. Smith plays a man who believes that he is the last person left alive after a biological apocalypse that has killed most everyone, and made all those left into zombie or vampire-like monsters who can not survive sunlight.The monsters seem driven to constant violence and cannibalism, and incapable of anything resembling intellect or humanity. Worse, the apocalypse was man-made, the result of viral genetic engineering done in an attempt to cure cancer. Smith, in turn, a scientist, is driven to find the cure to reverse this civilization-ending catastrophe. His own family was killed by the chaos that resulted from the outbreak of the epidemic.Will Smith has made more than enough films to convince me that he is excellent in comedy, as an action hero, and as a dramatic actor. This film is perhaps his best dramatic performance yet.I fondly remember 'The Omega Man' released in 1971, based on the same book, starring Charlton Heston, one of the most popular actors of his day. Heston was handsome, charming, strong, rugged, fearless... everything movie-goers at the time wanted in a superstar. And he played his part that way. He was heroic in almost every way.Smith plays the role in a way more fallible and believable. He treats his only companion, Sam (short for Samantha) his dog, as if she were his child. He talks to himself and store manikins as if the world were still full of other humans. At the same time, he exhibits the same self-destructive actions as Heston, understandable in a world with so little to live for. His efforts to find a cure have yielded no results, but he remains determined.When he finally comes across other survivors, events happen to bring to a head the contrast of his carefully protected and hidden environment, and the reality surrounding him. And then there are the alternative endings...If you see this movie, definitely watch both endings. Watch the original theatrical release ending first. It seems the most consistent with the book.But don't miss the alternative. I will not reveal anything, but watch for the butterflies... the butterfly Smith's kid forms with her hands, the one Sam chases, the one on the sign Smith passes, the shape in the cracks of the plexiglas when the alpha male hurls himself against it, the one the alpha male smears in his blood onto the plexiglas with his hand, and the one on the neck of the alpha female. What Smith suddenly realizes is nothing short of stunning. What he does is fearless. What happens next is positively memorable.",10,3,4,4 April 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Very Good - would watch it again and again.
","Matt Damon and Emily Blunt star in this contrast of a Romance/Comedy/Drama/Suspense and Fantasy/Science Fiction movie. You don't often see these genres combined, but I watched it solely because Damon has a reputation with me of high quality films (for example, the Bourne series and Good Will Hunting).This one does not disappoint. Damon and Blunt have such a chemistry on screen that their instant attraction anchors the fantasy/science fiction plot. He is placed with her for a brief encounter that will inspire him to rebound from an otherwise devastating political defeat, by someone called the adjustment bureau. They are never to see each other again, except that he is so taken with her that he spends the next couple years trying to find her.She meanwhile, calls off an engagement because of her brief but truly memorable experience with him.The bureau's 'plan' does not call for them to be together, in fact, it specifically calls for Damon to be without her, so that his political ambitions flourish.Damon has other ideas, and he is eventually assisted by a bureau 'man in black' with a conscience that the bureau is not used to. The rest of the movie concerns whether he is able to reunite with her.This is a very good movie, and I think you will be surprised at the outcome.",9,0,2,10 July 2011
