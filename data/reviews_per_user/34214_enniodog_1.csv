The Blair Witch Project," Original, yes, but WAY over-hyped
","I concede that 'The Blair Witch Project' is one the most original horror movies in modern cinema, yes, and that it is completely worthy of praise. What I can not understand though, is the overwhelming plethora of critical gushings such as that from 'Mr. Showbiz' calling it 'the scariest movie ever made.'  Does the distributor Artisan Films have these people on the payroll??Sans the thought-provoking conclusion I never got the sense of sheer terror I've experienced in such horror-fare as 'Halloween' or 'The Shining.'  One ostensible source of the audiences' sense of doom in this film comes from the fact that the 3 documentarians can't find their way out of the Maryland woods and somehow every step leads them to where they were days before. Their surroundings begin to look alike.  This would normally be effective in underground catacombs or in a haunted house where an evil force could conceivably manipulate the environment, but if you're in the woods there are some subtle clues which can be used to ensure you're not going in circles. Did it ever enter these peoples' minds to, say, oh I don't know, FOLLOW THE STREAM or USE THE SUN??I shouldn't be too harsh even though it's probably too late.  Given their $30,000 budget the filmmakers have created quite an achievement (the premise alone was brilliant) and given this economic allowance, the film is impressive.  On a Sundance level I understand the excitement, but to say this ranks up there with the best of all time?  I don't think so.  Let's praise this for its originality and creativity.  Not its ability to scare us.",Null,5,13,17 July 1999
