First Man," Superb acting. Poor camera work and rushed in places
",Who can disagree that the moon landing of 69 is a very interesting topic to cover and it does translate on film. You have got to hand it to the actors as they were superb but for me the shaky camera work was a major distraction. There were also some pacing issues throughout the film where it was a little slow without building on the story or characters. Then we get some overly quick timing between being in space and landing on earth without the fear that those astronauts must've felt during re-entry.Don't get me wrong. I am being critical but I did enjoy the film but it could've been so much more in my opinion. A solid 6/10 7 at a push.,6,0,1,28 February 2019
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A great second sequel
","After watching T3 for the first time I thought I would write up my review.
T3 kicks off with an introduction by John Conner describing the way he has lived his life since the last installment, this sets up the story without having to reintroduce his character. This allows the action to flow, and boy does it come at you non-stop, watch out for the street chase, unlike another film that I will not mention, the stunts were actually done for real. T1 was an awe-inspiring concept of a story and held no punches with the violence. T2 was an epical science fiction special/visual effects extravaganza. T3 tends to fall in between in terms of violence and visual/special effects with a hint more humour than T3, most of it blatant.The length of the film is shorter than its predecessor to ensure the film never lets up. The storyline is similar to T2 but has other elements added in to ensure that is also interesting.Overall it's a fantastic film in my opinion, it does differ to the other two installments, but this helps to ensure that things don't become stale, although it does fall slightly short of T2 but not much.",7,0,0,31 July 2003
Blow," A great film about a horrible subject
","I consider Blow to be up there with the Shawshank Redemptions and the Usual Suspects films, but it is probably more reminiscent to Boogie Nights to be honest, with the exception that the story is about a totally different subject, drugs. I don't want to give anything away in regards to plot, but Johnny Depp gives, yet again, another fantastic performance. The directing is superb and the cinematography is good.This film really draws you in and makes you feel very sorry for George Jung, especially as his upbringing was quite hard. At the end of the day though he is a person who took a wrong turn and payed the price.I give this one a 8/10, excellent - definitely in my top 50.",Null,0,1,23 September 2003
