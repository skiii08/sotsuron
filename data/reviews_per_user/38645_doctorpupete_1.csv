Sucker Punch," Bring a script please!
","SPOILERS AHEAD!I'm from Argentina and here this movie was premiered today, one day before the rest of world.Sucker punch has great action, production and music but there's one big problem which is the same problem many many directors and producers and filmmakers in general keep doing: The script is BAD.Today I learned that not even Zack Snyder can save a bad script.The main character gets confined to a mental asylum for reasons that stop being important once she is inside (for the rest of the movie). There, she flashes a weird burlesque world slightly related to the real world. and there, she flashes another world which is pure fantasy. This flashy third world has the cool action that we want to see. sadly it doesn't work at all, since nothing there makes sense. She finds suddenly turned into a super powered chick who fights robots, Nazis, dragons and samurais. Who are them? nobody. Why does she fight them? No reason. What if she loses the fight? We don't know. Who gives a damn then about them? Well, not me. Of course, after we start to see that her actions there mean something in the real world (actually it's not the real world either) but it's already too late. We see the first fight without caring about it since it doesn't have a background at all. And that transfers to all the rest.Some of the actors were good but many of them have the problem of having to act a scene that makes no sense at all and that hurts their performances really bad. The perfect example of this is the doctor that lobotomizes her, having to repeat the 'there was a creepy look in her eyes' speech like 5 times to make the audience believe it.It's sad that all those good action scenes fell flat for the lack of story. When I saw the first action scene versus the samurais (the best one by far) I thought: 'Man!! if I had this one action scene alone at the end after a great movie with good characters I'd been totally happy. No need for more action than this in a well constructed movie.' of course, I was able to think that so early cause the fatal flaw of the movie was all exposed already.Aniway. Nice action and nothing else.",5,118,219,24 March 2011
