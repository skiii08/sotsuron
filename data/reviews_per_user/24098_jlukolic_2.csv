Joker," I have to review a title to complete my profile.
","Joker is easily my favorite movie of 2019. While watching the it, I was reminded of Taxi Driver. It has the same setting and followed a similar character. I noticed the similarities when I rewatched Taxi Driver. I am definitely convinced it was used as inspiration. Still a great movie, with awesome acting and directing. If there is one thing I really loved about the film, it was the soundtrack.",9,1,2,7 November 2019
