Moneyball," Best Written Sports Film
","While Moneyball is by far the most original take on America's favorite pass time, it is not exactly what you would expect from a movie about baseball.Two things Aaron Sorkin knows how to write are controversial figures and excessive amounts of jargon.If you have ever tried playing a video game of baseball with your friends, but then gave up trying to play after you noticed how long they were taking and how excited they were getting to build up an empire in the franchise mode, then you should know exactly what to expect from Moneyball. The language and mathematics of Americas favorite pass time is put before everything including the actual game itself, which is both the solution and problem to the film in general. The writing of the script does not loan itself as much to the game as it does to the politics behind it.Therefore the commitment Sorkin makes to the characters of Brad Pitt as Billy Beane and Jonas Hill as his assistant Peter makes this a lot more of a sports drama than an actual sports movie, which almost makes for poor casting of Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the head coach of the Oakland A's. All Hoffman does as the head coach in Moneyball is pout around the office over every decision Pitt makes, which he does well. But Hoffman could've played anybody else besides the head coach while anybody else, including the actual head coach who was actually considered for the role could've played the head coach because the head coach doesn't really do much in Moneyball.However the story of Moneyball isn't about the head coach of the Oakland Athletics. Moneyball is about the Oakland Athletics Manager Beane and how Beane replaced three key players in his franchise. The kind of pressure that position comes with is a side of the game that fans of baseball do not get to see and either that's entertaining to you or it's not. For me this is probably one of the best written major league baseball movies I've ever seen.Every decision made by Beane is made with an authoritative confidence that is difficult to argue. The only person backing Beane's decisions in Moneyball is the assistant, helping him make them with his thorough evaluation of statistics. These two together are what also makes Moneyball fun to watch for the risk factor involved in every decision they make as a bizarre series of trial and error. With Peter as Beane's assistant and Kerris Dorsey as his daughter, Pitt as Oakland Athletics Manager Beane has more than enough support, on or off of the field.Both of these relationships are what allow us to like Pitt as Beane, an under dog in this game of Moneyball, even though nobody else does. And that seems to be a characteristic trait of Sorkin's hand in script writing so far besides politics.Nobody close to Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network liked any of the decisions he was making neither. But Zuckerberg's decisions are exactly what gave birth to Facebook while the movie about him written by Sorkin got him nominated for an academy award.",8,1,4,27 September 2011
Warrior," Most Contemporary Fighter
","When I had first seen the preview for Gavin O'Connor's 'Warrior' I wanted to say that this is going to be a post - any idea we have ever had of any fighter from 'Rocky' to last years 'The Fighter' starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. Now, after seeing it I'm not so sure if that statement holds the same amount of weight.This isn't your typical fighter. This is also a long distance sibling rivalry between Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brandon (Joel Edgerton). The fighters trade their stories in the same way we've seen done in movies like 'American Gangster' and 'Brooklyn's Finest' only with different bumps in the road that are just as contemporary as threatening home foreclosures and trying to outrun demons, people have recorded and posted on youtube. American Gangster also made caring equally, for both characters so much easier, whereas in Warrior you really can't know enough about Hardy's character.In between these stories is another one about a father (Nick Nolte) trying to rekindle his relationship with these two fighters, but the most I really want to say about that is from the beginning of the film Hardy almost brought me to tears with his first monologue. The relationship Hardy has with his father is what makes his story so much better than his counterpart's. Until then, both men are in training for the main event Sparta that could possibly be fought against each other.With all of that, it takes about maybe an hour and twenty minutes to get to any real fighting. But I think O'Connor wanted to give us everything he had to offer in cinema before this pay-per view. A taste of what Hardy can do in that ring is given here and there throughout, but it isn't until Sparta do we see exactly what we have been waiting for. I don't really know how much more I need to say to tell you that this is what makes Warrior Tom Hardy's film.Man to man, Tom Hardy as Tommy, in O'Connor's 'Warrior' is the post apocalyptic beast that I have always wanted to be.Now, I can see why Christopher Nolan cast him as Bane in next summer's final installment to the Dark Knight series. And by 'Bronson,' Nolan probably knew this long before Warrior. However it's this one that showed me what Bane has in store for Batman next summer. For those that have not seen Bronson it will certainly show you.",7,2,8,24 September 2011
Drive," Breathtaking Minimalist Thrill Ride
","With a pulse driven soundtrack pumping from the speakers of Ryan Gosling's GT, Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive is instantly a contemporary cult classic thrill ride written in blood stains and pink.The color of Drive brings to mind a quote made by Cameron Diaz as the femme fatale in 'The Mask that she addresses towards Jim Carrey during one of their first meetings. It brings to our attention the polluted skies she admires so much for its' accumulation of purples, pinks and greens. In retrospect this quote can now be considered a foreshadowing of what would later become a tradition in twenty first century film.Not only does Refn follow this foreshadowed tradition, but he sets a new bar for it by using this scope to create a new-wave, stylistic action thriller. Drive is a crash collision of vibrant colors inspired possibly by video games like Grand Theft Auto's Vice City, movies like Scarface, and maybe the minimalist script and shot decisions of Andrei Tarkovsky. For those that are unfamiliar with the last name, think of David Lynch or more recent films like 'Enter The Void,' 'Biutiful,' 'Blue Valentine,' or 'Tree Of Life.' The broad pov shot from Ryan Gosling's windshield creates something special. By the street lit product placement of names like rite aid, Ross, and Food 4 Less Refn's Drive puts me in an all too familiar place of oppression. However, seeing it from the perspective of Refn and Gosling illuminates and exposes it for all of its color and possibility. Refin knows how to capture optimism. Its one of those films that makes you proud to be a part of these fluorescent polluted times we are living in.With direction this good, the characters do not need to say anything. Drive's main character has no name. Everyone surrounding him has a name. Some of these circumstantial misfits are titled that way by choice, or just plain circumstances and all of them want some type of favor from our hero. And our hero will do it, no matter how absurd, without any questioning of things like what is in it for the misfit asking this favor of our hero.There are no hidden agendas behind anything that he says or does. Everything he does is done because it is the right thing to do. College's theme 'Real Hero' fits into this so well because it echoes exactly what this movie is all about and that is real people and real heroes. In this way Drive's main character is an example of a cinematic hero that can and should be followed.Less is more in 'Drive.' Their actions in this post apocalypse are what speak volume for their characters. Move over Emilio Estevez and Robert Deniro because Gosling is this years 'Repo Man' and 'Taxi Driver.' And while Gosling is today's hero in film, Refn is our post-modern and apocalyptic philanthropist.",8,8,16,24 September 2011
50_50," Another Bromantic Classic
","In terms of subject matter Director Jonathan Levine's 50/50 is similar to Funny People, minus the 45 minutes they take out to Monterey to see about Adam Sandler's married ex-girlfriend. Subtract that 45 minutes from Funny People and we would've had the pinnacle of comedic drama in what we know today as a bromantic comedy.Besides Click, Funny People allowed Sandler to provoke an eye socket warming cathartic reaction. Now subtract Sandler's sense of humor from that movie along with the 45 minutes he takes aside from the most dramatic feature of the film, which altogether ruined Funny People's chances and you have Joseph Gordon-Levitt with Seth Rogen alongside as a 50/50 chance of landing somewhere closer to this type of comedic drama's intended goal.By now since Inception, and 500 Days Of Summer, everyone likes Levitt enough to not only pay closer attention to such a complex illness, but to also empathize with his metamorphosis from a no license having health nut, to a balding thin medicinal marijuana smoking, cancer patient.Rogen lends himself to this feature as merely a helping hand with just enough comedic quips and antidotes to help Levitt through this illness without letting the audience forget exactly what they are dealing with. The occupations of these characters take a sideline to this disease. Levitt's reaction to this illness is certainly something real enough to set things off with. Cinematically the trip his mind takes over the edibles and the chemotherapy is definitely something new introduced to this genre of bromantic comedies as it is also something enough to keep every one's attention.Funny thing about these comedies that intertwine themselves with drama is how much it constitutes and dignifies what is basically a romantic comedy for bros. Other films of this genre are Along Came Polly, 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Funny People, etc. It must have been this type of feature that inspired movies like I Love You Man, movies like this years' 50/50. By leaving out the potty humor 50/50 is the closest this genre of bromantic comedy has gotten to what it has always lacked in subtlety. Something about this attempt at such a style is what makes me wonder where this type of comedy is headed.As far as 50/50's release in theaters, I say see it, if you've already seen everything else that American cinema has to offer, from Drive, Moneyball, and Warrior. Otherwise it makes for a great date.",6,1,6,4 October 2011
