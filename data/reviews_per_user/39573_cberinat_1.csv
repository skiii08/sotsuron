Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Safe to skip opening weekend
","I saw it at 7am this morning.  No, I'm not THAT much of a Star Wars fan, I just happened upon a free ticket...AND I'M GLAD I DIDN'T PAY FOR ITIn case you don't want to read further, definitely don't wait in line for this movie, and unless you're a really big Star Wars fan, bypass the opening weekend throngs and see it later.Now for slightly more detailed info, but still, no spoiler info...All the bad reviews, are basicly TRUE.  One media commentator said it 'skewed young'.  More accurately, one DJ said it was 'carefully calculated to tittelate toddlers'.  If George Lucas actually decided to make a movie for adults, it would probably be pretty good.  Also, contrary to what he may think, the typical viewer can still discern between live action and computer animation, especially when it comes to characters.  At times, this movie would be more aptly titled Who Framed the Phantom Menace.",4,0,1,19 May 1999
