The Rock," I Liked It
","Alright, I'm a fan of action film and this started it. The Rock (Referring to Alcatraz) is under new management by the famous, Vietnam Vet General Frank Hummel (Ed Harris). His cause is to avenge the men he lost in Vietnam while the government stood by and watched. With him are three or four squads of Navy SEALS, 81 hostages, and extremely dangerous poison gas missiles aimed at San Fransico. A squad is assembled but a guide is needed and a scientist to diffuse the missiles. John Mason (Sean Connery), the only unknown escapee of the infamous prison is to lead nineteen Navy SEALS into the prison to stop the madness. Along with them Dr. Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) is called in to assist. Soon the SEALS are gone, having been slaughtered, and Mason and Goodspeed are left to deal with the situation. The story for an action film is pretty good and the acting is solid. Connery, Harris, Cage, and Morse make up an excellent cast. The film is more focused on the characters then most action flicks and the outline of the actual prison for the location was pretty fun to watch. The film is loaded with violence and language but is needed at most parts to keep the flow even though mothers won't approve. The Rock. Starring: Sean Connery, Nicholas Cage, Ed Harris, David Morse, John Spencer, and William Forsythe.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",8,2,2,8 April 2005
The Mask," Carrey Makes Himself Known With This Film
","Before the master comedies of Dumb and Dumber (1994), Liar Liar (1997), and Man on the Moon (1999), there was The Mask. Stanley Ipkiss is a nice bank clerk but is unable to stand up to anyone and pretty much a pushover to anyone. After the worst night of his life, Stanley's car breaks down on a bridge overlooking the river. As Stanley beats his car he sees something in the water. After retrieving it, he walks home. That night he throws the mask on to his face to scare his dog, Milo (Max) an incredible force overtakes him and his face becomes green. He is overcome with a supernatural power to create things and cause mischief. That night he enacts a little 'revenge' on the mean people of the day including his land lady and car mechanics. But soon Stanley's fun is disturbed when his goofs indirectly lead to the death of small time mob boss Dorian (Peter Greene). Avenge is enacted and Dorian is now out to kill all the gangsters of the city and retrieve this mysterious mask. Along the way Stanley gets help from local beautiful dancer Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz), Max, and Lt. Kellaway (Peter Riegert).The Mask is smart, it's funny, and it's one of Carrey's earliest films and Diaz's first film. The Mask is filled with gags and humorous jokes one of the best being Stanley dancing with Tina and being shot, then accepting an Oscar for portraying the killing. Carrey does good work with Stanley and makes him out to be a total loser with a dog as his only friend. You'll laugh to tears and have a fun time while watching Carrey transform into the mischievous 'Mask Man' and along with Milo once. Some things maybe scary for kids but not intended and humor will quickly follow.The Mask. Starring: Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Riegert, Peter Greene, and Max.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",8,0,0,3 May 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Very Different, Very Good
","(Spoilers)Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the second of two very graphic movies by Quentin Tarantino. At the start, we witness why The Bride (Uma Thurman) is enacting revenge on five different people. After this we have a brief run-in with a conversation between Bill and his low-life brother, Bud. Within a half hour, The Bride and Bud meet. Bud succeeds in capturing her and buries her alive.While six feet under, we witness The Bride have a flashback of her training with the Japanese martial arts legend Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu). After some very awkward scenes we come upon Daryl Hannah's character Elle Driver driving to Bud's house (rather trailer) in the desert. By this time The Bride is out of her grave and heading for Buds trailer. I'll leave it here so I don't ruin it.Uma Thurman portrays the Bride incredibly. Smart, bold, and powerful. Willing to do anything to reach her goal of Bill. Uma Thurman is one of your top actresses in America today. She is sheer brilliant as the Bride and will keep you asking for more with every scene.Kill Bill, although not as bloody, still holds the R rating due to some violence and heavy language. Even though the Bride is the main character, I did not find her to be the most interesting. Rather it is Michael Madsen's character Bud who seems the only one of the five murders to have emotion and regret for what he did.The movie is dominated by Tarantino effects and brilliant acting by Uma Thurman and David Carradine (Bill). 4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",8,2,4,21 March 2005
Miracle," Disney's has finally come back with a hit
","Miracle is, in my book, a great sports film. Disney is finally able to come back with a smash hit sports film. Miracle follows the true-life story of Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) and his team in there goal of winning the 1980 Olympic games in hockey. Standing against them is the seemingly invincible Russian squad who the team must overcome.The film follows the entire team from training, to the cut lists, and right to the Olympics. Instead of a dragging sap story, Disney decides to focus the movie more equally with Herb Brooks and his family and the team and there own little family they've formed between themselves. I'm really not to fond of the sport of hockey but the scenes on the ice are beautifully crafted and filmed. The drama is well-placed and you feel as if your part of the team and feeling everything they do. I really found this movie to be good. Kurt Russell is great as Coach Brooks and he is supported by some great actors as his team and some of the sons of the actual players who won the game. This is a great sports drama, no Hoosiers but very, very close.Miracle. Starring: Kurt Russell, Patricia Clarkson, Noah Emmerich, and Sean McCann.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",7,4,4,22 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Other then finding Anakin, the film is pointless
","A lot of people keep telling me that Episode 1 was a very important and impressive film. How the film works and is just as good as the originals. These people couldn't be any more wrong.Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is easily the worst of all the Star Wars films. The film starts out with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) being attacked after a failed negotiatian attempt with the Viceroy of the Trade Federation who is laying siege to the friendly planet of Naboo. Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon end up on the planet and travel with the most annoying character in film history, Jar Jar Binks to the capital where they meet Queen Amidala. Next thing you know the planet's been taken over by the Viceroy and the Jedi are on Tatooine with the Queen. Soon they find a boy named Anakin(Jake Lloyd) who has the potential to be a powerful Jedi. Then they go to Coruscant and the films dwindles away into a terrible mess of characters and pointless story.So many characters get added that the film is just a bunch of one liners from characters you'll never see again. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are the only actors who do an average job but other then them, the characters are painfully one-dimensional and boring. Jake Llyod is the worst of all. He's so bad of an actor that to put him in the most important role of the film was destined for disaster results. What Lucas did worst of all was not the story but the conversion from puppet use to CGI characters. They're so stupid looking that you can barely watch the stupid things move. A word to Lucas, if your going to use CGI, make the d*mn things look believable. What made the originals so great was the use of hundreds of puppets, including Yoda, as characters. Those puppets were more believable then these new ones.The story is exceptionally weak. Other then finding Anakin, the film has no point. Darth Maul, the alleged villain of the film, makes the least sense of all. He never talks, is barely ever shown and yet is supposed to be the beacon of the villain in the film. So much time is wasted in the film, with Jar Jar, with the whole Gungon people, and with Darth Maul. The film is a complete waste of time. Anakin, if he's going to be young, should have been portrayed by a better actor. If you're going to have a director, don't have Lucas do it. In fact, let some check the stupid script before he starts filming. He makes three fantastic movies, then nearly ruins the two series with this lone film. Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Starring: Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and Frank Oz.2 out of 5 Stars.",2,3,6,19 November 2005
United 93," Emotional, powerful will leave you frozen in your seat
","When United 93 started to be advertised in theaters there was one thing I heard over and over again: 'Too soon.' Many could make the argument for the film being to soon but I do not see it this way. I found the film to be very much needed and a very important film in general. This film shows us that though how terrible the events of 9/11 were for the United States, it also shows how there was heroism occurring during these terrible events from ordinary people who were simply on a flight to San Francisco.The film just follows the events of September 11, 2001 centered around United 93 and its passengers. It also shows in depth the work from air traffic controllers and the military to prevent the attacks though they are virtually unaware of what is happening on United 93. About how the film shows us the passengers and the terrorists on board the plane and what may very well have been happening in ill-fated flight. No one knows for sure what exactly happened, all that is known is that the passengers saved hundreds by attacking the terrorists. I get goosebumps just thinking of the film.The actors are virtually all unknowns. I did not recognize one face in the film but that does not mean it was not amazing acting. The actors bring out the characteristics and realism needed for the film. The actors are practically ordinary people and the people they portray (all real people, no fictional) are ordinary people. No one is made out to be an overarching hero. They simply decided to stand up for themselves which makes the film even better. No fictional heroes makes a better film in any case.There are no sappy scenes. Yes we do see the passengers saying their goodbyes to family members, wives, children, etc but this is all true. There are records of this happening and the film simply tells the story how it was, no matter how sad it is. Trust me you will tear up during this film. I'm 25 years old and my girlfriend is 26 and both of us were still not able to hold back tears. The last scene is one of the most emotional sequences I've ever seen. Just powerful and emotional in every way imaginable. I sat stunned after seeing the film.I only have one complaint with the film. There is a character put on the plane who happens to be German. Well he is made out to be the only man to show appeasement to the situation. He wishes to negotiate with the terrorists whether then attack them. He wants to let them do what they want so they don't get hurt. I believe this was taking the story a bit too far. Details are still unclear about what exactly happened on United 93 and to make a passenger out to be giving into the terrorists I think does not fit when it is clear that the passengers weren't giving into the terrorists and were ready to attack. It doesn't matter if that is what he really felt. They shouldn't have made him out to be this way. They should have just made him to be normal. Other than that one complaint I have no problems with the film. It is exceptionally powerful. I teared up more then once and was haunted by some of the images, including real footage of the towers burning and being hit by the other planes. The portrayal of the terrorists is done right. Obviously they had been corrupted by Osama bin Laden and no jabs are taken at the Islamic faith by the film which is very important. The film shows heroism can occur even in the worst of times. It also shows that when we work together we can accomplish anything. Islam is not portrayed in a bad way and the events seem to be pin point accurate from the knowledge we have.4.5/5 Stars",9,3,6,28 May 2007
Meet the Parents," De Niro and Stiller make it work
","Meet the Parents. Something that any couple does not like doing. We've all had our experiences of bad first impressions, failed conversations, and overall just embarrassing moments the first time we meet the parents. Meet the Parents (the film) takes all these to the next level showing how bad a first impression may get. Doesn't seem like something that can make a story but it holds its own. Just look at the two leads and you'll know why the film works.Greg is a male nurse with a lovely girlfriend named Pam. Greg is considering asking her to marry him. Greg, however, must meet the parents first. He hopes to make a good first impression then do an old school move and ask Pam's father for his daughters hand in marriage. Greg sees this as polite while everyone else sees it as a waste of time. Fate seems to have other plans for Greg as everything that could go wrong does go wrong and he tries to impress the hard nosed father bent on not letting anyone take his daughter away from him.The film follows Greg for the most part as he struggles to impress Pam's stern father, Jack, and caring mother, Dina. Stiller really does a good job as the struggling Greg. He has some great spurts of humor and the pool scene is one of his funniest moments to date. I couldn't have seen anyone else in the role of Greg other then Ben Stiller. He is just too good in these kind of roles. I really do think this was one of his best roles of his career.Robert De Niro is one of Hollywood's top actors. He's one of your greatest actors in history. To see him in a comedy did not make much sense to me after seeing him in films such as The Godfather and The Deer Hunter. However, I underestimated De Niro. He has a great sense of humor and a great comedy style. His seriousness makes it all the funnier when something wrong happens and his constant saying of Greg's last name 'Focker' brings a laugh every time.Meet the Parents is well written, well acted, and well directed. There are a few slow parts and a few unnecessary parts. Somethings you know could just never happen but this is why it is a comedy film. The impossible happens. De Niro and Stiller propel the film to being a decent film. I enjoyed it and like seeing it every once and a while. There is nothing bad in the film. No heavy language, no nudity, no violence. Just good old fun for a family audience. 3/5 stars",6,2,3,16 May 2007
Se7en," A Thrill Above The Rest
","Se7en is on of the best thriller's of the 90's. After Det. Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is assigned to have a new partner, Det. Dave Mills (Brad Pitt) a murder is called in. The two go to the scene to find a enormous man dead, his face buried in a plate of spaghetti. The two investigate and behind the refrigirator they find the word 'Gluttony' dug into the wood.'Gluttony' one of the seven deadly sins according to Christianity. Now the two are chasing the most dangerous criminal Somerset has ever seen, killing according to whomever breaks a deadly sin. It's just a matter of time until the sins catch up with the detectives. The murders are gruesomely portrayed and the story develops around the mysterious John Doe who is responsible for the murders. The story is solid, the acting fine, Pitt and Freeman go great together, and the crafting of a murderer who obeys the seven deadly sins is well crafted from Andrew Kevin Walker.Se7en is smart, it's thrilling and at some scenes stomach turning. Above all the story doesn't fade, some scenes are a bit unbelievable and character development is on par. It's good to finally see Morgan Freeman in a lead role instead of the forgotten supporting actor.Se7en.

The Rookie," A Believable and True Underdog Story
","The Rookie is based on the true story of a 40+ year old school teacher in Big Lake, Texas reaching the majors. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small-town high school science teacher and baseball coach. His team is losing terribly until the team discovers that their coach played in minor leagues and can throw a pitch 98 mph. After throwing batting practice and a wager is made, Jim agrees that if his team wins regional's, he'll try out for the Major Leagues. The movie tells the story from Jimmy being boy to playing in his first game in the majors. It is a great underdog story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the movie worth while, giving an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supporting cast which includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. The story takes a little while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow but it all works in well by the end. The baseball scenes are fun, well-filmed, and portrayed excellently. The movie really isn't about baseball but about one man's quest to reach his dream. It's inspiring, it's emotional, and it's funny. I liked it, I hope you do.The Rookie.

The Birth of a Nation," Surprisingly Good, Surprisingly Accurate
","(SPOILERS)I watched this movie a couple of days ago and I must admit it wasn't that bad. I'm not a Neo-Confederate or Klans men but this movie actually depicted what happened after the war from a different point of view but in actualality never eached the peak as in this film. In The Birth of a Nation the main characters are the Klans Men and the enemy really isn't the blacks but Mr. Lynch a white man who wants the blacks to rule the south.The movie contains no talking but surprisingly there are sound effects. The main character are Lillian Gishes character Elsie Stoneman and Henry Walthalls' the Little Colonel Ben Cameron who is a Ex-Confederate and the Klansmen leader. The battle scene outside of Petersburg is surprisingly realistic except for a scene when Cameron jumps over the mound to help wounded Union soldier and everybody from both armies cheer. Also this is another high point, even though the South was at war with the North, Abraham Lincoln was still a hero to the south after the war; he was there only hope. Most of the blacks in the movie are just white men with shoe polish on there faces and it has some of the worst makeup I've ever scene.What would be considered over acting today is all over this movie especially when a soldier gets shot, sometimes you couldn't tell if Lillian Gish is crying or laughing at some scenes. Even more realistic scenes are like when Flora Stoneman jumps of a cliff, showing her hit the rocks about fifty feet below.One problem with this movie are the depiction of blacks as fools who couldn't talk right and were only down there to destroy white civilization. This movie was an interesting experience for me to see a movie that depicted the Klan as a group of heroes and the great work of D.W. Griffith. The film is racist at some scenes and do give it a sad moment for being the first feature length movie. The Birth of a Nation, Starring Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh, Henry B.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Another Jerry Bruckheimer Piece of Trash
","The first thing I realized when I saw this film was that Disney is running out of ideas for good films. I never thought they would be resorted to base their films of rides in their amusement parks. It's a pirate film with some good acting but Orlando Bloom proves yet again that he can't act. After the daughter of the governor of an island in the Caribbean is captured by mysterious pirates, only two people are able to save the beloved Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). These two men are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Some how they are able to comender a British super vessel able to navigate it across the ocean. The movie just went way to long, topping two hours and twenty minutes, way to long for a Disney film. Jerry Bruckheimer adds tons of corny lines and supposed battle scenes between undead pirates and British Soldiers . Johnny Deep and Geoffery Rush do what they can with the roles they're given. Their are some beautiful filmed scenes of the ocean but their really isn't a story. I guess you could call this entertaining for a nine year old but for anyone else it's just a yawn fest.

The film is a favorite among military cadets but among 'civilians' to. The battalion brings in a lot of humor from the murderous Francis to the anger-driven Dewey Oxburger (John Candy).

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," It really has grown on me
","In the past 5 or so years numerous novel adaptations and family films have come out. Two of the most popular book series ever written, The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, have been brought to the screen and gained considerable amount of praise. I, myself, liked both series of films but doubted that three in a row could be pulled off, especially how close all were coming out. Henceforth, I waited a long time to finally watch The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and when I first saw it, I was a tad bit disappointed but since then the film has grown considerably on me.The story follows that of four British children during the Battle of Britain. Their mother, seeing it to be too dangerous to remain in London, ships them off to the countryside to spend time with a crazy uncle in a large but boring mansion. There the children try everything they can in order to pass the time. One day, the youngest, Lucy stumbles through a wardrobe and falls into a magical land known as Narnia. Soon all of the children enter into the world and are brought into a battle with Aslan, a mighty lion, against the evil Jadis the White Witch for safety of Narnia.After I first watched it I found the four children to be rather wooden. They seemed bored and not familiar at all with the books. They seemed just too boring to be enjoyable or at least main characters for the movie. After my third viewing my mind changed. I realized something, I'm not familiar with British children personality and even less familiar with their acting skills. Once I realized this I realized they weren't at all wooden and boring, they simply weren't what I was used to from child actors. I realized how strong of performances they actually gave, especially William Moseley who I now believed portrayed an amazing Peter.The special effects for the film are tremendous. The visual effects department really out did themselves with this film. They generated amazing animals and creatures for the film that looked entirely authentic and believable. What also made the film is that not everything is computer generated. Most of the characters were in makeup and wore costumes, not lame CGI characters fighting. General Otmin had one of the most incredible looking costumes I've ever seen. I was highly impressed by the art department and effects department with the film.The film is not without flaws. I found some parts to be rather dry and boring especially the early parts of entering Narnia. Don't get me wrong, the set was amazing and visually stunning, the dialog was just a bit bland. Skandar Keynes really did not give a good performance. The kid tried his best but it just didn't feel like he was into the movie that much. He had the same dull expression on his face and rarely seemed to be trying. Moseley did the best of the children actors but even his inexperience showed just a little.Now the film does have several strong points. Tilda Swinton proves yet again she is one of the top British actresses out there and can do a variety of roles, including a pretty scary White Witch. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan (Aslan is CGI) is very good. Neeson shows he has some skill with voice acting. The Battle of Narnia, which is close to the end, is visually stunning and filled with amazing special effects and acting. I love battles in films and this fantasy battle was a rare treat. It was interesting to see animals doing combat (all staged and CGI, no animals were harmed making the film) and seeing the magic C.S. Lewis intended being brought to life with this film.I strongly recommend the film for the lovers of the book. Some people may think it is a kids film and while there are many cute scenes and cuddly looking animals there are several frightening moments and some pretty intense battle violence for a PG film. There is virtually no language, there's a lot of cuteness to the film but also a valuable lesson to also be learned from it. I won't ruin the message though, you've got to watch it. Overall a very good film that could have been better but is still good as it is now.3.5/5 stars",7,0,2,18 July 2007
Happy Gilmore," Funny? Yes. Pointless? Yes.
","Happy Gilmore is one of my top ten favorite comedies and brings out what little humor their is in golf. It's the best golf comedy since Caddyshack (1980) and really puts you in the golfing spirit. Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is the grandson of loving grandmother Gilmore (Frances Bay). He is in love with hockey but can't break into the roster of the local hockey team. After being cut he returns home to find his girlfriend leaving him. After a crazy night with a Japanese lady, Happy gets a call from his grandma saying that she is being evicted.Happy doesn't know what to do so he takes her to the local nursing home run by a psycho orderly (Ben Stiler). Happy goes back to the house to make sure everything is going alright to find the movers playing golf. Happy tells them to go back to work but say that they're on break. Happy says that if he can hit a golf ball past the two guys than they go back to work.Happy does more than that by hitting the ball 300+ yards and hitting two people at the end of the street. Happy, after meeting Chubbs (Carl Weathers), goes to the Waterbury open where he nearly kills his caddy because he thinks he's getting robbed. After winning he is on the pro tour and ready to get his grandma's house back.Along the way, Happy must deal with pro Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), Bob Barker (Himself), and hostile fans who he ends up beating the hell out of. Happy is kind at heart but has problems with anger when frustrated or unhappy. One of the funniest scenes involves Bob Barker saying he should be working at the snack bar and Happy head butts him.The story is just plain old fish out of water story with some unforgettable laughs. Happy's official caddy is the best part as a hobo bathing in the 8th holes pond or washing his underwear in the ball washer.This film is funny, it's attractive, and it really brought Sandler into acting. The golf scenes are pretty well filmed and accurate with real golf. Chris McDonald is sinister as the hostile pro competing for the Gold Jacket and Richard Kiel is hilarious in his cameo as Happy's ex-boss turned loving fan.Happy Gilmore.

Now Parker must decide whether he is to be Spidey and save the day or sit back and watch the city destroyed. The story is better than the first. The idea of Spiderman actually experiencing human emotion is a lot more believable. Maguire is his usual self playing a strong hero and Kristen Dunst as his secret love. In my opinion, this may be the best superhero movie ever made. Alfred Molina I liked more as a villain than Willem Dafoe.Spider-Man 2.

Finding Nemo," The Age Of Animation Continues
","The Age of Animation continues into the 21st century with such film favorites of Shrek (2001), Ice Age (2002), and Monsters Inc. (2001). In each film we find interesting characters, a funny and colorful setting, and creative ideas. But in all of them, the story is set in a different world or different world with little emphasis on how they would react to our world.In Finding Nemo we get that sense. Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks) is the clown fish father of young Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould) and it is Nemo's first day of school. Marlin is a very over protective father of his son who has a shrunken fin. They are living in the Great Barrier Reef and the coral reefs are safe but beyond is unknown and dangerous.After being embarrassed in front of his friends, Nemo decides to swim out and touch a boat to challenge his father. Before Marlin can get to him, Nemo is scooped up by a diver and taken off. Marlin is desperate to find his son and sets of on a long journey to find him and rescue him. Along the way Marlin is helped by Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres) A blue tang who suffers short-term memory loss. Ellen DeGeneres keeps the story of Marlin going with her accidental comedy and their constant confrontations of various sea-dwellers. Albert Brooks does an average job as Marlin - he had the hardest part bearing the full wait of emotion in the film. The animation is top quality and the design of the coral reef, coral reef, and marine fish are excellent. Some of the funniest scenes I've seen are in this film especially the vegetarian sharks and the surf dude tortoises. Each fish and animal is unique in their own way and are design ed exactly like the actual thing they're based off of. The story is funny, especially Marlin dealing with Dory and her short-term memory loss and Nemo living in a fish tank with Gill (stunning voice of Willem Dafoe) and other exotic fish.The humor is top quality and the story is truly a fish out of water story!

Superbad," Dirty, very dirty but did I mention it is absolutely hilarious
","I must admit I wasn't expecting what I got out of Superbad. Seth Rogen is one of my current favorite actors in the comedy genre and I knew he would perform well and bring some laughs but as for the rest of the cast I was hesitant. Jonah Hill was completely unknown to me and I only knew Michael Cera as the cute, innocent kid from Arrested Development. I was very skeptical if they could bring the laughs that I desired. To top off my hesitation to watch this was the fact I am not a big fan of teen oriented comedies. But I gave it a shot and was on the floor laughing.The story follows two seniors who are about to graduate from high school and who wish to do something 'superbad' before they graduate. Both seek to loose their virginity at a party a fellow student is having with the girls of their dreams. They are told to bring the large amount of beer required and both seek off to obtain. What follows is their zany adventure to obtain alcohol and make it to the party all with the help of their friend Fogell a.k.a. McLovin who has an interesting connection with two local police officers.I must admit I was dead wrong about every question that arose in my head when I saw the previews. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are both more than capable of bringing tons of laughs to the screen. Even when opposite of more experienced stars like Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. Cera turned out to be more funny of the two though he is actually the quieter one. Hill got annoying a few times in which I had to turn away in disgust but was fine 90% of the time. I guess it was his whinny voice, it just got on my nerves. The movie really did bring back my high school days and some of the crazy stuff that went on during it. Everything was quiet believable, maybe a little hard to come by but nothing seemed impossible that was portrayed in the movie. I guess that made the film even funnier. Everything made sense (unless you count the crazy cops). It really brings back great memories of times of innocence back when we were seniors in high school. Anyone wanting to get back to those times and remember high school memories way want to check this out.Now the film is really dirty. They say f*** around 190 times and most of the time it's uncalled for or at least most parents would say so. There are sexual innuendos at every turn and sex is usually the reason behind most jokes. Heck the plot is based on getting laid. Therefore I would definitely say if you are a parent don't take your kid to this if they are under 16. They won't get it and they'll just learn a lot of words they shouldn't be saying yet. For everyone between 16-30 I think they'll find it hilarious. I don't know about older age groups though.Superbad is funny though it is extremely dirty. It is one of the funniest films I've seen in years. It is a new teen comedy classic that outdoes almost every other comedy coming out nowadays. The film does drag a little in the middle. For about 15 minutes I didn't laugh but other than that the jokes are none stop. Everyone contributes to the comedy and makes you laugh at least once. Just a great comedy in my opinion and hope you feel the same way. Just go see it, give it a chance and you may very well just like it. Look at me. I was very hesitant and found that I loved it.4/5 stars",8,1,7,28 August 2007
That Thing You Do!," Funny and Interesting
","Meet the O-Need-Ers. A one hit wonder band from Erie, Pa. Or are they the Wonders. A group of four mid-twenty year old musicians in Erie have written what they think is a good song. Jimmy (John Schaech), Guy (Tom Everett Scott), Lenny (Steve Zahn), and the Bass Player (Ethan Embry).After their song, That Thing You Do! is heard by Mr. White (Tom Hanks) he signs them to Playtone Records and go on tour. From this they act in a movie, tour cross-country, have a no. single, and break up. The scenes are filled with humor from Zahn and are captivating and interesting. The whole cast is good, even Liv Tyler who I usually don't like. Tom Hanks made the movie work with taking us through a U.S. for of the Beatles (minus the break up of The Wonders). the movie was a good watch and makes you laugh at some scenes and almost cry at others (actually not really but you feel pretty bad). The movie even holds some aspects of what the Beatles went through: their first single 'Please Please Me' was originally a ballet but sped up by Ringo Starr=Guy speeding up That Thing You Do!). Also, something to watch for is this is one of Academy Award Winners Charlize Theron's movies. That thing You Do!

Alexander," So bad. I'm speechless.
","I was just able to catch another Oliver Stone film, this time it was Alexander. Let me just say, I want 3 hours of my life back. I can't begin to explain how pitiful Alexander truly is. It is just cinema and Hollywood at its worst. It was like watching a horror film. It just shook me up but not in a good way. I was told before hand I'd be stunned. I was stunned, stunned that Oliver Stone directed this piece of garbage, totally inaccurate film that I was told was better then Gladiator or Kingdom of Heaven.The film is suppose to tell us the story of Alexander the Great, one of the greatest military commanders and kings to ever exist. The film follows from young prince to death. We are taken across Macedonia, Asia Minor and Asia. We see the major battles of Gaugamela and Hydaspes. We also are taken into a mental look of Alexander. All is fine and well when this is read on paper but when you see it done on screen, its awful.Everything is way overblown. I know they are fighting in the desert at Gaugamela but for God's sake the audience wants to see the battle not just a giant dust cloud. The acting reminded me of watching a silent film from the 1910's with every character reacting overly traumatic to an action. The sets are so unbelievable. Yes this was the golden age of the Macedonian Empire but nothing was built or looked perfectly as Stone wants us to believe with every set shown.Colin Farrell is not a bad actor when given the right material. He is, however, a terrible Alexander the Great. I believe it is more of the character Stone wanted him to be, not Farrell himself. There are so many changes in personality for Alexander, from gay to straight, quiet and naive to inspirational and powerful, to scared and upset to determined and all mighty that eventually you start taking bets on what his next mood swing will be and what side he'll show. Now I'm sure the real life Alexander had some personal problems but if he saw how he was portrayed in this he'd probably be drawing up plans to invade Hollywood.I've lost almost all hope in Oliver Stone. His films are gradually deteriorating into boring and overblown pieces, nothing like Platoon was. Everything looks to fancy and neat. The costumes are too new, the people are too handsome, the battles are too choreographed. Stone's dialog is bland, boring, and thoughtless. There is either no emotion behind a speech or too much emotion. I can't begin to count how many times Farrell goes to the verge of tears when talking to someone.I honestly have never seen a worse biopic or historical drama. Nothing made sense. I couldn't tell what part of the story was going on with the constant flashbacks and flash forwards. The whole presence of Anthony Hopkins was totally unnecessary and boring. It just added wasted minutes onto the film. The film is so dry at moments I would fall asleep and wake up and they'd still be talking. Of the 2 hours and 55 minutes there is about 30 minutes of battle and 40 minutes of Alexander crying. Good job Stone. You really should think about whether you should ever direct again. I would say no.1/5 Stars",2,3,4,16 May 2007
Troy," Worst of 2004
","I still can not believe how many people continue to actually praise this movie as one of the best of 2004 and an instant classic. Let me tell you the truth, Troy was a God-awful experience. The film follows many like to call what really happened during the Trojan War. Achilles and Odysseus traveling to Troy to help regain Menelaus' wife Helen. The first few minutes of the film are enjoyable with Brian Cox and Brendan Gleeson prancing around in the company of Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom. Suddenly it takes a nose dive of epic proportions. Hector and Paris are on a boat, then they're in Troy, then suddenly we're confronted with Brad Pitt again. Eventually they all get to Troy and somehow, Achilles and his 50 men are able to overtake a beach of near 1000 men. Hmmmmmmm. That sounds real accurate. The whole time the battle is going on, Achilles is smacking around play toys that we are suppose to believe are soldiers trying to kill him. Eventually the story becomes more boring when a love interest enters into Achilles life so some of the women watching the film can be excited . From the first battle at Troy to the Trojan Horse scene, there is about an hour in between where only one thing that anyone cared about happened, the fight between Hector and Achilles.The battle scenes with the large, CGI armies are well done but the up close up battles with real human characters and the corny music are bad. Achilles and Hector's battle is quite bland, just two guys jumping in circles and occasionally swinging their spears. The beahc battle was hilarious watching Achilles kill about 50 soldiers one at a time. Hmmmmm . Wouldn't soldiers attack maybe three or four at a time?The main problem with Troy is almost nothing looks believable. The city walls, the Trojan Horse, and the army sizes for that matter are all way to big. The first battle outside the gates of Troy, the amount of soldiers present probably couldn't even fit into the city itself. Along with realistic is how nothing is ever dirty. We are made to believe that four thousand years ago that everything was kept clean and nice looking. I'm pretty sure there wasn't a Martha Stewart present in the Trojan War to do the cleaning.There is something seriously wrong with Brad Pitt in the film. All he does is talk in a wannabe- tough guy voice that brings more laughs to the audience then fear. I;m not saying Pitt can't act, because he can, he's just seriously miss-cast. I'm beginning to like Bana more and more every time I watch him. He has a sternness around him that helped to bring out the character of Hector, the only character in the film that really was developed at all. Sean Bean is completely wasted as Odysseus who only appears for short periods of time.Orlando Bloom is a decent actor but trying to play a Paris like character had disastrous results. The film is suppose to be about his love for Helen. If love is just having you know what then well I guess they pin-pointed that.Troy fails tremendously. The acting (minus Bana) is awful, the battles are totally unbelievable, and the adaptation of the poem is wretched. Try to avoid Troy at all costs and I do mean at all costs.1/5 Stars",1,6,13,25 March 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Stupid
","The world ice caps are melting, snow is falling in India, and storms the size of hurricanes are forming over the entire planet. Caught in the middle of these events is a lone scientist, Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who sometimes predicts a super storm that occurs every ten-thousand years and isn't believed until giving the most unbelievable proof. To add story they throw in a son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) who just happens to be in New York and is caught in the storm. Somehow, for a son that doesn't listen to his parents, he is able to give accurate forecast predictions and save a few people. The plot is pointless, a massive storm and mother nature being the enemy. The dialogue was lame but the actors did what they could with it. Truly the special effects was the only good part of the film.The Day After Tomorrow. Starring: Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok, and Jay O.

The Prestige," A brilliant film. Great performances mixed with a great story
","I was blown away by The Prestige. I don't know what exactly it was about it. Perhaps it was the incredible performances from Bale, Jackman, Caine, and Johansson. Perhaps it was the well thought out, near perfect script. Or perhaps it was the freshness this film brings to the eyes when first viewed, the same eyes that have seen crap after crap released in theaters. I don't know what it was for me but I must admit I was blown away by The Prestige and I have watched it several more times since first seeing it in theaters that October evening.The story follows aspiring magicians Angier and Borden as they struggle to both make names for themselves and to have the greatest 'prestige' in London. After a tragic accident, Borden and Angier become enemies. Soon a potentially dangerous rivalry develops between the two as both try to discover the ultimate illusion. What follows is a duel story line set in the past, following the reasons for the rivalry, and a present which follows the adventure of Angier as he tries to match Borden. Both stories are intriguing and will suck the audience in as they rotate screen time.As stated above four actors give great performances. Christian Bale (Batman Begins) gives one of the best performances of his career and that is certainly saying something. Bale plays the troubled and laid back Borden who is the cause of a terrible accident that causes the rift between him and Angier. Bale gives a very strong performance. He brings depth and sympathy to the character of Borden which I felt was strongly needed. Bale made out Borden to be exactly what he needed to be, a troubled individual who regrets most things in his life. Hugh Jackman (X-Men) also gives a tremendous performance as Borden's rival Angier. I never thought Jackman much of an actor, especially after seeing Van Helsing, however, he proved me wrong in this. Angier at first is made out to be a good hearted individual with a few flaws but none to serious. Angier goes through a major transformation that I feel few actors could have pulled off. Jackman was able to pull it off and give one of the best performances of his career.In support are the legendary Michael Caine and the beautiful Scarlet Johansson. Both give very strong performances and help the movie be even better. Caine plays the stage director and sort of mentor to Angier. Johansson plays Angier's stage hand and Borden's lover. Both are exceptional actors who gives exceptional performances in their respected roles. Not too much screen time is given to either which is good. I had a bad feeling these two would some how end up in every scene but thankfully that was not the case.The story is easy enough to follow... at first. A major twist is around every corner and will keep the audience guessing until the last lines are spoken. The twist isn't so out of nowhere that everyone will be wondering what the hell just happened. Most people will see things they missed earlier when the twists in the film do occur. The plot is well thought out and flows nicely. There are no dry moments of pointless dialog. Everything is important and needed to make the film work. Overall the film is one of the best written I have seen in a long time. A long time.In my opinion it is one of the best films of 2006 if not the new millennium. The plot is great. The cast is among the best compiled group of actors one could find in one film. The acting those people do is marvelous. Everything looks and feels real and will never have an audience member questioning what is happening on screen. This is key as when a person starts to question things on the screen, the film begins to lose its magical touch. This does not happen once throughout the course of The Prestige.5/5 stars",8,1,2,10 August 2007
The Terminator," Everything that defines a sci-fi/action film
","'I'll be back.' Uttered by the Terminator just before he launches into a murderous rampage as he looks for Sarah Connor, a woman who will give birth to the savior of humanity in the future. The Terminator is not simply an action film. The Terminator is not simply a sci-fi film. It is both rolled into one. However the Terminator breaks away from the norm of all flash and no show.Sarah Connor is a regular woman living in Los Angeles. She's normal until someone attempts to assassinate her and then protected by a man claiming to be the future. The story is pretty much this stranger attempting to protect Sarah from this assassin who says very little. However the assassin is not human, he is a cyborg and the man claiming to be from the future actually is from the future sent back in time to protect the mother of the future savior of humanity against the machines who will attempt to destroy it.When I first read the plot for this I was so confused I was uncertain I wanted to watch it. Finally I did and I loved it and go back to it for a good story. The film could have been terrible. Everything could have gone wrong but Cameron was the driving force behind the film. He makes everything work how it should from the action to the plot to the acting. Everything flows as it should. It showed how much skill Cameron had even in his younger days of directing. (Remember this is 13 years before Titanic would come out)The acting is nothing great. Yes Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton give convincing performances. Michael Biehn in my opinion was one of your top actors in the 80's and he pretty much disappeared. In The Terminator he is cool, bright, sexy, and all else convincing as a soldier turned bodyguard. Linda Hamilton shows how true actresses should act. She convinced me she had no idea what was going on when she first had that gun pointed in her face. Both leads give strong and worthwhile performances.Of course the most famous of the film is Arnold. Cold, cunning, and silent he portrays the Terminator. I really must comment that Arnold barely does any acting whatsoever except for walking, shooting, and a rare word or two. However, it doesn't mean he is a waste on the screen. Arnold, when he found out how little acting he was going to have to do made sure he was using the weapons correctly and acting as much a machine as he possibly could. The story is actually very strong. Instead of no evidence being given of the future a ton of information is given including flashbacks (or would it be flash forwards) of battles Reese has gone through in his life. Nothing is set directly, many things have to be figured out on your own but nothing is really difficult to understand. The plot line is complex and an amazing world is painted around the storyThe action scenes are some of my personal favorites, especially the showdown in the police station. Cameron got exactly what he wanted when he directed the film. He wanted darkness, rage, violence, a story line that worked. However, the film isn't all about action and violence, it is about humanity and how it is destroying itself. He wanted to show what the future could hold for humans with the possession of nuclear weapons and advancements in technology. He got exactly that. Cameron wanted to make as dark a film as he possibly could with top action sequences of the time and a sci-fi world only outdone by Star Wars in a film. 4/5 stars",8,0,1,4 May 2007
Hotel Rwanda," Powerful and Emotional
","Rwanda. A small country in the heart of Africa. Normal government, normal people, normal country. Until the day everything changed. the year is 1994 and Rwanda has fallen into civil war between the Tutsi and Hutu parties of the country. Caught in the middle is a hotel manager named Paul Rosesabagina (Don Cheadle) and his family. At first Paul tries to help only his family but soon finds himself housing over a thousand Tutsi and Hutu refugees in his luxurious hotel. With the help of camera operator Jack Daglish (Joaquin Phoenix) and U.N. officer Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte)he is able to save the people from the rebel army waiting at the gates. But soon Paul along with the refugees must fend for themselves as the foreign troops are evacuated from the capital. The movie is a powerhouse of emotions with accounts of people telling what they witnessed in the town. As the world turned its back, Paul Rosesabagina was able to save 1295 refugees through bribery, blackmail, and favors. Based on the true-life story of the man, the film gives you a sense of civil war and what is currently happening in the Sudan to millions.At some points you truly feel like breaking down and crying as you watch people being hit with machetes in the street and children lying dead on the road side. In my opinion, this is the best film of 2004 and Don Cheadle deserved Best Actor over Jamie Foxx (Ray, 2004) but that's my opinion. Hotel Rwanda. Starring: Don Cheadle, Nick Nolte, Joaquin Phoenix, Cara Seymour,and Sophie Okonedo. 5 out of 5 Stars.",10,2,3,12 April 2005
Gettysburg," Leaves Out To Much Of The Epic Battle But Still Good
","(Possible Spoilers)Don't get me wrong I liked the film but Gettysburg left out way to much of the battle for a great war movie. Set in 1863 as the Civil War rages on we follow the true-life stories of Col. Chamberlain (USA), Gen. Longstreet (CSA), and Gen. Robert E. Lee (CSA) through the three fateful days. The film leaves out way to much of the first day, it only shows part Little Round Top on the second day, and finish's with the infamous Pickett's Charge. If you weren't a Civil War buff (like myself) you would never believe that fifty thousand men were killed at the battle. The film is better than Gods and Generals (2003) but not by much. the film leaves out major engagements in The Wheatfield, The Peach Orchard, and East Cavalry Field. But the film does with a three day battle could be shoved into a 3+ hour film. It would have done much better as a mini-series but what can you do now.Jeff Daniels as military Colonel Joshua Lawerence Chamberlain caught me completely off guard after seeing his work in Dumb and Dumber (1994) but did a fantastic job. The other acting jobs are solid. The on film location was completely accurate along with uniforms and weapon usage.Acting is good, Stephen Lang with a stellar performance. The film is more easy to watch than its successor Gods and Generals and is quite entertaining. Gettysburg.

We Were Soldiers," Excellent
","There have probably been more films concerning Vietnam then any other US war. We Were Soldiers is the re-accounting of the first major US battle of the Vietnam war. Col. Hal Moore (Mel Gibson) is the commander of the US troops and is designated to fly into hostile territory with helicopters, not traditional ways of marching.Within Moore's army, various other characters are followed including: Sgt. Maj. Basil Plumley (Sam Elliot), Maj. Snake Candall (Greg Kinnear), and Reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper). Along with the story of the soldiers we receive of the stories of the wives trying to deal with the loss of their husbands. Hal Moore's wife, Julie (Madeline Stowe) puts it upon herself to deliver the death letters to the soldiers wives. the scene in which Julie and Barbara are delivering the letters is one of the best scenes of the film. The film is 90% battle with breaks here and there. The death of some of the soldiers is very graphic and when the napalm accidentally hits the US soldiers, you almost need to turn away as soldiers skin is falling off. Gibson gives another solid job as a soldier, Greg Kinnear brings some humor but not enough to hide what is being shown. The film is visually stunning and the battles are well done and graphic.

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Just Misses Being As Good As A New Hope
","Star Wars: Return of the Jedi is the third installment (or last depending on how you view the films release) and in my mind the second best. In this epic sci-fi film, the evil Empire finally falls and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally accepts the path of the Jedi.After Empire Strikes Back left off with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) being frozen and sent to Jabba the Hutt, we find Luke Skywalker arriving at the Hutt's palace. As Luke fights desperately to save his friend, the Empire under Lord Darth Vader (voice of James Eral Jones, body David Prowse) and Emperor Palpantine (Ian McDiarmid) are building a super-powerful Death Star to conquer the galaxy. After rescuing Han, Luke and his companions are sent on a mission to destroy the imperial base on the massive moon of Endor which would help lead to victory over the Empire. Instead of following into a circle of good and evil, ROTJ allows itself to develop characters including: Luke, Darth Vader, and Leia. Above all character developments is the struggle between good and evil for Darth Vader, who is stuck between helping his son or destroying him. The special effects are incredible and out do such special effects 'wonders' as Dungeons and Dragons (2000)and Troy (2004). The lightsaber duels are well choreographed and filmed. George Lucas is able to represent the dark side overtaking Luke in his climatic duel with Vader in the Death Star.ROTJ does not disappoint on any level. I, however, do not think that it was as good as A New Hope which was just incredible and fresh when it came out. The magic is not lost as most people thought. The Ewoks were considered annoying little fury guys but I thought they were neat they way they lived in tribes and weren't adapted to the advance galaxy around them. ROTJ will take you on a journey like no other filled with action, love, and drama like none of the other films. Mark Hamill is in top form and a real presence as Luke and leads the film in history as one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made.Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.

Malcolm X," A film of power that gives an amazing look into the man's life
","I had the privilege to finally have the chance to view Spike Lee's film on the controversial black Nationalist Leader Malcolm X. The film is near a 3 1/2 hour biopic of the man named Malcom X who in 1960 opposed Martin Luther King Jr as one of the most important civil rights leader. With the controversial director Spike Lee behind the camera and Denzel Washington giving it his all on the screen, Malcolm X has stood the test of time since its release in 1992 and was a privilege to watch for me.As stated above, the film is a biopic of Malcolm X. The story starts with his early 20's. He is a junkie, a thief, and a criminal in all aspects of life. The film has many flashbacks to give us an idea of his childhood and what he has endured thus far and why he is where he is. Soon he is sent to jail where he maintains his hostility towards life and all other people. But a transformation is on its way, one that will put him into the public spotlight and become one of the most influential members of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960's.Now I usually don't watch many Spike Lee films. I respect his work and I have seen some of his work but I tend to not watch his films. Don't know why. Malcolm X to me is the best of his work I have seen. He tells a story, he doesn't lie to the viewers or tone anything down, he tells the story exactly how it was. This has drawn heavy criticism from the white community which views this film as a tad bit demeaning to their race and along with some racial overtones. I myself am I white male and I did not find the movie to be racist. Yes there are the use of the word n*gger and several other racist names but these are not intended to single out an audience, it is part of the story. Spike Lee is a controversial director because he does not use stereotypes. He portrays people exactly how they are/were in life. He shows that not all white people in life are good, he shows not all black people in life are good. There is no controversy in my mind in this film.Denzel Washington is... how can I put it into words... MAGNIFICENT. His portrayal of Malcolm X is exactly how I picture the man to have been and that is human. A man who had the will to never give up and the ability to overcome any obstacle thrown at him in order to achieve his goal in life, to obtain equal rights for African Americans. Denzel shows all of this on screen through brilliant acting and character typing, something very hard to achieve.At first I found the film to be a bit choppy. One second you're in one place, the next you're some place else. Characters coming in left and right, all within the first 20 minutes. It is quite confusing in the first 20 minutes. I do realize that Malcolm X's early days were confusing and he was probably trying to obtain that with the audience in order to relate to him but I still found the start to be a little much. But after the first 20 minutes, the film is spectacular. The emotion behind Denzel's words and the support of the rest of the cast makes the acting in this some of the best I've seen. The cinematography and sets are top notch in their own respective areas. The film does go slow at a few parts near the middle and the end. It does grab your attention though when it needs you with a powerful montage of scenes to close out the film.4/5 stars",8,3,8,18 April 2007
Nacho Libre," So stupid it's funny
","Before I start my review I would like to say, what was Paramount thinking? Nacho Libre was so bad bad and so stupid, it actually made the movie funnier than it should have been. The story follows a Mexican Priest by the name of Nacho who attempts to wrestle in the local towns arena to earn money for the orphanage he lives at. Along with his partner Esqueleto, Nacho losses every match but earns money as he does it, brining happiness to the orphans.It sounds like a fairly decent idea for a family film. However, the filmmakers are able to bend and twist the characters into such stupidity that nothing makes sense by the end. Jack Black is a good entertainer, I'll give him that but he is just too stupid to be taken at all serious. Some may say I'm being ridiculous because I'm talking about a comedy film. I know it is a comedy, what I'm saying is that Nacho is just to unbelievable and stupid to cause many laughs. Some scenes are pretty funny, especially near the beginning but by the end, it is just so ridiculous that I could only sit in my seat stunned and muttering to myself 'What was Paramount thinking?' Kids may like the stupid antics of Jack Black, he's proved his ability to act with King Kong but doing this film was a serious set back. Don't go to watch this film to laugh at the jokes, but how stupid the film really is. 2/5 Stars",4,0,3,27 June 2006
Battleship Potemkin," Brought about a whole new generation of cinema
","The Battleship Potemkin is one of those few films that can truly be said changed cinema forever. The story focuses around sailors aboard the Potemkin Battleship, a Tsarist ship in 1905. The crew is heavily mistreated and are fed rotten meat. Eventually revolution breaks out and mutiny occurs. The events lead the crew into sailing for Odessa where one of the most famous scenes of the 20th century occurred.Battleship Potemkin is one of the most influential films I have ever seen. The power behind the words and actions of the sailors in vigor the crowd. Any person watching this film could easily see why revolution came about in Russia just from the Odessa Steps sequence. Few directors are able to captivate crowds but Einstein does it with relative ease.The film gave brought forth many new elements to films. Violence is the biggest of all. Films before 1925 did feature violence but in a way in which it did not bother a crowd. Battleship Potemkin's violence is straight forward and overall in your face. The Odessa Steps scene is one of the most violent and saddest scenes I've ever seen. Battleship Potemkin is a film not to be missed by anyone. The story is top notch and based on the actual mutiny aboard the Potemkin in 1905. The acting is outstanding for its time with no central character which makes the picture a lot better in my opinion. But by far the greatest part of the film is the extravagant cinematography and camera work. The Odessa Steps is filmed in such a way to make you feel as if your actually being chased and doing the shooting.5/5 Stars",10,3,4,5 November 2006
Elf," A film that is funny, enjoyable, and for the whole family
","Elf is another family film featuring Will Ferrell. Ferrell is Buddy, an elf raised by Santa's elves in the North Pole. Buddy lives with the elves thinking he is one of them until Papa Elf decides that he is old enough to know the truth. Buddy, after learning that his mother had died and his father did not know that he was alive, sets out for New York City to find his father.Buddy's father is played by the legendary James Caan and he is perfect for his role. Buddy finds that his father, Walter, is not as jolly as he had hoped. In fact the man has made the naughty list from Santa. Family is second to Walter and Buddy is third. Buddy's innocence and carefree view towards life is the only way to loosen up Walter and let the family have its first enjoyable Christmas. Will Ferrell goes along way from his adult comedy in Anchorman to a family film. He is carefree and at a few times you may thinks he's a complete idiot. But his jolliness defines how Christmas should be to family, a togetherness and unity during the holiday times. James Caan brings the same tough guy role to his father role, being the big man in a different way. He doesn't see the importance of family as much as money. His acting is fair with some great transitions around Ferrell, the scene when he convinces Buddy to go work in the basement with the criminals maybe his best acting in the film. As for the story. It's your typical fish-out-of-water story with a happy ending that is always expected. The scenes in North Pole are fantastic, putting the sort of magic behind the time of Christmas. THis film is going to be one Christmas movie to remember. It brings out a sense of importance of family, unity, and brings back what it is like to be a kid.Elf.

Glory," Historical Masterpiece, My All Time Favorite Movie
","(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Glory is probably one of the best acted, best filmed Civil War Movies I have ever seen. Glory is mostly about Col. Robert Shaw of the 54th Mass. and some of soldiers. The movie starts going right into the Battle of Antietam and shows how the South was beating the Union down pretty badly. In the battle the Commander of Shaws regiment is killed and Shaw is knocked out from an explosion.The lead is played by Matthew Broderick who completely took me off guard as a lead for a Civil War Drama. Denzel Washington (who received an Oscar for his performance) plays the young hot head Pvt. Trip. Morgan Freeman gives as what I believe is one of his best performances ever as Sgt. Maj. John Rawlins and Cary Elwes (another comedic actor) plays Shaws' (Broderick) second-in-command Maj. Forbes.Glory is not just about war but the fighting of racism between the all African American, former slave regiment and white union officers. Such as the scene during the winter of 1862 when Shaw requests shoes and socks for his seven hundred soldiers and is denied just because the regiment is all-black. Another scene is when Shaw is assigned to accompany an all black regiment into Georgia. While in Georgia the Union Brigade pillages the town and the commander of the brigade says they (African American soldiers) are nothing but animals and you just have to know how to control them.The whole movie is focused on the fight of racism and the first hour is the regiment getting trained under a Irish Sgt. The ending I thought was excellent but sad at some parts such as when Shaw is hit with the mini ball while trying to rally his men at Fort Wagner. Everything in this movie seemed to look real except the ships in front of the Fort. The battles were well done and the acting is amazing. A must see for a Civil War Buff or anyone who just wants to see an amazing movie. 5/5 Stars",10,0,0,26 July 2003
Forrest Gump," Brilliant in every sense of the word
","Forrest Gump is truly a magical film or creativity and imagination. Portrayed by a soon to be superstar in Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump brings out the innocence and beauty of life. It is a story so compelling, so well thought out and so brilliantly portrayed it goes down in history as one of the most imaginative films of the 20th century. Forrest Gump is a boy with a very low I.Q., 75 to be precise. All he is trying to do is to go through life and be happy. Forrest never registers much, he takes in a lot and is always looking to be nice to anyone he comes across. Always an entertainer he is capable of a great story which you'll see right off the bat. The movie of Forrest Gump is not really a story but more of a biography of a fictional character. It is brilliantly done.Tom Hanks has grown to be one of the best actors in Hollywood. His sense of character development is beyond belief. He is able to take a pretty much simple character as Forrest Gump is and make him into one of the most interesting characters in the past 20 years. His sheer genius and comedy made the movie what it is today and that is a classic.Gary Sinise adds a very strong supporting role as Lt. Dan who is an old military 'buddy' from Vietnam. A lot of the mid story of the film follows the friendship that kindles between Forrest and the stern Lieutenant Dan. Sinise does some amazing work and is a highly underrate actor. He brings the fear of life to his character and when him and Hanks are on screen together, it is some of the best acting in the film.The film has gone down in history as its amazing presentation of historical events with a character from the movie in them. Forrest goes through a variety of events including: Vietnam, the Watergate Scandal, meeting John Lennon along with some other events of history. Along with Hanks acting, the special effects used to put characters in those events captures a lot of people attention and interest.Forrest Gump should not be missed. It's funny, it's smart, it's brilliantly acted. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll have a good time. Don't miss Forrest Gump.5/5 Stars",10,3,8,23 February 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Very good. I wasn't as impressed as most people but I still liked it
","I thoroughly enjoyed the third installment of the Bourne films. Most people I know who have seen it are praising it as one of the best action flicks of the summer and they are correct. This puts most other action films in the past few years to shame. It's a great action film that is very well thought out. It's enjoyable to watch, very entertaining, and completes a story most of us have been following the past 5 years. Beside that I didn't find anything that special about the Bourne Ultimatum beside that is was a way better action flick then what usually comes out nowadays and it was a bit smarter then most.The film completes the Jason Bourne saga. Yet again Jason Bourne, who continues to suffer from a case of amnesia, travels across Europe and the United States, trying to evade CIA agents who want him dead, in a quest to discover who he is and what his past is. Along the way he is helped by a former colleague, Nicky Parsons, and gains a very unexpected ally. The Bourne Ultimatum jumps around like both other films taking us to various locations throughout the course of the film.Yet again the Bourne films do not disappoint. Ultimatum has the same great action sequences that its two predecessors had. No one will be disappointed by the flash it brings to the screen. The story is again very good though I won't say it is as good as The Bourne Identity in terms of script. A few things didn't work for me plot wise but most weren't too major of problems. The cinematography is done wonderfully, the dialog is well written, and the interaction between actors is very good.Matt Damon, yet again, gives a great performance as the amnesiac Jason Bourne. He brings out all of Bourne's traits: very very smart, strong, good fighter, and above all, without a clue on his past. What I was glad didn't happen is at the end when Bourne learns about his past Damon didn't have his character break down crying or anything. I don't know if this was Greengrass's choice or Damon's but thank God that he didn't start crying. One thing about Bourne that makes him so interesting is his lack of emotion toward almost everything.A few problems I had with the film. First off, someone has got to show Greengrass how to work a tripod. The film is WAY to shaky at unnecessary points. I can understand during a chase or fight sequence but when a character is meeting another in a café and the camera is swinging wildly it was too much. I know the director is trying to make us feel as if we are there but it was totally unnecessary to have the camera moving so much. Second, lack of buildup. There is practically no build up to the end. Something happens then it is over. The movie is well paced then at the end everything seems to get rushed as all lose ends are tied up. I was a bit disappointed with that.Everyone should go see The Bourne Ultimatum if they want to see it. One may use the excuse that not seeing the previous two films may make things almost impossible to understand in the third installment. My brother had not seen the middle film and still understood everything that was going on. It is very easy to follow though I do suggest you watch the first. Pretty much an amnesiac being chased by the CIA for reasons unknown as he tries to discover his identity. It has some great action scenes, a great story, and some great characters (with great acting behind them). Highly recommended.3.5/5 stars",7,1,2,9 August 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The first of three classics
","The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a film that accomplishes what it originally set out to do. That is to bring to life the books as never before seen and as readers always imagined them to be. Under the direction of Peter Jackson and with the help of a fantastic cast, The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the best films of 2001 and one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen.For those that have not read the books, the story focus' around the discovery of the One Ring and how a fellowship is formed to destroy it. The One Ring, if in the hands of the dark entity Sauron, could overthrow the world of Middle-Earth. A group of nine is formed of hobbits, a wizard, two men, a dwarf, and an elf. The journey they will have and the dangers they will face are near incredible.Now from reading the plot line and kinds of characters presented many would think this film was made for children and is real corny. it is anything but corny and hardly a children's movie. First off, the battle scenes are amazing. The filming and direction used in the scenes are spectacular where most can watch with the presence of little blood but still not be disappointed with the action presented.What is done exceptionally well is how easy the story is able to be understood and followed. With that being said, Tolkein's story is barely changed and what is left out are only the parts that have nothing to do with the story. The story is truly brought to life. The casting was the most important part. If actors such as Brad Pitt and Matt Damon were portraying the characters of Aragorn and Legolas then the film would have failed mostly by their popularity. The film takes many relatively unknown actors, as Star Wars did, and lets them be the stars. This works to the audiences advantage by not knowing the actors you are able to focus more on the story and not on the actor portraying the characters.The visuals are incredible. The sets used, and yes sets not CGI stages, are believable and great care is taken to make them look as real as possible. The Shire, Rivendell, and Lothlorien are breathtaking. What visual effects that are used are few and far between and don't take anything away from the story. The effects aren't over done or used.The Lord of the Rings: THe Fellowship of the Ring is visually stunning, it is well acted, and is directed by the next great director of our time. I applaud Mr. Jackson for finally bringing the books out of the cartoon world and into the light they deserve. 5 out of 5 Stars",10,1,2,11 June 2006
The Village," Chilling and Smart. Almost as good as the Sixth Sense
","The Village is yet another horror, suspenseful film by up-and-coming director M. Night Shyamalan. The movie will keep you thinking and is brilliantly acted and written for a horror film.Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)is a villager in a small, secluded, 19th-century town and is one of the better folk. The village is located in a valley surrounded by forest, and the villager's aren't allowed to stray from it. The forest is filled with creatures, deadly and vicious and if villagers stray into the forest they'll be killed. After the death of a villagers son, Lucius sees it ridiculous that they don't try and reach the outside towns for medicine. He is denied but an act of defiance would lead himself and his village into chaos and to the truth. Shyamalan is continuing to prove that he is a top director and an incredible storyteller. Phoenix is a bit wasted but Bryce Dallas Howard makes up for it as his blind and caring girlfriend, Ivy. Adrien Brody, however, is over-the-top brilliant in his role as the mentally-disturbed Noah.The end will catch you completely off-guard (what a surprise for Shymalan) and is thoughtfully placed. The story is just as good as Signs (2002) and is nearly as good as the Sixth Sense. It's a very good film, nothing special but still a pretty good thriller and horror film. The Village. Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrien Brody, and William Hurt.3 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",7,0,1,7 June 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," One of the best dark comedies around
","Little Miss Sunshine is a little drop of sunshine of 2006. With a year that saw some of the best films to be released in awhile (Snakes on a Plane, The Wicker Man, and Bloodrayne just to name a few) Little Miss Sunshine stands helplessly against these awesome films. Little Miss Sunshine is a smart, delicately crafted, dark comedy about the common dysfunctional family of America. Olive is the only normal one of her family. Her brother has taken a vow of silence, her father is constantly obsessed with succeeding, her grandpa is a heroine addict, her uncle is suicidal, and her mother just tries to live through it all. All their personalities are thrown together when they must reach Los Angeles to get Olive to a beauty pageant.The story is very strong when presented with the right characters and actors. For an independent film, the strong cast brought together of no names and big stars a like is surprising. The story, which is predominantly inside the VW bus the re driving cross country in. There are no dull points however even with the characters restricted to their seats. There are some hilarious moments of awkwardness and just flat out funny scenes between Alan Arkan and the rest of the cast along with one particular classic moment between a cop and Greg Kinnear on the highway.Steve Carrell gives, in my opinion, his best performance to date as the laid back suicidal uncle. Everyone thinks of Carrell as a no-talent actor who just does comedy. It's a bad trend going on these days thinking comedy actors can not act. He proves with his role as Frank that he can act and still be funny.Alan Arkan is not an actor well known to me, I remember him from And Starring Pancho Villa As Himself but that was about it. Alan Arkan's character is the best of the film. He is dirty, he is strange, and he is hilarious. I wouldn't mind seeing Arkan in a lot more roles in the future.All the actors deliver great performances along with Carrell and Arkan. The little girl, Abigail Breslin, gives a great performance that has earned her an Osar nod. A lot of adults and teenagers a like will enjoy the dialogue between many of the characters and learn a lesson or two about being a family. Warning: this is not a film for families. The word f*ck is present numerous times. Do not show to kids under 14.Little Miss Sunshine. 4.5/5 Stars",9,4,8,22 February 2007
"I, Robot"," A loud, fun, action packed sci-fi flick that is over all very smart and very fun
","I, Robots is the first sci-fi film I've seen in the past month I've liked (beside Star Wars III) and can't say I've seen much better. It has some great action, some eye-popping special effects, and a great story line. Det. Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a police officer in the Chicago Police Department. The year is 2035. All around him are artificialy intelligent robots whom Spooner find to be annoying and useless. After he is called to the scene of an apparent suicide by famous Dr. Lanning (James Cromwell), Spooner must figure out a way to convince the police force that somehow robots are involved.Along the way he'll receive vital help from Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) and the key suspect in the suicide/possible murder,a friendly robot by the name of Sonny (voice of Alan Tudyk) who has adapted into a mind which corresponds to that of a human. The action is well placed and with Will Smith in the middle of it makes it even better. The film turns into more a mystery/action film halfway through and it is able to remain smart and quite enjoyable.The drama is very good. Will Smith seems to be able to bring the emotional parts needed with help from Bridget Monyahan and Alan Tudyk. The sci-fi setting is present but not nearly as much as in such films as the Matrix and Star Wars. Instead of having a bunch of unbelievable fight scenes and long, boring speeches I, Robot is able to bring a mixture of mystery, action, drama, and sci-fi into one incredible movie. Alan Tudyk is far by the top actor in this film with incredible voice acting and holding most of the emotional drama in him. His character is stern yet kind, powerful yet loving. He is by far the best character and the best acted.I, Robots is a top sci'fi film. The part I liked most about it is that it isn't set so far into the future that no of us have any idea what's going on. Instead it's set right around the corner in the future in the year 2035. What I said before the film is well drawn out, the action is well placed, and the end is a big surprise in my book. I liked this film a lot and hope that more films of equal or greater caliber are able to be directed by Alex Proyas. No matter what anyone says this is a great film, I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good old mystery.I, Robot. Starring: Will Smith, Bridget Monyahan, Alan Tudyk, and Bruce Greenwood.4 out of 5 Stars.",8,0,0,19 July 2005
American Beauty," A Triumph
","In the world of Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey)everything truly sucks. Lester is a mid-forty magazine writer. His wife is an unsuccessful Realtor and his daughter is secluded, strange girl planning on running a way. Soon Lester finds himself in a midlife crisis, his wife in an affair, and his daughter in a relationship with the pot smoking neighbor Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley). But instead of Lester becoming depressed, he blackmails his boss and quits his job, goes to work for a fast food chain and buys the car of his dreams. lester is having the time of his life. But after a while, Ricky's father Col. Frank Fits (Chris Cooper) begins to notice somethings up with his son and Lester.The movie intertwines all the characters introduced into a well-rounded drama/comedy masterpiece. Spacey is excellent as a mid-life crisis father in love with his daughters best friend and trying to take hold of his life. Benning does a fine job as his wife and Bentley as the drug lord, teenage neighbor. The movie is a little different and your say after seeing this 'Wow!' or 'What the f***!' The movie holds a very deep message, one that can only be seen when watching it.American Beauty. Starring: Kevin Spacey.

The Alamo," Above Average Epic With Historical Accuracy
","Another version of the Alamo battle has been released and this is it. The Alamo recreations of the past in such films as The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory and John Wayne's version have both been very popular but just touch base on the facts.The story is the one we learned in grade school. Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton has come to the Alamo so he can earn a piece of land once the war for Texas independence is won. He is now under the command of Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) and William Travis (Patrick Wilson) and is defending a small, unfinished mission near San Antonio. Slowly Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) makes his away across Texas but is not permitted by the government to make an attack on Santa Anna's forces. Slowly the Alamo is surrounded and violent skirmishes occur around it. Eventually an all out night-charge is called on and the Alamo is overrun. The same story but it is done a little more interesting this time with better acting. Instead of young Alec Baldwin as Travis we get small time actor Patrick Wilson and does a fine job. Billy Bob Thornton does a fine job after his disastrous Bad Santa (2003) and really brings out the character of Davy Crockett never really done before. The battles are nicely done: not to much gore, believable deaths, and good visuals. Filmmaker John Lee Hancock brings out a fine Alamo film which is just short of being a great film. Now some accuracies brought out. Unlike most films showing the bed stricken Bowie standing up and firing off shots then swinging his knife, Bowie is finally made out to what actually happened, not being able to stand up and barely able to move. It is quite sad actually. No 1459 Mexicans are killed in this which makes it much better than the 1987 version where a bullet is fired and it kills ten guys. In actuality, historians believe that around two hundred Mexicans were killed, double that wounded.The movie is very good. It has some good action and some fine acting. The plot is thin at a couple of points and Santa Anna is made out to be a Bond villain but it's fine. It is well worth a trip to the video store.The Alamo.

The Patriot," No Braveheart but still is enjoyable
","The Patriot is yet another war-epic by acclaimed acotr/director Mel Gibson. Set during Revolutionary War, Gibson portrays fictional militia leader Ben Martin driven to war by the loss of a son by British soldiers. Now, Martin will stop at nothing to defeat the invading British and save the young country.The Patriot is not exactly original. It follows the same reasons for a man going to war as Braveheart did with Gibson in the lead. Gibson isn't bad, his character isn't exatly an easy one to play but he's played it before so it comes naturally. He is able to portray a lovable father and military man at the same time which is often hard to do.Jason Isaac's plays the British colonel responsible for Martin's son's death. He is superb. he's cunning, he's full of hate, and is easy too hate. You are able to relate to the hatred felt by Martin very easily. He does by far the best job of the actors.There are some problems to the film. The innacuarcies are numerous whether it concerns the battles represented or characters in general. What bothered me the most are characters not taking enough things serious. For example the militia destroy the vessel outside of Cornwallis' estate and Colonel Tavington just drinks up watching it even though the colonial militia is right outside their door. There at war for God's sake. However even with the inaccuracies and the characters being a bit too one-dimensional it does give an excellent story to its audience. The battle scenes are visually stunning and suspenseful. The film shows us the 'honorable' way of fighting in lines of men facing each other and firing until either line retreats or is destroyed. It is quite interesting really to watch the old style of fighting and compare it too war of today. The film, in the end, portrays the message of taking war-fare to far and freedom. The drama is very good and villain is top-notch. Hopefully it's entertaining for you, it certainly was for me.The Patriot.

The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Solid film. Shows Carrell has talent and that the rest of the brat pack is just as good
","The 40 Year Old Virgin is one film I've been wanting to see for sometime now. I've been a huge fan of Carrel since seeing him in Bruce Almighty and The Office (US). Carrel has shown his talent through his various projects over the past two years and The 40 Year Old Virgin was the one that first brought him to the public. Let's face it, The Office wasn't well liked in the US until '06 and he had a small role in Bruce Almighty. I went in with high hopes for Carrel and The 40 Year Old Virgin and I must say I was not disappointed.The film follows that of Andy Stitzer, a well meaning electronics store worker. Also working at the store are his three good friends: David, Jay, and Cal. One night while playing poker, his three friends discover that Andy is still a virgin and take it upon themselves to help their good friend to lose his virginity. Andy is very reluctant and confused by the whole ordeal but goes along with his friends not exactly knowing what to do or even if he really wants to.4/5 Stars Carrel really does show his talent off in the role of Andy Stitzer. He brings out the character of Andy very well. He shows that Andy is a very innocent, very pleasant individual who is well meaning and really a new-bee to the whole situation on the more physical aspects of relationships. Andy is meant to be a sweet guy and Carrel makes him that relatively easy while bringing tons of laughs. An overall very strong performance from Steve Carrel.In support are three great actors: Paul Rudd (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy) Romany Malco (Blades of Glory) and Seth Rogen (Knocked Up). All three attempt to give Andy advice the whole movie and all three make hilarious remarks and have memorable scenes. Seth Rogen really helped his career by taking a supporting role in this, now he's in the biggest comedy of 2007. Paul Rudd has always been hilarious and he holds nothing back as the goofy and ex-girlfriend obsessed salesman. Romany Malco is rather new to me though he was hilarious throughout the film yet still the least funniest of the three friends. Overall a good combo to play the three friends.What makes me like The 40 Year Old Virgin is how much unsuspecting humor there is throughout the film. A good portion of the film was improvised by the actors and this makes for the best humor I think. Also the film is very wise. It doesn't have too many 'dirty' jokes and the ones that are present aren't exactly overly offensive. The jokes are well thought out and, while the language is strong, there is nothing else to really turn a person away. There is barely any potty humor and most of the jokes come from the character Andy's inexperience and failure to understand certain things about women.Carrel really breaks through with The 40 Year Old Virgin. He is quickly becoming a star in Hollywood with his role on The Office and Little Miss Sunshine. He really gives a lot of laughs in the movie and with the help of a strong supporting cast, makes the film work. The writing is very good, the directing is solid, and the actors are top notch. I had a great time watching this though the first 20 minutes I nearly fell asleep. The rest of the film is golden though and will keep people laughing until the end.",8,3,6,16 July 2007
Spider-Man," A bit corny at some scenes but pretty good overall
","When I first saw Spider-Man I had a good time and walked away happy. But now after seeing it again last night on TV I'm a bit disappointed. Spider-Man is the story based of a comic book about Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a nerd living in New York, being bitten by a genetically altered spider and receiving special, spider powers from it. While Parker deals with his new found powers he must deal with the growing menace of the Green Goblin who may very-well turn out to be closer to him then he could ever imagine.The film is visually stunning with Spider-Man swinging through New York and some special-effects. But as the visuals and effects triumph some weak story-telling and little character developments hit the film hard. The whole film I felt that Mary Jane Watson(Kristen Dunst) was a complete waste and just ridiculous when all of a sudden a complete stranger is helping her and the very next scene she's making out with him. Tobey Maguire is pretty tough and pretty cool. He brought out the real dorky side needed to make Peter Parker a successful character. Above all Willem Dafoe (Norman Osborn/Green Goblin)and J.K. Simmons (J. Johan Jameson)was excellent. All the actors acted pretty well and brought a sense of feeling to there characters. I don't blame Dunst entirely for the weak job as Watson, I just always imagined her being just a bit smarter (ex: she begins to walk down a back alley in the pouring rain at midnight not expecting to encounter any trouble) and having more of a role then just being the love connection to Parker.Another problem was why they made the Green Goblin out to be the villain. With all of the great villains in Spider-Man comics (ex: Venom and Electro) they choose the Green Goblin. they did follow what the Green Goblin did in the comics but it would have been a lot cooler if Venom had been the villain. Venom was just awesome and truly frightened me as a kid.But Spider-Man brought back the genre of super hero films and Spider-Man 2 turned out to be one of the best super hero films made. Spider-Man isn't a bad film but it does get pretty corny at some scenes including the fight scene along the bridge. But the acting is strong and Willem Dafoe brings it from me not recommending it.Spider-Man. Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kristen Dunst,James Franco, and Rosemary Harris.3 out of 5 Stars.",6,0,0,19 June 2005
Jarhead," Disturbingly accurate and realistic
","Most war films of today are constant action. Battle after battle with every main character surviving and celebrating after making tons of kills in combat. This is the common look at war by today's standards of war from the past 100 years. All action and nothing else. Jarhead takes this myth and flushes it down the toilet and tells everyone how it truly was and shows us all war is hell without the use of combat or amazing special effects.The film follows a platoon as they enlist in the army and head off to participate in Operation Desert Shield and eventually Operation Desert Storm. Most enter thinking they are going to get that big kill and have the time of their life in Iraq. What they don't count on is censorship of views from the military, 100+ degree heat, and overall boredom. They all simply sit around under constant watch from Staff Sergeant Sykes as they wait for combat that they begin to believe will never come.What Jarhead does that so many other films don't is show what war is actually like. It gives a viewer a believable look. Instead of landing in Iraq and the very next day gunfire erupts, it is landing in Iraq and waiting and waiting and waiting. This is not a bad thing if you are thinking that. It shows us the life of a Marine during this waiting period. What he does to pass the time, the sense of brotherhood between the men, and the lack of seriousness from some of the more carefree recruits. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers, in my opinion, the best and most believable performance of his career as the lead character Swofford, the newest to the platoon and the one looking for the kill he wants so badly to have. He acts normal. He isn't some amazing hero or sophisticated soldier who is smarter and more understanding then the rest. He has his faults, he has a personality, he has a view on war and on life. He isn't some brain dead soldier who acts as if they are on a walk on the beach when war is going on like other movies make leads out to be in war. Peter Sarsgaard delivers a strong supporting actor job as Troy, Swofford's good friend and spotter (Swofford is a sniper). Like Gyllenhall, he delivers a believable and strong performance as a Marine in the Persian Gulf War. He's more of the understanding kind of soldier but still he has his faults. He is just a believable soldier who has a bit of a chip on his shoulder and understands a little more of what is going on then the rest. Many could say this is a typical kind of character found in a war, the understanding man who tells everyone off. Well I say to them that just because this kind of character is found in every film following war doesn't mean there aren't any in real life (Jarhead is based on fact too, Swofford wrote the book).Jarhead toys with the audience a lot in the view on the war. Going off to war seems like such an exciting time for the troops when news comes. They watch old war films about Vietnam and celebrate and dance and just screw around. We are made to believe the war is going to be a cake walk with no casualties and just a good old time for the troops. The second half of the film flips the view completely with the reality of bombardment from enemy mortars, walking through the burning oil fields, and coming across the countless civilian casualties sustained during the war. It's reverse psychology at its best. It makes us believe one way with one support for it and then changes are view completely with a hundred arguments against it.I have very few complaints on this movie. The language is very very heavy but that is to be expected. It's war, all the soldiers are barely 20, and they are all trying to sound cool and tough in front of everyone else. The film shows us the true brotherhood of the military, particularly the Marines. We see some of the practices and initiations of a platoon and views on officers and war in general. This is far by the strongest part of the film with all the in depth look at the Marines during Operation Desert Shield and Storm.Overall, Jarhead is disturbingly realistic. It isn't constant battle and carnage. It is the war being fought in one's mind. How a man handle's himself when looking upon a charred corpse. How a man reacts when a girl friend breaks up with them in the middle of war. It takes a more human look at war which hasn't been done since Gallipoli was released back in 1981. It is filled with strong sexual references, heavy language and isn't for anyone under 16. However, anyone over that age will love a great film on the human mind during warfare.4.5/5 Stars",9,4,7,10 May 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A Few Minor Changes Have No Affect. It's Still Good.
","The Prisoner of Azkaban is the third installment of the Harry Potter books turned into a movie. With a new director, some mite say the film would be destined to fail but in my book, it's honored the book memorably. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is yet again returning to Hogwarts for his third year at the magical school. Topping the wizard headlines is that the dangerous wizard criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Harry thinks little of it until it is revealed that Sirius is after Harry, Harry must do his best to remain calm and deal with idea of the man responsible for his parents death coming after him. To help with Harry's problem are his everlasting friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) along with their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). Eventually the dark past of Harry's life would reach him again as the vile Sirius Black closes in to finish his work. With a new director in Alfonso Cuaron some things are changed and others shifted around. Hagrid's hut is moved to a different location and some darker features are added to the castle. The story is darker then the previous two and makes it a bit more fun. The kids act as they usually do and show they each have promising careers after the long series is completed. The special effects are sometimes over-used and sometimes distract the viewer from the story. One big and obvious replacement is that of the late and honorable Richard Harris being replaced by Michael Gambon as Professor Dumbledore. Dumbledore's character isn't focused on as much and doesn't really have any effect on the film. Gambon has proved though that he is an honorable replacement to the great Richard Harris.The acting by each actor is pretty strong and the film is loaded with a variety of great actors. The film is pretty good and hopefully the film series continues to be as good as this. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

American History X," Powerful, emotional, stirring, amazing
","American History X has gone down as one of the most brilliants works of art in the past twenty years. Focusing on the subject of racism and Neo-Nazism within the United States along with the questions of affirmative action and illegal immigration. The film holds nothing back. I have never seen a film so balanced. What I mean by balanced is how the dialog, the story, the acting, and the characters are all amazing and brilliant equally. It is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen on the subject of racism.Derek is one of the most feared Neo-Nazi leaders in Los Angeles. He holds nothing back when expressing his beliefs. If he needs to kill, if he needs to destroy, if he needs to harm, he'll do it just to see what according to him is right is accomplished. But after a brutal three year stint in prison for the murder of two black men, Derek's only fear is that his brother will follow down the same path as he once did. Ed Norton stars as Derek in a film of redemption and acceptance of one another.Ed Norton is one of the best actors around. He held nothing back for American History X. He became the crazed, racist, mislead Derek that we see in the film. His performance is one of the most memorable performances by an actor in the past 25 years. The ending scene will bring tears to your eyes as Derek's ultimate horror finally comes about in startling fashion. When someone says 'Norton was the key to this films success' they are right.Edward Furlong is strong as Derek's younger brother. He makes you believe that Danny is being influenced by his brother. He makes his character to be innocent yet dangerous. We see the true human side of people through him and his misguided beliefs. We come to understand him and the dark side of Neo-Nazism through Furlong's character. The chemistry between Furlong and Norton is very strong and very believable though not nearly as memorable as Norton's.The film is seriously intense. Language is flying at every corner. There isn't any drug use which seems to be common in every gang movie today. I liked this because drugs seem to always be the focal point when it comes to gang films. Instead of focusing on drugs and things, the film focuses on the beliefs of the Neo-Nazi's and how in trying to strengthen society, they have all but divided it more. They have just brought more violence with their beliefs and the film stands as stark opposition to anyone who is racist or discriminative.Tony Kaye disowned the film after it was released. I still don't know why. The film is brilliant and mostly because of him and the work he did on it. The dialog, the characters, the story is all memorable in my book. I have trouble finding a better lead actor then Edward Norton. I have trouble finding a more complex character then Derek Vinyard, and I have trouble finding a more believable and brutal story the American History X. It is by far one of the best films of the 90's.5/5 Stars",10,0,2,25 May 2007
Pearl Harbor," Boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Pearl Harbor is the so-called epic by Michael Bay following the true events that occurred on December 7th, 1941 in Hawaii. Instead of being an amazing epic film, this just fails on almost every level. Capt. Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Capt. Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) have been friends since boyhood and are both in the US Airforce. Rafe has a girl(Kate Beckinsale) and is a fine pilot. Danny is his best friend but the two are separated when Rafe is shipped off to Germany. They don't hear from Rafe but from the War Department saying he has been killed in action. Without having any sympathy for a plot or for Kate Beckinsale, Danny moves rite in and puts the moves on her. The whole group is in Hawaii having the time of their lives when Rafe returns from Germany saying that he survived the crash. Then fights break out and somehow Danny and Rafe drive off the base and into the mountains. Next day, bombs are blowing up everywhere and soldiers are being slaughtered on the decks of their ships. Japanese have launched their offensive and an hour-long battle occurs which just gets boring after awhile. Somehow Rafe and Danny are able to get planes off the ground and drive away the bombers alone.From here, what little story there is goes into the Pacific but I won't waste the unbelievable story. The only excitement in this is about the first twenty minutes of Pearl Harbor. Affleck and Hartnett equally suck as their southern farm boy soldier characters. Cuba Gooding Jr. is totally wasted in a supporting actor job. The film is way too long, extending 2 hours and 40 mins. the acting is bad and it seemed every line Alec Baldwin said was suppose to be defiant and stunning. Guess what. They weren't!There is about an 1 1/2 hour of dialog and boring crap of Hartnett and Beckinsale making out and Affleck breaking down into tears over and over again. The visual effects are good and the Japanese actors aren't bad, but if you want to see a good Pearl Harbor film, I recommend Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970)Pearl Harbor. Starring: Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Tom Sizemore, Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Jon Voight.1 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",3,2,4,11 May 2005
Independence Day," Modern-Day Aliens
","Independence Day is pretty-much aliens updated from the 50's. When we were all kids we dreamed of aliens and were afraid of them or saw E.T. and loved them. I'd go with E.T but this film sure doesn't.After a new signal is received from outer-space, the world goes on alert as alien crafts cover entire cities. the countries around the world try to make contact but are gravely wrong when their planes are shot down. President Tom Whitmore (Bill Pullman) attempts to warn the people as a computer nerd David (Jeff Goldblum)attempts to warn him. but the aliens take matters into their own hands destroying countless cities around the world. Another attempt is made at the aliens, this time with fighter jets headed by Capt. Steven Hiller (Will Smith) but all but his ship is destroyed. From here on out the film heads from destroyed L.A. to Area 51 to the mother ship herself. The movie is visually stunning with breakthrough special-effects. The story is very good and Will Smith, Bill Pullman, and Jeff Goldblum make up a tremendous cast.Some drawbacks are is the films length. It probably could have been cut down about another twenty minutes.Independence Day. Starring: Bill Pullman, Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaid, Vivica A. Fox, and Judd Hirsch.3 out of 5 Stars.",7,2,5,6 April 2005
Gone with the Wind," 4 Hours. Nothing Really Happens
","I'm a big Civil War fan and I've seen most of the movies about the era except this. My aunt recommended it saying it was great. I rented it and started to watch. It's a love story! Not a war movie. But I watched it anyway.Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a stuck up, beautiful southern bell from Georgia and a gambling captain, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) falls in love with her. Most of the movie is just Scarlett sitting around complaining how she can't marry another woman's husband by the name of Ashley (Leslie Howard). But within the last half hour their child manages to die, they go to Paris, and sit around in a mansion watching Rhett get angry with Scarlett.I know the film was a breakthrough in film. The film does have its upsides. The filming locations selected were dazzling, the recreation of the escape from Atlanta was doen very well and Clark Gable gives off the sense of a true southern gentleman. However, the story focus' way too much on Scarlett and half way through the movie she just is annoying and boring to watch. If you like love story, it isn't bad. For a drama, it is sub par. Gone With The Wind. Starring: Clark Gable, Vivien Liegh, Leslie Howards, Olivia de Havilland, and Thomas Mitchell.3 out of 5 Stars.",6,7,17,8 April 2005
No Country for Old Men," The greatest villain since Hannibal Lecter, the best film of the new millennium, the Coen's deliver again
","No Country for Old Men may quite possibly be the best Coen brothers film to date. From the two men who brought you The Big Lebowski (one of the best comedies of the 90's) Fargo (one of the best drama's of the 90's) and O Brother Where Art Thou? (one of the most beautifully crafted films of 2000) comes this film. If you thought nothing could ever top those three films you are in for a big surprise, No Country for Old Men is not only the best film of 2007 but also one of the best films of the new millennium. It is the nearest to perfection one can get. It is, simply, a modern masterpiece.The story revolves around Llewelyn Moss, a retired worker who hunts antelope in the deserts of Texas. One day Moss stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and also $2 million in cash. Moss takes it and flees only to have a Mexican gang and a sinister assassin by the name of Anton Chigurh. Along the way several men become part of the fray including a sheriff about to retire and a rival assassin of Chigurh's. The story follows that of Llewelyn mostly but Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell also plays a significant role. In the end it is more then a battle of wits between Moss and Chigurh, it is a battle of good and evil.First off the acting in the film is among the best I've seen since American Beauty. Brolin, Jones, and Bardem are all Oscar worthy in my opinion. Brolin delivers the perfect portrayal of a man on the run who knows how to use his brain. We don't see Brolin running around shooting at everything that moves, instead the Coens' let us view Moss using his brain which makes the film way more interesting. Brolin's mild manner mix perfectly for the mold of Llewelyn Moss. Overall a great protagonist created by the Coens' and a great portrayal by Josh Brolin, a man we don't see too much of these days.By far the best acting I've seen by a person this decade comes from that of Spanish actor Javier Bardem as the cold hearted Anton Chigurh. Chigurh sent shivers down my spine every time he spoke and every time he moved. His calm demeanor, mixed with his sociopathic mind makes him simply haunting. What made him the most frightening is that he is so believable. He is smart and deadly but also very much believable and very unique. Instead of the cast mold for villains in cinema (kill, kill, kill), McCarthy makes Chigurh more of like the Angel of Death, deciding who dies by the flip of a coin. His weapon of choice is unique, even how he talks is quite different from most villains of the day. I could easily see a story about a murder like this guy appearing in a paper. While Chigurh is silent and many would portray him as a one-dimensional antagonist, Bardem brings life and soul to the character. This is not the Coen's or McCarthy's work but Bardem's work that makes Javier Chigurh the greatest villain since Hannibal Lecter and one of the greatest in cinema history. Javier Bardem, to say the least, is simply brilliant.I have few complaints about the film. Many people found a problem with the ending. I had no problems with it. I was thoroughly satisfied as I walked out of the late show. The Coens' make you think. They don't make everything obvious which most directors do. They make an audience think and that is what they do in No Country for Old Men. The movie takes us into the relationship of good and evil and some beautiful scenes are shown to explain how these two interact everyday. The film will shake you up, make you think, and always have you looking over your shoulder expecting to see the red eyes of Chigurh with his coin ready to decide your fate.No Country for Old Men had me thinking about it for days after. The symbolic meanings of the characters and the speech at the end, the amazing, three-dimensional characters, the beautiful story that is crafted perfectly by McCarthy and adapted beautifully by the Coen's. I honestly wanted to see this movie again and again. Give the film time and don't cast your thumbs up or thumbs down on it until you have let it sit for a day and you have thought about it. I find it to be the best film since American Beauty and a beautiful film with a haunting villain.5/5 stars",10,5,13,26 November 2007
Batman Begins," Batman has been revived
","I believed that the Batman series had died with the fourth film Batman and Robin (1997) which was absolutely awful and stupid. When I saw previews for this film coming out I had little hope for the film. I went to see the late show last night and was presently surprised by the film. The film explains the beginning of Batman from his childhood, into his training, right up to the confrontation with his first villain, the Scarecrow (Cillian Murphy). Batman must begin a quest to stop the Scarecrow from taking over Gotham City. But is the Scarecrow working alone or is he planning something much more, much more sinister that could bring back his dark past?Batman Begins takes the series back to its roots. It explains everything of his past, his obsession of bats, his bat cave, his training, and the origins of his costume, bat car, and gadgets. The film starts out a bit quick, I actually thought it was another preview until they said Bruce. The action isn't wasted though, it is used in just the right spots and not overdone. One thing I liked was how not everything Batman used was exactly how it was in the original with Michael Keaton. It gave the film a bit more freshness. The acting is outstanding and the cast that does it is just as good. With a cast of Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon you're going to get some great performances which you do.The story is a lot darker then the last two and the villains, especially the Scarecrow, are freaky and cunning. One problem I had was the fact that the Scarecrow is a bit wasted. In the comics he was really tough and never gave up but in the film he is a bit weaker and not as important as I liked.In the end the film does not disappoint at any level. Christian Bale is fantastic as Batman, he brings a new tough guy attitude that was lost after Michael Keaton. Director Chris Nolan has resurrected a story that I had believed to be lost but I was wrong. You'll have a good time watching the amazing action that put the film over the top.Batman Begins. Starring: Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Katie Holmes, and Morgan Freeman.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",9,1,2,22 June 2005
Liar Liar," Carrey is pure genius
","Jim Carrey proved yet again with Liar Liar that his comedy and acting abilities are outstanding. Carrey plays the witty Fletcher, a divorced lawyer who is in the middle of the biggest case of his life. Along with trying to prepare for the court hearings, he has to find time to spend with his cute and loving son Max who he constantly is breaking promises too, never intentionally. On the night of Max's birthday, in which Fletcher promises to attend but gets 'caught up' at work, max wishes that his dad could for one day, not tell a lie. What follows is the funniest day of his life. Being unable to tell a lie, Fletcher now must find a way to win the case and his son and ex-wife to his side. The court hearings are pure genius with Carrey as the lawyer acting opposite Jason Brenard as the judge. The two make a comical duo unlike any other with Carrey providing the wit and Brenard the sternness needed in the judge. The reason the film works so well is the acting. The plot is nothing to rave about, man not able to lie trying to win over his ex-wife and win a court hearing, but the actors in their roles are superb. Carrey carries 90% of the comedy and is fantastic. The final court hearing will have you in pain you're laughing so hard. Jason Brenard gave a great performance and it's a shame him and Carrey did not get to work again before his death. Jennifer Tilly easily convinces anyone that sees her that she is a total b*tch and not deserving of any money in the case. Maura Tierney wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of Fletcher's ex-wife but she held her own in probably the only serious role of the film. Cary Elwes even has a short role as Audrey's (Tierney) new love interest who may be taking both her and Max to Boston and out of Fletcher's life forever.The interaction between characters is outstanding. The scene where Fletcher makes fun of his boss and all of his executives for five minutes straight was pure genius. Carrey carried most of the film but no one should look past the other actors, they bring some great laughs also.Liar Liar, even though it isn't the most thought out comedy, it sure is one of the funniest. Carrey was pure genius with all the one liners and just plain actions he performs during the movie. He's constantly moving and jumping and yelling. The film gives a clear message of how people are much happier when they don't lie and it's done in Carrey fashion.4/5 Stars",8,1,1,16 April 2006
Saving Private Ryan," WWII Films Don't Get Much Better
","Saving Private Ryan is a top WWII film and I've seen it a dozen times. As the film starts we are presented with a hundred or so ships coming across the sea. Suddenly violence erupts and soldiers are slaughtered on the D-Day Assualt. In the assualt, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) leads his platoon up and around the German lines for a flank attack. Across the ocean, a mother receives three KIA letters in the same day but is promised that her youngest son, Private Ryan (Matt Damon) will be found in France and sent home. On the Normandy beach, Captain Miller and his platoon will be sent on a suicide mission across France to find Private Ryan and battle across the German lines. Through the whole mission the soldiers are pushed to the limit with the death of comrades and questioning of the mission.Steven Spielberg works his magic again with the presentation of one of the most honored war movies in film history. Tom Hanks is strong, smart and above all good as Captain Miller. There is also a surprise with one of Vin Diesel's first roles as Private Caparzo. The violence is brutal, bloody, and well crafted. Each character is interesting and their fears and weaknesses are each expressed in the film.Saving Private Ryan.

28 Days Later...," Brilliantly crafted, shockingly captivating, a must see
","28 Days Later has gone down in the United States a pure work of art and genius craftsmanship. Anytime I ask a person what is their favorite horror or thriller film, 28 Days Later pops up 9 times out of 10. For the past five years I have heard almost entirely positive reviews of the film but never managed to watch it. I wanted too but had trouble finding any time to do so. Finally it appeared on HBO and I was able to view it for the first time and I must say I am very impressed with the film 28 Days Later. After a first view I was no longer questioning why people found this film to be such a good member of the horror genre.The film begins with a virus known simply as Rage is released accidentally by a group of animal rights activist who think they are freeing harmless monkeys from a research lab. 28 days later, a man by the name of Jim awakens in a deserted hospital after being in a coma. He wanders out of the hospital to find that all of London is quiet and still. There is not a soul out. Through his wondering he is attacked by infected humans who seek to kill him. Jim is picked up by a woman named Selena who along with a few others attempt to survive the Rage infested United Kingdom and hold out some hope that somehow they will survive.Cillian Murphy has been making quite a name for himself as of late with such films as Batman Begins and Red Eye. He has shown extreme talent and a knack for playing villains but in 28 Days Later Jim stars as the protagonist. Murphy gives a solid performance. He seems well relaxed and suited for the rule and really shows off the fear his character is experiencing during the movie. This was no doubt a role that got him on the fast track toward success in mainstream films. Murphy overall gave a solid performance though there really wasn't much to it beside looking scared and confused most of the time. Nevertheless solid performance.In support is the beautiful Naomie Harris as Jim's companion Selena. Selena is difficult character to portray considering her complexity. She has more of a background then Jim which makes it even harder for Naomie to portray the character when their is more complexity. However, Naomie is quite strong and talented and does great in support, she also is something to look at in this overall dark film. Harris' performance is stronger then Murphy's simply because Harris had to act more, plain and simple, She is the force behind the acting in the film and I would not mind seeing her in more films.What makes horror films is the tone and setting of the film. One of the largest cities in the European Union hardly seems like a place to focus on for a horror/thriller film. However the tone is set in the opening shot of a deserted and abandoned London, England. Not a single person is on the street and you can't help but sit there and think 'My God!' It is shocking and scary just to see a city utterly deserted. The tone for the film works perfectly and helps set the stage for the story in the film. Kudos to Mr. Boyle and his crew.Another thing that 28 Days Later does so well is the mysteriousness behind the infected. They are 'seen' numerous times throughout the film but usually very quickly for only a few seconds or in the dark for longer. This adds to the overall scariness to the infected. They are constantly hiding and can strike at any moment. This adds to the shock that many thriller and horror films fail to capture. Infected can come out at almost any moment and attack and most of the time the audience is shocked and frightened by it. I overall enjoyed the frightening moments and the dark lighting and couldn't help but feel a bit freaked out afterwards though that is not a bad thing, that is what a horror film should do to a viewer.The film is very dark and filled with violence and gore, some rough language and nudity. Definitely try to avoid letting kids who aren't yet in high school from seeing this. They will not understand it and will be horrified by what they are presented with on screen. The plot is not too hard to understand, mostly a survivor story and quite a good one at that. One thing viewers must remember is that this film is not meant to be a happy one, it is bleak and does not care much for the sympathy of the audience. You have to adapt to the relatively despairing feeling you will feel when you watch it. You won't feel too happy afterwards but it is a horror film so why should you? Overall the film is quite good, some characters aren't developed well enough but the whole plot and story behind everything makes up for most of it. Genius work by Boyle, a masterpiece of British film making.4/5 Stars",8,0,1,23 July 2007
Schindler's List," The greatest achievement in filming history
","Arguably one of the greatest films ever made, Schindler's List details the struggles of two men who are trying to save as many people as they can during the Holocaust of World War II. Our main character, Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a German business man who runs a company which builds supplies for the German Army. Oskar employs many Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto because he can pay them near nothing to do long hours of labor. He treats them good and if one of his workers is harmed by a Nazi officer he writes letters of complaints and demands retribution for the damage.As the movie progress', Oskar meets Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley). Stern helps Schindler to run the company and is constantly hinting a plea for help to his boss. Slowly, Schindler begins to witness the horrors of the Holocaust after witnessing the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto and the slaughter of hundreds of Jews. Soon Schindler is no longer a cold-hearted German who has a schedule for when his goods need to be made but a man seeking to save everyone he can.Schindler's Lsit draws you in with the very first scene and holds you until the last credit rolls of the screen. Filmed entirely in black and white except for the first and last scene, the movie brings forth a n awesome sense of realism and authenticity. The sets are stunning and the effects sued are captivating.The movie also uses some symbolism which is odd for a Spielberg film. The infamous girl in red is the only character in the entire film who appears in color while the rest is black and white. She is put forth to represent to the conversion of Oskar and is used in only two scenes.Liam Neeson is able to captivate the audience with his breathtaking performance. He is cool and quick thinking, a ladies man and a sly talker. He is able to bring forth the desperation of his character by the end of the film of how hurt and damaged his soul is from what he has witnessed. he is able to bring for Oskar like no other with a sense of realism and compassion, he brings forth a man who is trying to save as many people as he can.I had no idea that Ben Kingsley was in this film until reading the cast list after seeing it. He barely ever talks but when he does, his words will bring tears to your eyes. He brings out the suffering of the Jews and how they are truly innocent of everything the Nazi's hold them accountable for. Kingsley continues with this film to be one of the greatest actors in the industry.The last of the main characters is Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), a troubled German officer and sort of commandant of the concentration camp that Oskar's workers come from. Fiennes kick started his career with this role. Acting opposite of Neeson, he is able to hold his own and bring out the lunacy of what the German's planned to do. You can't help feeling pity for him but also an overwhelming sense of hatred at the same time. It is Fiennes finest role to date.Schindler's List is one of a very few select films that are able to convey a sense of humanity. It shows that murder and genocide solve nothing and that the greatest power to posses is to be able to have power but spare an enemy. The film moved me in a way that I have never felt before, this film will truly stun you.5 out of 5 Stars",10,9,13,21 March 2006
The Incredibles," Fun For All
","Being part of a family of five, I know what it is like to have trouble in a house. Parents running kids places, coming to school because of misbehavior and so on and so forth. But the Incredibles takes the modern-day family a step further. Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) is your normal modern-male figure. He works in an office building, has a wonderful family and drives a nice car. Oh, did I mention that he is also Mr. Incredible, the superhero gone into hiding with his superhero family. Soon, Mr. Incredible wants to get back into the business of helping people again with his buddy Lucius Best/Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) and soon he gets his wish when a mysterious person hires him to be a hero on a small island. He jumps at the offer but soon realizes that the company is run by an old nemesis and all the Incredible's family is called together to help rescue him.Each scene in this movie funny and original. The family portrayal of arguing is truly brilliant when added with the superpowers of being able to turn invisible and run at the speed of light. One of the funniest characters is Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) as the ice skater superhero. The film won Best Animated Picture from the Academy and one other and was a breakthrough in animated filming with the development of hair design and body portrayal. Each character introduced has a laugh with them. Mine was Frozone but Edna 'E' Mode could be one of the most original characters this year as the loud-mouth designer of superhero suits.The movie brings lots of laugh and is a family film form all. Little kids will like it and parents will find it humorous. It starts out slow but when in full swing is as good as Shrek (2001).The Incredibles. Starring the voices of: Craig T.

The Elephant Man," Brilliant
","(SPOILERS) The Elephant Man (1980) is an absolute masterpiece. Set in the late 1800's England The Elephant Man shows the life of Joseph Merrick(John Hurt)and his doctor Fredrick Treves(Anthony Hopkins). The movie begins with Treves finding Joseph at a freak show were it shows his whole body. In life and in the movie Merrick is covered with bumps over 90 percent of his body and his head was three times the size of a normal head.Treves takes Merrick to the hospital were he is placed in a room alone. In the movie he appears very shy and very unproud of himself (he can't stand looking at himself)and is shamed to were a bag over his head to hide. But soon Treves breaks him from the shell to show him the life a proud Englishmen.The Elephant Man shows the greatest victory of the human spirit in a man being abused and frightening all his life. The life of Joseph Merrick is brilliantly brought to the screen and gives amazing in-depth analysis into the story around him. The movie also holds one of the greatest lines in my book and also the tagline: Merrick: I AM NOT AN ANIMAL! I AM A HUMAN BEING ! I..AM..A MAN!This movie is a must see drama and one of the greatest movies in the past twenty-five years.

Slap Shot," Funniest film to date
","Slap Shot is the comedy film. My father had always told me it was hilarious but I never thought it could beat out such comedies as Happy Gilmore and Blazing Saddles, it has. Slap Shot covers a far-fetched story of a minor league hockey team about to go under.Paul Newman plays their aging coach Reggie Dunlop who is out to win, but after discovering that his team is going to fold at the end of the season, decides to work a new plan of offense. With the help of his players they take a more aggressive plan by fighting, insulting, and swearing with opposing teams to win. In the end they're are able to fight their way to the championship. Along the way, one player (Michael Ontkean) takes a stance against the violent ways and brings about the question of what they're doing is exactly right. Paul Newman is in one of his best roles to date. He acts with enthusiasm and skill and comes up with a great line in every scene. It seemed every time he got angry he said something that made me fall out of my chair laughing. Michael Ontkean is next in his fantastic portrayal of a man taking a stand against violence. But above Newman, above Outkean, are the Hanson brothers. The three idiots of hockey. They're violent, they're stupid, and they're all look like Jesus. They hold the funniest scenes in the movie with the senseless punches and acts they do and even managing to get thrown into jail. I've never laughed so hard in my life. Every scene, every line is funny in its own way. I couldn't' believe it at first. Slap Shot is the tied with Dumb and Dumber as the greatest comedy ever made. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy.Slap Shot. Starring: Paul Newman, Michael Ontkean, Strother Martin, Jeff Carlson, David Hanson, and Steve Carlson.5 out of 5 Stars",10,1,6,28 October 2005
Children of Men," A brilliant sci-fi thriller that doesn't need all the special effects to make it work
","Children of Men is set in the year 2027. The world has become sterile and the youngest humans are in their 20's. Chaos reigns across the Earth. The United States is in a civil war, France is on fire, and Britain is deteriorating. Theo (Clive Owen) is a man who simply doesn't care about most of it until he is asked by his ex-wife to escort a woman to the coast for safety. A woman who may be the first mother in 20 years. It won't be an easy task for Theo though as the military begins to round up illegal immigrants and force them into camps and the Fishes (the illegal immigrants resistance movement) who are attempting to use the new born child as a political tool.Clive Owen stars in the lead as Theo. Owen put a lot of work into this film as he personally looked over every scene he was in to make sure his character never became too much of a hero. Theo is the classic un-wanting hero. He gets forced into the situation and must deal with it and Owen never strays from this presentation. He gives his best performance since Sin City and really shows that no matter who you are you can always be a hero to someone, in the movie it is Kee, the pregnant girl.Julianne Moore is only in the movie for about 10 minutes so she really doesn't have time to show off her character in too much detail. The legend Sir Michael Caine gives an off-the-wall performance as a former political cartoonist/ex-hippie who helps Theo and his company get Kee to safety. Caine is only in the film for about 20 minutes but gives a great performance. And to round off the supporting cast there is Claire-Hope Ashitey as Kee. This is only her second or third film but she is wonderful. The connection she makes with Owen in many scenes are great and her acting is top notch for such a new star.The film will be known for its cinematography more than anything. Several single shots exceeding five minutes in length are present within the film. If you are unfamiliar with this then it means the same shot is being taken the whole time without a switch to another shot or perspective. This is really cool cause the whole time your watching one long cut thinking 'Holy sh*t, how did they do this?' The cinematography sets the mood and makes the film even better then it already is because it gives a sense of artsy look to the film.Cauron sets the mood early and never strays from the feeling of destruction one feels the entire movie. This isn't a post-apocalyptic setting, it is set during it in a way. The film is not without scenes that brings hope to the audience. The last 20 minutes are truly moving as it shows Theo's sacrifices to save Kee and her baby from harm. Cauron holds nothing back in the film. It has its violent moments, its course language and its nudity but it is all needed to set the mood of the film.The film is set in the future and therefore would be considered sci-fi. Instead of showing a world with hovercrafts and aliens we are presented to a world destroying itself. The films cinematography and setting makes us feel as if we are right in the middle of this hopeless world. The film also shows that lasers, aliens, and outer space are needed to create a great sci-fi film. On the contrary I think the film as better for not having any of these present. Truly a modern day classic that won't be forgotten, make sure to see this amazing picture.5/5 stars",10,2,14,23 October 2007
Dumb and Dumber," Hilarious
","Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Llyod (Jim Carrey)are two low-life Providence men with nothing going for them. Llyod is assigned to drive a beautiful woman named Mary (Lauren Holly) to the airport. After Mary 'accidentaly' leaves her briefcase in the terminal, Harry and Llyod go on a cross-country trip to Aspen to return the briefcase. Carrey is put in the film for more of the goofy comedy. He is off-the-wall funny and always says something stupid that almost sounds right. Nevertheless Carrey puts a lot of thought behind his character and creates good chemistry between himself and Daniels.Daniels surprised me the most. After seeing his work in such films as Gettysburg and Speed you'd never think the guy could do comedy. WRONG! Daniels is brilliant, again. He's put opposite of Carrey for some of the serious humor but soon his role too falls into the goofy side. One scene especially involving a toilet stands out on how good his acting was.Dumb and Dumber is one of the funniest movies every seen with the interaction of Daniels and Carrey. After the movie you try to wonder who really was the dumber one. Some of the gags are just ingenious from Seabass, who was going to kill Harry in a truck stop ends up being gay or Harry licking the frost on the lift and getting stuck to it.Dumb and Dumber.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A step below Vol. 2 but still an excellent film
","The Kill Bill saga will go down in history as two of the bloodiest films ever made. Kill Bill Vol. 1 takes about 90% of the violence for both films. The film holds nothing back in story telling or action sequences, all filmed with masterful sword play. The film is full of fun and quite impressive for an action film.Uma Thurman is the Bride. A seemingly nameless woman put into a coma for 4 years after her ex-boss (who happens to be the leader of a group of assassins) has her shot for desertion, the Bride awakes to seek revenge on the 5 people who caused her life to become a living hell. The first film is more of a flash back to the Bride chasing the first person she is after, O-Ren and her second person, Vernita.The actors do a wonderful job with the story line and the characters they portray. Uma Thuman is slowly becoming one of my favorite actresses to watch. She is smart, she is cool, and she is hot. She has that air of power on the screen when watching her with the sword and the dialogue she speaks. She has proved herself to be more than just a no-talent actress in it for the looks.Lucy Lui delivers a strong supporting role as the Japanese gang leader O-Ren. She is silent and powerful. Lucy Lui was able to show the audience real quickly that O-Ren is not someone to mess around with in the film. Lucy Lui isn't well known to me. She was in the failure that was Charlie's Angels so I never knew she could actually act. She changed my mind in this. Her casual demeanor and quick sword play makes her one of the best characters of the two volumes.The movie makes many homages to past film genres, such as the kung-fu genre of the late 70's. The film is filled with the fighting music from those kind of films and I actually like the little homage made by Tarantine to the late genre. Tarantino is a master of making things work on screen and one of his best achievements is the combination of the corny music with the incredible fight sequences.Now the film is not entirely believable, that is evidence by some of the things the Bride and a few of the other characters are able to believe, However, the film is not meant to be believable but instead a story being told. The fight sequences are elegantly crafted and filled with spectacular stunts. The last sequence in the film has gone down as one of my favorite pieces of action in film history, right up there with D-Day from Saving Private Ryan and the Battle of Sterling from Braveheart. Tarantino is a master of dialogue and there is not one dull moment of speech. Te conversations make sense, they're well crafted, and they are easy to follow unlike some films. What Tarantino does is that he does not fill the conversations with big words few understand, but instead makes the sentences short and easy to understand for anyone. The film is very violent, one of the bloodiest I've seen. No one under 16 should see this. 4/5 Stars",8,0,2,27 February 2007
Major League," Baseball at its Funniest
","The Indians can't win and now they have a new owner. Rachael Phelps (Margaret Whitton) is an ex-model and widow of the Indians owner. But instead of turning the Indians around, she wants them to finish dead last so she can move the team down south. So the worst bunch of players and strangest people together. Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger) is the washed up catcher, Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert) is a voodoo outfielder, Willie 'Mays' Hayes (Wesley Snipes) is the uninvited player, Rick Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) is the pitcher who can't throw a strike, and Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernson) is the player waiting to be traded.After learning of their owners ploy the team must come together to win the division without killing one another. The film is filled with profanity but used at the right times to bring out the most laughs. Charlie Sheen is absolutely hilarious trying to pitch and being an ex-felon at the same time. My favorite character doesn't even talk, Cerrano's god Jobu, as it curses people throughout the movie and screw Cerrano throughout the season by not letting him hit a curve ball.Major League.

Men in Black," Funny Sci-Fi. As Good As Ghostbusters.
","As I stated above, Men In Black is just as good as the sci-fi comedies Ghostbusters I and II. But instead of chasing ghost's we're chasing after rogue aliens.James (Will Smith) is an officer in the NYPD and one of the top officers. After a hard night, James is questioned by his own police force for allegedly killing a suspect who fell off a building. As James insists that the person was acting strangely, Agent K (Tommmy Lee Jones) comes in and takes him out. James is welcomed to a secret agency which keeps aliens in check. After a brief examination of his life, James (now Agent J) joins the agency. On his first day, suddenly K and J are on a mission to stop a massive cockroach from destroying Earth and starting a galactic war. The chemistry between Smith and Jones is hilarious. Smith has some great comedy scenes especially when he is using his new weapon, the Noisy Crickett and him trying to deliver a baby squid type creature. The aliens are smart, their inventive, and their just plain fun when seeing how they identify themselves and hide their identities. The story is funny and will keep you laughing at almost every scene.The presentation of aliens as everyday people trying to live normal lives in Manhattan is a lot more fun than the presentation of murderous aliens (Independence Day). Another great part is that the film isn't overblown with special effects of alien explosions and massive battles. Instead comedy and chemistry keeps this top comedy flowing. Men In Black.

The Mummy Returns," Your Usual Good Sequel
","The Mummy Returns is the sequel to the 1999 summer hit The Mummy. Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraiser) is not fighting rebels in Egypt or getting into fights with people in bars. Instead he is quietly living in England with his wife, Every (Rachel Wiesz) and son Alex. Meanwhile a thousand miles away in Egypt, the body of Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) is being prepared to be sent to London by his loyal followers. Rick has no idea what kind of adventure he is going to be involved in and how much emotional pain it will cause when Imhotep begins his quest to kill the Scorpion King and conquer the world. There are many high points and many low points to this film. The development of Evey's character in a whole is fantastic and the fight scenes involving Fraiser and Vosloo are well-filmed and well-crafted. The story isn't as scary as the first and the film is a bit more flashy. Fraiser reaches for his gun one to many times in the film but you'll still have a good.The Mummy Returns.

The Last Samurai," Hollywood's Inaccuracy and Entertainment
","The Last Samurai (2003) I've watched numerous times. The last time (last night) I found the movie a lot better than I remembered. Set mostly in 1870's Japan during a time when Japan was beginning to modernize its country. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is hired along with other US soldiers to modernize the Japanese Army currently caught in civil war with the samurai. Even though this movie is based on actual events the United States had nothing to do with the modernization of japan. It was mostly France, Britain, and Russia. Yet the movie is still good. The portrayal of the way of the samurai is fascinating and the idea of rifles against sword seems utterly insane. This movie is the first movie for Ken Watanabe to speak English in and does a fine job as the Samurai leader Katsumoto. Even though I'm not exactly a fan of Tom Cruise I feel he did a good job with his troubled soldier character. The story isn't original (a soldier trying to find his honor and the right path) yet it's does fine. The action is wild: the first battle in the forest to the last battle with the fires all around.

Stalingrad," Right to the point. Show's war for what it truly is
","Having majored in Western History when I was a student in college seeing the views on World War II are quite discomforting and in a whole completely wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history. While the Axis Powers conducted many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every German soldier was out to exterminate the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier swung a samurai sword around and flew kamikaze missions, and not every Italian soldier was a Fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis powers were normal people like you and I caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved.The Battle of Stalingrad was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over 1,500,000 casualties sustained over the course of the battle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant von Witzland as they are reassigned to the Eastern Front to battle the Soviets at Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as sort of the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in Germany and Poland.The film follows the course of the battle. The film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle. We are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles (including a firing squad sequence). Overall the battles are the earliest examples that I know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence. Much of the inspiration for Saving Private Ryan's battle sequences seem to have come from this film.The film does not aim to make the German's completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to, evil. Most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home. The film makes it clear quite quickly that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that genocide was taking place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the Germany Army was simply fighting for a cause they really didn't understand and most wished just to return home rather than freezing in negative degree temperatures in Russia.The film really shows how hellish war is, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle. As with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it. It will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the Eastern Front faced. Not recommended for children. 4/5 stars",8,4,5,10 June 2007
Groundhog Day," Awesome Film. One of Murray's Best
","What can I say. i've probably seen this movie twenty times and it never gets old. Murray is perfect in his role and so is Andie MacDowell. The story goes like this. Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a cynical weatherman from Pittsburgh. It's February 1 when him and his crew, Rita (Andie MacDowell) and Larry (Chris Elliot) go to the small town of Punxsatawney to film the groundhog awake. Phil has a miserable day and is awoken February 2 to the sound of Sonny and Cher. He goes out to the Groundhog grounds and gives his usual performance. Afterwards the crew packs up to leave but can't get back to Pittsburgh due to weather. They spend another night. The next day Phil awakes to the sound of the same Sunny and Cher song and discovers it's February 2 again. What could be going on? Now Phil repeats February 2 again and again and again for days, months, even years. What is this purpose. Is it internal damnation for Phil being cynical or an idea for Phil to change his ways and help people. What do you think?That's what you'll be thinking each time you watch this film, right up to the very end. Bill Murray is absolutely perfect for his role. Andie MacDowell is a real strong female presence for the film and Chris Elliot has some good scenes as the camera man. The plot is next to perfect, an ultimate torture type world for Phil. Each day repeats, he does whatever he wants, and the next day he's back to new. The movie really gets you thinking about are more cynical side and how we represent that dark side everyday. The movie will bring a laugh and at some points almost make you cry. Murray deserved an Oscar for this performance and shows that he is capable of being a great actor, better than he already is.Groundhog Day.

Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino's First and Best
","Reservoir Dogs is a new look at crime in the eyes of the criminal's. Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) is a small time mob boss and is assembling an elite squad of thieves to make a hit. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. Blue are the robbers and are told to rob a Diamond warehouse.But something goes terribly wrong when the police arrive at the scene almost as soon as they've entered the place. Mr. Brown is killed and the rest are able to get out to the hide out. Now they've realized there is police informant among them, but who is it? Reservoir Dogs brings a new sense of brutality to crime movies. Instead of the occasional shot ringing out, Tarantino is able to bring a real sense of evil through Mr. Blonde, the ruthless killer and torturer. Each character is somewhat introduced over the course of the movie through flashback mode, some more than others. Standing as the lead characters are Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) and Mr. White (Harvey Kietel) both of whom are tryi9ng to figure out how the crime went wrong. The robbery is never shown and I think it made the film that much better. Instead of a massive shoot-out with police and the robbers triumphantly winning, we see little clips and of them running. The movie is Taratino's first and, in my mind, his best. He is able to portray crime in the horrible, wicked act it is. He is able to develop and create characters better then anyone else I've seen, and is just able to tell a good story. The film is a bit violent and gory and sometimes gets out of hand but just ignore it and watch this film.Reservoir Dogs.

The Descent," The scariest film in recent cinema
","I rarely get the treat of viewing British cinema so I was quite pleased when I was able to stumble upon the British horror film The Descent. The story follows that of six woman from the United Kingdom who love to do wild things. Not wild things in the terms of erotic films but in the terms of being daredevils so to say. After a freak accident claims the life of a woman named Sarah's young daughter and husband, the six friends travel to the United State to bond while they go spelunking (cave diving). What happens in the caves becomes a living nightmare as they become trapped inside with strange creatures out to kill them.At first when I read that the film was nearly an all female cast I had my doubts. The only time you ever see all female casts in the States is when a romantic comedy is the basis for the plot. However, one must remember, this is British made and are more adapt at acting then most anorexic, beauty queen wannabe's that act in the US. I liked the all female cast, they all did a great job and looked like they actually knew what they were doing while spelunking which added to the realism. All the girls are relatively unknowns outside of the UK but it doesn't matter, films don't have to have big stars in order to be great films.The horror is top-notch even before the Crawlers (monsters) show up. You feel a strong sense of claustrophobia and foreboding while the woman crawl through narrow tunnels in the pitch. Honestly, I was freaked out even before the monsters began wrecking havoc. Once the monsters do arrive you are really in for a treat. They are easily the most believable, scariest looking things I have seen in a horror film since the original Alien. Needless to say you will be scared out of your mind by the end of this and will be thinking about it even more when you turn off the lights to go to be that night. (recommendation: watch at night in the pitch black, it's even scarier)What makes all horror films is atmosphere. A strong sense of innocence and amusement must be present early on then that innocence must be smashed in bloody fashion. The film throws you right inside the caves with the six women and makes you feel just as claustrophobic and scared as they are. That is why The Descent works so well, it makes you feel as if you are there and as if you are going to be the next attacked. This is what so many horror films fail to do, there is a bunch of flash but no show, for the Descent there is not a lot of flash but a ton of show. This is why it is one of the best horror films since Alien.4.5/5 Stars",9,4,9,2 September 2007
Hoosiers," Solid Sports Drama
","(Possible Spoilers)Hoosiers is the definition of a well-rounded, strong sports movie. Taking place in southern Indiana where basketball is life, a new coach named Norman Dale (played by Gene Hackman) takes over as coach of a small town high school team in Hickory. Within his first ten minutes of coaching two players have quit. Things don't start out well, the team only has six players. Soon, however, the team rebounds and a new player joins up with them, Jimmy Chitwood (based on the actual player for the state championship team Milan, Bobby Plump), and things go up. Coach Dale soon finds an assistant in a drunk towns person named Shooter. Throughout the film we watch Coach Dale deal with everything from being booted as coach to helping Shooter get over his alcoholism to constantly being the underdog.What else is there to say, Hoosiers gives a person the real-sense of what high school basketball is and how it's a persons life in some places. The movie is well-acted, well-written (even though over forty minutes was cut) and well directed. The only problems with the film I had was that the events actually took place in 1954 and the actual school name is Milan. these details are small and don't have any effect on the movie.All in all see Hoosiers. 4 out of 5 Stars.",9,1,1,19 March 2005
Titanic," A Bit Long But A Great Epic Love Story Worth Seeing
","Titanic is the fictional love tale of a rich girl and a poor boy falling in love on the 'unsinkable' ship destined for New York City, from Europe. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor boy living in Europe, well just sort of hanging out in Europe in 1912. Outside the bar he hangs in, the largest ship ever built, the Titanic, is being set to sail. After winning an unbelievable card hand, he wins a ticket aboard and to America.While Jack camps out on the 3rd Level, Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is spending some rough time on the 1st Level. While Jack spends his night on the deck, Rosw rushes past him, ready to jump off the boat and to her death. Jack convinces her not to jump and the two begin to spend some time together and slowly fall in love. But as the days slowly tick away an unknown obstruction stands in front of ship, just a few miles ahead. One obstruction that would set the ship into history.The film beautifully shot and wonderfully acting. The love story is better then most. Instead of two kids just meeting and having sex that night, Cameron took time to let both Jack and Rose develop and progress into the relationship. The dialog between the two flows easily and the love connection is strong and well-portrayed. The special effects are a bit overwhelming especially when the ship is sinking. My only fault with the film is its length. I don't have a problem when a film extends 3+ hours when necessary but this extending 3 was unnecessary. Too many scenes are shown of Billy Zane running around and could have been edited out. Other than that the film is perfect. The story is told with great detail and flows less like a history lesson and more like a love story. The film is quite gripping and overwhelming at some parts but is well-worth seeing.Titanic.

Soon Harry starts receiving mysterious letters but is not allowed to read them. the Dursley's are utterly terrified.

Harry is confronted with a dark past and learns more of his parents and of the infamous, evil wizard Voldermort. Soon only Harry, Ron, and Hermione are the only hope for the wizardry world against Voldermort.The film is filmed with magical touches: moving and talking painting, a broomstick sport (Quidditch), and a teacher that transforms into a cat. the story is harmless and nothing really is ever mentioned of 'devils' while at school. I remember parents complaining how witchcraft was evil and possessed our children through the evil Harry Potter Stories. The kids act pretty well, Richard Harris keeps the flow of the movie going as the Headmaster of Hogwarts. The castle is beautifully designed and captured through the filming.

Enemy at the Gates," It's Hollywood! Not history!
","Enemy at the Gates has been slammed over and over again for its distortion of truth, cinematic liberties it took with history, and the wrongful portrayal of Russian heroes. Here is what people have to understand when they go to watch this movie. It has not a history lesson, it is entertainment. That is what everyone must say to themselves before they start watching this.Enemy at the Gates follows the story Vassili Vaitsez, an elite Russian sniper who has been drafted and is serving the Battle of Stalingrad. After Vassili kills so many German soldiers, the Germans send in their own elite in Major Konig. What ensues is a heart pounding stand off between the two elite snipers in the ruins of the train yard and other places in the once bustling city of Stalingrad.The actors due a phenomenal job of acting in this film. Jude Law, Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz and Joseph Fiennes all deliver top notch performances in their respective roles. Jude Law as a lead I'm usually not a big fan of but his performance as Vassili, a man caught in the middle of the bloodiest battle in human history, changed my mind about the English actor. Ed Harris shows how good he can act as villain when he is lurking around the ruins with his trusted sniper rifle.The film is loaded with violence done Saving Private Ryan style. The action is in your face, blood and gore everywhere. The opening 20 minutes is some of the most intense action I have ever seen. The director gives you a sense of as if you are actually in the battle, the confusion of soldiers, the explosions, everything. You feel as if you are actually in the middle of it.The story isn't great, it isn't terrible but it is not the greatest screen play ever to be written. The romance between Vassili and Tania, though I saw it be unneeded, still turned out to work very well. Enemy at the Gates is one of the few war films that actually takes the time to give a sense of the soldier and what they may be going through in the war, not just battle after battle. It is no history lesson, many liberties are taken with how the battle of Stalingrad and its commanders are portrayed. However, if you can look past these flaws, you'll be confronted with a very well made war film.Enemy at the Gates. 3.5/5 Stars",7,2,4,22 February 2007

All Quiet on the Western Front," A gritty and realistic WW1 film that is true to the book
","All Quiet on the Western Front is remembered for several different reasons and is a common household name today. Some say it is because it was the first 'talkie' to win Best Picture. Others say it is due to the amazing phrase its title is (common admit it is catchy). Yet others still insist it is due to the amazing adaptation of the book it was based on. However, All Quiet on the Western Front is best remembered by me as a gritty and realistic portrayal of a war nearly entirely forgotten.All Quiet on the Western Front follows the story of Paul Baumer, a German teenager who enlists in the army upon the onset of World War One. Along with his classmates, he believes the war will be more of an adventure than a war. That is until they are thrown into the trenches and confronted with the horrors of trench warfare and no mans land. Slowly the many teenage soldiers begin to lose their innocence in this war to end all wars. All Quiet on the Western Front is one of those few films that takes us into the lives of a soldier. It does not drop us into some distant battlefield and hold us there until the end. Instead the film gives backgrounds and liveliness to the characters. Everyone is made out to be someone you could run into on the street any day of the week. This is a work of Remarque (the man who wrote the book) and is brought forth perfectly by the actors portraying the characters.What made the book so wonderful was its accurate portrayal and feelings of World War One soldiers. Neither side had a vast majority vicious fighters who sought to destroy the enemy, they were there because that is what their government told them to do. These men were not glorious heroes because of the killing they did but for what they did for each other. The movie (just like the book) shows us that these men are not soldiers but human beings who are trying to survive in the war to end all wars. Another upside to the film is its realistic showing of trench warfare. The battle scenes are anything but watered down. The three or four scenes of actual battle are gritty and unnerving. The slaughter shown is accurate to the point of pain when compared to casualty statistics of the First World War (1,058,407 lost at the Battle of the Somme for anyone doubting that). Lewis Milestone paved the way for epic war battles with this film.Lew Ayres is an unknown actor to me. Granted I don't see many films from this time period but I thought his work as the young Paul Baumer was excellent. We literally see him age throughout the film and are easily able to relate to him and understand him. We understand the pain he suffers, we understand the emotions he is feeling all through Ayres fine acting. I hope to come across more of Ayres work in the near future, he was a great actor from what I saw in this movie.While Ayres gives a magnificent performance he is overshadowed by Louis Wolheim who portrays the leader of the bunch, Kat. Wolheim died a year after making this film and to me this was his best work. He is so close to perfection as the battle hardened Kat that it is almost unreal. His acting isn't like the melodramatic work of most actors of this period. It is as if you were watching an actor out of the present day. The work other than what is on the screen is marvelous. How the film did not win Best Cinematography is beyond me. It won two Academy Awards and perhaps the two biggest (Director and Picture). Remarque's anti-war classic is brought to life and loyally followed in the film adaptation. All Quiet on the Western Front goes down as one of the earliest war films. It also goes down as one of the most intense, most gruesome, and most brilliant anti-war films I've ever seen. Do not miss this timeless classic.4.5/5 Stars",9,3,4,9 April 2007

The adventure that follows is enjoyable and conveys a powerful message.The theme of the film is brotherhood and friendship. Throughout the film many aspects of the characters lives come forth and you witness how the other characters must unite to help one another. Some wonderful voice acting is put into play also. Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Leary all give excellent performances in the leads and help keep the smiles coming.What many must remember is that Ice Age is a kids film and some adults may not find the witty humor as funny as children.

","John McClane (Bruce Willis) isn't having the best time back in New York. He's been suspended from the police force, his marriage is falling apart, and the brother of Hans Gruber, a terrorist McClane dealt with a few years back, is reigning terror on the city. The man's name is Simon and he has called the police headquarters asking for McClane. After being found, John is sent to solve a series of puzzles for him to solve.After John is rescued from street gang(he was told by Simon to wear a racist symbol at 138th St.)by store owner Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) the two are forced together by Simon in order to solve where the next bomb may be. It's only a matter of time until another detonates and what Simon is actually planning is revealed.Bruce Willis entertains like no other actor I've ever seen before. He is just so good as the rogue, smart mouth cop always looking to have a little fun. Jeremy Irons, although not as brilliant as Alan Rickman was, is still a worthy and charming villain. The action is still as intense as ever and the dialog flows smoothly along with it. Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis are a pretty fun pair together and each will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.Die Hard With a Vengeance. Starring: Bruce Willis, Samuel L.

Con Air," Some scenes are ridiculous, some are pointless, and some are pretty cool
","I have a mixed feeling about the 1997 film Con Air. At some points in the film I would just sigh and realize how stupid the part I was watching. At other parts I'd be on the edge of my seat enjoying every second of the action or dialog. And yet at other parts I would yawn and nearly fall asleep. It was pretty weird.As the story goes, Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is a former US ranger preparing to be a father with his wife. But after a late night of drinking his wife keeps getting hounded by a two guys at the bar. Cameron and his wife leave but are attacked outside by the two men. Cameron accidentally kills one of them and soon finds himself in police custody. He is convicted of manslaughter and sent to do time which he does and is scheduled to be released. On his flight home, on a plane filled with murders, terrorists, and just plain filth of the earth, high-profiled prisoner Cyrus (John Malkovich) sees an opportuntiy to hijack the plane. After a struggle with the guards, the felons seize control of the plane. Not being part of it and just wanting to see his wife and daughter, Cameron makes attempts to contact US Marshal Vince Larkin (John Cusack)who can help him save the guards and felons that have no part in the hijacking.The film goes from the skies, to the deserts of Nevada, to the main strip of Las Vegas. the action isn't spectacular and highly unbelievable at most scenes. Nicolas Cage isn't exactly my favorite actor but does go from being the usual, boring, weak guy to a tough soldier. The script isn't exactly strong but some scenes are filmed and acted beautifully. John Malkovich is brilliant and is beginning to top my charts as one of the best actors around. All in all the film wasn't terrible. It could have been a lot better with a little less focus on the man getting back to his wife plot and more of just survival plot. I enjoyed it at some scenes and hated it at others. Nicolas Cage is entertaining is entertaining at the least and does have a tough guy attitude. John Cusack gives a better-then-average performance and is pretty cool at some scenes.In the end, Con Air just doesn't match up to Cage's previous action flick The Rock (1996) which was pretty awesome. Director Simon West had the right setting but never reaches what he originally set out to do in creating a top action film.Con Air.

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Ferrell's best to date
","Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy is the exactly what its title states. It is the legend of Ron Burgundy. Set in 70's San Diego, Ron (Will Ferrell) is the lead anchor of Channel 4's news station. Ron's life is one of fame and enjoyment along with his news team, the oddest people you'll meet. But Ron's life is about to change when a female reporter comes aboard by the name of Vernoica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). She becomes the love of Ron's life until she becomes co-anchor with him and soon they are arch-rivals. Ron's life is turned upside down as the story of his life nears. The story pretty much just follows the meeting and aftermath of Ron and Veronica. Their isn't exactly a plot, but it doesn't need one. It's a comedy!Ferrell fits right in another role where all he has to do is act stupid. However, Ferrell doesn't make you believe he is acting stupid, actually he's probably the smartest of the news team. As for the news team, they make the movie. With up-and-coming comedian Steve Carell as Brick the weatherman, Raul Rudd as the the reporter in the field, and David Koechner as our sportsman who can't keep his hands of a fine woman, how could you go wrong? While Rudd, Ferrell, and Koechner are hilarious, Steve Carell proves again he is one of the best comedians in Hollywood. His role as the retard (please don't take offense to that) weatherman with every scene involving him making no sense and every line, funnier then the last, he just keeps the laughs coming. Christina Applegate's role is not meant to be a fantastic role and isn't meant to bring many laughs but she does set up quite a few. The fight scene between her and Ron is one of the best scenes in the movie. She doesn't try to act scornful even though she comes off as it and Applegate doesn't overact once. Her lines are delivered perfectly and adds a little something to look at.Anchorman is the best comedy of '04 and Ferrell's best. He is finely given a good script of laughs instead of a family oriented, watered down , comedy film. It's crude at times but brings a smile to your face more than once and keeps you laughing the second and third viewing.Anchorman: The Legend of ROn Burgundy.

Stranger Than Fiction," Ferrell gives his best performance to date in a thoroughly enjoyable comedy/drama
","For the past 10 years Will Ferrell has been strictly known for his off the wall humor and crazy gags. His famous films include: Anchorman, A Night at the Roxbury and Talladega Nights. All of these films show Ferrell is very gifted at comedy but none show him as a man capable of truly acting in a drama. Up until this point there was little hope Ferrell would ever be more than a comedian who appealed to teenage audiences. Stranger Than Fiction changes all of that and brings out on of the finest performances of 2006.Stranger Than Fiction revolves around Harold Crick, a dull IRS Auditor who is obsessed with counting and has virtually no life beside his job. One day he begins to hear a voice narrating his own life, a voice only Harold can hear. As he struggles to figure out whether he is crazy or not with the help of a literature professor, he begins to audit the attractive baker Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who he begins to fall in love with. The story is different but it works and heres why.The story is very different but not so different everyone who watches is saying 'wtf?' The story is fresh. It strains away from the typical romantic comedies/comedy-dramas and makes its own little story afresh. The story also gives very in depth presentations of the characters. We begin to feel as if we actually no the characters, not just watching them. It is also a well executed story, there isn't too much to understand or any double meanings to everything, the film is straight forward with just a few questions arising every now and again which are suppose to be there to keep us guessing until the end.Will Ferrell, in my opinion, gives his best performance to date. Not because it is a drama and usually drama actors have to work harder then comedy actors, no, thats not the case here. Ferrell actually does give his best performance mainly because he isn't constantly screaming and saying obnoxious things. It is the first look into a more sophisticated Will Ferrell, though I don't mind having him in comedy films at all. Ferrell is able to portray the dull Harold Crick perfectly. He feels as if he has been doing the same thing all of his life. He never strays away from the personality he presents and that was the reason the film works so well, Ferrell is constantly in character, on screen.Gyllenhaal is not one of my personal favorites for films. I usually find her dull and trying to hard in her roles when I see her in a movie but maybe thats just me. I did liked her in this though. She seemed to be what was needed to make the film move along. I do feel that the relationship that develops between Harold and Ana is a bit far-fetched but nevertheless it still feels sweet as we watch the two interact. Overall Gyllenhaal's job is a job well done in Stranger Than Fiction.The film will make you laugh, it will make you feel good inside but it will also make you sad. Ferrell is able to put just the right amount of emotion into each scene to make them work and is the glue that holds the movie together. I don't think the movie would have been as good if Farrell had not been in it. I don't think teens will find this as enjoyable as I did. It doesn't have the sick humor and loads of nudity that seems to draw teens to most comedies these days. I think couples and anyone looking for a well acted, well written film would find this film to be a great piece to spend two hours watching.3.5/5 stars",7,1,2,24 October 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally Lucas Is Able To Redeem Himself
","I had walked out of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones feeling utterly disappointed. They same thing with The Phantom Menace. I really had little hope for the third installment of the prequels. I went to see the late show last night and was pleasantly surprised.The film starts out with a massive battle over Coruscant and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) flying through the explosions trying to reach the dark Sith lord Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) who has kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). After killing Dooku and rescuing the Chancellor, they return to Coruscant and Anakin to his forbidden wife Padme (Natalie Portman).Soon, Anakin discovers that his wife is pregnant and this throws his life into chaos. Obi-Wan is sent off to find the remaining Sepratists who are carrying on the Clone Wars. Anakin, on the other hand, is becoming very close to Chancellor Palpatine and eventually stops at nothing to protect, even killing other Jedi. Soon, Anakin is being seduced into the dark side and now he is the biggest enemy of the Jedi Knights.As I said above, this film redeems Lucas for his two earlier films. there still are some cheesy scenes between Padme and Anakin, but they were needed to emphasize why he was joining the dark side. The special effects are much improved and aren't overblown like in the first two. Lucas did try to cram a little too much into this, the Wookies were not needed but that's that's what you get when it takes two films to make the third one good. Far by the best scene in the film is the extermination of the Jedi which is beautifully filmed.The acting is definitely improved. Hayden Christensen playing a dark character is way better then him playing a sappy love story character. Ewan McGregor deserves special recognition for his role. He was absolutely amazing as the troubled Jedi Knight and mentor of the evil Anakin. He is totally believable and able to really suck you into the emotion he is feeling.Some scenes may be a little much for kids. I wouldn't recommend them seeing this, especially with some scenes like when Anakin walks into the Jedi Council Chamber and all of the kids come forward and then he ignites his lightsaber or when Anakin catches on fire after fighting Obi-Wan. o You'll have a good time, though. The action is well choreographed and the story is much improved. There's no more pointless lightsaber duels and shooting. All of it has a purpose of emphasizing the struggle between good and evil taking place.Thank's Lucas for the great entertainment of the past 30 years.Star Wars: Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.

The story is fun, its interesting, and it's smart. It's truly Disney at its best. The voices: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, and Whoopi Goldberg is stellar. The animation is at its best and the design of actual African animals is amazing. If only Disney could make more of these kind of movies.Anyone from kids to adults would like this film.

The Terminal," I didn't really buy the romance but was truly fascinated by the rest of it
","The Terminal is another co-operation work between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks. Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is an Eastern European just arriving in New York. Just as he gets off his plane he learns that his country has broke out into civil war.Viktor attempts to leave JFK Airport but is not permitted to go into the city or to get onto a flight home. Viktor must now wait patiently for the war to end so he may enter the city. Viktor takes up residence in an unfinished terminal while the newly appointed director of the airport Frank Dixon becomes ever frustrated by Viktor. Viktor is able to find ways to get money and uses his skills to earn a job actually building the airport. As Viktor slowly begins to adapt to the store he befriends and interesting group of guys. One he helps to get a date with a security guard, another he plays poker with, and the third believes the man to be a CIA agent. Viktor begins to enjoy life in the airport but never forgets the promise he made to his father.As Viktor lives and works there he becomes attracted to the flight attendant Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The film is truly a tale of how waiting patiently eventually pays off. Even though the film is highly intelligent and flows very well the romance I thought was not needed. I saw no connection between Viktor and Amelia.Tom Hanks however brought the movie out of the dust. His acting job is fantastic and the heavy accent makes him sound completely different. Hanks does give one of his best performances of his career. The film is highly emotional at some scenes including the first day Viktor is stranded in the airport and the scene where he translates for the desperate immigrant with the drugs.I thought the film is a bit updated version on Hanks earlier successful film Cast Away (2000) and is almost as good. I thought it was good. The end scene does get a little corny and the romance scenes aren't to strong but well thought out. The film has a good story, a good cast, and a strong message which made it very good.The Terminal.

The Shawshank Redemption," Powerful and Stunning
","(Spoilers)The Shawshank Redemption. A large Maine penitentiary where one convicted banker/murder ends up. Andy Dufrey (Tim Robbins) has landed a double life sentence in the penitentiary and must deal with life behind bars. During the duration of this powerhouse of a movie we see how inmates are truly institutionalized and their lives are virtually destroyed by their time spent in jail.After the suicide of Brooks, the movie takes a new turn and Andy's character begins to develop. He remodels the jail library, helps guards with their taxes and even finds the time to educate inmates. But during these times the Warden begins to bet Andy involved with illegal activity. Not to ruin it I'll leave it at that. The Shawshank Redemption is the definition of an amazing movie. While being entertaining and emotional the movie shows us the atrocities of jail life that only Stephen King could bring and how even in the darkest of times hope can survive. Robbins as Dufrey and Freeman as his buddy Red both do amazing jobs with their characters and deserved more than it was awarded by the Academy and Golden Globes.

Platoon," One of the Best War Films Ever Made
","I'm a sucker for good war movies but I had not really found a great Vietnam film until this. We Were Soldiers (2002) was good but didn't deal enough with the soldiers. This movie brought alive the atrocities of Vietnam and the horror's America committed in the war.Pvt. Chris Taylor (Carlie Sheen) has just been sent to Vietnam. He is young, untrained and afraid. Soon he is mixed in with a company under command of Sgt. Elias Grodin (Willem Dafoe) and SSgt. Bob Barnes (Tom Berenger) and soon witnesses the horror he will face in the year he is serving. After villages are burned and civilians killed under command of SSgt. Barnes, Pvt. Taylor comes to realize the war they are fighting is with themselves, the message Stone wanted to get across. As the movie progresses, you're confronted with a variety of characters played by now famous actors. Johnny Deep, Forest Whitaker, and Kevin Dillon just to name a few. This is the best Vietnam film ever made. The movie is filled with intense and gory action but it still brings its point forward.Charlie Sheen does the acting of his life along with Berenger and Dafoe. Taylor develops with his morals as he sees the horror of war brought forth and inhumane acts are performed before his very eyes. There are some very intense scenes involving the execution of a mentally-ill Vietmanese man and a soldier raping a girl in a village. The movie is emotional and powerful. Some very graphic battles and heavy language gave it the 'R' rating but it doesn't take away from this epic film.Platoon.

Raging Bull," An Excellent Biography and Boxing Film
","I had heard so much about this film throughout my years but never had the time to rent it or catch it on TV. Well I finally decided to rent the film and I must say, this is Scorcese's best film.The film is a biography of infamous boxer Jake La Motta played by Robert De Niro, middle-weight champion and a bit insane at the same time. The film takes the viewer through famous boxing matches and his personal life with his odd friendship with his brother Joey (Joe Pesci in his best performance ever) and his fifteen year old wife Vickey (Cathy Moriarty). The movie is well-filmed with excellent cinematography by Scorcese and Michael Chapman. The use of both slow-motion scenes and fast-paced frantic scenes are beautifully used to portray the film in an emotionally charged way. The film really shows the struggles that La Motta suffered the verge of insanity he was constantly touching.Joe Pesci surprised me and in my mind does the best acting of his career. De Niro is fantastic and overshadows Pesci a little. He's cruel, he's powerful, and he is emotional. The directing is brilliant and the acting superb. Raging Bull.

But soon his quiet, secluded life is disturbed when heartless ruler, Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow) when an law is passed to remove all fairy creatures and dump them in Shrek's swamp. While in this chaos, Shrek meets Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) and reluctantly sets off on a journey to Lord Farquaad's palace to get the creatures moved. After an encounter with soldiers in Farquaad's Disney-designed palace, he is told that they must go on a journey to retrieve Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz) from a castle so Farquaad may marry her. This is the only way Shrek may get his swamp back.Shrek, the film, is filled with Disney characters such as Three Blind Mice, Sleeping Beauty, Pinnochio, and Robin Hood (I'm not sure if he is a Disney character or not). Shrek, the character, is voiced by Mike Myers in a Scottish accent and is funny as the over-sized, green ogre. Donkey has the most laughs in the film, he is filled with comedy and is visually amazing with the design of massive castles, a fire-breathing dragon who falls in love with Donkey, and Shrek's unique hut.Most of the jokes are tended towards kids with a few adult jokes (Fiona fighting off the Merrymen Matrix style) and the film is a great for family audiences. Mike Myers goes from his goofy roles in Austin Powers to an angry, Scottish ogre whose best friend is a talking donkey.Shrek.

Bruce Almighty," Comedy With Sort of a Point
","(Possible Spoilers)Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is an upbeat news reporter for channel 5 in Buffalo. Everything, however, seems to be ruining his life. He's denied the anchor position, his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) is angry with him, and the next thing you now he's been fired. Soon, however, he starts to get paged and after awhile he calls the number.God (Morgan Freeman) meets Bruce in an empty building and after a hilarious sequence of 'how many fingers I'm holding up' Bruce receives God's powers. The movie becomes side-splitting funny after this point and continues on until a very strange yet important ending in which the city riots over four hundred thousand lottery tickets that are all the winning ticket.Carrey brings out a hilarious character in Bruce and Aniston perfect for the role of Grace. The message some may overlook that (if you believe in God or any creator) that it's not always the creators fault and job to make us happy. It is our responsibility. The acting is fine in the movie. The sequences of Carrey news reporting are ingenious. The movie (in my opinion) is Carrey's best since The Truman Show (1998) and Aniston is actually acting in this film (suprising!). Bruce Almighty.

Ben-Hur," Simply One Of The Best Film's Made
","What can I say? I had heard that this was a great film but thought only of it as an early version of Gladiator (2000) but I was wrong. Ben-Hur has all the parts that kept Gladiator from being an unforgettable film. Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is the young and rich Jewish prince of Jerusalem. He leads a quiet life and enjoys all the luxuries of a 1st century prince. Judah establishes a relationship with Roman soldier Messala (Stephen Boyd) and are happy to meet again years later while Messala commands the new legion moving into Jerusalem. But after a freak accident, Messala betrays Judah and the prince is sent to the galleys. But Judah never gives up hope and swears he will come back seeking revenge. Chalrton Heston is brilliant, he's a strong lead role, and delivers an unbelievable performance.Along the path of the story, we are confronted with a variety of biblical characters including: Pontius Pilate, Jesus Christ, Mary, and Balthasar (one of the three wise men). The film is fun overall. It doesn't hold the feeling of a 50's flick but a modern movie. The dialog is pretty good, the acting is at top game, and the sets are amazing for the time.Above all, the stadium where the chariot races are held and the sea battle are unbelievable. The film makes sense with a message of revenge and forgetting the past. The reason for the extra title 'A Tale of the Christ' pretty much has to do with message (Jesus' character is only in the film for about five minutes). This is probably one of the greatest film I have ever seen and recommend it to anyone who wants to see an epic. Ben-Hur.

Casino Royale," Daniel Craig enters in dominating fashion
","As another reviewer wrote, Daniel Craig is here to stay! You can always tell how the Bond franchise will do when a new actor enters as Bond. The list for good opening portrayals as Bond was only Connery and Brosnan, that is until Daniel Craig came in for the 21st film of the franchise. Craig blew me away from the beginning.The film opens with the origins of Bond. How he became a double-O and what his first mission really was. The story starts right after Bond has made his first confirmed kills. Bond is then sent on his next assignment, to stop the blood-weeping Le Chiffre, a banker who funds terrorists, from winning a high stakes card game in Montenegro so that he'll go broke and will have to surrender to MI6. Accoompanying Bond is the HM Treasury agent Vesper Lynd who is to handle money transactions for the high paying card game. When one looks at the story line, he or she would probably think, what a stupid idea for a film, a card game is the central plot? Come on. It turned out to be one of the best plotted films, from start to finish. The card game, when played, is enthralling and enjoyable. It was one of the best parts of the film seeing Bond use his brain and not his gun. In fact, the film shows us an entirely different side of Bond, a more believable and an easily acceptable side.What Connery and Brosnan were able to do to the Bond character was give him a personality of sorts. The films they acted in showed his psychological side more than just none stop action. Where Connery and Brosnan left off, Craig picks up. He shows the human side to Bond, the easy going yet determined agent. A man who can be overcome by his job. The film explores a lot with murder and how it affects a person, especially Vesper. THe film also has a lot more darker side to it, the torture scene being one of the darkest moments in a Bond film. Ion Productions has made a masterful work with Casino Royale. The problems are very minor and I can not reveal them for they may just be me. Martin Campbell proves yet again why he should be directing every Bond film from here on out. He has directed the two best Bond films since Goldfinger, GoldenEye and Casino Royale. Daniel Craig will blow you away with his acting and charisma. You will not want to move when the movie is running. Make sure you go to the bathroom and have your popcorn ready before the movie begins, cause once it starts, you won't leave that seat. 4.5/5 Stars",9,6,13,19 November 2006
Speed," How every action film should be
","Okay maybe every action film shouldn't follow the same plot but the spacing between action, yes. With a great cast Speed promises much and delivers a lot more. After an intense starting with the rescue of hostages from an elevator set to explode by terrorist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), Officer Jack Travern (Keaunu Reeves) and his partner Det. Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) are out to stop the same terrorist who has now planted several bombs aboard a city bus. Jack is able to board the bus with some difficulty and must take command of the situation immediately while Harry relays information to him from the office. As Jack tries to find a way to get the people of the bus, he is confronted with another problem. If the bus goes under 50 mph, the bus will explode. Taking the drivers seat after the bus driver is accidentally shot is Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) in the role that started her career. Now, along with Harry and the bus occupants, Jack must figure out a way to outsmart the terrorist and save the people aboard int his deadly cat-and-mouse game.Reeves is perfect for the role of Jack. He is smart, strong, and ever clever in his attempts to save people. Daniels creates the smart and ever reliable relief with a few words of caution and advice here and there. Even with Reeves and Daniels, Hoopers takes the cake as the best character, both in acting and in character. He's cunning, he's ingenious, and he is always ready with a smart remark. Unlike the Stephen Seagal films with every minute being filled with punches, shotgun blasts, and hand to hand combat, Speed is able to filter the action to when it is needed. The film is an action film but plays a lot on that of a thriller with buses speed always getting just close enough not to blow. The film works well and is one of the best action films out. With Reeves, Daniels, Hopper, and Bullock how could you go wrong?Speed. Starring: Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, and Sandra Bullock. 4 out of 5 Stars.",8,0,0,5 December 2005

","I went to see X2 with a couple of buddies and found the movie to be thoroughly entertaining. After the movie, I thought about the problems of being unwanted, hated, and the tragedy and violence against others, all presented in more comical ways in the film. The film comes back from where the first X-Men (2000) left off. The school is normal order under Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his mutant teachers: Storm (Halle Berry),Dr. Jean Gray (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), and the rebel mutant Wloverine (Hugh Jackman).After the government invades the school and capture a few students, the mutants must come together to stop the evil scientist William Stryker (Brian Cox) with the help of Magneto (ian McKellen) and a tele-porter named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming).

Fishbourne is perfect as the mentor of the troubled Chosen One. The film begins a story for what the life of Christ is like and is simply explained in the second and third film. The Wachowski brothers have made a classic sci-fi that will not be forgotten, at least for its special effects.The Matrix.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Sci-Fi Masterpiece
","Star Wars was considered a breakthrough in movie making and visual effects together and I agree. George Lucas has made what is considered the coolest and greatest universe ever. Having been denied from almost every major motion picture company he was able to get it released from 20th Century Fox.The story is simple yet extraordinary. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a young moisture farmer on the desert planet Tatooine and lives with his aunt and uncle. After buying two droids (robots) Skywalker hears a story and wants to help the beautiful Princess Leia being held by the evil empire. Skywalker ends up befriending a few unlikely characters: Han Solo (Harrison Ford) as a pilot, his sidekick and co-pilot Chewbacca the Wookie (Peter Mayhew), and Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and head for a large battle station to rescue her.But standing in their way is the evil empire, the robotic man Darth Vader, and his battle -station the Death Star which is able to destroy entire planets. The story, though pretty much a rescue story, is catchy and exciting filled with loads of action and encounters with hundreds of bizarre aliens. Star Wars is one of the best films I have ever seen and gave birth to the Sci-Fi industry in Hollywood. The characters are entertaining and slick. The action is faced paced and visually stunning.

300," Breathtaking
","The hype to see 300 has been building since September when the first teaser trailer was released and seen in theaters before the Oscar winning film The Departed. After months of anticipation, 300 was finally released nationwide and nearly every theater was sold out. Many are calling the film the wonder of '07, others, the best film since Sin City. I really couldn't formulate and opinion until I saw it for myself. I found the film o be breathtaking.300 follows the story right up to and including the Battle of Thermopylae. The main character is the King of Sparta, Leonidas. He's a born fighter and a skilled strategist having been raised in the rough society that was Sparta. Problems quickly arise when Persian Emissaries arrive demanding the surrender of Sparta. Leonidas makes sure that Persia knows his answer when he kills the messenger and his guards. The table is set for the invasion to begin and Leonidas marches his men to the sea to make sure Xerxes and his Persian Army does not enter Sparta unopposed.What follows is two stories. One of the Spartans at Thermopylae and the other of Queen Gorgo trying to convince the Spartan Council to go to war against Persia. Both stories are very interesting and very well written/acted. The story of Gorgo was shown a tad too much but it made it so that the film was not non stop action. Thermopylae is here most of the fun is at in the film.Gerard Butler is one of those few actors who makes you want o watch a film over and over again. In 300, he's no different. He's powerful, he's smart, and even funny in a few scenes. Butler is able to portray a powerful king willing to die for his men and his family. Gerard Butler is a phenomenal actor who is making a name for himself. Expect nothing short of an amazing performance from him in 300 along with all his other films.The battle sequences are over the top and incredible. Everything is choreographed but not made to look that way. Snyder used methods similar to the Matrix in filming the battles. Slowing down the camera, moving the camera's suddenly, etc, etc. The battles are not far apart and filled with historical fact of how armies fought (minus the obvious deviation from how a Greek Phalanx actually looked). They are entertaining and breathtaking. No action fan will be disappointed with the battle sequences.Filming style was a big thing for this film. Everything is shot in front of a blue screen to give a strange effect to the final product. The scenery used is breathtaking though everything is filmed indoors. The blue screen really made the actors focus on their acting rather than other small things in the film. Snyder was able to make us see a graphic novel come alive when he made the film 300.300 is bold, it's smart, and above all, it's historical fantasy. History buffs shouldn't go to see the film expecting history but instead a fantasy film with some historical facts to it. I prefer the fantasy element, it helped add to the surreal effect that the blue screen helped with. 300 is violent, it's bloody, and it's not for the faint at heart but if you want to see a top action/adventure/fantasy, watch 300.4.5/5 stars",9,4,9,12 March 2007
The Thin Red Line," In my book it was good
","I had the privilege of viewing The Thin Red Line on HBO a few days back and my mind is still fresh about it. The film follows the fateful battles of American forces in the plans to take Guadalcanal and two soldiers especially. Private Witt is played by James Caveizel and First Sergeant Edward Welsh is played by Sean Penn. Caviezel's character isn't really developed enough for my liking. Every time I saw him, I felt that he was just there for the thrill. He does show humanity to the Japanese prisoners and is brought around as the good soldier. Caviezel does give a fine performance even with the few lines he has. He helps you to understand the life of an innocent soldier, a kid in the war there because his country told him to go. Sean Penn's character is my personal favorite. Penn's character is the only man who is actually realizing the horrors of war and how much devastation they are causing. Malick should have given Penn more screen time because of the way his character and Caviezel's worked so well together.My favorite part of this film is the way nature is woven with the battle scenes. The battle scenes are unsettling and horribly graphic. But while the war rages on, Malick shows that there is a world beyond the battle. He works animals into the battles like I've never seen. The scene that struck me most was when the baby bird is shown with its feathers charred off and it's dying. It shows the true horror and devastation war has on everyone. The battles will shake you in a way you never thought possible. The scene in the village is one of the most heart-pounding and emotional battle scenes I've ever viewed.The lead characters are introduced with V.O. (Voice Overs) and in my opinion, is a fresh and interesting way to do so. For a WWII film, The Thin Red Line succeeds. The battles are brutal, the drama is solid, and the characters are somewhat believable unlike other WWII films (coughWindtalkerscough). The film is a step below Saving Private Ryan but still should not be missed. Nick Nolte gives a powerful performance as the commanding officer and some other supporting roles work well with the film. It is a shame the movie was cut back so much. A war film such as this should have been lengthened a little more, possibly to three hours or even more run-time. In the end, The Thin Red Line is excellent. The Thin Red Line. Starring: James Caviezel, Sean Penn, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Nick Nolte, and Adrien Brody.4 out of 5 Stars.",8,0,1,7 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Can't get much better
","What else can you say then that the Empire Stikes Back is part of one of the greatest trilogies every made. Being the second film in the old trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back works in a much darker way then the original Star Wars. The film starts out with our heroes on Hoth, an icy planet, while the empire chases after the Rebels. After an awesome land battle and a rebel defeat, Luke flees to seek help from a Jedi Master and Han and Leia are chased by Darth Vader in an asteroid field.The films visuals are extravagant, the land battle on Hoth and the whole asteroid chase are incredible. The film deals a lot more with morals and feelings. The whole temptation of the dark side is evident as we see Luke's training with Yoda, Vader's character is developed much more on a whole and play's the key character in the film. The ending with Luke and him is one of the greatest endings I've seen. Mark Hamill's character of Luke is still in more energetic, young stage but is quickly growing out of it. His training is a highlight of the film and is a great way to show his conversion to a Jedi. Han Solo makes up the lively, adventurous character who's stopping at nothing to save Leia and his ship. His scenes with Chewie, Leia, and C-3P0 are some of the most brilliant scenes in the trilogy.The character development in the film is about the same as in the first. The only difference, there is one, story-changing revelation at the end. The battle scenes are numerous and work well with the dark story line. The light saber duel at the end is the best in the two trilogies. Every actor is at their best and just misses being as good as the first. It is right with Return of the Jedi and helps to make the trilogy the best every made. Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams, and Frank Oz. 5 out of 5 Stars.",10,0,1,19 November 2005
Sin City," A beautifully filmed and written, overall dark film
","Sin City is yet another comic book turned film. But instead of Sin City being another cheesy comic book film where the superhero saves the girl from the clutches of an evil monster, the film is made into something I've never seen before in a comic book film. A visual masterpiece which is overall one of the darkest films I've ever seen, literally.Sin City follows the stories of three separate people living in the futuristic city of Basin City. Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is an ex-cop falsely accused of child molestation and sentenced to spend of a life of shame in solitary confinement. After being released, his only goal now is to protect young Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from the dark past both her and himself share. Marv (Mickey Rourke)is one of the ugliest people in the city but after having the night of his life, everything is about to change. Marv's lover and only friend, Goldie, is murdered by a superb assassin, Marv will stop at nothing to kill the man who murdered his love. And Dwight (Clive Owen) is the boyfriend of young waitress Shellie (Brittany Murphy) who is being harassed and abused by her ex-boyfriend. Dwight enacts revenge but realizes to late what may just set off a war between the cops of New Town and the prostitutes of Old Town. The three stories intermingle a bit and are all narrated by the three lead characters. The cast presented is one of the best I've ever seen and each actor is able to bring their own character to life. The story does not drag once as the film expands two hours. Some scenes are a bit nauseating and others, heart-touching.The film is almost entirely in black and white except for some beautifully shot scenes using colors to emphasize emotion and/ or personality. This is one of the most stunning films I've ever seen. It's bold, it's fresh, and above all else, dark.Sin City.

Gangs of New York," Too Long, Average
","(Possible Spoilers)Gangs of New York. Something most people would never think of. Probably a response would come of how all the gangs were in Chicago. However, this movie is set before the birth of Al Capone and his Italian gang. Set in 1863 New York, as the Civil War rages on, the movie let me down a little. Amsterdam Vallon is the son of murdered gangs leader Priest Vallon of the Dead Rabbits Irish gang. After a grotesque battle at the start of this film, the movie takes an awkward turn into a slow drama in which Vallon goes to work for his fathers murderer Bill The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) and then begins to plan against him. Gangs of New York was long, too long yet it was fascinating. Seeing how the Irish were actually treated coming from a famine stricken country and how they weren't afraid to stand up against government and society was interesting. I've researched this era and am quite familiar with what actually happened. The riots at the end of this film were portrayed accurately being based solely on the issue of drafting immigrants and Tammany Hall's sway in office. The city design and filming location was excellent.Acting was alright. Daniel Day-Lewis was solid as Bill, DiCaprio did a surprisingly good job as a main character yet Cameron Diaz as a main character in a historical drama made no sense. Visually the film was stunning and the history was accurate to a degree. Gangs of New York.

Windtalkers," No Successful Story and Little Acting
","I'm a big fan of war films and was hoping this would be another Saving Private Ryan (1998) but I was big time wrong. The story, I found was bland and the action getting to the point of stupidity.Sergeant Joe Enders (Nicholas Cage) is the only survivor of an engagement with Japanese forces in the jungle. Now he is a hospital back on a tropical island in the Pacific. Joe goes back into service a few weeks later and is assigned two Navajo code talkers Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) and Private Charlie Whitehorse (Roger Willie) to whom he must protect. Suddenly the battalion find's themselves in engagement after engagement which go on way to long. It seemed to me that during the battle Nicholas Cage was the only one doing any shooting and killing and is always leaping in front of an enemy machine gun nest but never being hit. The overall goal of the movie was to show the story of the 'Windtalkers' on the field of battle but that is quickly sucked up with Cage's character. Cage's character is made out to be this elite, troubled solider who is so much better at fighting than everyone else. In fact Cage's character could give Rambo a good fight if pitted against one another. The story is slow, it's boring, and it tries to work in a point of overcoming racism when there is none really present. The battles are mediocre at best and the plot is nonexistent.Windtalkers.

Braveheart," Inaccurate but Excellent
","(Spoilers)Braveheart. An outstanding film. This movie is based on actual events that occurred during the 12 and 13 hundreds. The main character is William Wallace, a man raised by his preacher uncle, and played by Mel Gibson. Wallace when we see him as a soldier is inspiring to the Scottish rebels at Sterling and at York and he was. Mel Gibson gave an outstanding performance as Wallace and a great performance by Patrick McGoohan as King Edward I.Now the downsides to me. William Wallace, though a protector of Scotland became ruthless after his invasion of England. It was said by a soldier that he spared man nor woman; monk nor nun. Also Longshanks (King Edward I) is made out to be a terrible king who murders at his own will, when in fact he cared lovingly for his people and his soldiers. And in fact at Falkirk as many as ten thousand Scots were killed before hand to hand combat began.Still the movie was amazing. An amazing score, directing (done by Gibson), and acting. There are more fine acting jobs in it than I have ever seen. It in fact deserved its Oscars. It was fine movie all around.Braveheart.

Coach Carter," An inspiring sports film
","Coach Carter is another film in association with MTV. But instead of being a film on rap or wild parties, Coach Carter is a drama and sports film dealing with a true-story. Ken Carter (Samuel L. Jackson) is a local sports store owner and a basketball fan of local Richmond High School team. After a friend asks him to coach, Ken accepts the job.The players are rebellious, they're crude, and they're violent. Coach Carter enacts a strict regime of strenuous workouts and requirements in the class room. The players are able to warm up to him and begin to have a great season before the class room reports come in. His players are failing miserably and it leads to the ultimate decision, benching every single one of them.Carter does this in order to put the players school work first and the move is meet with hostility. Players quit and parents and fans become hostile enough to call for his removal. As the lockout continues, players begin to realize that coach is doing this for there benefit and that he still has hope for them in the poor community. Now the only questions is will the players follow along with his lockout or cry in unison for his removal?As I said earlier this is based on a true story and is told beautifully. It brings back the old sense of sports movies such as Hossiers and Remember the Titans. Samuel L. Jackson is able to bring the Coach Carter to life with a loving personality but a near-brutal view to the game. The film influenced me greatly to work harder in school and did the same for many other people I know. The film conveys a powerful message of hope and understanding. The film presents teenagers on how they actually are; not in a bad way just in the usual smart-ass way. Each actor portraying a player, especially Rick Gonzalez and Antwon Tanner, is excellent in there own way. The films plot goes over nicely and the story flows well. The basketball scenes are filmed with great care and right on in accuracy. The film was very good. Just a notch below Hoosiers but conveys the same great message.Coach Carter. Starring: Samuel L.

Gladiator," A Modern Epic
","(Possible Spoilers)Gladiator could be considered the first great movie of the new millennium. It has story, it has history, it has romance, and it has action. But above all else, it has action. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the leader of Emperor Marcus Aurelius' (Richard Harris) legion in Germany. After a horrific battle to open the film, the Emperor is murdered by his power-hungry son, Commidus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus is sentenced to die. After an amazing escape, Maximus returns home to find his family murdered and home destroyed. Next thing you know he's being sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) a gladiator owner. The film is filled with amazing battle sequences held in the arena and a story of revenge that nearly matches Ben-Hur's (1959). Russell Crowe does an excellent job as the betrayed servant of Rome and the ability Joaquin Phoenix shows as a truly insane emperor is amazing. This film has some of the best acting I have ever seen. The film won (If memory serves me right) numerous awards and gratitude from critique's. The Colliseum is a tad to big compared to its actual size yet the director is still able to show how advance the Roman's were when it came to construction, battle tactics, and government. The look of Roman society is a bit off but it does not matter as that is not the focus of the film.Gladiator.

The Pursuit of Happyness," One of Smith's best performances in a decent story
","The Pursuit of Happiness (yes it is spelled wrong) was a film I had very few problems with. A film about dedication to family, never giving up, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done, the Pursuit of Happiness gets your attention early and does not release you until the end. In a time when pointless teen films seem to be coming out left and right with few meaningful movies here and there, the Pursuit of Happiness stands as a film with a meaning that is not out to just entertain.Chris Gardner is a struggling salesman in 1981 San Francisco. His wife is angry with him, his job is failing, and he is on the verge of being evicted. His wife finally leaves him and Chris and his son, Chris Jr., are forced out onto the streets. As they struggle to get back on their feet, Chris takes an internship at Dean Witter that pays no money. His hope, to get a job as a stock broker and give his son a better life who resides everyday at the Happiness Daycare while he waits for his father.Will Smith gives one of his most memorable performances. He is near perfect. Smith has always been a great actor but he really shines through as Chris Gardner. It's kind of similar to his performance as Ali. He isn't afraid to hold anything back as he portrays a struggling man trying to get back on his feet. His performance will move some to tears and others to stand and applaud him. This is one of Smith's best performances and is reason enough to watch it at least once.The story is strong: man trying to bring himself up from nothing to give his son a better life. The story is strong for the most part. There are some slow parts between Smith and his real life son Jaden. There really isn't anything pointless about the scenes that are slow just bad dialog was written. The movie also seems to try to make a point that all corporate executives care little about the people around them no matter what the case which is mostly false.Despite some flaws early and in the middle, the Pursuit of Happiness' meaning is clear. If you want to change something, you go change it. This message is made quite clear through Chris' actions in the film and Smith's powerful portrayal as him. I enjoyed the film very much. It's a lot better then some of the stuff that has been coming out nowadays/ It's a good family film and I recommend it to anyone especially people with children.3.5/5 Stars",7,0,0,26 May 2007

Harrison Ford finishes off his second classic trilogy (the other being Star Wars) and does it so superbly. Connery is hilarious as the off-beat father.

Back to the Future," A lot of fun
","Back to the Future is the kind of film for all ages. I have not come across many people who find this film to be stupid. A variety of ages, when asked, have told me they love the concept of the film, the story, the characters, etc etc. I agree with them whole heartedly. Back to the Future is one of those films I can go back to (no pun intended) again and again. It is a film that doesn't need brains to figure out, just watch and you'll enjoy it.Back to the Future follows the life of Marty McFly and his relationship with a crazy old scientist, Dr. Brown, who says he has discovered the secret to time travel. Due to odd circumstances Marty is sent back in time and the time machine (which is actually a buffed up DeLorean) breaks down, stranding him in the time when his parents were in high school. With the help of the younger Dr. Brown he must figure out a way to save his own existence when he messes up things between his parents and find a way to get 'back to the future'. Michael J. Fox is a great actor. He captures the spirit of a teenager though he was 24 when he did the film. He is the initiator of most of the jokes, though they don't come from his mouth. His inability to realize that he is in the past makes several awkward moments in the past, especially with the local bully and at a school dance. His performance is legendary in my book and one of the reasons I watch Back to the Future so often.Christopher Lloyd, I feel, is what made this film work. His eccentricity and his random proclamation of 'Great Scott!' makes his character work so well with what he is use to portraying. A veteran actor of Lloyd's background was needed to make the film work. If a serious actor had been put in the role, the film would not have worked. His odd approach to the character made his character and acting the funniest bit of all in the film.The portrayal of 50's life is right on par. Marty's interaction with it is some of the funniest things I saw in the film. Crispen Glover gives a solid performance as Marty's father back in the 50's. What I find great about the film though is how you feel for every character. You really do feel for George McFly (Glover) as he struggles to woe the love of his life Lorraine. A rarity in comedy indeed. You want Marty to get back to the 80's and you want Biff to get decked the whole film. The script is solid, the acting is superb, and the laughs are numerous.4/5 Stars",8,0,0,16 May 2007
Cinderella Man," Amazing. The Best Film of '05 So Far
","I went to see Cinderella Man last night not expecting much more than a good acting job from Giamatti and Crowe. Was I way off! The film follows the true-life story of legendary boxer James Braddock through his life during the Great Depression. The film starts with Jim breaking his hand, thus ending his prominent career and the family entering the Great Depression.Jim, his wife Mae, and their three kids struggle to survive through the winter of 1933 and to make ends meet to pay for electricity. Soon Jim is desperate for money and his ex-coach Joe Gould shows up wanting to help. He says that he has a fight for him against up-and-coming boxer Corn Lewis. After an unbelievable match, the underdog, who was picked to be K.O. in the first round wins. His life is now sent into boxing again, something he never thought he'd do again.The film is beautifully filmed rotating from shots of the boxing ring to the Hooverville in Central Park. The fight scenes (boxing actually) are creatively edited and filmed with style. You really get sense for the fighters and actually feel like your getting hit at a few scenes. But each fight scene is in good taste and truly shows what Braddock had to overcome. Not to much blood which also I think helped the fight scenes.Russel Crowe is good as ever but overshadowing him is my new favorite actor Paul Giamatti playing Joe. Giamatti is a bit of comic relief, a sense of hope, and a caring character destined to help his friend and partner. Renee Zellweger is better then usual, she isn't annoying and gives an excellent performance. Even Craig Bierko is able to portray Max Baer (Braddock's foe in the final bout) as a strong, impressive boxer, capable of killing his opponent in the ring.One down side is some parts of the movie are a bit to sentimental. But even those are few and far between. Character development is average. Renee Zellweger's character is never really developed nor the family. Giamatti and Crowe's character's expand though and develop. Still the story is good, you almost want to cry at some scenes and you're on the edge of your seat ever fight scene, especially the final with Baer. This film is just a step below Raging Bull (1980) which is pretty good considering that Raging Bull is one of the best films ever made.Cinderella Man.

The sole goal of the guests now is to get off the island with their lives.The film was a major advancement in visual effects and animatronics. Film crews actually building a T-Rex and designers virtually building velociraptors. The scenes are beautifully shot and filled with action. The film is a little intense for children even though they may love dinosaurs. The book I am currently reading and is close to film.

The Simpsons Movie," Nothing to write home about, funny at times, a bit dry at others
","Many people have been waiting for the Simpsons Movie to come out for nearly 10 years. Ever since the website was launched back in 1997 people have been anticipating the film to be released. Finally it was green lit and the Simpsons Movie was released on the 27th of July, 2007. I managed to see it opening night with a packed house, some even dressed as the Simpsons characters we have come to love. I must admit I never thought I'd watch the Simpsons with 300 people around me, let alone in a movie theater.The plot is pretty Simpson-like. Springfield has become a polluted city and the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) decides to drop a massive dome on the city to prevent the pollution and the citizens from escaping the area, all with approval from President Schwarzenegger. Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks doing great voice acting again) is out to keep every Springfield citizen inside the dome no matter what. The Simpsons escape and become fugitives but begin to work on freeing Springfield from the evil Cargill and EPA.The voice acting is at its best. Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria and Yeardley Smith are all exceptional as the characters they have portrayed so long from the show. I did have a few problems with the characters in the film however. The film gives Bart more feelings then are usually customary for his brat-like attitude. He becomes to caring in the film and is less funny then usual. Now Homer is ten times funnier then I have seen him in the past 5 seasons of the Simpsons. Marge and Lisa are still their normal selves. A few characters are all but cut from the film including: Principal Skinner, Mrs. Krabappel, and Mole Man. The flow of the film is a bit bad. They'll be a stretch of 10 minutes without a laugh then a bunch of laughs in another stretch. I felt they could have spread out the jokes a little more, especially toward the end of the film when there seemed to be far fewer jokes then in the first half hour. Most of the jokes are Simpson-like: easy to understand, low blows, and a bit of slapstick. A few jokes will have you on the floor crying they are that funny while others you may be like 'wtf?' Though that only happened twice for me. However the jokes are way better then what have been on TV for the past few seasons. A few downsides was that I believe the people making this felt that had to include as many characters as they possibly could. For no apparent reason some characters just show up, say something, then aren't seen the rest of the film. I didn't think that was really necessary. Mr. Burns and Smithers should have been used way more then just the two scenes they were in. Also I felt the need for celebrities to make guest appearances, while a part of the shows storied history, was also unneeded. I saw nothing funny about Tom Hanks appearing for a scene as well as Green Day being in the opening scene of the film which gets things flowing. I felt The Simpsons Movie was wasting precious minutes they could have put to more funny things (though when the barge Green Day is on begins to sink and the band members begin to play violins reminiscent of the scene from Titanic, I did laugh).Overall, I would not call The Simpsons Movie by any means a waste of time. Fans of the show will love it as I did. There were some stretched out, overall boring scenes that could have been shortened but the comedy made up for most of it. I can honestly say it is the funniest I've seen Homer since 1998. It's well worth a visit to the local movie theater. There ain't too much language, there's a lot of laughs and I think it will give anyone who is a fan of the show a good time though some may be disappointed for the reasons I stated above.3/5 stars",6,6,11,29 July 2007
The Wizard of Oz," The Birth of Fantasy
","The Wizard of Oz has given birth and inspired hundred's of fantasy films over the years and above all of them, this is still one of the best. With a colorful cast of characters and actors, a genius screenplay, and writer's imagination, The Wizard of Oz is the mother of all fantasy films and a milestone in film history.Dorothy (Judy Garland) is the loving daughter of a family in Kansas. She is caring and has a small friend in her dog Toto but one day while walking home, something incredible happens. A tornado hits the small town and Dorothy is knocked out by it and awakens in a house which she does not recognize. She walks outside to find tiny people walking about calling themselves Munchkins'. Suddenly the Wicked Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) appears and accuses Dorothy of killing her sister. Dorothy is saved by the Good Witch Glinda (Billie Burke) and she is told that in order to return to Kansas she must follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Wizard of Oz. Along the way she meets a Tin Man, a Scarecrow, and a Cowardly Lion all seeking the wizard and decide to join Dorothy. But along the way she will be attacked by the Wicked Witch of the West and her evil flying monkeys. Only through companionship and determination will they be able to get past her minions and reach the wizard of Oz.The story is imaginative, it's creative, and it's plain old fun. The designing of each character is phenomenal from the cowardly lion desiring nothing but courage to the munchkins being a tiny clan of singing workers. The Wizard of Oz gave way for the art of story telling and imaginative thinking now present in some films. Judy Garland wasn't exactly the best choice for Dorothy but she held her own with the other actors. Jack Haley is the best of the companions being smart, friendly and in my opinion had the most thought put into. The Wizard of Oz. Starring: Judy Garland, Jack Haley, Bret Lahr, Ray Bolger, and Frank Morgan.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars",9,2,3,14 May 2005
Dodgeball," I laughed so hard it hurt
","Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is simply hilarious. The film stars Vince Vaughn as Peter La Fluer, the owner of Average Joe's Gym. Peter's gym is, however, is going under and being bought there next door neighbor, Global Gym. In charge of Global Gym is health freak White Goodman (Ben Stiller) who has sought only to buy Average Gym. Along with Peter are his good friends Gordon, Owen, Justin, Dwight, and Steve the Pirate who are all determined to save the gym.Seeing it as there last option, they enter a dodge ball tournament in Las Vegas. The dodge ball scenes are all hilarious from Pack 417 to the Break Dancing Dodgeball team I was crying it was so funny. Vince Vaughn is funny and is able to bring the sense of a man being down on his luck while being funny at the same time. However, Ben Stiller takes the movie into the hilarious film it is. Being so determined to one-up Peter, Ben Stiller makes no sense in what he says and what he does, I fell out of my seat laughing watching the bar scene. Rip Torn, as there coach is probably the second best only to Stiller. With such great scenes as the wrench dodging scene, you'll find it impossible not to laugh.Christine Taylor is also in the film as the only female dodge ball player on Average Joe's. She isn't exactly funny but she does bring some quality acting. What was so surprising to me, though, was the way the writer was able to write so much simple comedy and make it absolutely hilarious. The cameos are over the top with appearances by Lance Armstrong, Chuck Norris, David Hasselhof, and William Shatner and make the movie even more silly. But no matter how silly, how stupid it got it continued to be funny and passed a good hour and a half.Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Starring: Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Rip Torn, Christine Taylor, and Alan Tudyk.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",9,0,1,30 August 2005
