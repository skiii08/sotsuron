Requiem for a Dream," The Dark Ladder
","Delineating a quadruple downhill spiral of escalating drug addiction and hallucinatory madness, Darren Aronofsky's 2000 offering, 'Requiem for a Dream,' is some pretty intense stuff indeed. In it, Oscar-nominated Ellen Burstyn plays Sara Goldfarb, a sweet Jewish senior living in Brighton Beach who becomes devastatingly hooked on purple, blue, orange and green diet pills, while her son (Jared Leto), his pal (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) go down what Joni Mitchell has referred to as 'the dark ladder' of heroin addiction. This interesting dual story line is made even more effective by the great acting jobs turned in by the film's four principals, and the very flashy, stylized direction that Aronofsky employs, utilizing split screens, slo- and fast-motion photography, rotating camera work, fish-eye lenses, strobe lights, etc. Burstyn surely did deserve her Oscar nomination in this role, and the film, I feel, should have been singled out for its direction, photography and editing, as well...not to mention the incredible makeup job that Judy Chin & Co. accomplished, turning the still-glamorous Burstyn of 2000 into an overweight senior, and then a gaunt and grizzled hag. So yes, the film IS intense, but 'not for the squeamish,' as has been reported? With the exception of one fork shoved through a hand, and the quite unpleasant sight of Jared shooting up into a very messed-up (gangrenous?) arm, the picture is not at all quease inducing. By the film's end, the dreams of all four characters (the perfect dope score, a dress shop, to be on TV) lie crushed beneath a cold and miserable reality. This is a picture that transpires over the course of a summer, fall and winter; for its four main, pitiful characters, there is no spring....",7,1,2,30 September 2009
Unbreakable," Deliberately Paced But Fascinating
","Only got to see one film over the weekend, but it was a most enjoyable one. The movie was 'Unbreakable,' which I had wanted to see ever since it was released in 2000. Many of my coworkers were raving about it back when, but it took me almost 17 years to catch up with it. It is the M. Night Shyamalan film that immediately follows 'The Sixth Sense,' which up until last night, was the only M. Night movie that I had ever seen. In this one, Bruce Willis stars again, this time as David Dunn, a football-stadium security guard who is the sole survivor of a horrific train accident. He soon comes to realize that he has never been injured in his entire life...or had a single sick day! Oddball comic-art gallery owner Samuel L. Jackson tries to convince him that he is special, while Bruce's estranged wife, Robin Wright Penn, looks on in confusion. Ultimately, the viewer realizes that he/she is watching nothing less than a genuine superhero movie, albeit a very realistic one. Dunn's superpowers turn out to be unusual strength and the ability to sense the evil deeds of anyone he comes in contact with. He tackles a psycho home invader in a very tense finale, but M. Night has one more twist ending up his sleeve, as he had in 'The Sixth Sense.' The film is a deliberately paced, quiet affair, but a fascinating one, nevertheless. Quentin Tarantino has gone on record as saying that he feels that Bruce gave his career-best performance here, and he really is very fine and understated in this one. I have heard that the character that Bruce plays here makes a belated return in this year's Shyamalan film 'Split,' and I do hope to catch that one now at some future point. 'Unbreakable' comes very highly recommended by yours truly. I have one more film by the man on tap, and that one is 2004's 'The Village,' which seems to suffer with very mixed reviews. Stay tuned....",8,0,1,26 April 2017
Monster," Who Needs A Radioactive Brontosaurus?
","Despite its title, 2003's 'Monster' is a shocking picture with no zombies, no aliens and no slime creatures, vampires, sentient blobs, dinosaurs, werewolves or mutants. Rather, it is a film dealing with a much more human kind of monster, specifically Aileen Wuornos, the Michigan-born prostitute turned serial killer who was convicted in Florida in 1992 for the murders of six men (she was never prosecuted for the murder of a seventh, whose body was never found), served over a decade on Death Row, and was ultimately put to death by lethal injection in 2002. The film, masterfully written and directed by Patty Jenkins, only glancingly mentions Aileen's sexual molestations as a child, her prostitution at age 12 and her pregnancy at age 14, and never mentions the criminal career (charges for DUI, disorderly conduct, armed robbery, grand theft auto, resisting arrest, jail time, etc.) she indulged in before the events depicted. In the film, we first encounter a suicidal Aileen in 1989, right before she meets the fictitious Selby Wall, a character based on real-life bar maid Tyria Moore. As happened in actuality, the two meet in a gay bar, their initially platonic relationship soon turning physical, and Aileen begins hooking with a vengeance--and killing with a vengeance, too--to support her young girl 'in style.' 'You'll never meet someone like me again,' Aileen tells Selby as they run away together; a good thing for Selby, too, as things turn out!Anyway, at this point, going on a full decade after 'Monster''s release, you surely don't need ME to tell you how brilliant South African actress Charlize Theron is in the lead role--the Oscar, Golden Globe, SAG award and more than a dozen other honors that she deservedly garnered for her work here should tell you something about her courageous performance. I will say, however, that she really does completely immerse herself in the character, and that the 30 pounds she reportedly gained for the role, plus some remarkable makeup work and those ghastly prosthetic teeth, make her look uncannily like the real deal. Christina Ricci (currently flying high on TV's 'Pan Am') as Selby, one of her early adult roles, is also excellent; the two make for one unlikely yet touching pair, and the desperate love that Aileen feels for this young waif allows us to actually sympathize with her, despite her murderous acts. As to those murders, we see four of the seven, and the initial one almost seems justified on Aileen's part; a clear case of self-defense. Her later homicides are far less defensible, however; indeed, the final two shown are quite horrific, fully validating the film's title. Jenkins wisely chose to shoot her film on the actual locations where events occurred, lending her film a seedy verisimilitude, and the young director does a terrific job; one can only wonder how she will fare on the upcoming 'Thor 2'! Her script, as I mentioned, excises the earlier segment of Aileen's life and concentrates on the touching relationship between the two gals, turning the film, almost, into a tragic love story; why Tyria Moore was turned into the fictional Selby is anybody's guess. Legal reasons, perhaps? Regardless, Jenkins' script allows us to peek into this notorious killer's mind, and manages to make the monster altogether human, recognizable and (hard to believe) almost admirable. I would be remiss if I did not mention the terrific, original musical score by the composer only known as BT (middle name Larry, I wonder?); it greatly complements the sometimes sweet, oftentimes appalling events on screen, and makes inspired use of the 1968 Tommy James and the Shondells hit 'Crimson and Clover.' All told, 'Monster' is a truly accomplished, ultimately saddening piece of work. Indeed, who needs to be shocked by a giant crab monster or radioactive brontosaurus when we have the spectre and the memory of Aileen Wuornos?",Null,0,1,17 October 2011
The Babadook," The Horror From Down Under
","When the Australian horror film 'The Babadook' was released here in the U.S. in November 2014, 10 months after its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, it was moderately successful at the box office and received almost universal praise from the critics. Somehow, I managed to miss the film back then (I happen to miss most new releases, actually, in my quest to see as many great classic/old films on the big screen as possible at NYC's several revival houses), but have wanted to see it ever since, especially inasmuch as the film holds an almost unprecedented 98% approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website! A recent showing on one of the Showtime stations has finally enabled me to catch up with this truly frightening picture, however; one that has grown into something of a cult item and cause celebre since its release six years ago. I knew absolutely nothing about the film when I sat down to watch it the other night, had no idea what a 'babadook' was, and felt a bit concerned about possibly not being able to follow those Aussie accents (a stumbling block for me in the past), but you know what? I found myself quite loving this marvelously scary and emotionally moving picture, and can now understand what all the fuss has been about. (And those accents, as it turned out, were not a problem here, either!)As many others have already discovered, the film introduces us to a lonely widow named Amelia Vanek (remarkably well played by Tasmanian actress Essie Davis), a worker in a nursing home who lives with her 6-year-old son Sam (Noah Wiseman) in a suburb of Adelaide, in South Australia. We learn that on the day Sam was born, Amelia's husband, Oskar (Ben Winspear), had been killed in a car crash while driving her to the hospital. Can you imagine? Now, as Sam's 7th birthday/the anniversary of her husband's death approaches, Amelia finds herself once again trying to subsume the pain. She has pushed away the grief and refused to deal with her loss over the years, we sense, and this state of denial will lead to horrific events as the film proceeds. Sam, we also see, is a child who lives in perpetual fear of monsters, even going so far as to cleverly construct weapons (such as dart throwers and rock catapults) against them. So it is perhaps not the wisest idea for Amelia to be constantly reading him horrific bedtime stories. On this one night, she reads to him from a particularly disturbing pop-up book called 'Mister Babadook'; a pop-up book that has popped up in the house from out of nowhere. The Babadook monster in this book is a singularly gruesome creature, a top-hatted figure with talons (supposedly based on the Lon Chaney character in 1927's lost film 'London After Midnight') who will come to your house, after making itself known by thumps and knocks, make your life miserable, and eat your insides out! Shortly thereafter, Sam's mania about the creature reaches a fever pitch, to the point where Amelia finds it necessary to sedate him. She tears the pop-up book to shreds and throws it away, only to find it reassembled and sitting on her doorstep one morning! Strange knockings and thumpings are heard in the house, she finds glass in her food, a roach infestation is discovered in her kitchen, and, in perhaps the film's most chilling scene, the Babadook itself is seen at night, hovering on her bedroom ceiling. After many sleepless nights, Amelia begins to crack, and her personality begins to alter, as the audience wonders whether or not she is just irritable and exhausted, or if perhaps she is beginning to undergo a personality change; a possible possession. It is only when she begins to verbally and then physically threaten her son that the viewer understands that she has indeed been taken over by the Babadook, and that Sam's suspicions about the entity have been correct all along....'The Babadook' was the first full-length film by Australian director Jennifer Kent, based on her own short film of 2005, simply entitled 'Monster' (this short film accompanies the longer film in its DVD incarnation, I've heard, and I would love to take a look at it one day), and most viewers, I have a feeling, will find it remarkable that Kent both wrote and directed the 2014 film, so very accomplished an effort is this debut. Kent's script is a wonder, and her direction is very self-assured and stylish. Her film can be seen and understood on several levels, a fact that has apparently been the subject of lively debate during these past six years. On a surface and simpler level, we can see the Babadook as merely a monster that possesses Amelia and causes her to threaten her child. But on a deeper and more plausible level, the Babadook can be understood as the manifestation of Amelia's repressed grief; of all the unresolved feelings that she has refused to deal with over the years. Not for nothing does the Babadook take the form of her deceased husband Oskar at one point; not for nothing is the monster ultimately shown to be impossible to slay, but only amenable to confinement. So yes, the film is much more than just another mindless monster movie. Kent has lots to say here about the mother/child relationship, about grief and its aftermath, and about how we move on in life after a tragedy. 'I want to create a myth in a domestic setting,' Kent was quoted as saying after the film's release, a statement that one can read as one wishes, regarding the Babadook's being an actual monster or merely a manifestation of Amelia's grief. Fortunately, the film works extremely well on either level.And Kent is abetted here by a raft of very fine performances, particularly from her two leads. Little Noah Wiseman is very fine and affecting as the disturbed child Sam, and Essie Davis is just amazing as Amelia, giving an Oscar-caliber bit of thesping here in a portrayal that demands much of her. She makes us feel Amelia's grief and loneliness just by the expressions on her face when she sees a happy couple necking in a car, or when she sits in her living room watching television by herself. Her Amelia is a beautiful woman, with a kind of Michelle Pfeiffer quality, but one who is beginning to look decidedly frayed by the cares and woes of her existence. Davis is equally compelling, however, when she starts to become possessed by the Babadook, and her foul-mouthed, threatening and ultimately murderous tantrums are really something to behold. It is a tremendous performance, truly, that runs the gamut of emotion, and Davis is fully invested in it.'The Babadook' is a film with any number of startling moments that will leave the viewer slack jawed and chilled. Besides the aforementioned one, with the title creature hovering on the bedroom ceiling, we have the one in which Amelia yanks out one of her own teeth that had been paining her (a scene reminiscent of the one in 2006's 'Bug,' which I had recently watched); the scene in which Amelia loses control of her car, after it has been infested with cockroaches; the one in which she vomits black bile in a copious flood; the one with Oskar's return; and really, the entire final half hour of the film, with Amelia and her son playing a cat-and-mouse game with each other throughout the house. And in a film with so much in the way of shocks and chills, how appropriate is it that Amelia, at one point, is shown to be watching, on her TV, one of the scariest scenes of all time, the one with the hideous hag in Mario Bava's 'Black Sabbath' (1963)? William Friedkin, the director of the film that many consider to be the ne plus ultra of horror, 1973's 'The Exorcist,' has since gone on to declare, regarding 'The Babadook,' 'I've never seen a more terrifying film,' and that should tell you something right there. But of all the shocks and scares in the film, none can compare with the sight of Amelia, who we have seen to be a loving and caring mother, as she begins to transform into a hate-filled and homicidal creature, as the Babadook, the essence of her concentrated and undealt-with emotions, begins to overwhelm her. Could anything be more frightening than the sight of a once-loving parent changing into...something else? Fortunately for all concerned, Amelia is able to, uh, work through her issues, and confine the Babadook to a place where it can be controlled.Kent's film closes on a sweet and hopeful note, leaving the viewer trusting that the Vaneks will go on to enjoy a happy life, and that perhaps Amelia will find herself a boyfriend with her kindly coworker Robbie (Daniel Henshall). The film is surely left wide open enough for a possible sequel, which apparently the author's fans have been clamoring for all these years, to Kent's adamant refusal. And you know what? Perhaps it's just as well to leave things as they are, with the Babadook safely tucked away where it can do no harm....",8,0,1,12 June 2020
The Others," Haunting
","With its sterling reputation as one of the best cinematic ghost stories since 1963's 'The Haunting,' Alejandro Amenabar's 2001 film 'The Others' was one that this latecomer plopped into his DVD player with great anticipation. And I am happy to report that all the positive word of mouth is right on the money, and that this really is some kind of great work. As most folks seem to have already discovered, 'The Others' takes place on the isle of Jersey in 1945, where Grace (superbly played by Nicole Kidman) awaits the homecoming of her soldier husband, whilst caring for her 'photosensitive' children and breaking in some new domestic help. Soon, though, Grace's worries are greatly added to by strange noises upstairs, the sound of a sobbing child, and the tinkling of a piano in an empty room. It would seem that her lavish mansion has been invaded by...spirits? Featuring an endlessly fascinating story line, interesting characters, fine production values, a creeping sense of dread and a good number of jolts, 'The Others' really does make for a top-notch, classy horror movie. Amenabar not only wrote the screenplay for and directed this great picture, but also provided the film's lovely/creepy score. (The man must be some kind of a friggin' genius!) Fionnula Flanagan (who, incidentally, impresses me no end by dint of her having appeared on three 'Star Trek' series!) is marvelous here as the housekeeper, Mrs. Mills; how wonderful to see her and Kidman giving two very Oscar-worthy performances in their many shared scenes. The picture features an absolutely brilliant ending that I was not prepared for (those who have read E.F. Benson's 1923 story 'Mr. Tilley's Seance' will perhaps appreciate this ending even more), and that final shot of Kidman and her children in an upstairs window is just...haunting. I found this film even better and deeper on a repeat viewing. More than highly recommended.",9,2,4,14 May 2008
American Pie," 'One Time, In Band Camp....'
","It is one of the most beloved comedies of the last decade, seemingly revered by all members of Generations X and Y; the first of a series that supposedly includes no less than three inferior sequels; AND the popularizer (if not the originator) of the term 'MILF.' It also jump-started the careers of actresses Shannon Elizabeth, Alyson Hannigan, Tara Reid and Mena Suvari. So I thought it was high time that this baby boomer finally caught up with 1999's 'American Pie,' and you know what...this film really is some funny stuff, and had me--a hard person to make laugh out loud--laughing out loud any number of times. The film's plot, about four soon-to-be-graduating high school guys (Jim, Oz, Kevin and Finch) in pursuit of the Holy Grail (i.e., losing their virginity by the night of the senior prom), may seem like a familiar one, but it is fleshed out with likable and amusing characters and benefits immensely by a brightly clever script. Among the funny scenes are any that include Eugene Levy as Jim's embarrassingly decent, well-meaning father from hell (the scene with the dirty magazines is a riot!); the plight of poor Finch in the ladies' rest room; the initial making of the boys' pact; and, of course, any bit with 'the Shermanator,' the most hilarious would-be (nerd) Lothario until 'Superbad''s McLovin' came down the pike eight years later. The film has a raunchy exterior and a sweet soul, and ultimately gives its audience the mixed message that sex is always better when it is combined with true love. Especially if one really loves warm apple pie!",7,0,1,20 August 2009
The Village," What ARE Maltin And Ebert Talking About?!?!
","On a Monday night, as a sleet/snow storm loomed here in the NYC area, I watched another film from M. Night Shyamalan--my second Shyamalan film in two days, following 'Unbreakable'--and it was another one that I greatly enjoyed: 2004's 'The Village.' In this one, a small, rural, Amish-like community, in what would appear to be the late 19th century, lives in mortal fear of the surrounding forests and the creatures that inhabit it. The writer/director keeps the suspense ratcheted up fairly high throughout, leading to another of his patented surprise/twist endings. Actually, I knew what the ending was before I watched the film; as with 'The Sixth Sense,' it is almost impossible NOT to have heard about this ending before going in. Still, that did not interfere with my enjoyment of the film, and actually allowed me to marvel out how adroitly the director plays fair with the audience throughout. The picture is gorgeous to look at in high def, and features a most impressive cast of pros: (Ron Howard daughter) Bryce Dallas Howard (whose performance I had enjoyed in the recent 'Jurassic World'), Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Jesse Eisenberg and Brendan Gleeson. I really don't know why this film has been so savaged by critics. Roger Ebert apparently detested the film, putting it on his 'Most Hated' list, while the Maltin guide calls it 'downright ridiculous.' I suppose that the film is a bit contrived in parts, but that didn't take away from its artful qualities and ability to frighten, for me. Most assuredly recommended!",8,2,3,26 April 2017
Split," A Dude With TOO Much Personality....
","Over the years, there have been any number of films that have dealt with lead characters who suffer with what the layman might term 'split personality.' Putting aside all the many iterations of the Jekyll & Hyde story, in 1957, audiences were given both 'Lizzie,' in which Eleanor Parker played a woman with three distinct personalities, and, five months later, the more well-known 'The Three Faces of Eve,' in which Joanne Woodward played a woman with the exact same predicament. In 1960, theatergoers were shocked out of their showers via their introduction to Tony Perkins' Norman Bates, a young man who was also his own mother, in Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho.' The situation was played for laughs in 1963's 'The Nutty Professor,' with Jerry Lewis portraying the hapless Prof. Julius Kelp AND his alter ego, the Dean Martin-like Buddy Love. But you would have to take all the preceding alter egos, and perhaps toss in later films such as 1992's 'Raising Cain' (in which John Lithgow sported three personalities) and 2007's 'Sybil' (in which the titular character, played by Tammy Blanchard, possessed no fewer than 16!), to exceed the number of disparate types to be found living inside one person, in M. Night Shyamalan's most recent offering, 2017's 'Split.'  The film introduces us to a most unusual character...or should I say, 'horde' of characters (no wonder the news media later refers to this personage as 'The Horde'!). He is Kevin Wendell Crumb--brought to remarkable life by the Scottish actor James McAvoy--a Philadelphia native (as have been so many of the director/writer's previous lead characters) who suffers with the condition known as DID: dissociative identity disorder. As a matter of fact, his psychologist, Dr. Karen Fletcher (Betty Buckley), has identified no fewer than 23 (!) personalities residing inside his noggin, each waiting patiently in his or her 'chair' for a chance to step forward 'into the light.' (And if this setup strikes some as being a bit improbable, I might add here that the real-life Eve evinced a full 22 personalities, and required a good 17 years of psychotherapy as a consequence!) Somehow, Crumb has managed to live a fairly low-key life in modern society, even managing to hold down a job as a dress designer, thanks to the talents of one of his many personae, Barry. But following a prank of a sexual nature perpetrated on him by a group of randy schoolgirls, Kevin snaps, and is soon seen kidnapping three young women in the parking lot of the King of Prussia Mall. Those three women--Claire (Haley Lu Richardson), Marcia (Jessica Sula) and Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy)--are incarcerated in some kind of underground bunker, while their captor intimidates them as successive personalities of his step into the light. Thus, we get to see McAvoy essay a good half dozen of Kevin's 23 inner personae; for example, the 9-year-old Hedwig, the dressy Patricia, and the unflappably in-command Dennis. But Dr. Buckley grows increasingly concerned with her patient, when Dennis/Barry informs her that a 24th personality, which he terms 'The Beast,' is soon to emerge. And since the good doctor knows that each of Kevin's personalities can effectively transform his body chemistry as it enters the light, there is every reason for concern...especially since this Beast is said to be extremely large, very fast, very powerful, able to climb walls (!) and, as it turns out, somewhat cannibalistic as regards dietary requirements.... 'Split' was produced on a budget of a mere $9 million and proved to be a box office smash, bringing in around $280 million all told. And there was very good reason for this. The film is a remarkably suspenseful affair, and every attempt that our trio of young prisoners makes to escape from their cell is a nerve-racking one. The three young actresses on display here are all terrific, especially Taylor-Joy. Her Casey character is both beautiful and interesting, and the director shows us her history in flashbacks that allow us to see why she is so well suited to survive in this horrendous situation (her father had trained her in outdoor shooting and survival skills), and why she is the introverted young lady that she is today (a bit of sexual molestation on the part of a skeevy uncle would do that for anyone!). The film makes good use of its autumnal scenery--Philly and its surroundings have never looked more gorgeous--and Shyamalan's script is a clever one. But best of all is McAvoy, whose sextuple performance is practically Oscar worthy. Not since Alex Guinness in 1949's 'Kind Hearts and Coronets,' in which the beloved British actor essayed no fewer than nine distinct roles, and perhaps Peter Sellers in 1964's 'Dr. Strangelove,' in which the actor gave the world three entirely different and truly memorable characters, has a performer attempted such a feat, AND brought it off as successfully. And for those who are wondering if Shyamalan once again pulls the rug out from beneath his audience's expectations with one of his patented surprise endings, the answer is a decided 'yes'; an ending that sets the viewer up for a sequel that also ties into another of the director's previous films. I don't think I'm giving anything away here at this late date by saying that this sequel is to be entitled 'Glass,' and that it will be coming out in January 2019. Personally, it is a film for which I cannot wait....",7,5,9,5 June 2018
It Follows," A Pretty Unsettling Experience
","Whoa! I just watched one of the creepiest/spookiest films I've seen in quite a while, 2015's 'It Follows.' This film has turned out to be a popular success, an instant cult item and a critical favorite, garnering great reviews all over the place...and for good reason. In the film, pretty Jay (the excellent young actress Maika Monroe) has a sexual encounter with her current boyfriend, only to soon learn that he has passed on a curse to her. She will now be relentlessly pursued by a demon/whatzit/something wherever she goes. This whatzit can assume any form and never hurries toward its prey; only walks steadily and with purpose. To have it catch up with you spells a pretty nasty death, as the film's opening scene shows us, with another pretty victim. The only way to get this curse taken off your back is to have sex with someone else, passing the curse on effectively. But if that next person is killed by the entity, the curse reverts back to you. OK, it might sound like a pretty outlandish basis for a film, but believe me, writer/director David Robert Mitchell makes the most of it, and turns his film into a masterful exercise in horror. This is the kind of film that you just KNOW will give you a nightmare eventually. The film contains any number of frightening scenes, despite the fact that there is little overt violence and barely any blood. In my favorite, the whatzit takes the form of an old woman in pajamas, who relentlessly follows Jay through the corridors of her high school. The demon thingy later takes the form of a hollow-eyed man, a half-naked woman, Jay's own father, and on and on. Monroe is terribly sympathetic and appealing in the lead, and she is ably abetted by her young fellow actors. The film has of course been seen as a metaphor for the AIDS virus, but can be interpreted in other ways, as well. Some see the whatzit as a metaphor for the fear and uncertainty that can ensue after a sexual encounter. Others have commented that the great unease engendered by this film can be attributed to the fact that things are never really explained, and that the central whatzit has no name, such as, say, Jason, or Freddy Krueger. The ending of the picture is quite ambiguous, too, and also open to interpretation. A pretty unsettling experience, over all, and one whose spell lingers after the final reel. And, oh...the film looks amazing in high def; almost painfully crisp and clean looking. Very highly recommended, indeed!",8,0,0,26 April 2017
Insidious," To Sleep...Perchance To Travel....
","With a production budget of a mere $1.5 million and a worldwide gross at the box office of over $92 million, 'Insidious,' an independent horror picture, was, famously and surprisingly, the most profitable film of 2011. Written and directed by the same team that created 2004's 'Saw' (another hugely popular horror film)--screenwriter Leigh Whannell and director James Wan--the picture is undeniably creepy and should manage to please most genre fans. In it, we meet Renai and Josh Lambert (Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson, both excellent here). The parents of two young sons and a baby daughter, and having just moved into a new luxury home, their lives are upended when their oldest boy, Dalton, slips into a three-month-long coma, and bizarre manifestations start occurring in their house. Convinced that their abode is haunted, the Lamberts move to a new domicile, which, appallingly, only makes matters worse! Fortunately, Josh's mother (nice to see Barbara Hershey, still looking mighty fine, on screen again!) is able to put them in touch with a trio of (what the general population might call) 'ghost busters,' leading to a battle royale against the clamoring, otherdimensional demons who are attempting to claim Dalton for their own....In a film with countless chilling moments (and the less said about them, the better, I suppose, for prospective viewers), several stand out: those photographs, for example, and those supercreepy voices heard over the baby monitor (I'm getting a little prickly just thinking about them!). Head 'ghost buster' Elise Rainier (well played by Lin Shaye) almost steals the show with her alternately gentle and steely ways, and her two assistants, Specs and Tucker (played by Whannell himself and Angus Sampson), provide what little humor and lightheartedness the film has to offer. Wan, still early in his career, demonstrates that he is already a pro at generating chills and suspense (especially in the film's masterful first third), while Joseph Bishara's discordant/screechy soundtrack is as freaky as they come. 'Insidious,' it might also be added, makes the best use of a Tiny Tim song (in this case, his late '60s classic 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips') since...well, I suppose since Tim sang 'There'll Always Be an England' for the Isle of Wight crowd in the 'Message to Love' documentary. Indeed, I find that I only have one quibble with this truly unnerving film, which I sincerely regret not having watched on the big screen; namely, many of the scenes--especially toward the end, as Josh explores the 'Further'--are woefully underlit. While I'm sure this wasn't an issue in theaters, on a normal television screen, many of the fine and subtle details of this otherdimensional zone might be lost. Still, the film manages to work, even at home. It is assuredly a powerful picture, right to its stunning twist ending, and does have a cumulatively chilling effect. The film turns out to be well named; insidiously, you may find yourself being creeped out before you even know it....",Null,2,3,12 October 2011
From Dusk Till Dawn," 'That's What I Call A _______ Show!'
","As most psychotronic-film fans already seem to know, Robert Rodriguez's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (1996) is a picture that cleaves fairly evenly into two discrete sections. In the first, homicidal bank robber/kidnappers Seth and Richie Gecko (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino), while on the run in Texas, abduct a lapsed minister (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and, in his film debut, Ernest Liu) and force the family to smuggle them into Mexico in a gas-guzzling RV. This is a hard-boiled, suspenseful, oftentimes amusing segment, which abruptly shifts gears as the quintet fetches up at a biker bar in the Mexican wilderness, only to find that the club's habitues are nothing less than bloodsucking, zombielike vampires! And then the fun really begins!Oh, how I did love this hoot of a movie; let me count some of the ways. (1) George Clooney, easily stealing the show here with what is practically an Oscar-worthy performance, as Seth; a relatively sane (when compared to his psycho sex maniac brother, at least!), totally unflappable, wisecracking, tough-as-nails, oddly likable wildman. (2) A crackling, imaginative script by Tarantino, clearly on a roll here after the recent success of 'Pulp Fiction,' that is loaded with big laffs, pays homage to both classic hostage dramas AND grisly horror flix, and is liberally sprinkled with 'F bombs,' natch. (3) Some energetic direction from Mr. Rodriguez, whose love for genre filmmaking is evident in every scene in the film. (4) The aforementioned humor, which leavens the drama, the gore and the grue; for example, try not to laff when Seth calls the Juliette Lewis character 'Gidget'! (5) A rocking soundtrack, comprised, appropriately enough, of such staggering Texas-based artists as Stevie Ray and Jimmie Vaughan and ZZ Top. (6) Cheech Marin's spiel in front of the biker bar; truly, a classic, hawking come-on for the ages. And honestly, how cool is it that Cheech plays three separate roles in this film, a la Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness? (7) Salma Hayek as Santanico (NOT Satanico, as widely written) Pandemonium, whose snake dance, with the sounds of Tito and Tarantula performing 'After Dark' in support, may well be the most awesome scene in motion picture history. Indeed, Salma here, I dare say, embodies what most men would deem the quintessence of pulchritudinous muliebrity. (8) The sight of Clooney, Keitel, FX legend Tom Savini, and blaxploitation hero Fred Williamson battling four vampire chicks...action heaven! (9) The coolest crucifix ever shown in a vampire movie; the one Harvey improvises from a baseball bat and a pump-action shotgun! (10) Some extraordinarily clever violence and carnage, as the hundreds of massed, repugnant-looking vampires are wiped out in dozens of clever ways. I could go on and on, but you get the idea: This movie really is a gas from start to finish, its remarkable final image itself a justification for a sequel. Thinking back on this film afterward, I could only echo Seth Gecko's words, regarding Santanico's performance: 'That's what I call a _______ show!'",9,0,0,4 November 2010
Drag Me to Hell," 'Here, Kitty, Kitty....'
","Many of us have muttered the words 'Go to hell' in anger, but none of us have done so with 1/1,000 the power and effectiveness of Sylvia Ganush, in Sam Riami's 2009 horror thriller 'Drag Me To Hell.' A slobbering, denture-wearing Hungarian gypsy, Sylvia, when we first meet her, has just been turned down for an extension on her mortgage by a pretty blonde loan officer, Christine Brown, and thus faces eviction from her L.A. home. After a remarkable brawl between the two in an underground garage, Sylvia puts the curse of the Lamia on Christine, and soon, this female goat demon begins to afflict Christine's life with three days of unimaginable torments, preparatory to pulling her soul down to you know where. And once these torments begin, virtually anything can--and DOES--happen, in this wildly entertaining shocker. Raimi, having taken a decade-plus break to do his Spider-Man trilogy and various other projects, here returns to his horror roots in a bravura manner, and fans of his 'Evil Dead' series will rejoice to witness the return of the gross-out splatter FX that were a hallmark of those films. Wanna see an old crone vomit maggots into a young girl's mouth? A stapler delivered to the face? Geyser nosebleeds, bursting eyeballs? Well, then, here is the film for you! The picture has nary a dull moment, and practically stealing the show is Alison Lohman, giving a sweet, sexy and ingratiating performance as Christine. Lorna Raver, playing Sylvia, is truly frightening, and Justin Long, portraying Christine's incredulous yet faithful boyfriend, is also quite good. The picture seems to tip its hat in homage toward Jacques Tourneur's 1958 masterpiece 'Curse of the Demon' toward the end, but even this homage doesn't prepare us for the film's shocking conclusion. Indeed, the final shot of Christine's face is one that few viewers will soon forget. No pun intended, but this really is one helluva movie. Welcome back, Sam! We missed you!",9,1,2,5 October 2010
Saw," One And Done
","Well, it took me long enough, but I finally caught up with the 2004 hit 'Saw,' a film so influential that it practically jump-started a whole new subgenre in the horror field: torture porn. It was the first film in what is currently a seven-part franchise, but I don't know if I am interested in seeing any more, although I did find this first installment impressively well done and very, very intense. In it, two men (Cary Elwes and 'Saw''s screenwriter Leigh Whannell) awake in a dirty disused bathroom of sorts and find themselves chained to the walls. A dead body lies between them. Eventually, the two realize that they are the victims of the so-called Jigsaw serial killer, who doesn't actually kill his victims per se, but rather puts them into situations in which they are compelled to do monstrous things or kill themselves. Via multiple flashbacks, we learn the two men's backstories and learn of the police investigation into the Jigsaw killings. We get to see several of these killings, too. In one, a man is compelled to run through a razor-sharp maze or be locked in a room forever. In another, a woman has a reverse bear trap attached to her head, and to get it off, must knife through the stomach of a living man to get the key to release herself. In another, a man has his head clamped between two approaching drills. Pleasant stuff. The film is supremely well acted by its impressive cast. Danny Glover plays one of the cops on the case, one who grows a lot more unhinged than the cop character he played in the 'Lethal Weapon' films; Monica Potter (future star of TV's 'Parenthood') plays one of the victims; and two of the future stars of TV's 'Lost' (Michael Emerson and Ken Leung) add fine support as well. Director James Wan does an incredible job of helming his film; hard to believe that this great-looking picture only cost around $1.2 million and was shot in only 18 days! In all, I heartily concur with reference book 'DVD Delirium 3''s assessment when it calls 'Saw' 'a stomach-knotting exercise in physical and mental anguish.' Still, as I say, I'm not exactly eager to subject myself to even more unpleasantness in this series, which, from what I hear, gets a lot more gruesome than this initial installment. Weirdly enough, this was the second film that I watched last week, following 'The Ruins,' that features a man getting his leg sawed off, and if I never see a scene like this in a movie again, that will be fine by me. It's hardly the stuff of a Fred and Ginger film, but for some people, I suppose, that's entertainment....",6,0,0,26 April 2017
The Descent," Should Be Damned By The National Speleological Society!
","I've had some minor problems in the past with horror films in which the bulk of the action transpires mainly in the dark, or in which the monsters go largely unseen (even in such classic entertainments as 'Alien' and 'It's Alive'), and so sat down to watch 2005's 'The Descent' with some degree of trepidation, despite its great rep. And it turns out that my qualms were justified, but not enough to matter. In the film, a sextet of sexy and spunky spelunkers--significantly, all semisuperwomen--explores an undiscovered cave system in North Carolina's Appalachians, becomes trapped after a cave-in, and encounters some truly ferocious underground dwellers. Though not a sufferer of claustrophobia, I have had many nightmares in which I am crawling through a very tight space underground (Freudians, make of this what you will!), and this film really does capture the frightfulness of those dreams. The monsters themselves ('Crawlers,' the filmmakers call them, in one of this DVD's many extras)--though perforce only seen dimly and in flashes, for the most part, as I suspected--are a truly horrifying bunch. Humanoid, albino and vaguely batlike, they make a catastrophic situation enter the realm of the surreal. As it turned out, my only real problem with 'The Descent' was the fact that it's very hard to differentiate between the six gals once they strap on helmets and start crawling around in the dark, although a repeat viewing did admittedly clarify things a good deal for me. I felt as if I'd been put through a wringer by the film's end, actually, which I suppose is high praise for even the murkiest of horror films. And I would imagine that this picture would be as welcomed by feminists for its depiction of sisters sticking together as it would be damned by the National Speleological Society! 'The Descent' will certainly not be drawing in new converts to the sport of caving, that's for sure; another indication of its power and effectiveness!",7,1,3,15 April 2009
Three Colors: Blue," Initially Sad, It Won't Leave You Feeling Blue
","'Blue,' the 1993 opening film in Krzysztof Kieslowski's 'Blue, White & Red' trilogy, sports perhaps the most fitting title of the three. It tells the story of Julie, a 33-year-old woman who has just lost her composer husband and young daughter in a terrible automobile accident. Thrown into the bluest of blue funks (and who wouldn't be?), Julie moves to a flat in Paris and tries to divorce herself from life, telling herself that money, love and friendships are all traps. But what at first seems to be an extremely downbeat film proves rather life affirming, as Julie discovers that maybe there are things left to her worth engaging with after all. Her newfound and unwanted liberty (blue is the color of the French flag that corresponds with 'liberty,' oui?), her sudden independence, may not be as desirable as she initially thought.... 'Blue' is a film loaded with all sorts of symbolism and suggested meanings. It features world-class direction, striking photography (although that impressive image-on-the-cornea shot was used to better effect in 'Goldfinger' some 30 years before) and impeccable acting, especially from Juliette Binoche in the lead. It is certainly not the picture for viewers desiring speed, but nonetheless rewards the patient viewer with its ultimately uplifting message that life does have a way of pulling us back in. Though easily the most somber of the trilogy, it is not at all depressing, and didn't leave me feeling blue at all. Oh...has anyone else noticed that although Julie's daughter is reported to be 5 at her funeral, the dates on her coffin indicate 7? Is this an error on the director's part (hard to believe, with such an impeccable craftsman as Kieslowski) or something else that needs to be thought about by the viewer? In a picture that offers so much food for thought, this is just one more tasty morsel.",7,1,1,28 September 2007
The Happening," Respectful Awe
","Following the inanity of the borderline train wreck that was 2006's 'Lady in the Water,' writer/producer/director M. Night Shyamalan rebounded in a very big way with his next film, 2008's 'The Happening.' His contribution to the type of eco-horror film that was all the rage in the 1960s and '70s--I'm thinking of such films as 1963's 'The Birds,' 1972's 'Frogs,' 1977's 'Kingdom of the Spiders' and 1978's 'Swarm'...not to mention the little-seen 1976 Spanish classic 'Who Can Kill a Child?'--the film seems to have divided his fan base and resulted in a bona fide critical flop of sorts. Indeed, the woman who I sit next to at work, a big admirer of film auteur Shyamalan, hated the film, although she professes a love for 'Lady in the Water,' a picture that I found to be both ridiculous and downright stupid. Go figure. THIS is why there is both vanilla AND chocolate out there, folks!In the film in question, what is at first perceived to be a bioterrorist attack occurs in NYC's Central Park, where droves of people are compelled to commit suicide in horrendous fashions. We then zoom in on Philadelphia schoolteacher Elliot Moore (very well played by the hugely likable Mark Wahlberg), who, along with his wife Alma (the pretty and kooky Zooey Deschanel), best friend and fellow teacher Julian (John Leguizamo) and his adorable daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), leaves the city by train after a similar attack occurs in their vicinity. Eventually, Julian strikes off on his own to search for his wife in Princeton, NJ, leaving his daughter in charge of the Moores, while it soon becomes apparent that this is NOT an instance of bioterror that has been afflicting the entire Northeast after all, but rather, a bizarre case of nature gone amok. The very trees are emitting a chemical--perhaps in an instance of self-defense--that has started to compel humans to do themselves in! (This action does not strike me at this particular moment as being all that far-fetched, afflicted as I am today with allergy symptoms brought on by tree pollen!) The Moores and Jess head into the wilds of the Pennsylvania countryside to escape the widespread violence, only to fetch up at the home of an isolated woman, one Mrs. Jones (Betty Buckley)...a demented biddy who, in retrospect, strikes the viewer as a warm-up for the demented oldsters in Shyamalan's 2015 film 'The Visit.' But even this isolated locale does not seem to be a safe haven against the arboreal threat that has suddenly arisen....Amazingly, 'The Happening' was nominated for no less than four Golden Raspberry Awards--for Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Wahlberg), Worst Director and Worst Screenplay. In 'Empire' magazine's list of the 50 Worst Films of All Time, the film came in at the #8 spot! Are these people kidding?!?! Have they never seen such films as 'Blood Freak,' 'Dracula vs. Frankenstein,' 'The Astro-Zombies,' 'Horror of the Blood Monsters,' 'The Beast of Yucca Flats' and 'The Worm Eaters'? THESE are truly horrendous and ineptly made pictures, worthy of anybody's contempt. But 'The Happening'? Really? This film is expertly made and well acted by its cast of appealing players. It also looks terrific on the screen, is loaded with any number of suspenseful moments, is laced with pleasing bits of humor (my favorite: Elliot talking in fear to what turns out to be a plastic plant), and is capable of stunning the viewer by dint of a pleasing number of shock moments (such as the sight of one man offering himself up to the giant cats in the Philadelphia zoo, a young woman casually sticking a rather long hairpin into her neck, and the truly awesome spectacle of a half dozen construction workers blithely diving off the top of a building to their doom). The film is nowhere near as bloody as the 2001 Japanese stunner 'Suicide Club' (how could it be?) but yet manages to startle and impress, nevertheless. And if the film does not provide one of Shyamalan's patented twist endings, it yet contrives to wind up on a note of not-so-unexpected pessimism. Like the Hitchcock film referenced above, a clear-cut explanation for the bizarre events in the film is never vouchsafed, and we are left to be content with these words of wisdom from the Wahlberg character: 'There are forces at work beyond our understanding. To be a good scientist, you must have a respectful awe for the laws of Nature.' And perhaps not so coincidentally, 'respectful awe' was the feeling that this viewer was left with by the conclusion of this hugely impressive and effective film. Very much recommended....",7,1,3,4 May 2017
Zombieland," Watch Out For Those Contaminated Burgers!
","For women who want to learn how to (supposedly) catch a man, there is Fein & Schneider's infamous 1995 book 'The Rules.' However, those who want to know about a different set of rules--specifically, those pertaining to surviving a zombie apocalypse--are advised to check out Ruben Fleischer's 2009 horror comedy 'Zombieland.' In the opening, perhaps funniest section of this consistently LOL-funny movie, a diffident, IBS-afflicted college kid, Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg, who currently stars as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in 'The Social Network'; ironic, as one of his funniest lines as Columbus is a Facebook put-down), gives us a half dozen illustrated rules for escaping 'the plague of the 21st century': the remarkably swift-moving flesh eaters. (As in the recent '28 Days Later,' the zombies here are not lumbering, reanimated corpses, but rather crazed, homicidal victims of a viral pandemic, in this case brought about by contaminated burgers.) Columbus soon encounters three other noninfected humans while traveling from Austin to his namesake hometown in Ohio: Tallahassee, who excels at the art of battling zombies and is very amusingly portrayed by Woody Harrelson, and two young sisters, Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). (How the two sisters--if they really are sisters--come to hail from different burgs is never explained.) Ultimately, the four decide to cruise over to L.A.'s supposedly zombie-free Pacific Playland (an amusement park in wintry Valdosta, Georgia was actually used). In his first go as director, Fleischer keeps his film zipping along smoothly and efficiently. His picture is perhaps more successful as a comedy than as a horror film, however; the requisite zombie carnage is hardly anything new or original, and no zombie kills on the order of the imaginative flame-up by flare gun, as seen in George A. Romero's 2010 outing 'Survival of the Dead,' are to be had here. The film veers sharply into the land of the absurd when the quartet crashes the L.A. mansion abode of Bill Murray, and starts goofing around with the big man himself. (The line about Eddie van Halen is a riot.) Actually, the entire film is something of a hoot, with a cracklingly funny script and some very able performances by the four leads. And yet, the gorehounds out there shouldn't be disappointed; the action scene between Columbus and his crazed neighbor in 406, and the final zombie slaughter in the amusement park, are pretty darn gripping. In all, the film is tremendous fun. And oh...all you 'Caddyshack' fans out there (I have never been one) will certainly want to stick around for that final coda after the end credits....",7,1,3,9 October 2010
Psycho," The Modern Horror Era Begins
","It is not every filmmaker who can manage the difficult trick of coming up with four consecutive masterpieces, but that is just what British director Alfred Hitchcock was able to do as the late 1950s segued into the '60s. His 1958 offering, 'Vertigo,' took time to find its audience but today is recognized by the British Film Institute's 'Sight and Sound' magazine as the single greatest motion picture ever made; 1959's 'North by Northwest' is surely one of the all-time great entertainments; 1960's 'Psycho' practically jump-started the modern-day horror industry all on its own, and remains the director's most well-known film; and 1963's 'The Birds' is still a baby-boomer favorite to this day. But of those four films, all of which reside on my personal Top 100 Favorite Films list, it is the third, 'Psycho,' that remains my favorite after all these years, and indeed, I personally feel it is the greatest bit of work that the so-called 'Master of Suspense' ever gave to an unprepared world. The film was a far cry from its predecessor, 'North by Northwest,' a big-budget movie that had been shot in lavish wide-screen VistaVision and Technicolor and featured a sweeping, transcontinental story, replete with action and comedy and Cary Grant at his suavest. By contrast, 'Psycho' was filmed on the cheap, utilizing Hitchcock's crew from his television program 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents'; the entire production was completed in just a few months at a cost of a mere $800,000 or so. But such was the power of the film, and its clever advertising and promotional gimmickry that insisted that no audience member would be allowed admission after the picture had started, that the box office for 'Psycho' was enormous: around $50 million, a smashing amount of money for the time. And did it ever deserve it!I generally try to not include spoilers in these little minireviews of mine, but in the case of 'Psycho,' I will go on the assumption that everyone knows the big reveal that comes at the picture's end, while at the same time endeavoring to be a bit coy, for the sake of those poor unfortunates who have NOT seen this masterpiece. As most of the world seems to know by now, or should, the film shows up what happens when a pretty secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh, in perhaps her finest hour), who works in a Phoenix real estate office, absconds with $40,000 of the company's money and hightails it by car to meet her lover, Sam Loomis (future U.S. ambassador to Mexico John Gavin) in California. Forced to take refuge during a sudden downpour, she stops for the night at the lonely Bates Motel, meets its gawky and awkward proprietor, Norman Bates (Tony Perkins, in the role that made him a star), and is later knifed to death--apparently by Norman's mother--while taking a shower in her room. (This, by the way, was not the first film to depict a woman being attacked while in the shower; indeed, just two years earlier, in the film noir 'Screaming Mimi,' Anita Ekberg had been attacked in a similar manner, but the difference was, hers was an outdoor shower, with somewhere to escape to, and she was NOT killed during the attack.) Worried by her sister's disappearance, Lila Crane (Vera Miles) arranges to go with Sam to investigate. The two hire a private detective, Milton Arbogast (the great character actor Martin Balsam), to help in their investigations, and the trio eventually tracks Marion's disappearance to the motel, where they discover the grisly secrets that it hides.A bit of personal history here...and I may be revealing my age a bit by doing so. I am old enough to remember when 'Psycho' was first released, in June of 1960, although I was just a wee lad at the time. I remember seeing the trailer for the film in a theater, although I did not realize until many years later, when I saw the trailer again as an adult, what it had been. And I remember the effect that this film had on many of the grown-ups in my neighborhood, particularly on one woman, Tika, who would not take a shower again for many months after she first saw it. The picture, of course, was a genuine shocker for film audiences of the era. Never before had a movie star of the magnitude of Janet Leigh been so suddenly killed off...and just 40 minutes into the picture! Today, naturally, anything goes, and any star can be unceremoniously knocked off in any manner. We've pretty much seen it all at this point, what with the advent of slasher flicks and torture porn films, but back in 1960, this kind of thing was brand new. People today just cannot imagine how shocked and stunned the 1960 audiences were at the time; what a sensation this film was. The word of mouth was terrific, leading to the box office figures mentioned above. As a youngster, I took all this in but of course was not allowed to see the film by my parents. It wasn't until I was in my very early teens that 'Psycho' was first shown on television, and by then, I was more than primed. Thus, having been dared by some friends that I would not have the courage to ever see this film alone, I sat down to do so one night. My parents and sister, for some reason, were not in the house, and I manfully plunked myself down on the floor and watched this celebrated horror legend on my ownsome. After all, I figured, I'd already seen 1959's 'House on Haunted Hill' any number of times (a good preparation, as it turned out!), and how much scarier than THAT could this picture be? Well, the shower scene of course frightened me, as did the shocking murder of Arbogast on the stairs (one of Hitchcock's greatest set pieces), but it was the final revelation of Mrs. Bates in that damp and musty fruit cellar that really got under my skin. Still, I made it to the end, and breathed a huge sigh of relief; I had made it all the way through, and had something to discuss with my friends. In the intervening 50 years or so, I have watched 'Psycho' God knows how many more times on both the big screen and small, and it never seems to get old for me. (That, by the way, is the hallmark of all of my Top 100 films; the fact that I can watch them over and over and over with undiminished enjoyment.)Today, 'Psycho' manages to hold up very well indeed, despite the fact that we are all aware of the film's secrets and know just when the jump scares are about to pop out. At this point, there is very little to say about the film that has not been said before. It has probably been discussed and analyzed more than any other Hitchcock film, and the books and articles written about it are legion. As a matter of fact, just last year, a new documentary, '78/52' (respective references to the number of setups and editing cuts), was released that centered on just the shower scene alone! I could certainly not improve on any of those commentaries, but would especially recommend to those who are interested Danny Peary's very informative article on the film, to be found in his indispensable reference book 'Cult Movies 3.' (It was Peary who first made me realize that the film gives us a woman named Crane who becomes the victim of a man who likes to stuff birds, and how the director makes his audience feel guilty by making us all feel like voyeurs throughout the picture.) The film contains so much to love that it is difficult to know where to begin. But let's start with the wonderful script that Joseph Stefano--who would go on to even greater fame a few years later as producer/writer for the classic TV show 'The Outer Limits'--was able to come up with, based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel. (Interestingly, the Norman Bates character in the novel is something of a big fat slob, on the order of a Victor Buono type; thus, Perkins was a very unlikely choice to play this particular role.) It is a wonderful script, witty and penetrating, that intersperses its shocks at just the right moments, and is perhaps never better than in the telling scene in which Norman and Marion converse in the parlor before she takes her good-night shower. The actors in the film are all marvelous, down to the smallest bit parts, and Hitchcock's manipulation of his audience, and the way he moves and places his camera (as in the spiraling descent into Marion's dead eyeball after the murder, and the overhead shot of Mrs. Bates attacking Arbogast), are by now legendary. Perhaps best of all, though, is Perkins. What a wonderful job he does here! Notice his hips sway as he ascends the stairs in the creepy Victorian mansion that is the Bates home, or the look of fear and then relief on his face as he attempts to sink that corpse-containing car in the nearby swamp. Amazingly, the audience sympathizes with him as he covers up for his homicidal mother, and that is no small feat. And, oh, let's not forget one of the most key elements in the entire film, that sensationally frightening score by the great Bernard Herrmann, composed solely of strings (violins and cellos); surely, one of the most instantly recognizable film scores ever created, and so very influential on future composers for horror pictures. 'Psycho' was a groundbreaker and a trendsetter in many departments, but here's something that you may not have heard before: It was also the first film that ever showed the inside of a toilet bowl, a fact that caused all manner of uproar among the decency and censorship groups. (Isn't it funny what some people will choose to get upset about?) I could go on forever about this film, but I will leave you with this one fun fact: The shower curtain that I have right now in my bathroom at home is a clear one, and come to think of it, I have been purchasing see-through shower curtains for many decades now. Is this a subconscious effect brought on by this truly remarkable film? Could very well be! After all, if the Bates Motel had featured clear shower curtains in its rooms, Marion Crane might still be alive and well today....",10,1,1,21 June 2018
The Iron Giant," I Should've Listened To My Nephew...
","Back in 1999, when 'The Iron Giant' was first released, several friends of mine, aware of my love for 1950s sci-fi films, urged me to go see this movie. For some reason, I passed. A few years later, another friend's 4-year-old son told me what a great video this was, but I still declined to watch it. And even later, when my own nephew (then 6) told me what a hilarious scene he'd just witnessed in 'The Iron Giant' (the one in which young Hogarth drinks espresso and starts talking a mile a minute)...well, even then, I still ignored the advice. Anyway, all the above folk will be happy to hear that I finally DID watch this animated sci-fi film last night, and found it absolutely charming. Featuring wonderful animation, nice touches of warmth and humor, and wry commentary on '50s paranoia and A-bomb lunacy, the film really does have appeal to young and old. Lovers of sci-fi and/or action films should especially enjoy the film's latter scenes, in which the lovable Giant gets ticked off and morphs into an unstoppable killing machine. My hat is certainly off to everyone involved in the making of this most entertaining film. And this 'special edition' DVD, filled with more extras than you can imagine, certainly does live up to the advertising. Hmmm...maybe I SHOULD take my nephew's advice and finally rent out his favorite movie, 'Toy Story 2'...",8,3,4,6 December 2007
Amélie," A Magical Blend Of Fantasy, Reality, Comedy And Romance
","Those of you who doubt that Paris, France is still the most magical and romantic city in the world should perhaps take a look at Jean-Pierre Jeunet's film 'Amelie' (2001). In it, we meet a pretty, shy young woman, Amelie Poulain, who works in a Parisian coffee shop and whose favorite hobbies, we are told, are skipping stones, cracking open creme brulees, sinking her hands into sacks of grain, and daydreaming about all kinds of strange things. She soon becomes a combination secret benefactor, philanthropist, fairy godmother and protector for the unusual assortment of oddballs at her job and in her Montmartre apartment building, but is stymied when she meets and is attracted to an equally eccentric young man. Anyway, it is just as difficult to not use the word 'charming' when referring to 'Amelie' the film as it is to not use the word 'adorable' when speaking of Audrey Tautou's Amelie herself. Ms. Tautou brings to mind another Continental actress named Audrey; yes, Audrey Hepburn. Indeed, in some shots, as when Amelie looks directly into the camera with that little mischievous grin, the resemblance really is something. Many magical things transpire in this highly amusing fantasy comedy--lamps come to life, snapshots speak--but I guess magical things can and WILL happen when a gal like Amelie is around. The film is remarkable to look at, with ingenious and colorful art direction, unusual camera angles, unexpected special FX, and--need I even say?--lovely Parisian backdrops. It is also, surprisingly, at times laff-out-loud funny. This picture is certainly not your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, but something truly special that manages the tricky blend of fantasy, reality, comedy and romance. I can't imagine it not appealing to anyone with a heart and a sense of wonder. A real winner, indeed.",10,1,6,24 October 2007
The Sixth Sense," For The Benefit Of The Korowai And The Munduruku
","Regarding the famous twist ending of M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' (1999), I will try to be coy here for the benefit of those who have just come out of a decadelong coma, and for those Korowai tribesmen of New Guinea and the Munduruku dwellers on the Amazon who may be unaware of it, but who may be reading this posting on their BlackBerrys (and in today's modern world, who knows?!?). For all first-timers (like me) who see the film fully aware of the picture's startling denouement, the question must be 'Can one still enjoy it with such a movie-spoiling foreknowledge?' Well, as anyone who has ever seen 'The Sixth Sense' more than once knows (and I can't imagine anyone seeing this film for the first time who would NOT want to watch it again immediately!), the answer is a resounding 'yes.' In it, Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist in Philly who attempts to help 9-year-old Cole Sear. Cole's problem, as he famously puts it, is that he sees 'dead people.' Anyway, the always likable Willis gives a nicely restrained performance here and, as 'DVD Delirium' puts it, 'manages to keep his trademark smirk hidden.' And young Haley Joel Osment is superb as the troubled Cole, effectively communicating, with his whispered delivery, the fear that is his daily bread. The film is a quiet and understated affair, building suspense and scares through a gradual accretion of detail. It has been expertly lensed by master cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, and Shyamalan's direction is quite ingenious in the way it skips around the edges of the film's big twist while still playing the game fairly. By that famous ending, young Cole seems set to beat Jennifer Love to the punch as a 'ghost whisperer,' while Malcolm comes to see himself for what he truly is. It's some brilliant stuff, and I for one wouldn't even mind a belated, latter-day sequel....",8,0,0,4 March 2009
The Cabin in the Woods," An Over-The-Top Thrill Ride With Too Few Explanations
","When 'The Cabin in the Woods' was released in April 2012, it almost immediately became something of a sensation, a hit both with the critics and the public, ultimately going on to gross around $67 million at the box office, after having been produced for $30 million. Despite all that, however, and despite the fact that I am an old fan of a good horror movie, well told, I managed to miss the film when it was first run, and only caught up with it very recently, at home. And now, I am most regretful that I did not run to the theaters back when, as this really is a film that would have benefited from being seen on the big screen. It is an eye-popping film, loaded with suspense, action, scares, laughs, and amazing special FX; one that would have been ideal for seeing with a good audience. Not since 1996's 'Scream,' perhaps, has a motion picture so knowingly and winkingly toyed with the conventions of the horror film, and to such winning effect, all the while adding something fresh and new to the conversation. As I say, a perfect film for watching with others in a theater, and yet, so good is the film, that even at home it managed to stun and leave this viewer slack jawed, although not entirely satisfied. More on this in a moment.The film is one that will undoubtedly leave the viewer feeling more and more puzzled as he/she watches. It opens inside what looks to be a highly advanced and scientific installation of some sort, where we see two men, Sitterson (Richard Jenkins) and Hadley (Bradley Whitford), casually joking around while making small talk about how the Swedes have just botched their end of the operation, leaving only the U.S. and Japan in the game. What ARE they talking about? We jump to five attractive college kids who are about to go off for a long weekend in the country. These students are athletic Curt (Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, who had just started playing the role of Thor for Marvel Studios one year earlier), his blonde hottie girlfriend Jules (New Zealander actress Anna Hutchison), the bookish but buff Holden (Jesse Williams), stoner dude Marty (Fran Kranz), and sweet Dana (Kristen Connolly, who many will recognize from television's 'House of Cards' and 'Zoo'). The five are horror-film archetypes - the athlete, the slutty girl, the scholar, the fool and the virgin, although Dana is admittedly hardly the latter, strangely enough - and before long, we are made witness to any number of other horror film conventions. They encounter a creepy gas station attendant en route to the cabin of Curt's cousin, where they will be staying, while the viewer is made increasingly aware that things just aren't right here. The men in that scientific installation are keeping constant watch on the five, and, even more startling, a bird that flies high over the quintet's van en route to their destination suddenly hits a force field of some kind and is puffed out of existence! Once at the cabin, a party gets started, while we see Sitterson and Hadley manipulate the proceedings from afar, changing the outside ambient air temperature, altering the moonlight (!), even allowing puffs of pheromone vapor to arise from the ground to increase Jules' already primed libido. But matters really start to take off around the film's 30-minute mark, when zombies arise from the earth, in response to some Latin words uttered by Dana from a creepy old diary that she had found in the cabin's cellar. These zombies proceed to butcher several of the teens in a most ghastly manner during the film's central third section, while another is killed during an escape attempt. Finally, in the film's most flabbergasting sequence, the final half hour, the two students who are left (don't ask me which ones, please) manage to discover the secret of just what the hell is going on as they penetrate that mysterious scientific facility, leading to monstrous mayhem the likes of which you have rarely seen on screen....'The Cabin in the Woods' is the type of film that grows increasingly wacky and more amazing as it proceeds, and indeed, its final half hour really is one for the books, mixing in as it does not just those hideous zombies, but also (take a deep breath) a hideous werewolf, a skull-faced wraith, a girl in a tutu whose face is a gaping cavity of fangs, a dude who might just be Pinhead's cousin from 'Hellraiser' (1987), giant snakes straight out of the pages of Robert E. Howard, winged creatures that beggar my poor powers of description, macabre doll people, a killer clown, monstrosities that spout green blood, a homicidal unicorn, a lumbering whatsit that tears its victims apart while spouting their blood out of its blowhole, and more ... so many more. This monster mash in that scientific installation throws so very much at the viewer that it will be a sequence you will want to rewind and rewatch over and over again. And indeed, the entire film is one for which you might find the need to experience again immediately after your first viewing. During that first watch, while you are attempting to figure out what is transpiring, and why these scientists are doing what they're doing, you'll just barely hang on and go along for the ride. A second viewing will allow you to better appreciate how all the pieces kinda sorta fit together and make some kind of sense. And I say 'kinda sorta' only because, unfortunately, the film hardly gives away all its secrets, and that is a pity.'The Cabin in the Woods' has been directed in a very impressive and stylish manner by Drew Goddard, a former writer on television's 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' 'Alias' and 'Lost,' as well as the films 'Cloverfield' (2007), 'World War Z' (2013) and 'The Martian' (2015). As with 'Lost' and 'Cloverfield,' the film astonishes the viewer with its mysterious incidents and set pieces but ultimately fails to answer all our legitimate questions. Goddard, who wrote the film along with Joss Whedon (another 'Buffy' screenwriter, as well as the screenwriter for 'Toy Story' and the director of two Avengers films), seems to delight in stunning the viewer while withholding all but the sketchiest of rationales as an explanation. Here, that explanation comes from The Director (played by a surprise guest star whose name I should perhaps not reveal, although he/she remains a horror and sci-fi favorite), who fails to explain how these scientists have been operating in secrecy for so long, how these monstrous creatures have come about, why their, er, higher-ups insist on these proceedings, and many other bothersome questions. Thus, this is a film that works best as long as you don't think about it too deeply, but rather, just go along for the undeniable thrill ride that it is. And in truth, the film is well acted by all concerned, and is gripping and altogether dumbfounding. It is also extremely gory and violent, with a very high body count ... actually, with what I should call a practically universal body count, as things turn out. It is thus decidedly not recommended for the squeamish viewer or those who are averse to the red stuff. The film, as mentioned, also contains much in the way of humor, both as far as amusing one-liners are concerned and in the sly acknowledgment of those hallowed horror conventions; thus, the five student archetypes, that gas station dude who serves as a sinister portent, the pot- and booze-fueled party in the cabin, the Latin reading and the rising of the zombies, the clever nods to the Japanese J-horror films of the early 2000s, etc. Interestingly, it is Marty here, the perpetually zonked stoner dude, who is the first to perceive a glimmering of what is going on, and who turns out to be something of a hero by the film's end. And the sight of him fighting off those zombies with a drinking cup that instantly transforms into an oversized bong certainly is one to cheer.When 'The Cabin in the Woods' was initially released, its promotional poster sported the tagline 'You Think You Know The Story.' It is a clever come-on, indeed, referring both to the fact that the film subverts and has fun with its horror film tropes, and the fact that the film does indeed pull the rug out from under the viewer's expectations. It is a difficult film to write about without giving away any of the picture's manifold secrets, and so I am currently trying to be coy here as I skip around the central conceit and attempt not to reveal any spoilers. Let's just say that this is a film that has never even been considered for a sequel, despite its huge success, and I for one could not even imagine how a sequel would be possible, after the ending that we are given. One and done, but what a 'one' this film is! You might walk away from the film scratching your head, but you are surely not likely to forget it....",8,0,0,19 June 2020
Donnie Darko," Migraine-Inducing But Fascinating Stuff
","Some movies take many years to achieve cult status; others become objects of cult adoration relatively quickly. 'Donnie Darko,' released several weeks after 9/11, has achieved that quantum leap to cult status faster than any film I know. I've never seen so many laudatory reviews here on the IMDb, where over 1,700 (!) people have taken the time to sing the film's praises. Having now finally seen the movie, I can understand its cult appeal. Dealing with an emotionally troubled youth, Donnie Darko, who is not only in therapy and on prescribed psychotropic drugs but who is also possibly hallucinating a death's-head, man-sized bunny rabbit, the film dishes out a story involving time travel, alternate universes and kozmik wormholes. The picture has been impeccably made by tyro writer/director Richard Kelly (and for only $4.5 million!), is well performed by the entire cast (how nice to see Katharine Ross on screen again!), and features excellent use of '80s pop tunes, especially 'The Killing Moon' by Echo and the BUNNYMEN and Tears for Fears' 'Mad World.' Too bad the film is also hopelessly confusing. I've watched the darn thing twice on DVD already, and although the second viewing (with the English subtitles on) did clear up some matters, too many questions remain, and still left me scratching my head. One can get a migraine trying to riddle out all the temporal paradoxes and Mobius-like plot convolutions hinted at here. Thus, the aforementioned cult, spending endless days picking at clues and debating this brainteaser no end. But as Donnie himself says somewhere in the film while talking about God, one can debate some subjects forever and still not come up with concrete answers. And that's just how I feel about Kelly's film. Still, pretty fascinating stuff...",7,0,2,3 October 2006
