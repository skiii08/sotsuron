The Avengers," Best superhero movie till date
","Hands down, best superhero movie till date. It had the right mix of story and action sequences. The movie spends the first half of its time in building the story. Although Marvel had already laid some foundation for this story in its previous movies. (Tesseract was seen in Captain America: The First Avenger) The second half of the movie is where you get to see all the action, hulk smashing the giant flying robot, hulk smashing Loki and hulk saving iron man. Geez, it seems like hulk was really enjoying himself out there. Well, coming back to the story so, S.H.I.E.L.D was trying to harness tesseract energy and thus it fell on the radar of the Loki(or we should say thanos). Now, Loki had made this deal with thanos that he will deliver tesseract to him if he helps him in conquering earth. So, Loki arrives on earth, steals the tesseract from SHIELD and uses it to create a portal and call an army. Now, it's up to avengers, our superheroes to stop Loki and save earth. The movie is packed with pretty bad-ass fighting scenes. You get to see the battle between Thor and iron man. You also get to see Thor using his hammer on captain America's shield. And of course, then there is the battle between avengers and Loki's army. Coming to characters, I think movie mostly revolves around iron man, Loki and hulk. Captain America seemed useless in this movie. Hope they use him in a better way in next avengers. Loki is clearly one of the wittiest characters in the marvel universe. NO wonder why people love him. All in all its a true entertainer and like I said the best superhero movie till date. If you haven't watched this movie then don't wait any longer. Just watch it and see hulk SMASH!!",10,3,7,13 January 2015
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Beautiful Story, amazing cast and astounding performance by them
","I have created my IMDb account just to give this movie 10 stars. The story is so beautiful and so touching, that you will actually feel all the emotions running through the film. You can connect with the characters so easily. The truth is I watched this film only for Emma watson, but the performance of Logar Lerman took my breath away. I have no words to describe how much I was impressed by his performance. Emma watson has also done an amazing job in this film. She is definitely growing as an actor in every film and you can feel that in her performance. The introvert, shy boy who has an awful childhood meets a guy and a girl who change his life completely. They take him under their wing, become his friends, and shows him the true meaning of friendship. It's a very sweet story in which the boy fells in love with the girl but is too shy to tell her. I won't take away your chance to enjoy this wonderful movie by telling you the entire story. Go and watch this movie, I assure you, you will most certainly like this movie.",10,0,0,10 May 2014
Armageddon," A highly Underrated film
","You might think that this just another disaster movie where the earth is faced with a catastrophe which is so threatening that it could end the life on earth, and you are right if you thought so. You might think that the heroes of the film will be able to save the earth from this catastrophe, and yes you are right again. So, you already know the story then why should you bother watching this movie? The answer is plain and simple. For entertainment. For this movie is awesome. For the graphics of this movie is awesome. For the way the story pans out is awesome. This movie has everything. A spaceship is blown away, then the earth's heroes must handle 11g's of gravity and asteroid debris to safely land on the asteroid. Well if this doesn't turn you on then the film's ending will definitely will. I won't speak about the ending and spoil the film for you. Trust me this is one movie that you don't wanna miss out on. There's drama in this film, there's sacrifice in this film, there's heroism in this film. This film is a complete entertainer. So bring the DVD, bring the popcorn and sit back and enjoy 2 hours of action-packed adventurous thriller.",9,1,2,16 May 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Awesome movie!!! Must watch!!
","Easily, one of the best super hero movies of all time, well, there have been only few of them. And of course, there has to be the obvious comparison with the earlier series of spider-man. I think most of the people will agree with me that earlier series of spider-man was better than this one. Peter Parker looked like Peter Parker in the earlier film, whereas in this one Peter Parker is shown as ultra smart, cool dude of the college. Well if you ready to overlook this fact, then you are in for a treat. The graphics of this movie is awesome. It will make your jaws drop. When the spidy releases its web, you get the feel with the force he releases it. This movie also shows how the senses of the spidy gets enhanced after he becomes the spider-man. And then clearly his lady love Emma stone looks way way way more beautiful and sexy then the Kirsten Dunst.Well overall the story is good, and as you guessed, the hero defeats the villain and saves the city from his evil plans. Well, that's more or less the gist of the story. Could it had been better? Yes, but was it good, Yes definitely. Should I watch this movie? Of course. I think this pretty much answers all your question.",7,0,1,10 May 2014
Independence Day," Outstanding movie
","I know people say that there are a lot of technical faults in this movie. That's true. But what's also true is that movie was made in 1996, where the computer graphics had just started to develop. A lot of stuff which could be done today could not be done at that time. So directors had to go with whatever they had. The motive of making a film is to make money, which the film did. The film has an awesome story line, apart from some technical glitches. I watched this film when I was in my teens. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. This movie is awesome. The way the story is told is very good. Some of the scenes are breath-taking. The scene where the aliens destroy the city with one attack was horrifying while at the same time that scene was just brilliant. And I almost cried in the last scene when that crazy guy sacrifices his life to save the lives of others. The actors had done a solid job in this film. If you like sci-fi and alien stuff, then I think you should go for it. This is one movie which you do not want to miss out on.",10,0,0,12 May 2014
The Dark Knight," One of the best movies of all time!!
","The Dark knight rises has got to be one of the best movies of all time. And its not because of Batman but the villain, Joker. Heath Ledger has done a phenomenal work in this film. He has overshadowed the Batman. This could be the best Joker of all time. Though the plot is good but it's the solid performance of Heath as Joker that does the trick for the film. Such is the impact of Joker that you can feel his presence in all the scenes, even in those scenes where he is not present. Well that's all about Heath and the joker. Now let's talk about the film. The story begins with Joker robbing banks with the help of other jokers and kills them all after when he has robbed the bank. This opening scene speaks about the unforgiving and twisted minded character of Joker. The Joker puts Batman to the ultimate test, taking him to such an extent where Batman wants to actually kill him. Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is also trying to work out his relationship with his girlfriend. It's a tough test of character for Batman as well as for the people of Gotham city as they must decide whether they want to kill other people to ensure their own safety. The film ends with quite an interesting twist. Like I said you can fell the effect of Joker even in the scenes where he is not present.Clearly, you should not miss out on this movie. This is one of the best Batman and superhero movie of all time. Well, this movie will be more remembered for the villain than for the hero. So, I should say one of the best super-villain movie of all time.",10,0,4,19 May 2014
Inception," Mind-boggling concept
","The idea is quite different and refreshing. Its not staid. Its completely different from the sc-fi movies that you normally see. The idea that you can enter into someone else's dream, and that you can also dream inside another dream is something unheard of. Though this idea is extraordinary, but it takes more than just an idea for a film to be hit. What's important is you how you use your idea and use that idea to develop a story around it. Clearly, the writers managed to do that. And if you have Leonardo in your film than you don't have to worry about the quality of acting. A guy with a troubled past, who cannot go back to its country because of being convicted to kill his wife, is given an opportunity by a man who can free him of this charge if he succeeds in pulling off the impossible task of implanting an idea inside another person. The story has so many layers and it unravels on every level of the dream. The cinematography of the film does justice to the this mend bending concept. This is a wonderfully written movie which has been acted by some of the best actors of the Hollywood. This movie is a must watch for everyone!!",10,0,2,21 May 2014
