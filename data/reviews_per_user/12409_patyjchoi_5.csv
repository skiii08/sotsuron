The Avengers," A Marble's Gigantic Symphony 'Hero'
","Even though I am not a passionate reader of American comic books , I really enjoyed this movie. This film succeeded to penetrate my firewall and planted a strong desire to master all the Hero comic books.The movie has a long running time of 142 min, not to mention of it, the director needed long enough to provide appropriate conflicts to the respective avenger members. The first half of the movie shows member's conflict, whereas the second half shows their reconciliation and reunion.That is also a good example of how the members cooperate in such as desperate situation 'The earth is under siege' Thanks to perfect CG and perfect acting of heroes/heroines, this movie is almost gave me joy of listening to a well made classical symphony. The last 30 min of war scene is outstanding and memorial. Marble comics did it. Really this is a phenomena.",9,1,4,29 April 2012
Oblivion," viewpoint on cloned human beings
","I want to leave out all the other comments which were mentioned by other reviewers here. The movie is like a grocery store selling all kinds of SiFi movie concepts such as alien's invasion, mass cloning of a human, conspiracy theory, messiah who dies for the earth peace... I do not want to be sarcastic about those factors. This is quite a well made SiFi movie, for highlighting Tom Cruise. It is another His movie.One particular point I want to say is; approach to cloning has been slightly twisted in the film. Remember 'Sixth day'? Adam Gibson(Arnold Schwarzenegar) realizes he is a clone and help his original Adam beat villains. The end? Cloned Adam leaves for his own life.But in Oblivion,it appears that two cloned Jack 49 and 52 are identical person to Julia. Whether DNA is same or not, Jack 49 is just a clone of the original one. They are DIFFERENT entities. The movies seems to claim, All the Jacks' are under one soul. As long as they are cloned from one Jack. This logic is very stunning and brand-new. And it is a dangerous concept I think.Personally I do not agree the philosophy flowing under this movie. Very uncomfortable, and now what will be the end?",7,0,1,28 July 2013
Man of Steel," One of the best SF movie in our era
","Finally, I saw 'Man of Steel'.It showed what Superman in 2013 has to show with such a cutting edge technique, nice acting, and perfect plot.Superman is a story about POWER. America needed this super hero when they struggle with Great Depression in 1930's and began 'Pax Americana' to be a watchman for the entire world. Also Superman is a story about 'CHOICE' of how to use the absolute power.But it is 2013 now. Our 84-year-old superhero should have been interpreted in a new way. Not just a man flying with her girlfriend over the night sky, not just our trustworthy friend who beats up crappy villains for peace...In that sense, the film's focusing to Kal-El's birth, growth, agony and his trauma, is a fresh approach.Dark colored filming, Nolan's surreal super-realism, the ultimate battle action that shakes up audiences.. All these are presenting a cheering catharsis effect for all those living in this hardship in 2013..With a adequate interpretation of Superman of now, Man of Steel is one of the best SF movie in our era. 9 our of 10.",8,1,7,1 July 2013
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Memorial work
","This movie owes a lot of its shining value to Tom Cruise. He is getting aged but his soul is backtracking when he shot the first MI. When I heard he did not accept using any stunt and did the action for himself, I could really enjoy his scene at the Dubai Burj Khalifa. But frankly speaking, Ghost protocol is another MI, meaning nothing that special. I think Mission Impossible attraction is on its unpredictable story and brilliant and intelligent chase. High technique such as mask disguise and gum bomb reminded me of classic 007 movie, which I liked. But part 4 Ghost protocol is going way too far. I can't understand all the magics that the IMF agents are using. Well, people are aware of what is MI like already, so that's why I felt boring about those skills. Nevertheless, with only one stunt scene at Burj Khalifa, this movies becomes one of the best action movie in history.",7,1,3,4 April 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Twist does not come up to the last
","I kept saying to myself 'There will be a awesome twist at the end. Let's get through it...' when I watch this film, but the twist was not mine. The view of the world in this film is very innovative, I agree with it. All the monsters and horrible creatures people know are gathered in one spot, where they awaits their turn to kill this year's sacrifice lamb. Otherwise the dark god beneath the globe will rise and all humans will have demise. So we can see an exposition of ghosts here. wolf-man, dragon, zombies, Japanese female ghost, .....But what else? the plot was predicted from the very beginning, and there was not a twist at last. Only bloody scenes are remained red-handed in the brain.I had expected something fresher, like resurrection of the killed, awakening of a zombie girl...but no way. All die. That's it.Why Sigourney is starred ??? She should'not have accepted the casting. PATHETIC.",3,5,12,20 August 2012
