Alien 3," previous reviewers have covered how this movie ruins the series
","two stars - Siguorny Weaver and Charles Dance can't rescue this snafu, but they are both as charismatic as ever.Ten lines of text... what else to say about this abysmal, vandalistic, stinking heap of tripe?I couldn't watch the whole thing, 1/2 an hour was too much. Or maybe it just felt that long.I got as far as the two generic bald gumps humping the worst approximation of a dead bullock I have ever seen around a generic abattoir, spouting the usual 'I'm a victim with verbal diarrhoea waiting to be gorily splattered over the walls' garbage for an interminable age. I gave up waiting for the alien to emerge and put me out of their misery and mine.",2,0,5,29 February 2012
