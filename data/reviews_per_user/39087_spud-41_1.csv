"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," smashing
","I cannot understand how someone who sees this film cannot be taken by how wonderful it is. True, it is not deep, it is not groundbreaking, and the plot is not the strongest asset. But the acting is wonderful, the characters are believable, and there are subtleties that cannot be noticed watching it the first time. I have seen this movie maybe twenty times, and every time, I see something new, something funny.Guy Pearce of L.A. Confidential makes an astounding change of pace as a very effeminate drag queen, and So does Hugo Weaving from his straight role in Proof. I cannot even look at Terence Stamp anymore without admiring how he could morph so gracefully into a 'woman.'Overall, I sing praises for this movie. It truly deserves the full 10 out of 10.",Null,3,5,19 January 2000
