3:10 to Yuma," 'Just remember, it's your old man that hauled Ben Wade to that stationwhen nobody else would.'
","A good western is hard to come by these days. In the 50's & 60's, guys like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood rose to stardom playing gunslingers in the old west. Over time though, the genre fell victim to endless clichés and schlock. So when a new western is released and manages to impress, I consider that quite an accomplishment. In 2005 I was pleasantly surprised by 'The Proposition', and this year  I'm happy to say that '3:10 To Yuma' is a success.James Mangold's remake of the 1957 film is a crackerjack character piece set amidst deadly circumstances. Christian Bale plays Dan Evans, a down-on-his-luck rancher in danger of losing his land to a draught. As chance has it, he finds himself involved in the capture of famed outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe). The authorities look to Evans to help take Wade to Contention where he will be placed on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. Evans agrees, as he not only feels morally obligated, but placement of Wade on the train carries a $200 bonus  enough to buy back his farm. Unfortunately for our heroes, Wade's gang is hot on their trail, and plan on getting their leader back by any means necessary.Director James Mangold, hot off his hit 'Walk the Line', demonstrates a similar touch that he showed in the Cash biopic. While the film is competently shot and paced, it's his ability to work with actors that deserves recognition. 'Walk The Line' featured Oscar nominated performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, two talented youngsters. With 'Yuma', we have the privilege of watching two of today's finest actors go toe to toe. Christian Bale is well on his way to becoming the best actor of his generation. Whether playing Batman, Patrick Batemen, or Bob Dylan  Bale has demonstrated a range and depth of performance that is unparalleled in movies today. Russell Crowe is equally multi-talented, going from roles like 'Gladiator', to 'The Insider', to 'L.A. Confidential' with ease. He also has an on screen intensity that is unmatched in Hollywood.In 'Yuma' both actors are in fine form, and Mangold clearly is having fun watching sparks fly between them. The movie builds as a test of wills between the men. On one side is Evans, a noble man determined to provide for his family through an honest living. Then there's Wade, a cold blooded thief who quotes scripture just as fast as he kills. Their journey together finds them struggling to understand the other man, while trying to stay one step ahead of the other. Amidst the tension is a constant threat of violence. Their trail is filled with the likes of deadly Apache and greedy posses. Not to mention Wade's gang, determined to make it to the train before his captors and set him free. The film features numerous impressive shoot-outs and action sequences, including a nail biting gunfight during the last act. On the downside, it ends a bit too abruptly and asks the viewer to suspend some believe. All that is easily forgivable though. '3:10 To Yuma' is a quality western made better thanks to the first rate performances by the brilliant leads.3.5/4",8,2,5,22 October 2007
Gone Baby Gone," 'I'm gonna bring her home'
","There is a certain grim ambiance that distinguishes Boston as a city. Within the last few years, Clint Eastwood and Martin Scorsese enjoyed high praise for their Boston based dramas. The city has a natural grit that lends itself perfectly to film. While 'The Departed' utilized the city as merely a backdrop, 'Mystic River' came to life exploring the tensions of the working class natives amidst the city streets and neighborhoods. Both these movies were released to mass critical and public praise, so it's no surprise that Boston native Ben Affleck would choose to make the city the subject of his directorial debut 'Gone Baby Gone'.Based on a novel by 'Mystic River' author Dennis Lehane, 'Gone Baby Gone' is a fascinating crime drama. The film concerns the kidnapping of a 4 year old girl, and the investigation that follows by a private detective played by Casey Affleck. Assisting in the matter is a loose cannon detective (Ed Harris) and a no nonsense police chief (Morgan Freeman). With each clue and discovery, it becomes clearer that there is more to this kidnapping that meets the eye. Matters of right and wrong become blurred and, more importantly, choice and consequence.Director Affleck deserves high praise for taking on a challenging subject and his display of excellent film-making skills. He handles the visual and stylistic aspects like a seasoned veteran, and demonstrates excellent storytelling intuitions. In particular, the city of Boston sizzles with life under his sharp eye. I would even go as far as saying that he outdoes Eastwood in terms of capturing the spirit and nature of the streets of Boston. The film opens with a breathtaking montage of city life, and often slows down to observe everyday people about their blue-collar lives. There are also a number of well crafted action sequences that are very effective and intense thanks to their grounded realism. The acting is capable all across the board, in particular, Ed Harris impresses with his intense and evocative performance. Also of interest is the first rate behind-the-scenes crew assisting Affleck. Oscar nominees John Toll and William Goldenberg provide wonderful lighting and cutting, while noteworthy composer Harry Gregson-Williams delivers a haunting score.The film isn't without flaws, most notable being the plot suffers a few predictable twists and some uneven structure. I'm not one to dwell on this sort of thing. More important are the final shot and subsequent issues at hand. Affleck doesn't take the easy way out with his commentary. The film offers the kind of bold moral challenge that will surely divide audiences and make for great debate long after you leave the theatre.3.5/4",8,2,5,22 October 2007
1408," One Evil Room
","Hollywood loves Stephen King. His work has seen numerous adaptations, mostly in the form of films and mini-series. Unfortunately, for every successful adaptation, we are subject to about ten poor ones. In thirty years his literature has gone through nearly 100 screen adaptations, only a fraction of which have been satisfactory. The dramas 'Stand by me' and 'The Shawshank Redemption' are widely considered to be the best adaptations of King's work. Genre filmmakers David Cronenberg and John Carpenter saw success with their film adaptations, as did masters Stanley Kubrick and Brian De Palma. Outside of those films, most of King's films have ranged from moderate to mediocre. '1408', based on a short story by King, is among the better works.John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a once respected author who has been reduced to writing schlock for years. It's a role tailor made for Cusack, with all of his trademark wit and cynicism. Since falling into his slump, Enslin has made ends meet writing stuff like '10 Haunted Graveyards', and '10 Haunted Cemeteries'. His latest work, entitled you guessed it '10 Haunted Hotels', has Mike traveling the country to investigate the most infamous haunted hotel rooms. Unfortunately for him, every room turns out to be an over-hyped disappointment. So when gets word about '1408', the haunted room in New York's luxurious 'Dolphin Hotel', Enslin is immediately skeptical. Who cares that 56 people have died in that room over the years, rooms aren't haunted. Right? Like Mike, I was a bit skeptical going into '1408'. How scary can a movie about a haunted hotel room be? Well, color me surprised. Director Mikael Hafstrom and his screenwriters have crafted a very effective thriller. What starts as a boring night in 1408 for Enslin, slowly becomes a nightmare of genuine terror and madness. Subtle creeps slowly escalate to a desperate fight to stay alive.The movie owes a lot of its success to John Cusack, who is on screen for about 99% of the picture. His ability to identify with viewers while commanding the screen with his sharp performance is key to the success of '1408'. That, combined with effective direction and smart screen writing, makes this a refreshing little thriller that doesn't rely on the over-the-top gore of most of today's horror.",7,1,2,5 October 2007
