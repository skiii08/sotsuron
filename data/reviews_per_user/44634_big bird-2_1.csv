The Blair Witch Project," Kill the girl....
","Generally, the movie sucks.  Everyone says the concept is so cool and original.  Bulls**t.  It's *The Real World: Lost in the Woods*.  Imagine three of your least favorite, most self-involved Real World characters all fighting to be the one who rambles on the most.  'I'm so scared'  'No you're not, I am'  'Oh, I so totally can't believe how selfish you two are.  I am the most of the scaredest.  Oh, by the way, watch how I smoke while pretending not to notice that I'm smoking.  People who are nonchalant like that are cool.  Especially while smoking.'The character of Heather wins the annoying contest, hands down.  She's the kind of person who has to convince herself that she has no friends because people 'don't understand me'.  If that's the way the character was intended, huge applause to the young actress who annoyed the s**t out of me.Aside from the 9.67 reading on the annoying scale, the movie is less than scary until the end, which, admittedly, was nothing short of creepy. However, I would have liked the whole movie a lot better had I not been subjected to the rest of it.",4,0,1,9 August 1999
