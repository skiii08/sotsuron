It," Turd emoji
","It, looked like something seen in an Agumented Reality, 3d game. It, was not as intense, like the original, because It, was an action game. It, had some scary scenes, creeping in the water, contortion. But, instead It, had far more action scenes. Where instead of the original. It, missed the same affect. Their fear, scaring them, and so they leave, later returning them, as adults. Also the mist, smoke, fog effects accompanying Pennywise, not just the rain, water. It was more brutal, but the kids were annoying, some of their relationship were gone. If It, was shown like this, more kids should have floated. Perhaps It, would have been much scarier as a larger Joker gang. & the law, fire, ambulance, city hall, Swat, & the national guard should have gotten involved. Game over. It, felt rushed.",Null,0,5,6 October 2017
Captain Marvel," Who would watch this?
","The comic was sued for copyright infringement after making only a handful of comics and them being completely removed from the shelves. Sure some exist, nowhere, and look at their crap camp artwork it sucked. This hero doesn't exist in the Marevl arcs. They were created later when Marvel had to adapt. Marvel adapted by making the Marvel-verse, all of its heroes combine. X-men. Shield, Thunderbirds, Fantastic Four. Instead of it previously simply stealing DC tech and getting sued for making lifeless clones devoid of any rationality except for copying DC 's otherwise standalone heroes and villains which make them otherwise exceptional. Superman complicated thier arc with aliens. So they created an Alien defense league combining into lackluster editions. These really didn't do much and were often released as special editions to get their sales up. Unlike Marvel where its heroes are in a Marvel-verse combining in almost every comic release. Apart from a few of their trademarks Spiderman stealing his tech and Captain America his girlfirend was Agent Carter .There was no other hero Captain/Captain. Only agents and perhaps soliders and villains.Today Diseny has bought the rights and simply milked not another stupid hero movie where it seeks to exploit a fanbase already buying the past comics. Adding anything into them now, is exploitation. Turning them into not another stupid teenage mutant superhero movie worshiping some tribal deity about some lesbian looking like a rectum using her ass powers to mepoo.These spinoffs and many of their TV series have become so lame outside of their better films. The big hits. No backstory is needed we see it in the bigger films. We want something dark, brutal, unique, and epic. Instead of another actor dressing up in thier underpants screaming for more money. They're nobody else. They don't provided anything apart entertainment and that's faster becoming a drag in a saturated market using baby formula.",1,50,86,13 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Why would anybody watch this
","Why would anybody watch this? Disney has simply inserted a hero, after acquiring the rights sometime in this millennium. Captain Marvel was previously banned for copyright infringement. As it was a Superman clone because Marvel stole its founding tech outside of maybe one or two ideas. The comics got removed off the shelves. And the prints were abandoned after all of handful of lame comics were released. Very few exist, and their artwork is terrible. And then Marvel created another back story, story arcs, Sheild, and the enitre connected marvel-verse.Prior it trying to get a leg up on DC..Marvel's other heroes were simply copied and pasted off DC villains and heroes. All of Marvel's later heroes connect. Where DC tended to be far more standalone, except for the buddy system. Batman and Robin. Superman and Wonderman. And the lame alien justice league, because of Superman. However the villain and hero stand out in DC. But the marvel-verse makes Marvel unique.Agent Carter was Captain America's girlfriend she died later because she wasn't a winter soldier, when Captain America got frozen/unfrozen. Who the hell is Captain Marvel. Nobody anybody else gives a monkey about. Sure it's milked some milk money. But it is faster running out of gravvy, and makes the better Marvel editions look bad. Adding her into the plot brings nothing but another lesbian playing dressup. We have enough stupid heroes today, enough teenage spin off Tv series that are largely vomit. The only way you actually tell them apart is when they combine into the Xmen, Avengers, big films adding more to a plot line. Putting Captain Marvel into that plot brings nothing to the table .It's not a comic and any newer prints will be meh on collectors editions. Sure there's the dumb tribalism of today worshipping mutations.We've all got the same phone and it sells advertising. Gee gosh gonna buy it. They're getting so stupid today. Or any films are the Batman Superman Dredd with really epic villains, or something unique, unseen, and brutal. Sure fit in the occasional dyspraxic Marvel needing the rest of the band to put thier underpants on.However these spin offs are getting so utterly lame and unremarkable. And the attitude behind them is simply exploiting a fanbase. Into not another crap camp stupid movie. With another pig in blankets looking like a rectum. Got real powers, it's called ass. Mepoo.",1,32,54,12 March 2019
The Irishman," A Classic
","The duration is a long ride, ultimately it is worth it. I am not sure that's the way the story happened, but even if wasn't we'd never know, the movie also makes it clear. They took it with them.Regardless it is a piece of mastercraft cinema, which has been somewhat lacking as a genre of late, and it makes this film all the more worthwhile and rewatchable.The acting, cast, theme, cinematography, and direction are truly calibre in its genre and as cinema, and despite the duration are well worth the entire ride. De Niro is at his best, Pesci and Pacino are also stellar. Stephen Graham was memorable. Hopefullly this film gets the recognition it deserves.Thanks for the entertainment",9,5,10,29 November 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Guardins from a stupid galaxy and it's not Thor's
","15 whole minutes I watched this sitcom for, 15 minutes, and it was enough to put anybody off the 'superpants' genre for life. (An ego they aren't clowns in diapers, but are providing an alternative role models). It was a bad as watching musical stupid heroes. They might as well have sung themselves into Valhalla. No it was worse, they told really stupid fart jokes almost every time they spoke, while flicking 'snot' at the screen, (CGI goop grunting) upon using posh English accents. And in utter disdain I have boycotted Thor and these stupid heroes from memory. Don't bother. You will probably find it worst, because if it was that bad, the source material has vanished. Like in those 15 Surtur was seemingly slain, maybe it was parody. Yawn",1,9,21,4 February 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," Thank You
","I absolutely liked it. Superheroes especially Marvel I can only take in smaller doses, but when we get all those superheros in this film it is so Epic. On their own they can often drag out. DC Batman/Superman/Dredd however I am more inclined until they don't combine well, because they are stand alone, and any justice league seemingly only really stole from Marvel. I admit this film is gonna be marmite to some, love/hate possibly due to continuity. But it's worth it unless they predictably Disney next. There should be a price. Look at our World. Otherwise I might stew. As far as the current trilogy so far, it's very hard for me too pick a winner between the first and the 3rd? The first started it and was a great film, the 3rd however you must watch and make that marmite opinion. Forget the second I didn't like it, many reasons, but that's a separate review. Infinity War certainly lives up too its hype, it is so fresh and enjoyable, they didn't look stupid like all stand around jacking each other off in those other superhero movies where they all do a line dance, singing like a bad music video. It had enough clever one-liners, comedy not too impact its telling, but enough humor for it to also be a hoot. And its visuals, choreography, and story are masterful. Thank you for this addition. It was amazing, and a favorite.",9,1,7,8 August 2018
Logan," Errors
","Dumb stupid error.. This was just too annoying, because you always pay attention during the action shorts.Watch 125.20 now watch 127.16, Charles Xavier. Bad Wolverine's puncture wound on Xavier has swapped sides, bad Wolverine stabs Xavier in bed on the right side 125.20, now good Wolverine carries him down to the truck, but the puncture wound is on the left side at 127.16.And that plastic gun, definitely plastic, 3d printed gun, previously at the pump station. Come on, shotguns don't break in half unless you're Colossus. Not Wolverine who has agility, claws.Yawn",Null,3,10,17 May 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," What plot what happened
","Did somebody hide a Zucchini in the Vibranium and this was how Ultron's AI is born? What was up with that dreadful plot, well at least it has managed to build into a trilogy? Although the only really funny part was Checkov dying, he didn't see the chaingun firing, you must be joking? Mass produce Ironman 3 bots, now Hulk smash them over and over and over and over again, presto the result of the film. Thankfully Pepper Pots didn't join in. All because these Ultron bots had the most annoying Atom (Watchmen) accents ever. The dialogue was boring, the plot was totally screwed, the action was utterly repetitive.Yawn! Apart from some of the better action sequences, there was nothing there, no nothing at all. The actors mostly looked like they went through some motions mostly of something else somersault to go out and get paid. They just didn't jive.The first film was epic, this second film is such a lame comparison.",Null,1,6,16 September 2015
Joker," Does he become the Joker?
","I walked out. This should have been aired on Netflix. It is terrible.infused superhero make-up yarn about something else indy. What am I watching? Norm Bates. Never the Joker. Insert fake medical condition. People laugh when they're nervous, is there a diganosis like Parkenson where they don't stop laughing? No. Although after this film who knows?He was a megalomaniac, pure killer, schizo. It developed from trauma. Youth. The Joker wasn't this. A black comedy.When does he become the Joker? I wasn't gonna stick around. FaceplamAll this film is was another attempt at normalizing a fantasy universe into real people and real politics, today. They've the got mental health, but we better just pretend why they're paid. What? So it stole the fantasy. And it offered us psychology. Who would have watched it if they knew it was this? Would it be breaking its box office? No. So they inserted this. Disappointed. Get your own psychodrama. Give us back the comics. Come on.Only rating it 4 for the Joker, Heath Ledger. What a shame.",4,1,1,12 November 2019
Joker," When does he become the Joker?
","That was never Heath Ledger from the Dark Knight, He was a megalomaniac. The story of his smile, remember that story. His quotes. That joker. It was pure evil, menacing, macabre, and terrifying.What happened in this film? Can somebody please explain why we had a black comedy for the yearly mental health awards, where it has dulled out Indy best left on Netflix. Netflix offers a case study into the superhero. Their life, their family. But never that comic scrapbook of boom, blam, whack, zap, and kapow. This film was truly awful, just soo wrong. That wasn't the joker, at all. It's harder describing what it was, easier just describing what it wasn't. It offered the stereotype. He's just a victim of circumstance. With a chip on his shoulder. It's better to cry about it and try to relate too a schizo. Like every other  granted asylum, it's not thier fault, they're just mental, they just want to be inserted more, faster committing crime and terror. What we watched was an indy flix of a boring case study into a clown with delusions of grandeur, he's walking on broadway for the pretentious fetishes of mental health. An unheard of psychosis made especially for its droll laughter, causing outrage into the current politics. Instead of it being a terrifying killer who doesn't blink twice.I hate this film. Undoubtedly it wouldn't have made its bucks if it hadn't usurped an audience. Give us back our villain.",4,3,9,13 November 2019
