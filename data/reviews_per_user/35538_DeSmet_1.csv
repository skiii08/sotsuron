50 First Dates," A remarkably sweet scenario and cast
","Before watching this movie, and having read in several newspapers and TV guides that this movie was not really worth watching, I expected an all American loves story. Well made, beautiful scenery and a very thin story. But I experienced something completely different.My feeling about this film is that the story was just so utterly romantic, even sweet and very well laid out. The film has pace, is brave in its dialogue, and the actors do their best to really make it work on screen. With this, the scenario is very original. Seeing loss of memory as a classic theme in the movies, this is a very original adaptation of a well known them that could easily fail when treated as a clichÃ©.Drew Barymore is so very sweet in her performance renewed surprise, while Adam Sandler is his regular self, but this time filled with love and ambition in going a long way in pleasing Drew. Their chemistry can be seen from a mile away, especially in the moments of love and laughter.Not bad at all, I'd say, a perfect boy/girl movie! regards from the Netherlands, DH",8,1,2,4 January 2007
