The Blair Witch Project," terrible
","If you like to listen to cursing then this movie's for you. For the rest of us, the movie flat out sucks. There's nothing scary about this movie other than the thought that you actually paid money to view it. The film critics that wrote favorable comments about this movie had to of been paid by the film makers to do so. It should of never been released. nuff said...

Pulp Fiction," Over hyped
","Half the people I know liked the movie, the other didn't.  I'm in the latter group. I'm not sure what it was that I missed that the first group picked up on, but I was bored with it. I felt it had a lot of lengthy, boring, scenes & dialog. I was unimpressed with the acting, not that it was bad but it just didn't grab me. I won't say not see it, but rather make up your own mind.Many in this group liked it so check it out, you may be in the first half I talked about.",4,8,18,18 January 2002
