The Blair Witch Project," Review of Film
","The movie 'Blair Witch Project' was one of the worst movies which I have ever seen.  First of all, this film was really a documentary, not a regular film.  My initial impression was that the photography was amateur and could have been improved upon.  I am now able to see why the film was so inexpensive to make.In addition, both myself and my son went to see the film together.  We are horror film buffs.  My son was sick by the time we got out of the film due to the camera moving around continuously.  We were both very much disappointed with the film and felt that the film was hardly worth the money spent on it.  By all indications, it should be one of the most profitable films on record.  We kept thinking all the way through the film that this must stop.I am a nurse by profession and would like to see a caption added to the film.
