Casablanca," Excellent
","After my first time seeing Casablanca, I can easily say it is one of my favorite films. Casablanca is so captivating, and while watching it, it is hard to not feel like you are a part of the romantic drama that you are watching. There are so many emotions packed into this film, and there is not one scene in the film that you feel like could be cut out. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is undeniable. The two act flawlessly together which really adds to how great it is. I'm still amazed at how well this was made for the lack of technology that was available at this time. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone and everyone.",10,2,3,25 March 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," great
","Having read and loved the book, I was a little apprehensive about watching this. I didn't want it to not meet my expectations. However, it went above and beyond them. The movie really painted a clear picture of everything the book was trying to say. The adaptation from book to film was a work of art in itself. It has such a powerful social message that is really hit home through the way it is directed and the way the actors worked together. Also, I felt that the cinematographer of the film did a wonderful job at capturing the fields and open skies of Oklahoma. The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most realistic and captivating films that I have seen and definitely left me in awe, and thinking about the issues it presented.",8,0,1,25 March 2014
Annie Hall," best of the best
","Annie Hall is my favorite Woody Allen film. There is humor and meaning in almost every scene. Not a line or word muttered is wasted. And a majority of the lines are memorable and quotable. The editing is beautifully done, and the whole film seems to be made up of long takes. Long takes as opposed to short ones that made up a lot of movies in the past, make it more enjoyable and smoother to watch. Also, Allen's approach of breaking the fourth wall is done in a way different than most films that do this. It definitely kept my attention and made the film even more entertaining than it already was. Annie Hall is definitely one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. It beats modern rom-coms by a landslide.",10,1,1,4 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," best musical
","I was never a fan of musicals, and did not have any desire to see this movie. However, once it started, I was hooked. Every aspect of this film was wonderful. Between the chemistry and quirkiness of the cast, there is no way anyone could not enjoy it. There was a perfect amount of seriousness offset by a lot of humor. Also, the bright colors really stuck out and made this film ten times better. The whole set in general was really outstanding. For the time it was made, I felt that the props and settings for all of the scenes were magnificent and ahead of its time. All around it was a wonderful film and made me have a new appreciation for not only musicals but the way early films were made.",10,0,1,3 May 2014
Psycho," favorite Hitchcock film
","Having just finished the first season of Bates Motel on Netflix, I was very excited to watch Psycho, to see what the show was based off of. And I have to say, it did not disappoint. The film is full of plot twists, with an ending that one does not expect. It is also filled with many Hitchcock like shots, being very dramatic and suspenseful. The score of the film adds to the over all horror and suspense feel that the audience gets while watching, and helps make the film the masterpiece that it is. Psycho has definitely been a reference for many horror films to follow, and will continue to do so. It is truly a masterpiece, and I would recommend it to anyone.",9,1,2,4 May 2014
The Wizard of Oz," one of the best
","The Wizard of Oz is in my opinion, one of the greatest movies ever made. The color in this film is the first thing that stood out to me. The transition from the black and white to more vibrant colors like red, orange, blue, and yellows really drew me in and made the movie even more dream-like. Also, the special effects in this film are definitely something to be talked about. Because of the time, the effects are not computer generated. However, this causes you to use your imagination and really engulf yourself into the film to see what the filmmakers wanted you to see. The Wizard of Oz is one of those films that every person should see at least once in their life.",9,3,5,11 March 2014
