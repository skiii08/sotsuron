Black Swan," Whoops!
","Gay porn. No other way to describe it. Pure and simply it's another of Hollywood's subversive attempts to promote the gay and lesbian agenda.WARNING to all decent folks - do NOT see this movie!The movie started out interestingly enough. I could handle the parts where the 'Director' of the dance troupe tries to get the prudish woman who's mother is totally overbearing to loosen up. He even tries to help her get in touch with her sensual nature, to become a woman who is capable of seduction, so that when she dances the part of the Black Swan she won't be so 'stiff' and dull, but when it comes down to it and Natalie and Mila start going at it, it's just too much. That's why I say it's porn, thinly disguised as a 'thriller.' Overacted, over-hyped, and overdone.",3,8,37,23 December 2010
United 93," Powerful!
","Tells it like it was. I haven't seen a docu-drama in a long time that did as good a job as they did on this film. They created the sense of chaos, of confusion, of sadness, of terror, all with very realistic effects and surroundings. There were no outstanding performances, just the whole thing worked together to tell the story well on one of the most shocking days in American history.My wife and I were on the edge of our seats from the very beginning, and the ride didn't stop until the very last scene of the movie. We were RIVETED to the screen! We were both emotionally moved, tears, mixed with the anger and we were sure those were the reactions of many of the folks who were actually there in the places portrayed.There are no '10' movies in my book, only very close 9's. This was a high 9.",9,1,2,18 September 2006
The Adventures of Tintin," Just too.... ridiculous
","Aside from the badly stereotyped characters, and the overly ridiculous action sequences, I liked the movie, and thought it was OK. But, I just came away feeling like somebody had put me on a thrill ride and told me I was supposed to have fun and that I would come away feeling exhilarated but instead I came away feeling set up.I just couldn't shake the feeling. My wife loved it, thought it was every bit the thrill ride. Well, I have to give it those moments. Visually it was very appealing. But then, I started wondering if I'd ever seen any of the original comics that this was based upon. Turns out I haven't seen those either. So, I won't downgrade it on the fact that apparently, it was not very true to the author's original intent.Instead, it felt like Indiana Jones on steroids. It seemed to me they did things just because they could. You know what I mean, they took the type of silly Raider's stunts and had them move to the next level of ... difficulty. That's a poor word to describe action shots, but you get my drift. They just stretched it a bit too far I thought. Then, there's the plethora of silly characters who add nothing to the story but give us some bizarre attempt at comedy.I liked the dog Snowy the best. As he had to be mainly a dog and be subject to some limitations, his portrayal in the movie was at least mostly believable. Not that a comic book should be believable or anything - it's just that I think I wanted to like Tintin and even to think he was a hero, but I couldn't because of all the far-fetched stuff happening around him and to him. Dueling cranes ... what next Mr. Spielberg, dancing hippos? Oh, no, Mr. Disney already did that.",6,37,58,28 December 2011
Horrible Bosses," In A Word: Horrible
","My wife and I walked out of this picture. That's the second time this year we've had to leave a movie because it was just disgusting. My wife was done with it a bit before I was, I guess I just kept expecting it to get better somehow, and rise above the gutter where it started out. But, it never got better. I was ashamed of Jennifer Aniston. I would challenge her with this: 'Ms. Aniston, would you take your mother to see this picture?'My wife was embarrassed by the women in the audience who were laughing at the sexual innuendo and crass jokes in that 1/2 hour of the movie we saw. One woman in particular was cackling like a fool. It reminds me of that scene in Forrest Gump where the guy is standing at our nation's capitol and he keeps getting the audience fired up by dropping the F-bomb. In that case it was an editorial comment on our society's downward plunge, in this case it's a sad commentary how far we've come that is all the writer's (and actors) have left to try to create 'Humor.' It was not humor, it was a portrayal of the lowest in human behavior.",2,7,15,15 August 2011
Hugo," Magical
","There is a rare gift in film-making that can take you beyond the ordinary, beyond what most films portray as the 'Human element.' What has come to pass these last few years in Hollywood and elsewhere as 'Movies' is largely the big budget blockbuster that delves into the gut-wrenching emotions of love, hatred and other primitive feelings as they attempt to make us feel a part of the life and death struggle.Those are fine as far as they go, and I like a good bang-bang shoot 'em up as much as the next guy. They've evolved as I said to use more technology and more 'So called' magic to do what they do. It's all still smoke and mirrors unfortunately. None of them comes close to telling the sensitive tale that is Hugo. We first meet the young boy where he lives, carrying on his meager, miserable existence in a train station. And yet, you have the sense that to him, it's not miserable, he's not lonely, but rather that he's fascinated by the world around him: The life, the hustle, the bustle, the activity, the people, and then you realize it, this is a child, and he's innocent! And yet, Hugo has suffered much in his young life. The tragedy that he is becomes part of all of us. That is real screen magic. The audience begins to empathize with him, even to feel his pain. The pain is real, it's inside each of us, it's the longing for connection, to be part of the story, to make a difference! Those who were in our theater that didn't fall asleep (there were a few, I must be honest, and they snored - how rude!) were touched by the magic of the film-making and given a fresh glimpse of hope, of a new life. We made a connection with the past and learned how that makes us better in our present. We learned that relationships really do matter and they are worth fighting for, even if it means we might lose everything.Hugo is a winner! The magic is not in the film-making per se, rather it's in our hearts as we learn that we are all Hugo.",9,4,6,16 December 2011
No Country for Old Men," Shockingly depressing, too cynical
","*Spoilers ahead!* My wife and I saw this movie Saturday morning. We were totally bewildered and depressed when we left the theater. My wife was actually very upset. I had a time calming her down. Unfortunately (for this movie), we saw the movie 'Freedom Writers' later that afternoon. That movie also starts with a bit of violence, but then continues on toward sweet, sweet redemption. I've liked some of the Coen brothers work (no pun intended), but this movie is clearly too dark and cynical to be believable.It may be truth, but it's only a 1/2 truth since the war on drugs was not 'finished' in the 1980's, and is not over today. There have been battles won on both sides, and evil men like the antagonist in this movie come and go, but mostly die in the wars they seem to thrive on. We all know there are sick people out there, but at the end of it all, if they wrote it to have something incredibly random happen, then why didn't they just kill the bad guy at the same time? I would have at least felt good walking out of the theater.Bad job Ethan and Joel. Bad job.",4,3,7,26 November 2007
District 9," District 9 - Aliens Among Us
","I gave the movie an 8/10, but my wife only thinks it was a 3. She did not like it at all, it was too gross apparently. To me that's an added touch of realism that made it worth while. I tried to explain to her also that the movie was real, that it had actually all happened here on earth during the 20th century, and much of it there in S. Africa oddly enough. Interesting choice of locations for the story.Of course, the scenario didn't actually happen with aliens, but what happened was called 'Apartheid.' In Hitler's Germany we called it the Holocaust. I make the argument that all of these things really did happen between one group of humans and another, so in that light the story is completely believable. Thus, the writers didn't need to look too far or have too much imagination to come up with the idea for this story.I argued with my wife for the point that this made the film better than a 'B' movie, but she wouldn't be convinced. So, there you have it. It's interesting that she has seen Schindler's List and The Hiding Place and other film versions about the Holocaust and agrees those are both great films and great stories. Putting it in terms of an alien race and adding all the glitzy special effects (even though they were good, and probably deserving of an Oscar) just didn't make it for her.It's a decent movie, and I did notice the change over in mid film from pure documentary style to an action film, where it became essential to have extended knowledge of the main character and his soon to be allies. It's a memorable film, one that took a bit of an unexpected turn, I liked that aspect of the movie. Still, I find it hard to believe that an alien race that was so advanced could have found themselves 'out of gas' and stranded on a place like earth. In some respects, that was a flaw in the basic premise of the movie plot I thought.I thought it was a good effort from Peter Jackson and his team.",6,0,1,14 September 2009
1917," War is Hell!
","1917 is very intense, pretty much nonstop action. It has elements of Private Ryan with very realistic and horrifying special effects during the battle sequences, as well it has the 'First person' POV (Point of View) made popular in such recent films as 'Dunkirk' (as well as many video games).There's a bit more to the story than it seems at first, as the desire to fulfill the 'Mission' becomes an all-consuming drive for both the protagonist and the audience. It drives hard to the finish and never stops making the point as so many have pointed out in history: 'War is hell'.We gave it a 9/10 and feel it is a likely contender for several Oscars.To address the silly critics who say that it 'Looks like a video game'. Silly people - video games were given the 'First person' POV so they could simulate REAL war! If you've not been in combat, you might not know that, but don't pretend you know something when you don't!Other critics I've seen have said 'There's so little character development'. My goodness! Do you want to double the length of the film and see his birth and childhood too? It's not necessary for the plot of the movie. The movie presents us with REALISM and ACTION, as well as the fact that in war, there's no time to grieve, you simply gotta keep moving, or you're dead.Even if you do keep moving, you may wind up dead. Ask the guys who stormed the beaches of Normandy, they'll tell you: 'The guy on my left was killed. The guy on my right was killed. I didn't get a scratch.' That's called 'Survivor's guilt' and is quite common.This movie grips you, and puts you in the trenches with the men who were there. That should make anyone shudder!",9,7,11,30 January 2020
Avatar," Avatar - Old Ideas Combined
","My thoughts on Avatar are that it is 'Ferngully' combined with 'Dances With Wolves' (DWW). It's still mostly a comic book though. I found quite a number of faulty plot elements, the 'flux vortex' is just bizarre, I have no idea what that is or why it would lead to 'floating mountains.' I even found some ideas from the old 'Barsoom' series (John Carter - Warlord of Mars) by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Not that I didn't like it, visually, it was a treat, but I'm not going to let 'Bling' overpower my sense that there were some faulty plot elements, and some silly dialog.I liked the idea of telling the story from Jake's point of view. As he learned what was happening, so did we. There's not much sense of transition from human to alien though, just one video log he announces 'I don't know who I am anymore.' Probably a lot of film got cut to make it to 2.75 hrs running time, so I guess that some of the missing stuff is on the editor's floor (so to speak).I found so much of the plot and so forth came from an animated flick of the last generation - Ferngully - that I just kept expecting Batty-Koda to come flying out with Robin William's voice to announce that 'We're DOOMED!' Silly, I know, but much of the visual imagery derives directly from Ferngully. The John Dunbar parallels of the film (DWW) are so obvious as to be monotone. We've seen this theme before, evil corporate empire desires to exploit and displace natives to get at 'Unobtainium.' Was that name for real? Who the heck thought that up? Did they hold a 2nd grade challenge to come up with that one? Overall, Avatar's just one step ahead of a comic book in my opinion. Cheap Sci-Fi stuff of the 1930's, redone with some modern technology. Thus, it gets just ahead of a 'B' movie with an 8/10 rating.",8,2,4,12 April 2010
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Back To Junior High Humor
","My wife and I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy - Vol. 2 yesterday. I have to say we were both extremely disappointed. =(The amount of crass and vulgar humor, as well as the general juvenile level of the entire movie made us both, well, sad. The only redeeming quality of the whole movie was the little tree guy (what's his name ... Groot) running around most of the time, completely oblivious to what was happening in the world around him! He was cute! I suppose there were a couple other decent themes, but overall, we rated it 'Lame'. Typical Cartoon gets a 7. Good ones get an 8. This one, a 5. Sorry Marvel... you guys put comics back into the dark ages.",5,4,8,3 June 2017
Inception," Too Bizarre To Believe
","Sorry, I know most folks are just enamored of this film, either that or they just can't get enough of Leo D. I thought that the film was visually pretty amazing. There's TONS of CGI though, and that makes it pretty bizarre. The camera angles, and the fast pitch come at you and blow you out of your seat, but beyond that there's a bit of plot and some drama, that's all. I found the device they used to have 'mutual dreams' pretty unbelievable.You hook up to some drug induced sleep state and suddenly you're sharing dreams with your best bud? Huh? What's that all about? There must have been more to it, but they glossed over it so blatantly that it makes it just a bit too much hocus-pocus for me. Like I said though, it's very visually appealing, but so are most comic books. Thus, my 8/10 rating.",8,0,4,16 December 2010
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Geriatric Attempt At Reboot
","You know, what bothered me the most when I saw this movie was I just kept feeling that 'Deja vu' like I'd seen all this before. I had! In 1977 with Episode IV! It's simply a reboot, told with a few new characters, and a few ... geriatric ones, who probably shouldn't have been in it at all, except perhaps in cameo roles or some such.I was very disappointed in JJ Abrams efforts, given that he did such a wonderful job on the Star Trek reboot. Anyhow, the plot is nearly identical to Ep. IV, and the plot holes are even larger! The bad guy was so poor quality as to be cartoonish. In fact, I walked out initially giving the movie a 7/10 for being a decent Comic Book adaptation, but that's all. I went back later and downgraded it for being so doggoned disappointing.Technically, the movie is pretty good, with good action scenes, and decent aerobatics with the various spacecraft involved whether they're flying in space or in atmosphere. But there were just too many 'Impossible' things to reconcile for me, like how does a garbage man have intimate knowledge of a station that complex, and how does his 'Captain' have intimate knowledge of the shield around the station, and how come if he/she is actually able to turn it off, nobody else can't simply turn it back on?Like I said, too many plot holes to be anything but a Comic Book, and not enough on the decent acting side to merit any real comment. The whole movie is spent looking for Luke, then at the end it's like we've achieved some state of nirvana in that we've actually found him! We found him! Visually stunning, that final landscape lacks depth because it's like some proverbial vision quest that ends in a speechless moment of awe and inspiration, but the movie as a whole lacks both.Sorry guys. I hate to say this movie was a HUGE disappointment, but it was (disappointing).",6,35,42,12 January 2016
Me Before You," Decent Acting...
","My wife and I were very impressed at the beginning of this movie, and through the middle. We grew a bit uncomfortable when the young girl finds out the fellow in the wheelchair has decided to kill himself (through assisted suicide). At the end of the movie we both felt very let down. Not only did she not succeed in changing his mind, she actually becomes happy about it as if life is only lived for moments when you can really experience something.Sad, sad, commentary on life, and very narrow minded. First, I know a couple people who have been injured and confined to wheelchair, quadriplegic or otherwise. They took the time to adjust, and one has been that way for near 40 years and has a wonderful life. He did not quit or give up on life, just because his life before the accident was so 'Tremendous' or whatever it was the wimpy dude said in this movie.If you want to make a movie about someone with redemption or about overcoming adversity, then you had best not have the person quit at the end, like a whiny cry-baby and try to convince everyone out there that 'The world is better off without me because I hate my life now, but loved it before...' That's a cop out, totally and completely. It's not an ad for assisted suicide, it's just a dramatic interpretation of a dude who gave up, and let everyone down.We gave it 8/10 for acting. But, the overall movie is a 2 since the premise and the interpretation are so wrong. So, it gets a total score of 4/10 compromise from us.",4,8,15,17 June 2016
