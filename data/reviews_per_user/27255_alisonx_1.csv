The Blair Witch Project," dont bother to see this movie
","i just got back from an advance screening of this movie and i must say if i had payed to see it i would ask for my money back. i swear it was the worst movie i have ever seen, it plain sucked. i now feel dumber after seeing this movie. everyone seemed to walk out and feel the same way, like did we miss something? because it wasn't scary at all.don't waste your money to go see it, don't rent it when it comes out, don't ever  bother to sit on your couch and watch it on HBO.",Null,1,3,14 July 1999
