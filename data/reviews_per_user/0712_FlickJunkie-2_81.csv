The Legend of Bagger Vance," Beautifully filmed golf story
","As a director, Robert Redford has gained a reputation for making beautifully photographed human-interest stories (`The Horse Whisperer', `A River Runs Through It') and this film fits that mold.  From a production standpoint, this film is an 11.  It has gorgeous photography, incredible locations, wonderful period costumes and props, and terrific golf sequences.  The story is an old-fashioned underdog story with a man fighting against the odds and himself in quest of victory and self respect.  It gets a bit corny at times with the `Golf is Life' metaphors and the story is predictable, but Redford conjures fascinating characters and endows the story with a great deal of affability.If there is one area where the film falters, it is in the character of Bagger Vance.  This is no reflection on Will Smith, who did an outstanding job with the character.  It has more to do with the way the character is written and Redford's way of presenting him.  Vance is presented in a way that is too quirky and enigmatic which dissipates some of his impact.  There has been much speculation about the character.  Is he a real person, or an angel, or is he just a representation of Junuh's (Matt Damon) mental battle with himself?  The last scene points to the angel theory, but Redford purposely leaves the issue nebulous.  It is a mistake for Redford to personify Vance as a black man dressed like a hobo.  In Savannah in the 1930's, you were not likely to have seen a black caddie at an exclusive country club, particularly one dressed in tattered clothes.  Redford completely ignores the issue of race in the film.  During the entire film, not a single person makes so much as a crossways look or comment at this disheveled black person consorting with high society, which is utterly unrealistic and anachronistic.  Perhaps Redford is trying to contrast the wisdom of simple folks against the deluded self-importance of the wealthy, which is a noble message with a ring of truth.  However, the incongruence of the character and the times makes the entire story much less like a legend and more like a contrived fairy tale.As an enthusiast for the game, I am delighted at how wonderfully the golf scenes are done.  From an athletic standpoint, Joel Gretsch is a marvelous choice for Bobby Jones because Gretsch has a classic golf swing as did Jones.  Similarly, Bruce McGill does a good job imitating Hagan.  McGill is an avid golfer and he adjusted his swing to make it more ugly, more like Hagan's swing.  The biggest surprise is Matt Damon, who never picked up a golf club until this film.  He worked with a golf-pro and developed a nice looking swing, hitting some fine shots in the process.The acting is outstanding.  Damon gives another superb performance, capturing the conflict and determination of the character and the mental gymnastics of the sport.  Charlize Theron is full of affected southern charm and belts out a fine Georgia accent.  Bruce McGill is flamboyant and charismatic as the pompous Hagen.  Though I don't agree with the way Bagger Vance is presented as a character, I can't imagine anyone doing a better portrayal of him than Will Smith.  Smith is charming, wily and cantankerous giving Vance a wise yet homespun air.This is a beautiful film to watch and a gift to golf lovers.  The story is somewhat trite, but the presentation is splendid.  I rated it an 8/10 on the strength of the production values and my love of the game.  Subtract one or two points if you think golf is boring.  Add a couple if you believe that life is a metaphor for golf.",8,0,1,11 April 2001
Vertigo," A Hitchcock Masterpiece
","Many believe that this was greatest work of a master renowned for the outstanding direction of suspense thrillers.  Alfred Hitchcock creates a vortex of emotion and deception in this classic film about obsession.There are so many complex themes to this story that it requires several viewings to appreciate.  It metamorphoses numerous times, shifting from a detective story, to a love story, to a murder mystery, and finally to neurotic obsession.  It is a deep character study of flawed characters. Some are not what they appear to be and others change before our eyes.Hitchcock's direction is superb, not only from the standpoint of assembling the story, but from a technical perspective as well.  The photography, lighting and perspectives are brilliantly done and locations wonderfully selected, especially the shots at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hitchcock also brings forth outstanding performances from Kim Novak and James Stewart.  Stewart generally played admirable and heroic characters in his career so the deeply flawed John Ferguson was a clear departure for him. This is probably his best and most gut wrenching performance and I don't think it would have been possible without Hitchcock's direction because Hitchcock was the master of bringing such characters to life.  Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes (most famous as Miss Ellie on TV's `Dallas') also give excellent performances.Bernard Herrmann's musical score is superlative.  It is beautiful, compelling and chilling and brought additional power to almost every scene. Hitchcock had such great respect for Herrmann that he stated during production that whether the scenes of the film worked or not depended completely on the music Herrmann would write.  He trusted that Herrmann would create just the right mood, and he was correct.The DVD version presents us with a completely restored version of the film with rich color and powerful sound.  The new DVD is the only way to watch this film if one hopes to experience it the way it was originally presented in 1958.This film is ranked number 61 on AFI's top 100 movies of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  It was virtually ignored at the Academy Awards garnering only two nominations for set decoration and sound.  However, it endures in the opinion of many as one of the best suspense thrillers ever made.",10,17,27,2 January 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A welcome addition to a legendary series
","This prequel to the Star Wars series is a welcome addition to the hexology. The story is entertaining and fills us in on the early times of characters we know such as Obi-Wan Kanobi and Anakin Skywalker as well as R2D2 and C3PO.  This derivative work is crafted like a jigsaw puzzle where we already know what the picture looks like in the later episodes, but we don't have the details on how the pieces all came together.Even if you are the only cave dweller on the planet who hasn't seen any of the Star Wars episodes previously, you won't be disappointed by this film. It stands on its own as a solid sci-fi action adventure entry.
Critical to the success of any Star Wars film are the special effects, and in this regard 16 years of technology has moved the art form to new heights. The animation of Jar Jar Binks, the droid army and the panoramic city scenes with the hustle bustle of the futuristic cities was mind boggling. The pod race was a dizzying rocket ride.  In every regard, the effects were an improvement over previous generations.Liam Neeson was a bit too stoic in the role of Qui-Gon Jinn, but his performance in the action sequences involving the light saber were excellent.  Neeson has the intensity to play the character more expressively, so I have to wonder if he was being directed to be more phlegmatic by George Lucas.    Ewan McGregor was excellent as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, but  I found Natalie Portman to be wimpy and flaccid as Queen Amidala.  Carrie Fisher she ain't.  Jake Lloyd was a treat as the young Anakin.  He has a lot of spunk and it will be interesting to see if he can convert that potential from child phenom to solid actor.I'm sure I could pick out little things I wish were different, but this is fantasy entertainment at its finest, so other than a few weak acting performances I have to give this film a 9/10 just for sheer enjoyment and marvelous special effects.",9,1,3,10 April 2000
Ali," No biopic can possibly do him justice
","Muhammad Ali was so much bigger than life that any biopic is likely to have come up short.  But to those of us who grew up watching Ali in his prime, this film is a real disappointment.Director Michael Mann is a highly talented director with films like `Heat', `The Insider' and `Last of the Mohicans' to his credit.  Yet, in this film he takes the wrong tack and clutters it with boring details and excessive focus on racial issues that were ancillary to the life of a very exciting boxer and a dynamic showman.To do justice to Ali's entire life, you would have to make three films.  One for the boxing, one to look behind the scenes of a complicated man, and one to chronicle his interaction with the Nation of Islam and the civil rights implications of his refusal to be inducted into the army.  The most interesting of the three are the first two.  Yet, Mann decides to give us the first and third elements with the greatest emphasis on the civil rights angle, which is clearly the least interesting aspect of Ali despite the controversy.  It seems that Mann is on a crusade to impress us with what a central figure Ali was in the civil rights movement and that his boxing was secondary to that role.  Mann wants us to believe that Ali was a civil rights leader who just happened to be a boxer, when in reality he was first and foremost an outstanding boxer with a flamboyant and arrogant attitude and a rapier wit.Mann completely neglects the element that he presents so superbly in `The Insider', the character development of the main character.  In `The Insider', Mann drills deep into Wigand's (Russell Crowe) psyche and turns Bergman (Al Pacino) inside out.  In `Ali', Mann glosses over Ali's motivations and concentrates more on Ali as part of a larger mosaic rather than the fascinating character he really was.  He only gives a hint of the close relationship between Ali and Cosell, which could have been a film by itself.The boxing scenes were well choreographed, but overly long with too much emphasis on too few fights.  Ali was one of the most active heavyweight champion ever, sometimes fighting four or five times per year, but from this film it seems like he had only four fights in his career.  We didn't need to see 15 minutes of George Foreman pounding Ali against the ropes to get the idea.Will Smith does an excellent job of portraying Ali.  Though he sometimes misses on Ali's rapid fire poetic cadence, he hits the mark a high percentage of the time and delivers a very realistic portrayal.  In the ring, he does a passable job of imitating some of Ali's more notable moves like the `Ali Shuffle' and his penchant for dodging punches with his hands dangling by his side.  But no one can come close to imitating that lightning jab.As much acclaim as Smith got for this role, John Voight steals the show as Howard Cosell.  Though the physical resemblance is not that great, Voight's command of Howard's movements and speech patterns is nothing short of phenomenal.One thing that is very disappointing is that the DVD has absolutely no bonus material.  This is a topic that could have provided hours of background material and original footage and there wasn't even a featurette.Overall, this film is entertaining for those who never saw Ali fight, or bad mouth an opponent in a new conference.  But for those of us who were lucky enough to see this brilliant athlete and flamboyant personality in his prime, this film never leaves the ground.  I rated it a 6/10.  For anyone interested in the real Muhammad Ali, see `Muhammad Ali  the Whole Story', a six hour documentary that will show you why no biopic can ever do him justice.",6,0,1,5 May 2002
Spartacus," An Epic Masterpiece
","Stanley Kubrick has given us many memorable films, but this is my personal favorite.  It is hard to imagine that he was not even nominated for best director in 1960.  I suppose his final satisfaction must have come in the endurance of this film's popularity after all the other nominees faded into obscurity.'Spartacus' is one of the great Hollywood epics and Kirk Douglas' defining role.  It is a brilliantly written screenplay that combines the struggle for freedom from oppression with a compelling love story in a setting that accurately depicts the majesty as well as the corruption of the Roman Empire.  The scenes depicting the political maneuvering of the Senate were priceless.Kubrick's work was nothing short of brilliant.  His attention to the details of the period was wonderful.  The orchestration of tens of thousands of extras in the battle scenes was phenomenal.  His presentation of the love scenes between Varinia and Spartacus were sensitive and compelling.  I was most impressed with his treatment of the slave army.  He put a human face on the slaves by showing mothers with their children and scenes of Spartacus walking among the people.  This completely wins the affections of the viewer.  His pacing was perfect and despite the film's length at over three hours, it did not seem to drag since there was always something fascinating on the screen.Kirk Douglas gave a powerful performance and created a character that was bigger than life.  He was strong and inspirational while simultaneously being gentle and kind.  Laurence Olivier gave a riveting performance Crassus.  He was cunning, imperious, consumed by ambition and utterly heartless.  It is hard to imagine a more nefarious bad guy.Jean Simmons has had an impressive acting career that has spanned more than 50 years.  She is both a great beauty and an enchanting actress.  She gave Varinia dignity, strength of character and a quiet seductiveness that played well off the power exuded from Douglas.  Their screen chemistry was both passionate and touching.Rounding out a great cast were Peter Ustinov who was terrific as the sniveling and cowardly Batiatius always conniving to profit from someone else's misfortunes, and Charles Laughton as the astute and duplicitous Gracchus, manipulating the Roman senate to his best advantage.This is among the best epics ever made and certainly among the top three films about the Roman Empire.  I rated it a 10/10.  This film should be on every film buff's list of required viewing and is highly recommended for its moving story to anyone who hasn't seen it.",10,6,12,27 August 2000
Training Day," Intense, powerful, implausible
","This film starts with an excellent premise and then sprints straight out into left field, makes a right turn at incredible and lands somewhere between absurd and ridiculous.  Actually, I enjoyed the film, but this day of mayhem and corruption is so far from believable that it diminishes the film's value.One of the most important factors in a good cop film is realism.  It requires not just realistic guns, explosions and car chases, but realistic and authentic characters and a plausible story.  In this film, almost all the characters are way over the top.  Rookie director Antoine Fuqua brings great intensity to each frame from his music video experience, and most scenes have an imposing power that grabs the viewer and chokes off his air supply.  However, Fuqua's failing in this film is that of excess.  There are no moments of calm to create contrast.  The film is all storm.  It is well done, but exhausting.Denzel Washington is a great actor.  I say this without hesitation. However, this is nowhere near his best performance.  He was far better in both `Hurricane' and `Malcom X'.  He was robbed in 1993 when the best actor award went to Al Pacino for `Scent of a Woman' instead of going to him for his performance in `Malcolm X'.  In `Training Day', Washington tries far too hard to be bad.  He overacts in spots and he is so intent on being forceful that he neglects character nuances, normally his greatest strength as an actor.  So, while I consider this to be a strong performance by any other standard, comparing Denzel to Denzel, this performance is just slightly above average.  This year, Russell Crowe got robbed.  However, Crowe won it last year despite the fact that both Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush gave better performances.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.Ethan Hawke was also nominated for his supporting role as Jake, and it was a nomination that was well deserved.  This is the strongest performance I can remember from Hawke.  His is the most credible and nuanced performance in the film, despite being in Washington's shadow.  He is helped, of course, by the fact that the character is the only one that is anything like a real person in the entire film.This is a vigorous film that never lets up.  The action and the psychological tension are first rate.  It is just too overblown to be real. And to be great, cop stories need to be real.  I rated it 7/10.",7,1,11,10 May 2002
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts gives a breakout performance
","Julia Roberts outdoes herself in yet another David and Goliath struggle based on a true story.  Erin Brockovich (Roberts) is a down-on-her-luck mother of three who can't seem to hold down a job.  After having an auto accident, she makes a bumpy transition from client to employee at the law firm and stumbles onto a case with staggering implications.  It seems that utility giant PG&E has poisoned the groundwater and the local residents are getting gravely ill.The story starts poorly with scenes of Erin looking for jobs and botching her accident case.  The first twenty minutes of the film could have been condensed into five.  However, once the investigation of the case begins, the story is engrossing.  It is a powerful and well written human interest drama centered on a tough and smart (though crude) woman who leads a passionate crusade on behalf of the victims.Director Steven Soderberg played it straight in filming this after his extremely avant-garde effort in `The Limey'.  His key strength here was the direction of the actors with both Julia Roberts and Albert Finney giving excellent interpretations of their characters.  However, my only negative criticism of the film was the way Erin's boyfriend George was presented. George is a grubby tattoo covered biker (the tattoo on his left shoulder says 'DIRTY') who behaves like Ward Cleaver with a ponytail.  He is genteel, articulate, level headed, patient, sensitive and kind.  All of this is so disconnected with his lifestyle that it seems inconceivable that a character this wonderful could possibly come in this package.Julia Roberts' gave a superlative performance that smashed any myth about her inability as a dramatic actor.  A far cry from her accustomed lightweight romantic characters, her portrayal of Brockovich was gritty, raw and audacious.  Emotionally, she commanded states from manipulative vamp and vicious harpy to sympathetic confidant and indignant crusader.  This is unquestionably her best performance and legitimizes her as one of the more versatile actresses in Hollywood.Albert Finney also gave a fine performance as the bumbling but effective curmudgeon of a lawyer.  He was simultaneously obnoxious and charming and created a good contrast to Roberts' character.  The two of them had terrific chemistry.Aaron Eckhart was lovable as George, although as mentioned above, the character's forbearing personality didn't jibe with his rebellious culture. However, I put more of the responsibility for this on the director than the actor. This is an excellent story that is well and believably dramatized.  I rated it an 8/10.  For viewers who enjoy strong dramatic performances and who are not offended by liberal profanity, I recommend it highly",8,0,1,16 August 2000
Meet the Parents," Don't expect 'Mary'
","At $165 Million, this film was number seven at the box office for 2000. Though it is funny in parts, as is often the case with blockbusters I am left scratching my head at its runaway popularity.  Comparisons with `There's Something About Mary' are unavoidable.  Ben Stiller plays the same kind of sincere but hapless character in each film and they both have a wry and offbeat presentation.  However, the humor in this film is far more lowbrow than `Mary'.  It is also highly predictable.  The least perceptive of viewers can see the outcome of each gag a mile away.I suppose there is an element of identification with the premise, since most people remember their own consternation at the big meeting with the parents of their beloved.  Perhaps the appeal of the film is that we love to laugh at people who are more luckless than we are, and Greg (Ben Stiller) clearly has no equal when it comes to the bad luck he has in this film.Ben Stiller is fast establishing himself as one of the most accomplished Sad Sacks in film today.  He portrays characters with such sincerity and misfortune that you can't help but love him.  In this film, he continues that tradition with an outstanding performance as Greg.  Robert De Niro, who is a great dramatic actor, continues his recent trend away from serious drama and toward offbeat comedy roles (`Flawless', `Analyze This', `Rocky and Bullwinkle').  Although his very presence in films like this is comical due to its incongruity, he is not a particularly good comedian.  I'm looking forward to seeing him in his latest film `Fifteen Minutes' which is a more serious dramatic role better suited to his enormous talent.  I was very impressed with Teri Polo, who played Pam.  She has genuineness and an affable nature that is well suited for romantic comedy.This is a good comedy, but nowhere near as good as the box office would lead us to believe.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is a fun flick with absurdly exaggerated humor and numerous belly laughs, but don't expect it to be as good as `Mary'.",7,0,0,8 March 2001
Unbreakable," Shyamalan outdoes himself
","Writer/director Night Shyamalan had a hard act to follow after his success with `The Sixth Sense', but he outdid himself with `Unbreakable', a film I liked even better.  This is an outstanding tale that incorporates fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, human interest and a complex character study of a man coming to terms with an unusual gift.  The story maintains its intriguing edge throughout, and just when the viewer thinks the last surprise has been revealed, another leaps forth.  The ending is fantastic, and will certainly surprise anyone who hasn't been tipped off.The direction is superb in every aspect.  The photography is outstanding, with creative use of the camera that enhances the mystery and drama of the film.  Though some have complained about the pace of the film, I found it to be necessarily deliberate, avoiding the temptation to rush through the psychological elements and heightening the suspense.  The direction of the actors is also smartly done, with everyone working well together creating a realistic feel despite a story that flirts with fantasy themes.Bruce Willis can't seem to do a film lately without a kid to play opposite. As was the case with `Sixth Sense' and Haley Joel Osment, he works well with Spencer Treat Clark in this film.  The scene where Clark confronts him with a loaded weapon will nail you to the wall.  Willis plays the part just right with a combination of skepticism and curiosity that makes his transition from regular Joe to action hero extremely believable.Samuel L. Jackson knows only one way to play a part and that is flat out. Once again he delivers, with a darkly enigmatic character that makes the entire mystery work.  Jackson's talent and intensity again makes me wonder why he has only been nominated for one supporting Oscar (`Pulp Fiction'). Robin Wright Penn rounds out an excellent cast with a solid performance as Willis' wife.For anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller this film won't disappoint.  I rated it a 9/10.  It will keep you guessing and intrigued throughout.",9,0,0,2 August 2001
Fight Club," Brutal and raw
","Fight Club' is a superb filmmaking achievement.  It is brutal, innovative, raw, realistic, and extremely powerful.  You could not ask more from the actors.  Edward Norton once again portrays a psyche in delicate imbalance with potent and believable intensity.  Brad Pitt moves to the far side of diabolical and excels in making his character both warped and charismatic. Helena Bonham Carter also shines as the Tyler's pathetic and parasitic girl friend.  Fight Club' takes some of the most pernicious elements of societal dysfunction and wraps them up into a single imaginative well crafted and entertaining film.  We have elements of gang behavior, cultism, anarchy, terrorism and debauchery all glorified in the name of iconoclasm.  Exciting, seductive and subversive.  How utterly cool and hip!So now comes the twist.  I hated this film.  It is a monument to everything that is wrong with filmmaking today.  It is clever and technically superb but philosophically and socially bereft.  Its attempt at social satire, while effective and visceral, was destructive and noxious.  I also can't help but notice the extreme irony of using satire against consumerism as the theme for inducing the masses to buy tickets to consume your film.At what point does a film cross the line between art and depravity?  Fight Club' is a brilliant but dangerous film that begs the question.  If art is a reflection of a society's culture and values, then when I look at this film I have to be frightened at what is staring back at me.  When I reflect on some of the most popular films of the last five years, I can't help but notice the accelerating celebration of random and impulsive violence, depravity, decadence, and pure bad taste.  Fight Club' has pushed the envelope once again to find a new pinnacle (or should I say nadir) in the portrayal of these corrosive elements of societal dissolution.It's comical how many people think it is avant-guard to attack the establishment, as if this is a concept only recently conceived.  Fight Club' is just the latest rallying cry to anarchy in a long line of such cries that have plagued society throughout human history.  It always seems to be a romantic notion for everyone to be totally free and just live `naturally' (like animals) until one of those animals decides that it is you whom it might be fun to kill today.  It doesn't seem to occur to those who extol the sardonic message of such films, that they simultaneously promote and lionize societal destabilization, and that anarchy and mayhem are much less fun in real life than when you are watching them in the air conditioned comfort of your local movie house.  Just ask the kids at Columbine High School.I like dark movies as much or more than the next guy, but this film simply goes too far.  There is nothing wrong with criticizing the establishment. Constructive criticism is the only way to bring about progressive change. But this film is merely vulgar cynicism that suggests that mayhem is preferable to imperfect culture.  That is grossly irresponsible. 
So I am placed in the paradoxical position of admiring this film while I must condemn it.  As a flickjunkie I must stand in awe of it as a filmmaking accomplishment.  But as a human being concerned with the greater good of the species, I must cry out against it.  How far are we willing to go in the name of entertainment?  Are we so myopic as to demand entertainment at any cost?  I guess we will see when someone raises the ante and the next shock treatment comes to a theater near you.",9,0,1,10 June 2000
Citizen Kane," A vanguard motion picture
","Probably the most unfortunate thing that ever happened to Citizen Kane' was that it found itself atop the AFI top film list.  Now, no one can simply enjoy the film.  Everyone feels compelled to scrutinize it and make a decision about its greatness.  Asking whether Citizen Kane' is the best film of the century is like asking if Marilyn Monroe was the most beautiful woman.  It depends on whom you ask.Citizen Kane' is not the most entertaining film I've ever seen, but it is certainly one of the most important.  It is a vanguard motion picture and a gargantuan achievement for Orson Welles.  If you consider the fact that Welles was a 24 year old Hollywood outsider who had only done radio and theater when he landed the contract for this film, you begin to appreciate what a big deal it was.  This was during a time when a few studios controlled every film that was made. How many 24 year old actor/directors can you name today, even in a world where independents abound?The story is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst.  Writer Herman Mankiewicz had an up-close look at Hearst as he had been an occasional house guest at the Hearst mansion.  The similarities were striking, right down to the paramour whose career Hearst promoted, who loved to do jigsaw puzzles. The fact that this film was released at all is a marvel in itself.  Hearst went on a personal campaign to crush the film and enlisted every powerful friend he had to stop it.  Louis B. Mayer offered RKO $800,000 to destroy the print.  John D. Rockefeller ordered the Radio City premier cancelled. All of Hearst's newspapers were forbidden to mention the film. 
Hollywood was uniformly against it and Welles was branded an insolent maverick.  The film was snubbed by the Academy.  It was nominated for 9 Oscars and won only best screenplay.  The film turned out to be a commercial failure, losing $150,000.  With all the forces stacked against it, we are lucky to be having this best film debate at all.The story has a simple moral; that money and power can't buy happiness.  We see Kane's progress from a happy child, to an idealistic young journalist intent on helping the common man, and finally to a bitter and angry old man whose innocence has slipped from him.  One of the most effective scenes that illustrated this was the two minute overlay of breakfast conversations with his wife.  It starts with cooing lovers and progresses through increasing levels of discord.  It ends in silence with the two reading separate newspapers, her disdain for him subtly indicated by her choice of the hated Chronicle as her newspaper.What is so remarkable about this film is the filmmaking.  Director after director has pointed to some aspect of this film as having influenced them. The use of shadows and various perspective shots was not unprecedented in 1941, but never before had they been used with so much dramatic impact. What was unprecedented was that Citizen Kane' was the first film ever to depart from the strict narrative format, which moves forward chronologically.  The film starts at the end and jumps around in time based upon the perspective of the person who is telling their story about Kane. So the next time you see a flashback, remember it started here. 
The makeup was revolutionary.  Welles often went through four hours or more of makeup to be properly aged for each scene.  The film also launched a number of brilliant careers.  Besides Welles, Joseph Cotton and Agnes Moorehead went on to long and prominent film careers.If Citizen Kane' is not the best film of the century it is certainly one of them.  Its influence on a generation of filmmakers cannot be ignored in the equation.  People who watch this film and ask, `What's the big deal?' are comparing it with modern films that have borrowed from this film's techniques and undergone 60 years of evolution.  It's like going back to Kitty Hawk and saying, `What's the big deal, the flight only lasted a few seconds.'There is only one rating to give to a film of such monumental importance. It is the consummate 10.",10,2,3,5 June 2000
The Rookie," Inspirational human interest story
","As someone who loves films and baseball, this film was a mixed bag for me. As a human interest story it is excellent, but as a baseball story it is somewhat of a disappointment.  It is a very upbeat tale of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a high school science teacher who rediscovers his fastball at the age of 35 and tries out for the major leagues.  The story mixes together his personal quest and that of the high school baseball team he coaches, both of which overcome incredible odds to achieve near impossible feats.As a baseball story, Jim Morris is really nothing more than an interesting footnote in baseball history.  There are far more compelling baseball stories to be told, like Tommy John who came back from reconstructive surgery to pitch another 14 seasons (that were some of his best), or Jim Abbott who was born without a right hand and pitched in the major leagues for ten years, pitching a no hitter against Cleveland in 1993.  Morris only played for Tampa Bay for parts of two seasons, pitching a total of 15 innings with a 4.80 ERA and almost as many walks as strikeouts.  Still, it is pretty inspirational that he made it to the majors at all given his age.This film plays well on Main Street, where regular folks are reminded of the faded fantasies of their youth.  It strikes a chord because to root for Morris is to root for their long abandoned dreams.  Director John Lee Hancock does a fine job of bringing out the best in the human story, although the sports components are marginal.There are just too many instances of unrealistic baseball in this film.  For instance, Morris is repeatedly shown throwing as hard as he can with absolutely no warm-up.  Any little leaguer can tell you that you will blow out your arm if you do that.  This is especially unrealistic given the fact that Morris had surgery on that shoulder when he was younger.  Unless he was plain stupid, he would warm up before he attempted to throw flat out. 
As an athlete, Quaid is not terribly convincing, with pitching mechanics that are far short of professional caliber.  Kevin Costner was much more credible in `For Love of the Game', though that film lacked the story of this one.From an acting perspective Dennis Quaid is marvelous in the lead.  This is one of the best performances of his career.  He is convincing as the high school coach pushing his kids to reach for their dreams and maximize their potential.  His chemistry with the young cast is terrific.  However, in the pursuit of his own dream, he is even better.  This is a complex and nuanced performance showing Morris as filled with desire and self doubt.  Quaid's portrayal of his determination in the face of his own insecurity is phenomenally insightful and compelling.  Rachel Griffiths and Brian Cox give splendid performances and Morris' wife and father.This is a wonderful feel-good film that is great for the whole family.  I've been a little hard on it because I'm a long time baseball fanatic, but the human interest story is so well done and Quaid's performance so compelling that I have to give it at least an 8/10.  This is a film that everyone can enjoy, regardless of whether you love sports.",8,1,1,2 October 2002
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Ambitious project falls slightly short
","As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film, a lot is lost.  Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off.  What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete.There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic.  The cinematography by John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is splendid.  Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful.  Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel.  The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous.Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film.  There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment.  However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn't much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated.  While the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. By the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal.  Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features.Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight.  When fight he must, Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas.Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia.  In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen, but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic.  She allows the character to be objectified as Corelli's love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right.John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine.  However, Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagia's fiancé.I rated this film an 8/10.    Despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing.  The photography alone is worth the price of admission.",8,42,54,10 March 2002
The 13th Warrior," Well directed period piece has an authentic medieval look and feel
","I have read a lot of criticisms of this film here and elsewhere that I don't feel are justified.  I liked this film.  It is an excellent piece of directing from John McTiernan that captures the medieval period realistically.Contrary to most of the criticism that this film is just violence with no plot, this film has a very definite and sound plot.  It is the story of 13 courageous men who are sent to defend the homeland of a respected king from the attack of the Wendol, the creatures of the mist who are thought to be eaters of human flesh.  It is a story of duty, courage, honor and loyalty, and some very brutal battles.What the story lacked was character development and an archetypal hero. Since that is what the masses expect in their films, I'm certain this film was a big disappointment.  That is what made Braveheart a more complete film of this genre.  We had William Wallace as our reason for watching the battles.  If this film starred Gibson or Arnold Schwarzenegger as Buliwyf (played instead by veritably unknown Vladimir Kulich), and spent a little time developing him as a leader, I'm sure everyone would have thought it was a great movie.They only real flaw in the plot was premise that an Arab that they just met, especially one who was not a warrior by profession, would be selected as the 13th warrior.  This was highly contrived.  This film was an epic saga of human conflict.  It wasn't some romantic war over a great philosophy or ideal.  It was raw survival against barbaric intruders.  It was typical of life in medieval times.  This is not something today's society can really relate to being a generation that has grown up on sitcoms and fast food and whose idea of a threat is if someone insults their cultural group.  I believe that this is the reason it did not have popular appeal.  The response would probably be the same if The Iliad were made into a film without some character development of Achilles and Hector. 
McTiernan did an outstanding job of capturing the look and feel of the times.  The locations were fantastic and the sets all very rough hewn.  The cave scenes were also extremely realistic.  The battle scenes were first rate.  He did a fine job of depicting the thinking of medieval men, wrought from a combination of tradition, myth, superstition, and fear of the unknown in a time when almost everything was unknown.The only real error he made was the depiction of Ahmad's (Antonio Banderas) learning of the Northmen's language.  Clearly, he was not trying to make it look like Ahmad learned the language in one night.  Unfortunately, that's the way it came across.  It would have been more effective if he used successive cutaways of him listening in different situations, on the boat, in a field, by the campfire, etc.Of special note, I saw this film on DVD and the sound was fantastic.  This was superb use of all five speakers in the Dolby 5.1 format.  The forest and battle sounds came from everywhere at once.  Characters who rode off the screen, could be tracked audibly as they rode away.  Kudos to the sound designers.Antonio Banderas did as good a job as can be expected given the way his character was written.  Since the hero wasn't the point of this film (the struggle was), and since he wasn't really even the hero (Buliwyf was), Banderas was relegated to being a supporting actor in a starring role.I rated this film an 8/10.  A few minor flaws did not detract from the excellence of the portrayal of the epic.  Not for the faint of heart.",8,4,9,27 January 2000
Billy Elliot," Almost flawless
","I was prepared to love this film when I read the descriptions, and with one minor exception, my wish was fulfilled.  This is a compelling story of a young boy's courage to pursue his dream, despite its being completely antithetical to the cultural expectations of the town in which he lived.  In a mining town, where men are men, Billy (Jamie Bell) slips away each night after boxing practice to learn ballet with the girls.  In spite of enormous social pressure and a disapproving father, Billy persists in his dream to become a ballet dancer and emerges triumphant.This is a story that is less about dance than it is about social interaction.  The incredible pressure to be what one is expected to be is pitted elegantly against the unyielding desire to pursue one's ambitions. Also woven into the story are various themes about people who are different and how they handle being on the fringe.  The film does an excellent job of developing various characters and making us love them, foibles and all.My only reservation is that the film overemphasized certain of the human stories (particularly the minors' strike) at the expense of the dance.  We see glimpses of Billy's progress as a dancer, but he seems to explode from spastic and gawky to an accomplished tap artist with little transition. Also, there seems to be a disconnect between his exceptional tap skills and his tentative ballet skills, which is so discrepant that it is hard to believe it is the same dancer.  While the dance theme is clearly subordinate to the human issues, I felt it should have been more believable and better developed to complete the film.Not much more could have been asked of Jamie Bell in this role.  In his film debut he is mesmerizing, both in his acting and dance performances.  Bell always found exactly the right emotion to portray Billy's conflicts, disappointments and stubborn persistence.  Bell is the keystone that holds the entire film together and he is the reason it succeeds so completely.The ensemble supporting Bell is also first rate as is the direction of Stephen Daldry.  Daldry gives the story that quaint small town British feel, full of brutal honesty and simple human truths.  Daldry's greatest success is in the pure sincerity of the actors' performances making every frame realistic and convincing, and earning him an Oscar nomination for best director in only his second film.  Julie Walters, also nominated for best supporting actress, does a fine job as the tough and determined ballet teacher, and Gary Lewis gives a standout performance as Billy's dad.This is an inspirational film that is just a hair short of perfect.  I rated it a 9/10.  With a little better development of the dance theme it might have been flawless.  Nonetheless, it is one of the most compelling and uplifting films of the year with a positive and upbeat message that is sure to capture your heart.",9,0,0,22 August 2001
The Others," A triumphant American debut for Alejandro Amenabar
","Writer/director Alejandro Amenabar has burst onto the motion picture scene in a major way with this, his first American film.  The Spanish auteur had already made a mark in Spain with `Abre Los Ojos', a film he wrote, directed and scored, which was remade four years later by Cameron Crowe as `Vanilla Sky', starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman's ex-husband who co-produced both films.This film is outstanding in almost every respect.  With a microscopic budget of $17 million and one bankable star, Amenabar turned a great idea into a brilliant film.  As he has in past films, he also composed the music, which is exceptionally powerful and a perfect fit for the story.  There are few directors with the talent to write, direct and compose this effectively.  It is even more impressive when you consider that he is barely 30 years old.Amenabar's use of shadow and light is phenomenal and he is extremely adroit at utilizing the camera to maximize the suspense.  He is also very insightful in his direction of the actors.  While Nicole Kidman is a veteran, the children are both in their first film and Amenabar elicits terrific performances from each.The story is elegant in its simplicity and the ending is difficult to predict.  The use of the séance scene to flip the film on its ear is inspired, creating a defining moment by taking an indirect approach.  He brings us a supernatural thriller that is scary without the need for blood and gore, making the most of what is unseen.  Often compared with `Sixth Sense' because of the final plot twist, this film is better in most of its technical elements, despite being slightly less flashy in its presentation.As if Amenabar's genius weren't enough, Nicole Kidman kicks out the jams and delivers one of her best performances to date.  She is utterly believable as Grace, the neurotically overprotective matriarch and mistress of the house. Her interaction with the children is exceedingly genuine, replete with nurturing affection and backbiting irritation at her daughter's perceived recalcitrance.  Grace's daughter Anne is played by Alakina Mann who gives a phenomenal performance in her first film.  Mann is sassy and stubborn and shows a strong backbone in the face of her oppressive mother.  James Bentley, as her brother Nicholas, plays off Mann extremely well.  Bentley's timidity and reliance on his sister creates a strong symbiosis between them that is extremely realistic.This is a fantastic thriller by a director with a very promising future. While the pacing is sometimes overly deliberate, the story, music, camerawork, and the acting are first rate.  I rated it 9/10.  Don't miss it.",9,0,0,25 July 2002
Insomnia," Taut detective thriller
","Director Christopher Nolan made a sensational splash with the indie hit 'Memento', earning him this shot at the big time. For the most part, he proved himself up to the task. 'Insomnia' provides a multilayered psychological thriller where two distinct storylines are interwoven in the character of Will Dormer (Al Pacino). The workup is a bit contrived, with Dormer coming to Alaska from LA to help out an old buddy with a murder investigation as he is himself being investigated by internal affairs. This serves as a foundation for the two storylines. The first is the animosity that develops between Dormer and his partner, who wants to cut a deal with internal affairs. The second, of course, is the murder investigation. After Dormer accidentally (?) shoots his partner while chasing the suspect in dense fog, the psychological games begin. Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who is fawning all over Dormer and has read all his books on detective work, begins to suspect that her hero may have feet of clay.The psychodrama becomes intense as Dormer is confronted with communications from his killer nemesis Walter Finch (Robin Williams), while suspicions swirl around the death of his partner. Add to this his inability to get any sleep in Alaska's perpetual daylight and you have a man driven to the absolute brink.Nolan does an excellent job of shooting this film and the editing intensifies the psychological tension. The cinematography is also superb, aided by the majestic Alaskan and British Columbian locations. While the interaction between Dormer and Finch is unlikely, the symbiotic relationship that develops is fascinating and Nolan squeezes every psychological tingle that can be wrung from it.Pacino is masterful as the insomniac cop who has made certain ethical compromises in his career in the name of justice. He looks so terrible that he must have been purposely depriving himself of sleep to increase the realism of the character. Pacino gives Dormer (an interesting play on the latin dormire, 'to sleep', a dormer is the window of a sleeping room) a hard edge that gradually erodes as he becomes more sleep deprived, blurring the distinction between good and evil.Robin Williams seems to be trying to shed his nice guy image with back to back wackos. He follows up his sociopathic performance in 'One Hour Photo' with this character who is a sort of sinister pragmatist. Williams is at his best when he is pushing sanity's limits, whether that be in zany comedy or maniacal mayhem, which is precisely why he was wrong for this part. This character is far too calculating and controlled for Williams talents and the part is also much too physical for him. He is just not convincing as a cold blooded killer and tough guy. That is not to say it was a bad performance, just the wrong actor. Hilary Swank unfortunately doesn't have much to do in a film that is dominated by Pacino and Williams.This is an excellent big budget debut for Nolan and another terrific performance by Pacino. The suspense and pace are first rate and despite the contrivances, it delivers. I rated it an 8/10. Definitely not a snoozer.",8,0,0,9 November 2002
X-Men," Spectacular form with little substance
","Though highly imaginative with astounding visual effects, `X-Men' explodes onto celluloid much the same way as most of the other comic book films, with a weak and predictable plot and characters as two dimensional as their paper counterparts.  This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it is. It is very high on filmmaking `coolness' and the action is intense and impressive.  However, it suffers from excessive form and very little substance.The science in this so-called science fiction story is laughable.  If we are to accept the premise presented here, suddenly, over a period of about 50 years, man takes a quantum leap in evolution and dozens of people develop superhuman powers with none of powers duplicated in any two mutants.  There is no explanation as to what triggered so many drastic mutations; it is just a sudden acceleration of evolution.  Well, evolution doesn't work that way, not even close.  Major evolutionary changes are generally separated by thousands or millions of years and it will usually be a single change in a species that elevates the whole species.  So the concept is really more fantasy than science fiction.`Lighten up', you say.  `Who cares if it is science fiction or fantasy anyway?  It is just an awesome movie!'  That's a good point.  However, even fantasy films need a plot.  `X-Men' trots out the same tired storyline; good superheroes battle to save the world from bad superheroes as mere mortals helplessly look on.  There is nothing remotely novel or interesting about the story.The film tries to make itself socially relevant with platitudinous comparisons between social injustice in human history and the persecution of the poor superhuman mutants.  However, the comparison is inapt since true persecution always flows from the strong to the weak and not vice-versa as depicted here.  Feeling sorry for the mutants is like pitying wealthy corporate executives because everyone fears and despises them.  They have the power.  How much sympathy can we have for them?At the risk of inducing a lot of impassioned e-mail, I have to diverge from popular opinion about how great this film was.  This film was all sizzle and no steak.  There was only one character with a shred of substance and that was Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).  The rest were just cardboard cutouts.In 1995, at the age of 29, wunderkind director Bryan Singer directed a brilliant and exquisitely complex film called `The Usual Suspects'.  He then burst into flames with `Apt Pupil', a dreadful film about a boy who became enamored with an elderly Nazi war criminal who was trying to live out his life quietly in the U.S.  After that disaster, he went underground until `X-Men'.  This film showed that Singer is a stickler for detail and he knows how to make a stupendously vacuous action flick, but it shows not a shred of nuance that would earn it the right to stand in the shadow of `Suspects'. That film showed that he has a certain directorial genius, but we are not likely to see it emerge again if he keeps taking lucrative, but shallow projects like this.The acting; well, there wasn't much acting to be done.  Anna Pacquin and Hugh Jackman had the only parts that weren't utterly superficial.  Both of them did a good job, actually conjuring up some emotions other than resolute righteousness.  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos looked about as sexy as a human being could when covered in reptilian body armor, and she said all six of her lines like a true professional.I'm being overly hard on the film.  It wasn't bad.  It was very enjoyable. It just didn't deserve the raves that were doted on it.  I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the visual effects and the action sequences.  These areas were an easy 10/10.  The screenplay was about a 3/10.  It's definitely worth seeing, but leave your brain at the door.",7,0,0,4 December 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Entertaining but overly ambitious
","When I see a Tim Burton film, I usually come away with a sense of awe and bewilderment.  I am in awe of his visual imagery (though I don't particularly like his penchant for dark exposures and washed out colors) and I am perplexed at his use of this genius to create such bizarre and twisted films.What is most disturbing about this film is that it tries to pass itself off as being based on Washington Irving's classic short story.  This is not even loosely based on that masterpiece.  It bears no more resemblance to the Legend of Sleepy Hollow' than Johnny Depp bears to Ichabod Crane.  To put Irving's name and title on this goes beyond artistic license to shameless artistic forgery for its commercial value.This is not to say that this isn't a good story.  It is an excellent story. I just object to the artistic deception.  What is sad is that we have a whole generation who will never read the story and believe they know it because they saw this film. That being said, I thought this was a very good film that was a bit too ambitious in trying to cross genres.  Burton attempts to create a comedy horror action adventure mystery romance.  It has too many competing elements that distracted us from the main plot.  The comedy element is the least effective.  Burton's wry attempts at humor are sophomoric and puerile and detract from the better elements of the film, namely the horror/mystery aspect.From the standpoint of the sets, props, costumes and visual effects, this film is masterful.  The woods were spooky, the tree of death was fantastic and the windmill was a marvel.  The creation of the headless effect was brilliant use of digital technology.  The decapitations were also superbly grisly and realistic.Johnny Depp did a fine job as the bumbling constable.  He played it a bit too tongue in cheeky, but I'm certain that was more Burton's direction than Depp's interpretation.  Christina Ricci was well cast as the coquettish Katrina.  Somehow I don't think she has to stretch much to play the sassy and flirtatious type, but she played it to perfection.I rated this film a 7/10.  It is very entertaining and has moments of brilliance, but overall the whole is less than the sum of the parts.  And Washington Irving it ain't.",Null,0,0,4 June 2000
We Were Soldiers," Among the best war films in recent memory
","`Saving Private Ryan' redefined the war genre and opened the floodgates to a new generation of war movies.  It pushed the boundaries of acceptability by frankly showing war in all its grisly glory.  As such it gave us a better understanding of how terrible and frightening war is.  `Black Hawk Down' took the graphic violence to a new level, with an intensity that matched the beach landing of SPR, but of a duration that was almost unbearable.`We Were Soldiers' is the latest big budget war offering from Hollywood. In many ways, I consider this to be the most complete of the three. Writer/Director Randall Wallace (who wrote 'Braveheart', 'Pearl Harbor' and the screenplay for this film), takes the understanding of war to the next level, by offering more than one perspective to the events.  Of the three films, this film has the best workup, the best character development, and the most nuanced look at the battle.  He brings all the sustained intensity of BHD in the action sequences, but introduces the NVA perspective, the wives' perspective and a far more charismatic and heroic central figure in Lt. Col. Hal Moore.Based on real events, this film shows war as being horrendous and heartless to both sides.  It expands outside the combat zone to visit the ramifications on the families as well.  The scenes with the wives getting the telegrams are poignant reminders of how war reaches beyond the battlefield.  Wallace's treatment grabs us on an emotional level and shocks the senses.  Unlike BHD, which presented the characters in a very anonymous way, we come to know these characters and their families and identify with them.Of course, the film lacks the hard edge that would make it starkly believable.  It is after all a Hollywood production and not a documentary. However, Wallace pours enough realism into the depictions to assure that this doesn't turn into another sappy melodrama like `Pearl Harbor', which was really nothing more than a romance with a long battle scene in the middle.  Wallace finds the optimal balance between engaging storytelling and the brutality of combat.The acting is excellent.  Mel Gibson offers the right combination of hard nosed officer and father figure (both to his children and his men). Gibson is steadfast and courageous without being harsh.  His portrayal of Moore is so well played, so charismatic and heroic, that it is impossible to believe that such a person could actually exist.Sam Elliot follows an outstanding performance in `The Contender' with this gem as Sergeant Major Plumley, the tough as nails warhorse who serves as Moore's non commissioned adjutant.  Elliot plays the intransigent career soldier to the hilt, where nothing including life itself is more important than honor and discipline.  Barry Pepper also turns in a fine performance as Joe Galloway, the photo journalist who hops on a helicopter to take pictures in the center of the battle and finds himself with a rifle in his hands fighting for his life.This is among the best war films in recent memory and probably the best film on the Vietnam War film since `Full Metal Jacket'.  I rated it a 10/10. This film is not for everyone.  It contains graphic violence and disturbingly realistic battle scenes.  It is a gripping and distressing film that should be required viewing for statesmen and generals alike.",10,154,208,23 September 2002
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A Classic and Brilliant Satire
","Stanley Kubrick's acclaimed dark comedy about nuclear holocaust is among the greatest film satires ever produced.  To truly appreciate this film it is necessary to remember its historical context.  It was produced right after President Kennedy was assassinated and just two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The whole world was gripped with a profound paranoia about nuclear annihilation.   Average Americans were spending their life savings to build bomb shelters in their basements.A strong anti nuke sentiment was building in the U.S. and anti-nuke protests abounded.  This film was one of two anti-nuke movies made in 1964.  The other was `Fail Safe' starring Henry Fonda and Walter Matthau which was a heavy handed drama that depicted an accidental breakdown of the Fail Safe system that resulted in a nuclear attack on Russia.  `Fail Safe' conveyed its anti war message through a realistic dramatization of an accidental war that frightened the most cavalier of viewers.  `Strangelove' accomplished its purpose through brilliant satire, turning strident generals and politicians into absurd caricatures.  The dire nature of the topic at a time when real fear was at its height produced a catharsis that made this film even funnier when it was first released than it is today.Kubrick's direction was nothing short of genius.  The film is laced with so many subtle innuendoes and ironies; one could see it twenty times and still not find them all.  For instance, most of the names had sexual connotations. Strangelove (perversion), Mandrake (a root to used to promote conception), Merkin (slang for female genitalia) Muffley (same), Buck (stud) Turgidson (distended with swelling).  The battle to take over the air force complex took place with a sign that said, `Peace Is Our Profession' in the background.  Then there is President Muffley's great line, `You can't fight in here, this is the War Room!'The entire ensemble gave superlative performances.  Peter Sellers was marvelous playing three parts.  As the President, he was deadpan and serious while delivering one hilarious line after another.  As Mandrake, he was the gentlemanly Brit trying nervously to reason with a madman.  Finally, his best performance was as Dr. Strangelove, a crippled immigrant German scientist who kept inadvertently calling the President, `Mein Fuhrer'.  This was Sellers at his zaniest, and it was some of the best physical comedy I've ever seen.George C. Scott was perfect as the gung ho war hawk.  He brayed, strutted, and played the butt kicking military man to the hilt and beyond.  This part was a harbinger of his most famous role as Patton, where he played essentially the same character without the tongue in cheek embellishments. And who can forget Slim Pickens, who is shown on the cover of the video box riding the nuke to ground zero, in one of the funniest and most famous scenes in the history of film.This is one of the most creative, witty and effective lampoons ever done. It makes its point effectively by poking fun at people who take themselves all too seriously, and making us laugh at that of which we are most afraid. I rated it a perfect 10.  `AAAAAHooooo!'",10,1,1,7 September 2000
The Beach," Noir Bizarre
","Leonardo DiCaprio must have been very desperate for an antihero role to agree to this turkey of a script.  No amount of camera magic by Danny Boyle or idyllic locations could save this dreadful story.  It spasmodically progresses from implausible, to inconceivable and finally to demented.  It is Fantasy Island' meets Apocalypse Now'.  The only way to classify it would be Noir Bizarre.John Hodge and Danny Boyle team up to prove that one success in avant-garde filmmaking (Trainspotting) does not necessarily spill over into future projects, though I must say that Boyle's direction was the only thing that kept this film from being a total disaster.  His brilliant camerawork and cinematography helped keep my mind off the peculiar and disjointed content.As far as the acting goes, this was The Leonardo DiCaprio Show.  Though there were additional characters in the film, other than a cameo by Robert Carlyle they were the equivalent of extras that had been elevated to speaking parts.  DiCaprio gave a good performance, but his character was so mercurial that it is hard to say he really nailed it.  He ran around with his shirt off a lot, so I guess that will keep the teenyboppers happy.I rated this film a 4/10 on the strength of the cinematography.  The story was a 1 or 2 at best and DiCaprio was not enough to elevate it to the level of mediocrity.  This is a film for die-hard Leo fans only.",4,0,1,20 August 2000
The Best Years of Our Lives," A moving character study of the aftermath of war
","This outstanding 1946 film looks at WWII from a different perspective.  It examines the plight of soldiers returning after the war.  It follows three servicemen who meet on a flight back to their hometown.  The story is well crafted, depicting men from very different backgrounds, each from a different branch of the service and each with a different challenge to face.Fred (Dana Andrews) was a bombardier, a dashing captain in the Air Corp.  He is coming home to a beautiful wife (Virginia Mayo) and no job prospects. His wife loves to party but his job as a soda jerk can't keep pace with her penchant for spending.  Al (Frederic March), a former banker, was a sergeant in the infantry with a wife of 20 years (Myrna Loy) and two grown children. He comes home to a distant wife and a troubled marriage.  He is a banker with a heart, which evokes derisive scrutiny from his boss and the other bankers.  Homer (Harold Russell) was a sailor who lost his hands in a fire onboard ship.  He is returning to his parents and his long time girlfriend Wilma (Cathy O'Donnell) feeling certain that she will never be able to love him with his disability.William Wyler (Wuthering Heights, Roman Holiday, Ben-Hur) is one of the most renowned directors in filmmaking history, having won four Oscars in twelve nominations.  His direction here is superb.  This is a compelling character study with nuance, sensitivity and insight.  The scenes of the uneasy moments of reunion were stirring, especially in the case of Homer, who was tormented and insecure about how he would be accepted without his hands. Wyler takes us right into the most intimate thoughts and feelings of these families as they attempt to deal with challenges for which they are not totally prepared.  The scene where Wilma sees Homer without his prosthetics for the first time is one of the most touching and poignant ever filmed.This is a candid look at the issues of the day.  The film addresses the burgeoning Communist threat and the sense of betrayal at the actions of our former Soviet allies after the war.  It refers frequently to the nuclear threat and the fear of mass destruction.  Most importantly, it shows how difficult it was for servicemen to adapt to a world that had become accustomed to getting along without them.The acting was outstanding across the board.  Frederic March was excellent as the banker trying to hold together a troubled marriage.  He gave a towering performance and won an Oscar for best actor.  Andrews, who wasn't nominated (and should have been), also gave a fabulous performance as the glamorous flyboy who comes home to discover he has no skills and can't get a job.  Harold Russell won a best supporting Oscar for his portrayal of the sailor trying to regain his self-respect after the loss of his hands. Russell actually lost his hands in the service in an explosives accident during a training excercise. He is amazingly dexterous using his prosthetics. His portrayal of Homer had such affability, depth and sensitivity that it is difficult to believe this was his acting debut.This film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture, Best Actor for March, Best Director and Best Supporting Actor for Russell.  It is ranked number 37 on AFI's top 100 of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  For anyone who enjoys a powerful and emotional character study, this classic is a must-see.",10,2,3,11 December 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," Zellweger shines as a quintessentially English girl
","This film is another excellent showcase for the talents of Rene Zellweger. It is a fairly common occurrence for British actors to play American characters with varying degrees of success in duplicating an American accent.  It is almost unheard of for an American to play a British character, and when it does happen the accent is almost always awful. Zellweger nails both the accent and the demeanor of the quintessential middle class English girl and is absolutely charming in the role.The screenplay is an adaptation of Helen Fielding's novel of the same name that follows the single life of everywoman Bridget through the trials and tribulations of being a singleton.  Fielding unabashedly admitted in interviews that the original story was borrowed from Jane Austen's `Pride and Prejudice', going so far as to name one of the main characters Darcy (Colin Firth), the identical name of the corresponding character in Austen's novel.  To complete the bizarre crossbreeding, Firth played Darcy in the BBC production of P&P just before being cast in this role.Fielding's screenplay is full of the ironic and droll humor that makes English comedy unique.  Bridget is written as such an adorable ditz that you can't help loving her, especially with Zellweger playing the role.  First time director Sharon Maguire does a bang up job of keeping the silliness moving at a rapid fire pace.Zellweger is perfect for this role and must be commended for expanding her horizons (in all senses of the word).  She packed a great deal of weight onto her normally svelte frame to properly depict Bridget's weight problem. She then boldly allowed herself to be photographed in various skimpy outfits where flab burst forth from every seam.  Even more important than her excellent English accent is her comic ability to make the most of every peculiar situation with matter-of-factness so natural it is hard to believe that she didn't grow up in England.Zellweger totally eclipses her male leads in energy, comedic ability and charm.  The normally likeable and bumbling Hugh Grant is sorely miscast as the jerk.  Grant's strength is his sincerity and his character doesn't possess any, leaving him adrift in his ability to interpret the role. Firth, who has excellent comedic and dramatic skills, is really wasted in a role that mostly sees him leering dourly at Bridget for two thirds of the film.  When he finally gets a chance to interact he is very good in a stuffy sort of way that is right for his character.This is a delightfully wacky comedy with a fabulous performance by Rene Zellweger.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is peppered with funny truisms about single life that make Bridget's plight one that is with which easy to identify.",8,0,0,21 October 2001
American Pie," Finally, the real thing
","Over the years there have been dozens, maybe hundreds of high school hijinks films, most of which are sophomoric caricatures which try to outdo each other in the grossness of their cliches.  American Pie has run away from its pubescent pack by capturing high school the way it really is.  Four years of frustrated preoccupation with sex; what it is, who's done it and how to get it.  This movie is hilarious, mostly because it depicts the essence of what it is like to be wrestling with the confusion of emerging sexuality while trying to convince everyone else that you are cool.Director Chris Weitz has found the right balance between sexual obsession and teenage self consciousness.  The fact is no-one is as experienced as they pretend, and they're scared to death of the embarrassment it would cause if everyone knew.The skits are mostly funny, sometimes raunchy, sometimes touching, but always right on the mark emotionally for that age group.
Jason Biggs (Jim) takes the cake (pie) when it comes to comic prowess in this film.  Alyson Hannigan is priceless as the nerd girl refugee from band camp.This film is a must see good time.  Check your maturity at the front door and just enjoy.",8,0,0,2 January 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A gargantuan filmmaking achievement
","Prior to this film, Director Peter Jackson was obscure even among the anonymous wannabes of the film industry.  His resume consisted of a half a dozen indy films in the horror and comedy genres.  If you took the budgets of all his prior films together, they wouldn't equal his salary for this franchise.  He now owns the second highest grossing film in history.  Talk about a Cinderella story!This film was somewhat of a personal obsession for Jackson.  It took eight years from inception to completion.  He originally pitched the idea to Miramax who agreed to take it on and then balked at the cost of a two movie deal and backed out.  Desperate to save the project, he presented it to New Line Cinema and convinced them that if he filmed in New Zealand, used his own effects company and filmed all three movies back to back, he could make three films for less than the cost of two.  They bought the project and gave him a record $270 Million budget for the three.  He completed the filming for all three films in 16 months of continual shooting, a record.Jackson's task was daunting.  He wanted to create a film with mass appeal that was true to the classic books.  Considering the devoted following of Tolkien's trilogy, their preoccupation with the smallest trivia and the sheer volume of the works, this was an almost impossible task.  Jackson decided to lean toward the action/adventure elements, while paying homage to aficionados with scenes that compressed the intricacies of the various cultures and contained allusions to various pieces of trivia that only devotees of the books would understand.  The result is a terrific film that doesn't leave the books out of the screenplay.The transformation of the real world into the fantasy world is nothing short of fantastic.  The combination of makeup, set decoration, costumes, New Zealand locations and special effects sets a new standard for this or any genre.  The attention to detail is astounding from the elf ears to the hobbit toes.The ensemble cast does a fine job without any need for a superstar.  Elijah Wood is lovable and believable as the dauntless Frodo.  Wood has the perfect combination of childlike exuberance and steely resolve to play the ring bearer.   Ian McClellan, who is a big ring fan himself, is perfectly cast as Gandalf.  With almost 40 years in TV and films, McKellen is one of the veterans of the cast.  He is a powerful dramatic actor and he renders Gandalf with great range.  He is formidable and commanding in some scenes, and tender and paternal in the scenes with Frodo.  Along with Christopher Lee (55 years in film) the battle of the elders is given enormous dramatic power.Viggo Mortensen is awesome as Aragon.  Mortensen demanded to do all his own stunts and trained exhaustively at swordsmanship and other combat skills to make his fight scenes as realistic as possible.  In one scene he had a tooth knocked out and after a quick trip to the dentist he was back on the set later that day.  Ian Holm is wonderful as Bilbo Baggins.  Holm captures the ageless hobbit with a youthful enthusiasm that belies his advanced age.This film is really more the first episode of a miniseries than a film that stands alone.  By the end it is clear that we haven't yet reached the middle, even if you never read the books.  Still, at three hours, it never drags.It is a tremendous filmmaking achievement that redefines the fantasy genre and sets production standards that will be difficult to equal.  It is fabulously entertaining for audiences of all ages.  One cannot see this film and not be eager for the next episode to be released.  I rated it a 10/10. It is motion picture history in the making.",10,2,2,29 August 2002
Cast Away," Mediocre story propped up by outstanding Hanks performance
","The last time Tom Hanks teamed up with director Robert Zemeckis the result was `Forrest Gump'.  I can safely say this is no `Forrest Gump'.  FG was a terrific story, further enhanced by outstanding acting.  This is a decent story propped up by phenomenal acting.The initial premise was intriguing.  A Fedex employee is stranded on a deserted island and is forced to use his ingenuity to survive.  At first, it is fascinating watching Chuck (Tom Hanks) adapt to his stark environment. However, after about an hour of screen time devoted solely to his island exploits, the film begged for a cut to somewhere else.  There were numerous themes that were running simultaneous to his island struggles.  There was the search and rescue, and Kelly's (Helen Hunt) coming to terms with his loss to mention the two most obvious themes that were completely neglected.Instead, Zemeckis decided that we should have all Tom all the time, which despite his gargantuan talent and over the top performance, became just a bit more Tom than I could stand.  Zemeckis did a superb job with the photography and induced one of Hanks best performances.  Unfortunately, the film became one-dimensional and began to bog down.  The ending brought no relief from the drudgery, leaving viewers adrift without the emotional release necessary to bring the story to closure.Tom Hanks was in top form.  He deservedly was nominated for yet another best actor award by the Academy (his fifth).  It seems everywhere I turn lately I see Helen Hunt.  She made four films in 2000 and I have seen them all in the last two months.  This was one of her better performances of the year, though the part was small.The film grossed over $200 million, which shows that for most people just being able to see Tom Hanks is enough.  I rated it 7/10.  The one-dimensional story and flat ending stifled my enthusiasm despite a tour de force performance by Hanks.",7,0,1,17 July 2001
American Psycho," A Directorial Hack Job
","Not having read the book, I will take this film on its own merits. `American Psycho' is a satirical horror film that had greater potential than was realized.  Mary Harron's adaptation and direction seems to be the problem.  Part of the story was a lampoon of the excessive materialism of the 1980's, focusing particularly on the yuppie lifestyle.  That should have served as the background for the character study.  However, Harron pushed it to the foreground and exaggerated the portrayals of yuppie superficiality and arrogance to the point where it became sophomoric.  She then pounded on the point until it was threadbare.The film would have benefited from more development of Bateman's tortured inner self rather than this obsession with his and his friends' way of life. The story presented an opportunity for a fresh approach to the horror genre.  Most horror films are presented from the perspective of the victims, whereas this story was from the killer's perspective.  In addition, since it was a first person narrative, we had an opportunity to look inside the killer's head.  Though some of that was done, too much of the introspection focused on his thoughts about his lifestyle and not enough on his feelings about the people he was killing or the acts themselves.Another problem is that the killings were sloppily done.  In most cases it is inconceivable that he wouldn't have been immediately apprehended based on all the forensic evidence he was leaving behind.  This is the director's way of giving us a not so subtle push as to how to interpret the ending.  If the killings were masterfully planned and executed, the ending would have been much more perplexing and effective.  The acting by Bale was excellent.  Though I didn't agree with Harron's vision of Bateman as the poster child for yuppie conceit and tawdriness, Christian Bale played the caricature to the hilt.  He was more pompous and supercilious than your typical Roman Emperor.  The scene depicting his emotional disintegration was terrifically done and very intense.Overall, the way the story was presented created an air of incredulity about all the characters and their behavior, which took the effectiveness out of the psychological angle.  That left us with a mindless horror flick with only mediocre effects.  Despite some excellent acting, I rated this film a 4/10.  A directorial hack job marred a good story concept.  Since it failed miserably at the box office, the film's best hope is that it becomes a cult classic in rental.  It is kitsch enough for that to be a distinct possibility.",4,2,6,9 September 2000
North by Northwest," Better than most, but not Hitchcock's best
","This is acclaimed by many as one of Hitchcock's best films, but it is also known as one of his biggest blunders.  It is generally agreed that `The Master of Suspense' stumbled badly by revealing the identity of George Kaplan early in the film, in the scene where the CIA members discuss what to do about Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant).Thornhill is a heady advertising executive who is abducted at gunpoint and taken to a man named Vandamm (James Mason) who asks him cryptic questions and keeps calling him George Kaplan.  Thornhill responds that he doesn't know George Kaplan and that they are confusing him with someone else. Through this entire sequence, we are never sure whether he is Thornhill or Kaplan.  The film would have been far more intriguing if this were left a mystery until the end, rather than having it cleared up twenty minutes into the plot.It is thought that Hitchcock believed that the introduction of Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) would replace one mystery with an even better one. However, Eve's motivations are too transparent and even of the dullest of viewers can discern that their meeting on the train is no chance encounter. Eve is far too forward and obvious, especially for the 1950's.  It is hard to believe there is anyone who wouldn't be a tad suspicious at her behavior. Though we are left with more than a few questions about Eve after the love scene, imagine how wonderfully confused we would have been if Kaplan's identity weren't revealed so early in the film.  We would know only what Thornhill knew about why he was being pursued and seduced, which is next to nothing.Despite these flaws, the film is still intriguing, with a number of unpredictable twists.  The second half of the film is much tighter, and the chase scene on the face of Mount Rushmore is one the classic suspense scenes in the history of film.  Hitchcock tried to get permission to shoot the scene on the real Rushmore, but he was refused.  Not to be deterred, he had his own Mount Rushmore set built that was indistinguishable from the original earning an Oscar nomination for set decoration.The acting is excellent.  Cary Grant is at his debonair best as the acerbic ad executive who is beguiled by Eve's beauty and charm.  Eva Marie Saint is best known for her movie debut as Edie in `On The Waterfront', but she is every bit as good in this film.  Hers is a very complex character, duplicitous and devious, yet vulnerable and torn, and she handles it with facility.  James Mason is enigmatic and elusive as VanDamm and a youthful Martin Landau does a nice job as VanDamm's tough lieutenant.I enjoyed this film, but I don't believe it attains the level of excellence of Hitchcock's other renowned films (`Psycho', `Vertigo' and `Rear Window'). I rated it 9/10 with a point deducted for blowing the Kaplan question. Even so, a bad day for Hitchcock is like the best day for most directors.",9,2,3,21 April 2001
U-571," Rises above its flaws to deliver non-stop action
","A writer/director can take only so much artistic license before a story that is supposedly truth-based turns into a sham.  Jonathan Mostow runs dangerously close to that line.  The list of inaccuracies and improbabilities in this film is lengthy.  As has been noted numerous times, the British and not the Americans cracked the enigma code.  There were no blacks serving with whites on submarines, due to the segregation policy of the U.S. military before 1946.  The Germans were not evil, cold-blooded killers who strafed unarmed survivors.  The likelihood of a single torpedo hitting a ship showing only a bow profile is astronomically low, etc., etc., etc..  If you put aside the fact that this was pure fantasy rather than fact-based fiction, this film was great entertainment.  The story was engrossing, the action was non-stop and the suspense was extremely well done.  Mostow uses every submarine film device ever invented and gives the crew a continual flow of crises to solve.  Yes, it smacked of U.S. nationalism to a fault and the music was so insipidly patriotic it became corny.  However, though this was a shamelessly derivative work, it was intense and twisty with great special effects, and that made it worth watching.Many people have compared this film with `Das Boot', concluding that this film pales by comparison to that classic.  `Das Boot' is one of my all time favorite films, but I really don't think you can compare the two.  They were really telling completely different types of stories.  `Das Boot' was a highly realistic character study and `U-571' was a fantasy action/adventure flick.  The only thing that they had in common was the fact that they each took place inside a German submarine.  The acting was nothing special, but in defense of the cast, the film wasn't really about the characters so they didn't have much to do except look tense.  The best performance was delivered by Harvey Keitel as Chief Klough, the old sea dog who held the crew together.  Matthew McConaughey was hollow and wooden.  This was not one of his better performances.Despite a long list of grievances, this film still delivers high power entertainment and rises above its many flaws.  I rated it a 7/10.  Be prepared to suspend a ton of disbelief and then enjoy the ride.",7,0,1,19 October 2000
American Beauty," Okay but not great
","I was eager to see this once available on rental because I was wondering what all the fuss was about.  After having seen it, I'm still wondering.  At the risk of inducing a lot of indignant e-mail, I have to say that I didn't think this film was all that great.  As a matter of fact, it was only somewhere between okay and good.Admittedly, it was an effective lampoon of American culture, with the clear message that life is ironic and we need to get our priorities straight.  But it was far from a defining moment in cinematic history, as has been implied in all the hype.  The fact that it is rated the #2 movie of all time on the IMDb list sends me an even more frightening message about American culture than the film itself.The film had a sardonic tone and a wry style, most certainly by design, but it was taken to excess to the point of being bizarre and cartoonish.  The humor was sophomoric, the characters were more like caricatures than people and everything in the film was dreadfully clichÃ©.  The story gets high marks for irreverence, but not for realism or subtlety.The direction by Sam Mendes, other than that of the actors, was really nothing special.  Other than a few vista shots, some rose petal shots and the dancing paper bag, it was visually pretty mundane.  It was also structurally unsound as a first person narrative.  The narrative format is from the speaker's perspective and implicitly must limit itself to events the speaker experienced directly or of which he had indirect knowledge.  The film included numerous scenes and conversations of which Lester could not possibly have had any knowledge by the end of the film.  That's just sloppy storytelling.The one area where this film shines is the acting.  Though I don't agree with the character interpretations, the character presentations were superb. Kevin Spacey was fantastic as Lester.  He got better as the movie progressed as he was allowed to break out of his caricature.  Annette Benning was not allowed that luxury, but played the fanatical yuppie role to the hilt.  Thora Birch as daughter Jane had the good fortune of playing the only realistic character in the entire movie.  She was quite impressive, playing the part with a sensitivity and poise belying her experience as an actress.This was a decent film, no more, no less.  There were so many excellent films in 1999, that it is hard for me to understand this film's mass appeal. Perhaps we have become so overwrought as a society that this film struck a chord.  That is decidedly to its credit, but it doesn't make it a great film.  I rate it a 6/10.  A huge disappointment.",6,0,0,14 May 2000
The Patriot," Masterful filmmaking
","War is horrific.  If there is one message that comes across clearly in this film that is it.  `The Patriot' is an extraordinarily graphic and compelling depiction of 18th Century warfare.  It is difficult to imagine a scene more terrifying than the sight of thousands of men leveling muskets at you from a distance so close you can see the sweat on their faces.  Woven into this revolutionary war film was a human drama about a man and his family and the devastating effect the war had on them.In an effort to make the audience sympathetic to the hero, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan), wrote an overly melodramatic and sentimental script with excessively noble Americans and incredibly evil Brits.  Though I didn't have a real problem with this, I can see how many people would be rolling their eyes, especially the ones whose top priority was the war itself.  Still, for those who like a good human drama, this film grabs the emotions and makes one scream out in vindication when the bad guys get what they deserve.  It is also difficult not to feel a bit patriotic while watching this film.  I was put off however, by the preachy, politically correct pabulum regarding the slave soldiers.Other than that criticism, which is more a matter of personal preference, this film was extraordinary.  It was brilliantly directed.  With this film, Roland Emmerich (Godzilla, Independence Day) has moved beyond schlocky sensational films and actually assembled a substantial film with a story that wasn't tongue in cheek.  If there is one area where Emmerich excels, it is visual effects, and this film is another shining example of that.  He created graphic and grisly effects of decapitations and dismemberments that were disturbingly realistic.  His choreography of the combat with thousands of extras was magnificent.  In some cases, he used computer simulations for panoramic battlefield scenes that were indistinguishable from action created by real humans.  The costume design by Deborah Lynn Scott (Wild, Wild West, Titanic) was superlative.  She actually went to the Smithsonian Institution to use real revolutionary uniforms as her models for the patterns.  The entire period was fantastically rendered.  The five-speaker surround sound on the DVD was awesome, especially during the combat, with voices and battle sounds coming from all directions.The acting was superb.  Mel Gibson was completely immersed in his role as the reluctant Colonel, for whom the war was a personal vendetta.  He had to handle quite a range of emotions, from the tenderness of a father to the rage and savagery of battle and the seething hatred of the murderous dragoon.  He was outstanding in every scene.  Heath Ledger (Ten Things I Hate About You) was also excellent as the Martin's idealistic son whose war started as patriotism and became personal in the end.  Jason Isaacs was supremely evil as the nefarious dragoon colonel who delighted in the murder of women and children and in burning settlers alive.This was a masterful filmmaking achievement that went a bit overboard on the sentimental side.  It was highly entertaining with a strong and engaging story and characters with whom it was easy to identify.  I rated it a 9/10. Be forewarned; it's not for the squeamish.",9,1,2,16 November 2000
Being John Malkovich," Clever and imaginative film
","This is a clever and imaginative story with a lot of droll and peculiar situations that make for an entertaining film.  John Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a frustrated puppeteer who can't find work.  He takes a job as a file clerk and discovers a portal that leads inside John Malkovich's head that allows him to see and experience what Malkovich is doing for 15 minutes until it spits him out on the New Jersey Turnpike.  The remainder of the film uses this device to create absurd uses for the portal, from selling tickets to Malkovich to two women having sex using Malkovich's body.Ultimately, the puppeteer discovers how to take over Malkovich and he proceeds to usurp Malkovich's life.  In one particularly ingenious scene, Schwartz is manipulating Malkovich to be a puppeteer who has a marionette manipulating yet another smaller marionette.  It's a little like Russian matroishka dolls where every time you open one, there is another smaller one inside.  If you take it one step further, it was really Maxine who was the master puppeteer, manipulating Schwartz to manipulate Malkovich.This film goes beyond humor of the absurd to humor of the bizarre.  At times it gets a bit too far out to be funny (like when Malkovich goes inside Malkovich and sees Malkovich's everywhere).  But the material is fresh and innovative and most of the skits work well, silly as they sometimes are.Spike Jonze is a strange guy with a strange sense of humor which is perfect for this film.  If you get the DVD, one of the bonus features is an interview with Jonze.  If you see this interview, you will get a fuller understanding of just how strange he can be.  He does some very interesting things with the camera, lighting and setup that give the film a very distinctive look.  This was Jonze first feature film.  Clearly his work in music videos, where directors are a lot freer to push the creative envelope, helped in the making of this film.  I thought he could have done a better job with the Malkovich perspective (it looked like you were looking backwards through a pair of binoculars), but most of the camera work was quite good.  I particularly liked the way he split the sound tracks to have Malkovich's voice come out of the back speakers while in his perspective.The acting in this film was terrific.  John Malkovich, who excels in both dramatic and comedic roles did a fabulous job of playing himself, poking fun at himself at every turn.  Poor John Cusack.  He is such a tall guy and they made him play half his part on a set with 4 ½ foot ceilings.  He was very funny as the tortured puppeteer.  Catherine Keener was a scream as the bitchy and evil Maxine.Overall, this film is a rollicking good time.  I rated it 8/10.  It is funny throughout but sometimes goes a little too far off the deep end.  If you like absurd humor, you will love this film.",8,1,2,10 May 2000
The Fast and the Furious," Weak story, but heart stopping action
","This film examines the street racing subculture and provides ample thrills for the 25 and under set.  Based on the box office numbers this film threw up, every teenager in the U.S. must have seen it at least twice, since it doesn't have much appeal outside that demographic.The screenplay pretends to be a detective story about an undercover cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who infiltrates the street racing scene to try to find a group thieves that has been hijacking tractor trailers and stealing the cargo.  Make no mistake about it.  This is not a detective story.  This is a racing story replete with fast, NOS guzzling street machines, horsed up to burn rubber and detailed to attract babes.  Fasten your seatbelt for a screaming ride to testosterone city.The script panders shamelessly to post pubescent boys with hormone overload. Universal wisely kept it PG-13 to maximize the film's target audience. There is plenty of strutting, getting in people's faces, muscle flexing and a street fight about every fifteen minutes.  Everyone demands respect and if they don't get it there is either a brawl or a race.  Director Rob Cohen, who cut his directorial teeth on `Miami Vice', has an implicit understanding of what makes male movies work and he pulls out all the stops in this film.
Unfortunately, Cohen gets so immersed in the street culture that he recklessly reinforces antisocial conduct as normative.  The film sends a consistent message that honor and loyalty to one's friends are more important than the obeying the law.  The police are portrayed as jerks and fools.  The only way to handle injustice is to take matters into your own hands.  You stick up for your friends even if they are criminals and you are a cop.  If another cop disrespects one of your undercover friends, you slug him.  While this might be an accurate reflection of the culture, I feel compelled to interject that the movie industry has a social responsibility to teach our youth good lessons rather than bolster countercultural behavior in the name of realism.Once you get past the script, the film gets extraordinarily high technical marks for the action photography and stunts.  The cars are first rate. Most of the ones seen at the race wars were owned by actual street racers who brought their cars from everywhere to be in the film.  The film has so much adrenaline pumping action that by the time it is finished you need oxygen and a yoga session to settle yourself down.  I can't ever remember a film that had so many cars going airborne.  There is more molten, smoking rubber in this film than in a Perelli manufacturing plant.  The final stunt where the cars are racing to beat the train across the railroad crossing is an awesome, heart-stopping thrill ride.  It is easy to see why kids flocked to this film.The most notable member of the cast is Paul Walker (The Skulls, Pleasantville) who steps up to the lead for the first time.  In the featurette included with the DVD, Rob Cohen declares Walker a modern day Steve McQueen.  I'm afraid not.  McQueen, who saw his heyday in the 1950's and 60's, was a swaggering, audacious male lead brimming with machismo and frequently compared to Paul Newman (who was the star in `Somebody Up There Likes Me', the first film in which McQueen appeared).  Walker is a pussycat by comparison.  If Walker were to be compared to anyone of that generation it would be Troy Donohue, the good looking heart throb of the 1960's. Donohue wasn't extremely dynamic, but the camera loved him, and so did the teenage girls.  Walker fits comfortably into that description.If there is one standout in the film it is Vin Diesel as Dominic.  Diesel carries every scene in which he appears with a pure and imposing power that is present whether he is scrapping or just standing there.  He is mostly tough, but in the scene where he tells Brian about his father, he shows that he can conjure up a vulnerable side.  He presents his character in a way that is both charismatic and complex, part villain and part hero.  No one else in this cast is anywhere near Diesel's league as an actor.Jordana Brewster shows some promise as Dominic's sister and Brian's love interest.  Rick Yune, whose performance I enjoyed in `Snow Falling on Cedars', is menacing and believable as the leader of the Asian gang.This film has a limited audience, but is well done for its target market. I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the action and stunts.  The story is about a 2/10, but the racing and chase scenes are as good as it gets.",7,1,3,4 January 2002
Ocean's Eleven," An entertaining caper flick
","I have trouble calling this a remake, because it doesn't share much in common with the `rat pack' original except the name of the lead character and that it is a casino heist.  Actually, this is a better film than its namesake, apart from the fact that the cast of the original was filled with entertainment legends.Director Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Traffic) takes a vacation from serious filmmaking with this film, which on his resume is something of a lark.  Everyone seems to be having a good time and it is clear that the actors enjoyed making this film.  The overhauled screenplay pops with snappy dialogue, riddled with deadpan humor and a decent, though somewhat far fetched plot.  It has a little of the whimsical feel of `The Sting', though the screenplay isn't as strong.  A crew of professional thieves plans to knock over three casinos on a fight night by raiding the impregnable vault that serves all three.  The plan is elaborate, full of high tech wizardry, daring deceptions and acrobatic stunts.  The caper runs into more than the normal amount of foul ups, but our devious team of burglars is always up to the task of working around the glitches.The cast is very solid.  George Clooney is perfectly cast as the brainchild of the scheme.  He is dapper, macho and smooth with a sardonic wit that keeps the film's tone serious yet light.  Brad Pitt plays the always eating Rusty, who is really the brains behind the operation, coordinating it flawlessly.  Except for `The Mexican', this is much lighter material than Pitt usually tackles, yet he gives a suave performance seeming very comfortable with his character.  Despite the fact that this is an ensemble cast, Pitt carries a lot of the weight and makes the story as close to believable as could be possible given its improbable nature.Don Cheadle continues to impress, rendering a terrific demolitions expert. His cockney accent is great and with this part Cheadle shows once again what a terrific character actor he is.  In a little twist of irony, Cheadle plays an analogous part in this film to that played by Sammy Davis, Jr. in the original, and he also played Sammy in the TV movie entitled `The Rat Pack'.  Poor Andy Garcia has the thankless task of playing the heavy in a tongue-in-cheek film, but he does a marvelous job.  Matt Damon plays the rookie, giving the character a charming naivetÃ© and a mischievous bent. Julie Roberts is nothing more than a throw in, with a minor role as Ocean's ex-wife.If you don't take this film too seriously, you are in for an entertaining evening.  It is smartly done without too much melodrama, and provides just enough suspense and realism to keep it from being a farce.  I rated it an 8/10.",8,0,0,20 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Another puff piece from the master of puff
","Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film.  He is nothing if not consistent.  His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses.  Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach.  The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.The script by Randall Wallace of `Braveheart' fame is the biggest problem. Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted.  It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story.  Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of `From Here to Eternity', the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story.  While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes. The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue).  And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious.Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories.  Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary. Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's.  It seems all he cares about is the military angle. The costume design and hair for the girls' is merely good while the military costumes are perfect.  Mostly, the 40's feel is missing.  The music is all wrong.  It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all. Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked.  Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene.  Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke. Everybody.  Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn (Kate Beckingsale), who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later.  Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day.  Not a single `swell', `dame', `jeepers', `say' or `ain't' in the whole film.  No Brooklyn or Chicago accents.  Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking.  It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs.  It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor.  The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships.  Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production. They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture.  That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail.  Still, by any standard, this is fantastic action sequence that could not have been more realistic if one had actually been there.The acting is mixed.  Beckingsale is excellent as Evelyn.  She creates a very appealing romantic figure.  Ben Affleck is too moody and sarcastic in the role.  Josh Hartnett is much better, coming across as far more sincere and relating to his character better than Affleck.  Affleck seems content to play Ben Affleck in uniform rather than trying to actually flesh out a character.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance in a minor role.  Veterans Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight do a marvelous job as Colonel Doolitle and FDR.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the visual effects.  It would have been much better if it had been about Pearl Harbor instead of being a schmaltzy love triangle story that coincided with the attack.  The entire event that is Pearl Harbor is shrouded in intriguing questions.  Did Roosevelt know about the attack in advance and allow it to happen to get us into the war?  Many historical facts indicate that was the case (it is thought to be more than just lucky that the aircraft carriers weren't in the harbor that day).  What was really going on in the minds of the Japanese? Were the diplomatic efforts of the US designed to force the Japanese into attacking us as a matter of honor?  As much as I dislike Oliver Stone, this film would have been substantial if it had been done in his docudrama style (without the historical rewrites of course).Instead we have another puff piece by the master of puff.

Pearl Harbor," Another puff piece from the master of puff
","Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film.  He is nothing if not consistent.  His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses.  Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach.  The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.The script by Randall Wallace of `Braveheart' fame is the biggest problem. Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted.  It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story.  Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of `From Here to Eternity', the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story.  While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes. The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue).  And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious.  Personally, I would have preferred it if they had killed Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) in the attack and given Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) an opportunity for some real soul searching as they went on their top secret mission.  But such nuance is far too risky for Bruckheimer.Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories.  Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary. Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's.  It seems all he cares about is the military angle. The costume design and hair for the girls costumes was merely good while the military costumes are perfect.  Mostly, the '40's feel is missing.  The music is all wrong.  It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all.  Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked.  Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene.  Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke. Everybody.  Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn, who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later.  Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day.  Not a single `swell', `dame', `jeepers' or `ain't' in the whole film.  No Brooklyn or Chicago accents.  Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking.  It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs.  It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor.  The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships.  Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production. They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture.  That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail.

Remember the Titans," An uplifting experience
","Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (`Top Gun', `Beverly Hills Cop', `The Rock', `Flashdance', `American Gigolo') is a master of bringing crowd-pleasing films to the public.  Once again, Bruckheimer hits with this inspirational human-interest story.  This script was rejected dozens of times before it found its way to Bruckheimer's desk.  He immediately saw the potential and began shopping it around until Disney picked it up.It is a true story of a high school football team in 1971 during the first year of forced integration in the Virginia.  The team members are compelled to confront years of racial hatred and bigotry if they are to come together as a team and win.  To add to the tension, a black coach is installed as head coach, replacing a popular white coach with a history of having winning seasons.Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) runs the team like a marine boot camp.  He forces the boys to put their prejudices aside so they can coalesce into a winning football team.  He faces obstacles within the team as well as those from the parents and the school board.  Everyone is waiting for him to fail so they can pounce on him.  He never gives them the satisfaction.This is an stirring story that accurately represents the open racial hostilities of the time, especially regarding forced integration.  It gives us excellent character development of coach Boone and coach Yoast (Will Patton), as well as players Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) and Julius Campbell (Wood Harris).  Though the plot is predictable, it is such an inspirational story that it doesn't become tedious.  There are a few oversimplifications of complex issues, like when the team overcomes a lifetime of bigotry in two weeks of football camp.  However, there are also a number of memorable and emotional scenes.The acting is terrific across the board.  Denzell Washington gives the coach a very hard edge while maintaining a certain tough charisma.  Will Patton does an outstanding job portraying coach Yoast, a man stuck in the middle of forces that are ripping his life apart.  This is the best performance I've seen by Patton, who has always been a solid supporting actor.  The selection of Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst for the student leads is a bit of a stretch age wise (Hurst is 25 and looks older, and Harris is 31).  However, both actors deliver brilliant performances, supercharged with intensity on and off the field.  Eleven-year-old Hayden Panettiere is fantastic as coach Yoast's football obsessed daughter, stealing every scene in which she appears.The DVD has a good deal of interesting material including interviews with the real coaches Boone and Yoast as well as player interviews.  The DTS sound on this DVD is nothing short of awesome, making the music powerful and sounds of the action on the field explosive.This film is classic Bruckheimer.  It sweeps us up and gets us totally involved with the characters, while putting impediments in their way so we can root for them.  I rated it an 8/10.  For most viewers, this will be an uplifting experience.",8,0,1,27 March 2001
Man on the Moon," Tour de force performance by Jim Carrey
","This realistic biographical treatment of the life of Andy Kaufman is a tour de force triumph for Jim Carrey in the starring role.  Carrey portrays Kaufman with such spooky accuracy that one has to wonder whether this was an impersonation or a possession.  Kaufman could not have played Kaufman any better.Andy Kaufman was an audacious pioneer in the world of shock comedy.  His most popular work in Taxi' was not his most important and was the work he liked the least.  Kaufman was a ruthless manipulator of human emotion.  He didn't care whether people loved him or hated him, laughed or cursed him as long as they were reacting.  He would go to any lengths, no matter how ridiculous or distasteful to shock his audience and put one over on them. Though not the first in this regard (Don Rickles and Don Imus were offending people's sensibilities long before Kaufman emerged) his antics raised the bar for shock comedy, aiding people like of Howard Stern, Sam Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay.  Though I don't personally believe this is a particularly constructive direction, I must concede that Kaufman broke through some major barriers.The film's biggest shortcoming is its neglect of the inner Kaufman.  Some of the best scenes explaining Kaufman's motivations and reactions to his own behavior ended up in the deleted scenes bonus feature on the DVD.  This relegated the film to becoming an Andy Kaufman greatest hits film without Andy.  While it was entertaining as such, the burning question remains unanswered, namely, `What is this guy thinking as he behaves this way?'I can't say enough about Jim Carrey's performance.  He totally immersed himself in the character down to the most meticulous detail.  As he explained in the featurette, he didn't just try to impersonate Kaufman, he was intent on becoming him 24 hours a day.  People who knew Kaufman well like Danny DeVito and Kaufman's girlfriend Lynne Margulies said that it was like Andy had taken over Carrey's body.  With each film he makes I gain a new appreciation for Carrey's skills as a comedian and actor.  Though much of his early work was tripe, his range of abilities continues to expand with each new role.  In many ways he reminds me of Jerry Lewis, a brilliant mind behind the face of the village idiot.I rated this film an 8/10.  It is a must see for Andy Kaufman fans and will still be entertaining for those who missed Kaufman's work.  Unfortunately, it lacked insight and that made it incomplete.",8,0,0,2 June 2000
Saving Private Ryan," One of the most realistic WWII movies ever made
","This film has been mentioned as the greatest WWII film of all time.  It was very good, but nowhere near that good.  It probably qualifies as the one of best WWII films made after 1970.  There were dozens of great films with better stories made in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's when the war was still fresh in everyone's minds.The story was about a rescue mission to find a paratrooper behind enemy lines and bring him back alive, because all his brothers had been killed in the war.  The platoon was commanded by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) who had to take his men through enemy controlled territory to rescue Private Ryan (Matt Damon).  It is a combination character study and action film, more about the platoon than about Private Ryan himself.  Other than Captain Miller, there wasn't very much character development, but there was a good deal of time devoted to the human dynamics within the platoon, which was excellent. What really stands out about this film is the direction.  Steven Spielberg has created probably the most gut wrenchingly realistic war movie ever made. The scenes on the beach at Normandy were terrifying.  This should be required viewing for all politicians and generals before we commit men to battle.  Spielberg's attention to detail and willingness to show the grisly and horrifying results of men being thrown into a fusillade of projectiles is unparalleled.  The entire ensemble cast did a terrific job.  Tom Hanks, as always, was masterful as Captain Miller.  He struck just the right balance between the sympathetic commander who understood what his men were going through, and the hard-nosed military man who had to force them to do a job they didn't want to do.I rated this film an 8/10.  It wasn't the greatest WWII story ever told, but it may have been the greatest telling of such a story.  This film shows explicit battle scenes that are brutally gory.  It is definitely not for the squeamish.",8,0,1,10 September 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Jackie Chan meets Peter Pan
","This is a good film that fails to live up to the hype (a common phenomenon). There are many elements of the film that are superlative in this martial arts fantasy, but director Ang Lee can't seem to commit to a theme for the story causing it to meander aimlessly from one fight scene to the next.  The film is remarkable in the fact that women play a prominent role, a marked departure from the second class status of women in eastern societies.  Yet, Ang even hedges on this important point with Jen ultimately capitulating to the forces against her in an ending that is as unsatisfying as it is ambiguous.  It is almost as if he is saying, `Women are strong too, but not quite strong enough.'On the plus side, the photography and the choreography of the fight scenes are superb.  While Bruce Lee was probably the most accomplished martial arts star ever, and Jackie Chan one of the most innovative and entertaining, the choreography by Yuen Woo-ping in this film is artistry that makes ordinary actors seem like skilled elite warriors.  The use of wires in the fight scenes is incredible, creating eye popping acrobatic scenes that take the genre to a new level.Unfortunately, the wires are overused and give the film a Peter Pan quality that reduces its impact as a serious fantasy adventure (if there is such a thing).   By far, the biggest flaw of the film is the unsteadiness of the storytelling.  There are too many subthemes and Ang doesn't commit to any of them.  We have two love stories going on (Li/Yu and Jen/Lo), the theft of the Green Destiny, Li's desire to mentor Jen, Jen's relationship with Jade Fox, Jen's relationship with Yu, Jen's progress as a warrior, Jen's adventure in the desert, etc., etc.  Ang drifts from theme to theme and never ties them together effectively.  The most disconcerting of these is the overly long treatment of Jen's pursuit of Lo into the desert to get her comb back.  This was one of the longest film non sequiturs I can remember, and it didn't add that much to the main themes.The acting is excellent across the board.  Chow Yun-Fat is the most prominent actor in China and his outstanding abilities are evident here.  He renders a strong and sympathetic character that is both charismatic and dynamic.  Michelle Yeoh is an accomplished martial arts expert, who is the only female star that Jackie Chan allows to do her own stunts.  Her presence adds great credibility to the fight scenes and her dramatic performance is first rate.  Newcomer Zhang Ziyi lights up the screen as Jen with impressive athleticism in the fight sequences and strong acting skills.  
Overall, this is an impressively filmed adventure with a story that is too loosely wound to qualify it as a great film.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is undeniably great entertainment as its $120 million U.S. box office gross will attest.  However, mass appeal is not necessarily a good gauge of filmmaking quality (as worthless blockbusters like `Scary Movie' exemplify). Despite stunning cinematography and mind boggling action footage, CTHD lacks a compelling story, leaving all its impressive elements adrift as nothing more than extraordinary window dressing.",7,0,1,29 July 2001
Good Will Hunting," An intelligent story
","This is a very intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT when he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department.  Though the story is a bit far fetched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man. 
Will is discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head of the math department at MIT.  This throws his life into turmoil, as the mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy.  He also begins seeing a therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions and experiences he had been repressing.  The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale.  The screenplay was written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon for which they won an academy award (the film was nominated for nine).  Both were considered promising young actors before this film, but this tied a rocket pack to their backs and lit the fuse.  Damon was outstanding in the lead.  He had a very complex character to play and his emotional range was phenomenal.  Not only was he quick witted, charming and vibrant, but he also had to be hot headed, arrogant, confused and despondent.  He was able to switch emotions with ease and was always intense and believable.  Robin Williams also gave one of his better performances and received a best supporting Oscar.It is hard not to like this film.  Most of the challenges that Will faced were inside him, and watching him struggle to overcome the limitations from his past was very uplifting.  I rated this film a 9/10.  We need more scripts like this.  Perhaps if we are lucky, Damon and Affleck will take time from their successful acting careers and collaborate again.",9,2,6,3 September 2000
Coyote Ugly," Insubstantial but highly entertaining
","Producer Jerry Bruckheimer seems to have an innate sense of what makes money in cinema.  He seldom makes a film that isn't profitable and has numerous blockbusters on his resume over the past 30 years (American Gigolo, Flashdance, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Con Air, Armageddon). Bruckheimer is a populist producer.  He is more concerned with giving audiences what they want than he is about producing films of any artistic value or substance.  In that regard, `Coyote Ugly' fits right in.This film is energetic, entertaining, scintillating and fun to watch.  The story is 'Flashdance' lite, and is reminiscent of the popular but vacuous `Cocktail' with Tom Cruise, only with a decent plot woven in.  Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is a young aspiring songwriter who leaves South Amboy, New Jersey traveling to New York City to be discovered.  When things don't go as planned, she takes a job as a bartender in a raucous singles bar where the sexy female bartenders dance provocatively on the bar to the shrieks of the rowdy patrons below.  Of course, there is a love story to go along with the quest for fame, completing the populist formula.Bruckheimer defies the conventional Hollywood big budget approach by using an ensemble cast of veritable unknowns and a first time director.  Other than John Goodman in a minor role, and supermodel Tyra Banks who hasn't done much acting, most of the actors have extremely short resumes.  This gives the film a freshness and energy that comes from the cast's exhilaration at just being on the set.Piper Perabo is an incredible find.  She is not simply acting in this film, but living the role.  Just like her character Violet, this film is her big break so her ability to understand the character and the role is implicit (another stroke of Bruckheimer genius).  Perabo is an excellent actor with tremendous ability and potential.  It is likely that this film will be the launch pad for a bright career.  Maria Bello also gives a fabulous performance as Lil, the tough and successful owner of the nightclub. Australian actor Adam Garcia has great chemistry with Perabo as Violet's love interest.  His pleasant demeanor and good looks have many people comparing him with Mel Gibson, although it remains to be seen whether he can handle roles that are more substantial.  John Goodman provides one of the film's best moments when he gets up on the bar and dances as Violet auctions him off to the screaming women in the crowd.The DVD is packed with interesting special features about the making of the film.  It also includes a DTS audio option, which I like better than Dolby Digital 5.1.  The soundtrack is pulsating and explosive and pumps the film up with excitement.This is not great filmmaking, but it is great entertainment.  It is an amiable film that sparkles with energy and is easy to watch.  I rated it a 7/10.  Many people were surprised by how much they enjoyed it, but I'm never surprised when I like a Jerry Bruckheimer film.  He knows how to push our buttons.",7,55,69,22 February 2001
Moulin Rouge!," A brilliant symphony of incongruities
","My reaction to the first 15 minutes of this film was, `Oh, no.  This is going to be a two hour music video, and from the looks of it, it is going to be like MTV on LSD.'  I actually shut it off and went to bed.  I returned the next day and vowed to keep my personal policy never to leave any movie unfinished, no matter how much I dislike it.  I'm glad I have that policy because wow, was my first impression wrong.Baz Luhrmann has delivered us a piece of filmmaking genius with this avant-garde film.  It combines disparate elements that seem incompatible, yet they work magnificently together.  Music video style is combined with the moorings of the traditional theatrical musical to create a piece that is simultaneously revolutionary and old guard.This film is about incongruity.  Modern popular music is woven into a turn of the century story.  The sets, lighting and costumes are designed to create garish color clashes.  The presentation is sometimes camp comedy and at others very straightforward and melodramatic.  Normally, none of these elements work together, but Luhrmann orchestrates them into a symphony of visual and auditory harmony that is nothing short of overwhelming.The story itself is nothing special.  It is an old fashioned tragic love story where true love is pitted against practical realities.  The impoverished writer (Ewan McGregor) loves the courtesan (Nicole Kidman) and she loves him, but the Duke (Richard Roxburgh) desires her and will stop at nothing to get her.  She promises to be with the Duke, and he agrees to fund the `Spectacular Spectacular', refurbishing the Moulin Rouge for the event and promising to make her a great star.  She agrees but continues to dally with the writer behind the Duke's back.  Of course, this leads to a confrontation where she must decide between true love and great wealth.The music is outstanding.  The arrangements of familiar pop songs as well as the original music are fantastically done.  The dance and choreography are Broadway quality.  The costumes and sets are, well, Spectacular.  The presentation is sometimes zany and at other times solemn, but always entertaining.  While Luhrmann may not have redefined the movie musical, he has certainly expanded its limits by a couple of galaxies.  In many ways it reminds me of the kind of effect shows like `Jesus Christ Superstar' and `The Wiz' had on theater, taking risks to go to irreverent places and traverse unspoken boundaries.The acting is terrific.  Ewan McGregor continues to expand his considerable acting talents into new and varied areas, and with each new project shows his adaptability and facility.  In addition to giving a gut wrenching performance as the forlorn writer he also shows a reasonably good singing voice.  However, as good as McGregor is, he is blown off the set by Nicole Kidman.  Kidman astounds with powerful vocals of recording artist caliber that literally raise goose flesh.  Her acting is multi-textured with amazing range, handling the comedy, the romance and the tragedy with equal aplomb. This is by far her best performance and her shining moment.  Jim Broadbent is phenomenal as the over-the-top owner and ringmaster of the legendary night spot.  The entire cast (especially the dancers) delivers a high energy performance.This film is a treat for anyone who loves theater, popular music, great dance and an old fashioned love story.  I rated it a 10/10.  Yes, it is sappy and silly and overly melodramatic, but it is done with style . . . Spectacularly!",10,0,1,3 January 2002
Rules of Engagement," Not original but still entertaining
","Despite various flaws, this film succeeds at creating a strong drama with two excellent performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson.  It is an interesting premise in today's world where the lines between politics and warfare become ever fuzzier.  Is a commander justified to engage an enemy to protect his men if there is a high probability of killing innocents?  With increasing frequency, radical groups use human shields to capitalize on this Western dilemma.  This film brought some of these issues to the fore, and though sloppily done in parts, it was an entertaining treatment of the issue.Director William Friedkin (The French Connection) is no stranger to action flicks, and the action scenes were extraordinarily realistic.  The trial was also well done from a dramatic standpoint, but some glaring flaws went unexplained.  For instance, are we to believe that with all the firing that occurred from the ground, forensics experts couldn't find a single bullet hole with a ground-based trajectory?By far the best aspect of this film was the acting.  Tommy Lee Jones was outstanding as the shot-up marine who turned into a second rate lawyer to stay in the service.  Samuel L. Jackson continued to prove himself one of the better dramatic actors around with a stellar performance of the dedicated career officer thrown into an impossible situation and then fed to the wolves.  Guy Pearce also gave a fine performance as the prosecutor for the government, although he tried to hide his British accent by putting on a New York accent and it sounded phony.Though unoriginal (see A Few Good Men), this is a very watchable drama with some credibility problems, but the flaws were more than overcome by the great acting.  I rated it a 7/10.  It offers food for thought regarding the difficult demands we make on our military in the world of post cold war international diplomacy.",7,0,1,16 October 2000
Jerry Maguire," Highly Entertaining
","Tom Cruise had a good year in 1996 showing everyone the money by starring in two of the top four grossing films of the year ('Jerry Maguire', $153M; and 'Mission: Impossible', $180M).  Of the two, 'Jerry Maguire' was clearly the better film, garnering five Oscar nominations and winning a best supporting Oscar for Cuba Gooding, Jr.It is the story of a sports agent who falls from grace with his agency because he develops scruples and has the bad judgment to share his newfound principles with his firm.  This results in instant unemployment and the necessity to start his own agency.  Upon striking out with his trusty new assistant Dorothy (Renee Zellweger), he finds to his chagrin that the only client that stays with him is a loudmouth of a football player named Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) whose psyche is in a state of delicate imbalance.  As time goes on and his depression and debt get deeper, Jerry's only hope is that Rod can play football as well as he can talk trash.Writer/Director Cameron Crowe is excellent at writing amusing human-interest stories with offbeat themes (See Fast Times At Ridgemont High).  The combination of the high-pressure world of sports representation, a whacked-out client and a charming love affair makes for an engaging tale with something for just about everyone.Tom Cruise shines as Jerry Maguire.  He gives that character a false bravado that belies his desperate lack of confidence.  Yet, despite his feelings of hopelessness he never gives up, not on Rod, Dorothy or himself.  This film put Renee Zellweger on the map as Dorothy, Jerry's idealistic and loyal secretary and love interest.  She was enchanting and resolute as she stood by her man no matter what the costs.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. was fantastic and stole the show repeatedly with his over the top performance.This is a fast paced and highly entertaining film.  I rated it a 9/10.  I recommend it highly.",9,5,11,15 September 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Impossible to believe
","The purpose of this silly action adventure flick seems to have been to live up to its name.  The malarkey they want us to swallow is so utterly impossible that this film could easily be one of the most laughable movies of 2000.  Fifty bad guys shoot 10,000 bullets at Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) with automatic weapons, but never even wing him.  Hunt, armed only with pistols, kills a bad guy with every bullet he fires, often killing them three at a time while somersaulting through the air.John Woo (Broken Arrow, Face/Off) is a veteran of action adventure films and his expertise in this area is evident throughout the film.  It contains stupendous action sequences throughout, though I thought Woo's attempt to turn Tom Cruise into Jackie Chan was a bit much.  Woo also chose some breathtaking locations and the photography was first rate.Ronald Moore's (Star Trek: Generations) story was an utterly unoriginal excuse to keep half of Hollywood's stunt actors employed.  The dialogue was wretched.  If one more character ripped off his face, I would have stomped the DVD.The acting was nothing special.  Cruise really had nothing intelligent to say or do, so the best I can say about him is that he was in great shape and showed us what a good athlete he is.  Thandie Newton (Beloved) was initially very dynamic and sassy, but by the end of the film, she was reduced to a quivering jellyfish.  Dougray Scott was fair as the villain, but lacked the wickedness to make him truly hateful. This film did well at the box office grossing over $200 Million, a testimonial to the American public's inherent need to see stuff blown up without the burden of having to lug their brains to the movie theater.  I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of Woo's fabulous action sequences. Wear earplugs (to protect your ears from the loud explosions and the insipid dialogue) and don't expect to be mentally stimulated.",6,1,2,22 November 2000
Black Hawk Down," Realistic depiction of modern warfare
","For producer Jerry Bruckheimer (`Beverly Hills Cop', `Flashdance', `Top Gun', `The Rock', `Armageddon', `Remember the Titans', `Pearl Harbor'), this is a departure from the crowd pleasers he usually produces.  Bruckheimer is one of the most successful producers in Hollywood because he knows that crowd pleasers make a buck.  Even `Pearl Harbor', wasn't really about Pearl Harbor, but about a love story with Pearl Harbor as the backdrop.  Here, Bruckheimer produces a straight, no nonsense action film with controversial subject matter and none of his standard crowd pleasing elements.  Oh, and by the way, he still made money.This is not a film for the squeamish.  War is hell and this film turns up the fire.  It is a frank and realistic representation of war, much the same as the beach scene of `Saving Private Ryan', only once the action starts, it never lets up.  Ridley Scott gives us a raw depiction of modern warfare, based on actual events from the US military action in Somalia.  Despite a lot of criticism of Scott for not delving deeper into the political issues, I believe he made the right decision in staying focused on this as a combat film.  What is so unlike a Bruckheimer film is that there is no workup of any single character.  There is no attempt to get us to love someone and have us pulling for him.  He just gives us a bunch of ordinary grunts that get thrown into a fire fight and try desperately to fight their way out to survive.  No one is a hero, and everyone is.Scott's direction of the action scenes is superb.  This film maintains a dizzying pace and Scott never lets us catch our breath with stunt work and pyrotechnics that defy description.  There is no safety net in this film where we know that certain characters won't die.  Everyone in the cast is a potential casualty.  While this is extremely realistic, it is also one of the shortcomings of the film.  By the end, the viewer suffers from battle fatigue and there is no emotional consolation that at least one character we liked came out okay.The ensemble cast does a fine job of creating realistic battle scenes, though there isn't a lot of meaningful dialogue.  The actors had to go through real military basic training in preparation for the film and it hardened them for the exhausting rigors of their roles.  Josh Hartnett and Tom Sizemore stood out slightly from the rest, but only because they each had slightly meatier roles.This is an intense and credible war film that doesn't so much engage viewers as it does overwhelm us.  From an action perspective it is a 12/10, but in the area of storytelling and character development it falls short.  I rated it an 8/10.  See it, but brace yourself.",8,1,1,10 August 2002
For Love of the Game," Excelent Baseball Story
","This is an excellent baseball movie and a decent romantic entry as well. Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is a veteran pitcher with an accomplished career who is headed for the Hall of Fame.  On the day we meet him he has a lot on his mind.  He is informed that his team is being sold, he is being traded and the love of his life is moving to England.  Add to this the pain in his pitching arm, his impending decision on whether to retire and the fact that winning this game is critical in determining if the Yankees go to the playoffs, and you have a man with overloaded neurons.The story unfolds as an introspective retrospective.  As he is pitching this important game, he is thinking about his childhood, his relationship with Jane (Kelly Preston) and how he is going to get the next batter out.  He is so preoccupied that it doesn't even dawn on him until the eighth inning that there have been no Yankee hits and he has been pitching a perfect game. 
The flashback elements are expertly woven into the game, giving us a genuine feeling for his distraction.  This is a fresh perspective for a sports movie.  Instead of simply focusing on what the player is doing, the film focuses on what he is thinking while he is doing it.  It gives us an authentic look at how athletes get `in the zone', filtering out all the noise and concentrating totally on their performance.  Those who have been involved in athletic competition can identify with this state, although only the best can achieve it at will.Sam Raimi's direction on this film was excellent.  His direction of the love story was nothing special, but he did a superb job on the baseball scenes. The combination of on the field action, commentary by Vin Scully and simulated TV telecast footage was so well done that it was impossible to differentiate it from a major league game in progress.The acting ranged from fair to excellent.  Kelly Preston was very good as Jane.  She brought a full range of emotional expression to the part, though she sometimes got a little shrill, like the scene in the hospital where she screams out `Is this America?  Is baseball still the national pastime.' Overall though, she played the part of the torn lover very well.Kevin Costner is no great lead actor and it is hard to understand why he is so popular.  Perhaps it is his whiny lost boy charm that makes women want to mother him.  In the love story, he again presented as listless and uninspired.  But in the baseball scenes, he came alive.  In fact, in these scenes Costner was not acting so much as acting out.  He loves baseball and was obsessed with doing all his own baseball scenes.  He is a top notch athlete, so he really could throw a curveball and his fastball had plenty of pop.  His ability to portray a professional athlete in this instance was superlative, probably due to his having played the game scholastically.   So overall, I would have to rate his performance here as very good.John Reilly gets a very honorable mention as Chapel's catcher.  He was quietly supportive and unobtrusive, the way catchers usually are.  He portrayed intense desire in a demure and low key way without overacting.  It was a nice performance by an actor in a supporting role playing a baseball player in a supporting role.I love baseball and this was a great baseball movie so I rated it 8/10. Anyone who enjoys sports will probably enjoy this film.",Null,0,1,6 April 2000
The Insider," Gripping reality based drama
","This is a dramatic triumph; a gripping story of the battle between truth and corruption in the sacred halls of mass media news.  Based on the true story of Jeffrey Wigand, the research scientist from Brown and Williamson Tobacco who blows the whistle on the industry's attempts to chemically enhance the addictive effects of nicotine, this story grabs you like an anaconda and slowly squeezes you until you are out of breath.The plot follows Lowell Bergman, a producer for 60 Minutes, as he first stumbles across Wigand (Russell Crowe), convinces him to do an interview and then battles to get the interview aired after Brown and Williamson threatens CBS with a lawsuit.  This is reality based drama at its finest.  For once, we have a real story that is not rendered dubious by over-dramatization.Michael Mann directs his third consecutive triumph.  He only does one project every three or four years, but what he lacks in frequency he more than delivers in quality.  I liked all aspects of his direction, but I was particularly impressed with his use of the camera.  Mann has all the various camera techniques honed to perfection, but what is most impressive is his appropriateness in using technique in a scene to maximize effect.  If he gives us an extreme close-up or a foreground blur, it is exactly what is needed for maximum impact in the scene.  He uses technique to enhance the scene rather than using the scene as an excuse to show off technique, a disease that seems to have become epidemic, especially among hip young directors.Mann brings us taut drama with a relevant message.  He provides well defined characters that hook the audience emotionally.   His pace is always appropriate with moments of frenetic action augmented by dramatic buildup and suspense.The acting in this film was uniformly excellent.  Pacino is at his finest in this role.  It is clear that he had a real passion for the part unlike his stilted and phony performance in `The Devil's Advocate'.  As in `Heat', I believe that Mann has again brought forth Pacino's maximum dynamism and squeezed out of him every bit of his brilliance.Russell Crowe elevated his game to a new level with this film.  Though I found his performance a bit uneven, he brought great power to the role (perhaps a bit too much), and transcended his previous best performance in `LA Confidential' by a wide margin.   This was a complex and difficult character,  reserved and intellectual yet highly emotional and explosive. This is a combination that doesn't usually come in the same package.  Crowe nailed the reserved intellectual part, but was overwrought in the angry scenes, coming across more like an action hero than the incensed nerd he was supposed to be playing.  However, this is a picayune criticism of what was on the whole a fabulous performance.This is one of the better dramas I have seen in a while.  I rated it a 9/10. It is well written, well acted and well directed.  What more can you ask?",9,0,1,15 April 2000
"Girl, Interrupted"," Outstanding acting, but story comes up a little short
","Girl Interrupted' suffers from comparisons with One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', perhaps a bit unfairly since they were different kinds of stories. Possibly the reason for this is that the story presented like Cuckoo Lite. This story begged for some character development, especially of Lisa.  It is essentially a slice of life film.  There was no real plot, just a succession of incidents at the institution.For a slice of life film to be successful, there must be character development or situations that are so unique and fascinating that they compensate for the story's lacking a plotline.  In Cuckoo's Nest' despite having little character development, the situations were intense and Jack Nicholson commanded our attention in every frame.  G.I. fell short in both areas.  It was unquestionably an interesting character study of both Suzanna (Winona Ryder) and Lisa (Angelina Jolie), but the flashbacks of Suzanna's life were too sketchy to provide much insight into the problems with which she struggled, and Lisa's past was a total mystery.  Though Jolie's performance was truly outstanding, as was Ryder's, together they failed to create a performance strong enough to compensate for what the story lacked.Director James Mangold gets credit for a story sensitively told and his direction of the actors was excellent.  This was generally a very well acted film.  Angelina Jolie continues to impress in difficult and gutsy roles. She is a very gritty performer and is fantastic at pouring out raw emotion with no holds barred.  Hopefully this performance will help her emerge from the shadows of supporting actor to land the lead she deserves.Wynona Ryder delivered another mature and powerful performance.  She is quite accomplished at playing complex and tormented characters.  One day, I would love to see her in something that departs from her accustomed dour roles.  While watching the featurette included on the DVD, I noticed she actually does possess a genuinely happy smile.  It occurred to me at that moment that this was the first time I'd seen it.  The only smile she ever gets a chance to use in character is her wounded smile.I rated this film a 7/10.  Overall, this film gives us two great performances, but comes up a little short in the presentation of the story. It is not an overwhelming film, but it's definitely worth seeing.",7,0,0,7 June 2000
Chariots of Fire," An engrossing and powerful sports story
","I enjoy sports films, especially when they are used to exemplify greater human truths.  In that regard `Chariots of Fire' is one of my favorite sports films.  What differentiates this film is that it is really a human story about sports rather than a pure sports story.  Based on a true story, it centers on two gifted athletes and their quest to run in the 1924 Olympics.  The first is Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a haughty sprinter with an obsession for winning.  Abrahams, who is Jewish, is a man with something to prove, mostly to himself.  His rival is Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), the first man to ever beat him in a sprint.  Liddell is a devout Christian and runs for the glory of God.There is an exquisite interplay of subtle themes in this film underlying the obvious sports tale.  There is the contrast of motives.  Abraham runs to validate his feeling of personal power, and his preoccupation with winning is actually motivated by his fear of losing.  His quest is torturous, and ultimately his victory empty, more of a relief than a triumph.  Liddell runs out of a desire to repay God for the physical gifts he has been given.  He is at peace with himself, but at odds with all those who want to control him.  Their rivalry represents a battle between the forces of the physical and spiritual.  Other themes pervade the film.  We have undercurrents of bigotry against the Jewish runner, a man of whom Cambridge was begrudgingly proud while berating him behind his back.  We have sinister political attempts at manipulation in the face of Liddell's staunch integrity in adhering to his principles.  Together, these forces combine to produce a film rich in drama and meaning.The film has been criticized for its inaccuracies.  Some say Abraham did not suffer from anti-Semitic bigotry and that he was wildly popular at Cambridge.  This does not necessarily mean he didn't feel inferior.  No one can know what childhood experiences might have affected his psyche.  Jackson Scholz was quoted as saying he never gave Liddell a note of encouragement on the track.  I have to agree that this was a bit of Hollywood drivel that didn't need to be there.  Additionally, Liddell knew weeks before that the heats would be on a Sunday, not just before the race as shown, and he was always scheduled to run the 400-meter race.  The meeting of political bigwigs that allowed him to switch from the 100 to the 400 was pure fabrication to emphasize his resistance to compromising his beliefs about running on the Sabbath.  However, these liberties can be forgiven because they enriched the story and did not change history in major ways.The direction by Hugh Hudson is powerful.  Hudson captures the feeling and excitement of track and field competition, as well as giving us numerous beautifully photographed scenes and a wonderful period rendering.  Though nominated for an Oscar, Hudson was unable to capitalize on the success of this film, and he has directed very few, mostly minor films since.  The music by Vangelis is also wonderful, and it won the Best Music Oscar.Ben Cross is fantastic as Abrahams.  He brings great intensity to Abrahams' single-minded obsession for winning.  Cross hasn't done much film work since, but has had a long and distinguished career in TV.  Ian Charleson is also excellent as Liddell, but his career went the same route as Cross'.This minor film was the sleeper of 1981, nominated for seven Academy Awards and winning four, including Best Picture.  I rated it a 10/10.  It combines the best elements of human drama and sport to create a potent and engrossing film.",10,94,110,17 January 2001
The Hurricane," A powerful and compelling drama
","This is a powerful and compelling look at the life of Rubin Hurricane Carter (Denzel Washington) and his highly publicized fight for freedom from imprisonment.  Based on a true story, the film is an in-depth character study including Carter's early life, the murders for which he was incarcerated, his coping with prison and his court battles.Veteran director Norman Jewison creates a tight weave of factors affecting Carter's life; his childhood, the turbulent civil rights movement of the 1960's, and the people who came to his defense.  It is an impressive panoply of the forces that swept over his life like a tidal wave. The period props and costumes were well done and accurate in the 1960's scenes.  I loved the fact that all the fight fans in the arena were wearing suits and ties. Strange as it seems, that's the way it really was in the early 1960's.  The camera work was very good and I particularly liked the use of black and white for the fight scenes.  Unfortunately, Jewison made a few choices that bogged the film down in the middle and detracted somewhat from the story.The film presents some good historical footage of the civil rights movement, but gets a little too preachy at times.  The character development of Carter and Lesra was good, but the film would have benefited from a little less of Carter's internment angst and more time in character development of the Canadians.  Jewison also presented Detective Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya) as an evil character of superhuman proportions, an inconceivable depiction.This was a superb performance by Denzel Washington, perhaps his best to date.  His portrayal of the internal struggle to use his seething anger to help him survive was sensational.  He got himself into tremendous shape for the boxing scenes and handled himself well in the ring.I was also impressed with Vicellous Reon Shannon who played Lesra.  He exuded sincerity, toughness and genuine empathy, and had very good chemistry with Washington.This strong drama grabs you like a boa and doesn't let up.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is worth seeing for Denzel Washington's performance alone.",8,0,2,12 July 2000
The Legend of 1900," Richly rewarding character study
","Director Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso) has lovingly crafted a bittersweet story about life, music and the intricate weave of one upon the other.  Tornatore caresses the heart with characters steeped in emotion and sentimentality without descending into sappiness (okay, maybe just a little at the end).  The setting is turn of the 20th century.  On New Year's Day, a baby is abandoned on an ocean liner and adopted by one of the crew members who names him `1900'.  The boy never leaves the vessel and crosses back and forth for his whole life.  As a child he learns to play piano and proves himself to be a genius at the instrument.The story is interesting by itself, but Tornatore brings incredible feeling to the tale.  1900 has an amazing gift of being able to put not only his emotions to music, but characterizations of others he sees around the room. All his pieces are impromptu and as original as the people surrounding him.Tim Roth is fantastic in the lead role, displaying extraordinary range.  He renders a believable pianist, but more importantly, he simultaneously brings the character dynamism and depth.  When he is playing the crowd he is the flamboyant showman, yet when he is alone or with Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) he is reflective and moody.Pruitt Taylor Vince also comes through with a strong performance as 1900's close friend and fellow musician.  Vince plays the part with great empathy and the interactions between him and Roth are often moving.  Clarence Williams III (yes, that's Linc from the Mod Squad TV series in the 60's) is electrifying as Jelly Roll Morton, the self proclaimed inventor of jazz. Williams steals the show for at least 15 minutes as he and Roth duel it out on the piano.The music is exquisite.  Ennio Morricone is a prolific composer whose career spans 40 years.  He has scored over 400 films including 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly', 'The Untouchables', 'Disclosure', and 'Twister'.  His ability to find the right music for the multiple moods in this film is astounding.
For viewers who enjoy complex character studies replete with unabashed sentimentality, this film is worth hunting down at the movie store.  I rated it a 9/10.  It is a richly rewarding experience.",9,3,6,9 August 2002
Rocky," One of my top 50 of all time
","Once in a long while, there comes a film that has such tremendous gestalt that it rises above any negative criticism.  Rocky' is such a film.  It is more than just a story about an underdog boxer who makes the best of a title shot.  It is a story about perseverance, heart and courage.  Most of all it is a story about transcendence.  All the major characters in the film, including Apollo Creed, transcended their previous limitations.  If you reflect on it, Mick, Paulie, Adrian and Rocky were all changed people by the end of the film.  Apollo was changed too, but we didn't realize it until the sequel.  The film was also a transcendent event for Stallone, and served as an allegory of his life.  If there ever was an underdog in Hollywood, it was Sly Stallone.  His trademark droopy eyes and slurred speech were the result of a severed nerve at birth, and this disability was not conducive landing roles as a leading man.  As a child, he was teased for his slur, and coupled with his name endured a childhood of Tweety bird jokes.   He knew a little about fighting.  He was expelled from fourteen schools by the time he was fifteen.  In the film, when Rocky was knocked down and his corner told him to stay down, it was symbolic of his own life when his acting teachers at University of Miami tried to dissuade him from acting.  In both cases he got up and proved them wrong.This film found its original inspiration in a boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner (a.k.a. The Bayonne Bleeder), an astronomical underdog who lasted fifteen punishing rounds and emerged with his pride and a face that looked like ground beef.  Anyone who saw that fight and this film would see the obvious similarities in Ali/Creed and Wepner/Balboa.  After seeing this fight, Stallone wrote the screenplay in three days.Stallone had several big money producers interested in the script, but they refused to produce it with him in the lead.  So he turned them down and produced it on a shoestring, grossing over $225 million and winning Best Picture and Director Oscars and acting and writing nominations for Stallone. Stallone should have stopped after the first Rocky' as the sequels did not and could not compare.  However, I can't blame him for riding the gravy train after the price he paid for admission.Stallone is brilliant in the role, as the inspiration came from his own life.  He simultaneously elicits pathos and respect from the viewer.  Though Balboa is none too bright, Stallone gives him a pure heart, unswerving desire and through sheer simplicity makes him the wisest of all the characters in the film.  By the end, everyone in the theater is pulling for Rocky because to do so is to cheer for their own lost dreams.  I still get a lump in my throat when he screams out, `Adrian' at the end. 
This film is in my top 50 of all time.  I'm partial to underdog stories and this is the heavyweight champion of that category.  I rated it a perfect 10. Rocky' may not have been great filmmaking but it was great art.  Would that life could always imitate art as well as it did in this film.",10,1,2,3 June 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Defective screenplay brilliantly filmed
","It is unfortunate that Stanley Kubrick who has given us so many brilliant films (`Spartacus'; `2001, A Space Odyssey'; `A Clockwork Orange'; `The Shining'; `Full Metal Jacket'), should end his career with this one.  The biggest problem with this film is the screenplay, which is all the more perplexing since Kubrick helped write it.  It is hard to comprehend how such a masterful filmmaker could miss the mark by such a wide margin.
Let me begin by saying that the technical aspects of this film were superb to the point of being superhuman.  Kubrick's camera work was pure genius. The color and lighting were impeccable; incomparable in their impact and effect as well as their beauty.  Anyone who has seen this film should go back and watch it again and just notice the way the sets are lighted, how the shadows are cast, how the rooms in the background are bathed in soft blue with contrasting colored lights perfectly splashed in to heighten the effect.  As far as the sound, Kubrick can do more with the well placed single note of a piano than most directors can do with an entire orchestra.That being said, the script can only be described as grossly disappointing. There were really two stories here.  The first is the story of Bill (Tom Cruise) and Alice (Nicole Kidman) Harford's relationship.  The second was the story of Bill's sexual odyssey resulting in his crashing of an orgy for the rich and famous.  Too much was made of the first and not enough of the second.  This should have been a psycho-sexual film noir suspense thriller. The elements were there for a good one.  Bill's penetration of the sordid inner circle of sex games of the powerful could have been a riveting thriller with proper follow through.  But instead, Kubrick chose to deflate this storyline with the unsatisfying dialogue between Bill and Victor (Sidney Pollack).  He then returned to the Harford's relationship, which was a character study in `who cares'.  He ends the film as if their relationship was the point, which left the film pointless.Other than her ability to provide sexy set dressing, Nicole Kidman was utterly superfluous in this film.  Worse yet, this was probably the most wretched performance of her career.  Kidman is not without talent and has given us some excellent performances (`Malice'; `Dead Calm').   Her performance here was tentative and strained, however.  There were times when she was so unnatural in the delivery of her lines, one would have thought she was aphasic.Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance portraying a difficult and tormented character.  It was somewhat of a departure for him to play a character that was so pent up and emotionally torn.  He hasn't taken on a part this difficult since `Born On The Fourth of July'.  Usually he plays the straightforward macho type; more action than depth.  I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to rise to the challenge of this character's complexity.I gave this film a 7/10.  The filmmaking was a 12, but the story was never developed to its full potential.  It would have been interesting to see what Alfred Hitchcock would have done with this story.  Perhaps Stanley and Alfred are talking about that right now.",7,0,1,17 March 2000
Pretty Woman," The new DVD makes it worth seeing again
","This film catapulted Julia Roberts to superstardom and with good reason. The film itself is a light but entertaining romantic comedy about a wealthy and unemotional corporate raider (Richard Gere) and a flamboyant hooker (Julia Roberts).  The story isn't that original, being a variation on the `love on the wrong side of the tracks' theme.  However, it is full of charming and funny moments and Roberts' audacious effervescence is the perfect contrast to Gere's impassive macho persona.  The film had enormous popular appeal and surprised everyone, grossing $178 million in the U.S. and $463 million worldwide, establishing Roberts as one of the most bankable stars in a generation.At only 21, Roberts was a fresh talent with sexy girl-next-door looks who showed she could light up the screen with her acting.  With the guidance of veteran sitcom director Garry Marshall (`The Odd Couple', `Happy Days', `Mork and Mindy', `Murphy Brown'), she was transformed from a tall and pretty model type into a delightful romantic figure with an extraordinary sense of comic timing who earned a best actress nomination for her performance.The new DVD includes a good deal of footage that was left out of the theatrical release, and the commentary by Garry Marshall is rich in interesting trivia about the production.  For instance, he tells how Julia Roberts was so nervous about her first nude scene with Richard Gere that she broke out in hives, and they spent the entire day applying calamine lotion and makeup all over her to hide the blotches.  Also, the now famous scene where Gere snaps the lid of the jewelry case on her fingers was not intended to be in the film.  Marshall instigated a prank because Julia was dragging and he wanted to wake her up.  So, he told Gere to impishly snap the lid when she went to touch the necklace, and her reaction was so delightful that they kept it.This is a fun film that is worth seeing again now that it has been released on DVD.  I rated it an 8/10.  Though it is ridiculously implausible, it is enchanting and amusing throughout.  It is also an excellent look at Julia Roberts' early work, when she only earned $300,000 rather than $20 Million per film.",8,1,2,25 January 2001
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Action X
","I'm not really surprised that this film is popular with the under 45 crowd. I suppose, regrettably, that this is the direction filmmaking is heading.  I call it Action X (typified by Pulp Fiction) because it is a genre unto itself loved by Generation X.  It is a combination of Action/Adventure, Film Noir, and Horror laced with bizarre characters, offbeat themes, sick humor and lots of irony.  Personally, I don't find it very entertaining, but I have to give it credit for creativity and boldness.If there is one area I have to compliment in this film it is the direction. Excellent, daring photography, scenes well thought out, lots of interesting stuff happening on the screen.  I gave this a 6 only because it was so well directed.  The script was clever, but pointless and if there was any theme to the story it was that stupid people tend to do stupid things and end up dead, except our heroes who do stupid things and are just lucky enough to get away with it.Though I understand the film's appeal, I guess I just can't appreciate a film that uses excellent filmmaking technique to produce a product so unrefined.",6,3,6,3 January 2000
Titanic," A colossal filmmaking achievement
","At over $1.8 Billion worldwide (excluding rentals), `Titanic' is the most commercially successful film of all time.  That is double the next highest grossing film (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace).  Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it won 11 including best picture in 1998.  Everything about this film was big.  It ran over 3 hours and had a budget of $200 million which is larger than the U.S. box office for all but 30 movies in the history of filmmaking.  This was a TITANIC film in every sense of the word.  But, was it any good?  Well, actually it was!The film was written and directed by James Cameron, who before this was most renowned for writing and directing `Terminator' films.  The story was a combination love story, period piece and disaster movie.  As a love story was good.  As a period piece, it was wonderfully precise in its myriad details, both generally and as to specifics about the Titanic and her passengers.  As an epic disaster movie, it was utterly colossal.From a directorial perspective, this film is unparalleled; a feat of gargantuan proportions.  In addition to the normal directorial duties, Cameron had to coordinate mammoth model-building projects, deep sea filming of the original ship, thousands of hours of painstaking research, elaborate visual effects, and hundreds of special sets.  To be able to pull all those elements together at all is a superhuman task.  The result was truly remarkable entertainment.Cameron took a chance on Leonardo DiCaprio.  The studios wanted Matthew McConaughey but Cameron insisted on DiCaprio.  It was a gamble that paid off.  DiCaprio gave a career performance and his enthusiasm and charm lit up the screen.  Kate Winslet was also a fresh talent with only five minor films to her credit before Titanic'.  Her performance was sparkling and her chemistry with DiCaprio made the love story urgent and magical.  Oddly, she hasn't worked much since, and is fast slipping back into the obscurity from whence she came.This was not as much a film as it was a fluctuation in the space-time continuum.  Forces and emotions from the original event were transported to 1997, and they clutched us with a power that left us spellbound.  It was neither the best story ever told, nor the best film ever made, but it was certainly the greatest filmmaking achievement to date in its sheer size and scope.  As a motion picture, I rated it a 9/10.  As an epic, there is no scale large enough to rate it.  The box office speaks for itself.",9,2,3,31 August 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids
","This film is an outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids from about seven through fifteen.  After that, its appeal drops off dramatically.  Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) does a fine job of bringing the wildly popular children's series to the big screen.Columbus had a difficult decision to make with the first film.  The introduction of Harry Potter requires a good deal of character and plot development, which isn't particularly interesting to those who aren't dedicated fans of the books.  Columbus chose to be true to the series and spent a lot of time doing background work that would be useful in later films (two more of which are already planned).  That encumbers this film a bit, weighing it down with details at the expense of plot pacing.  So, while this film is not as thrilling as it might have been, it sets the stage for more exciting sequels.From a technical perspective the film is marvelous.  The visual effects in this film are often astounding, especially the Quidditch match.  The cinematography is rich and dramatic, both the outdoor shots and those shot on the sets.  Columbus entices excellent performances out of the young and inexperienced cast members, but also works well with the veterans.The acting is fabulous.  Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent find as Harry.  He has a kind of nerdy coolness that is perfect for the part.  He comes across more as a regular kid trying to come to terms with special powers than a self important superhero type.  This is exactly the right balance.  Emma Watson, playing Hermione, is the consummate scene stealer and it is difficult to believe that this is her first feature film.  Watson packs a perky punch and has a wide array of facial expressions that often make dialogue completely superfluous.  Her self assurance and boldness provide the ideal contrast to Radcliffe's characterization of the timid and tentative Harry.The adult actors also represent themselves admirably.  Richard Harris and Maggie Smith provide steadying influences as Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.  Harris is almost unidentifiable under the flowing beard and robes, but his distinctive voice is unmistakable.  Smith is suitably stern and kind, showing she has a soft spot for Harry, but maintaining the authoritarian demeanor required of her position.  But the show stealer among the older actors is clearly Robbie Coltrane as the overly loquacious Hagrid (`I shouldn't have said that.  I should NOT have said that.')  Coltrane makes Hagrid as lovable as he is bumbling; a kid in a grown-up's body that is clearly on the kids' side.This is a delightful film for middle school kids, a segment that has fewer film choices than toddlers and teens.  I'd rate it a 9/10, shaving a point for excessive workup that slowed down the story a bit.  However, for Harry Potter fans, this is a perfect ten.",9,0,0,21 June 2002
It's a Wonderful Life," A Wonderful Film and Timeless Classic
","This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas.",10,235,276,6 December 2000
Enemy at the Gates," Good war story that meanders off point
","This is a war-within-a-war story based on a real WWII Soviet sniper upon whom the Soviets built much of their morale boosting war propaganda. Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) is an extraordinary marksman, pressed into service as a sniper in the Soviet army.  Through a combination of effective sharpshooting and relentless coverage by propadanda minister Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), Vassili becomes a Soviet hero and a German nemesis.  In response, the Germans send their best sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris) to find Vassili and take him out.  The result is a deadly game of cat and mouse where the lines between predator and prey blur.Director Jean-Jaques Annaud (`Seven Years in Tibet') also collaborated in writing the screenplay which is mostly riveting, but too often loses focus. The film is generally well directed with an authentic wartime feel to it. While some have criticized it for looking too much like `Saving Private Ryan', I feel such a comparison is a compliment.  Using outstanding cinematography as a model, and coming close to duplicating it is a positive, not a negative.  There has also been a lot of criticism of the fact that the Russians don't have Russian accents and the Germans don't have German accents and thus it isn't realistic.  I find this criticism ironic and without merit.  How someone can accept as realistic the fact that all the characters are speaking English and then criticize as unrealistic the fact that they don't speak accented English is beyond me.My main criticism of Annaud is his inability to stay locked on the main storyline, the story of the snipers.  He feels compelled to throw in a meaningless love triangle and lots of other fluff that really add nothing to the story.  The time would have been better spent delving deeper into the minds of the snipers and creating additional suspense filled confrontations.Jude Law gives a fine follow-up to his outstanding performance in `The Talented Mr. Ripley' showing that he is here to stay.  He strikes an excellent balance between Vassili's sense of duty and reluctance to be a hero, showing a character that is compelled to be courageous when he is really scared.Rachel Weisz also turns in a strong performance though her character is totally superfluous to the main story.  Bob Hoskins renders a fabulous wartime Khrushchev.  Ed Harris is good as the German sharpshooter, but this is not among his better performances.  Joseph Fiennes is also very good, although his is another role that is overemphasized needlessly.This is a very good film that lost its opportunity to be great because of Annaud's inexplicable need to wander from a great storyline.  I rated it 7/10.  It is a good wartime thriller worth a look.",7,0,1,4 October 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Brilliant filmmaking, superb acting
","Ron Howard (Splash, Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13) has done excellent work as a director for which he has gotten little credit over the years.  With this film comes a best director Oscar and a best picture Oscar and finally the recognition he deserves.  Howard has always been good at presenting human stories, be they comedy or drama.  He has a intuitive understanding of character motivation and is excellent at making his characters elicit strong emotions in the viewer.  This is particularly true in this film.The story is based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a mathematician and Nobel laureate who suffered from schizophrenia.  The film gives us a unique first person perspective of the disease, drawing us into his world and allowing us to see what Nash sees.  Howard's presentation is brilliant.  At first Nash is presented as a bit eccentric, but lucid.  As we experience his world, reality and illusion are so perfectly intertwined that we are not sure where the world ends and the mind begins.  By fooling the audience Howard makes the subtle point that to the schizophrenic it all seems real. In attempting to evaluate Nash's world we get a distant understanding of the confusion that results when a rational person attempts to cope with a world that is part real and part hallucination.While this is a biopic, it is more fiction than fact.  A great deal of dramatic license is taken since Nash freely admits that he has little recollection of the years when he suffered from the disease.  The powerful speech at the end of the film where he thanks his wife after receiving his Nobel Prize is pure Hollywood.  Included in the DVD is footage of the actual Nobel ceremony and no speeches were given.  Yet, we can forgive the latitude taken because the story is so inspirational.From a production standpoint, special note must be given to the makeup department, which ages Russell Crowe so magnificently.  As the movie progresses through four decades, Nash is realistically depicted and aged appropriately.  Likewise, the art department does a fine job rendering four different periods, matching costumes, props and sets to the times.Yet, with all the fine production values, this film excels most in the acting.  Russell Crowe turns in a career performance in a career abundant in great performances.  This character is the antithesis of the Russell Crowe we've come to expect.  Instead of strong, tough and balanced, with a sharp worldly intelligence, he plays an eccentric and convoluted man with quirks, nervous habits and a psyche obviously out of balance.  Crowe completely immerses himself in the enormous volume of the role, effortlessly moving between its elements from audacity to paranoia to tenderness to genius. This is an accomplishment that is light years beyond his Academy Award performance in `Gladiator', good as it was.Jennifer Connelly puts herself on the map with an Oscar for best supporting actress.  It is always difficult to avoid getting lost in the presence of an actor as powerful as Crowe, but Connelly stays right with him, delivering a moving performance as Nash's steadfast wife.Ed Harris was my favorite to nose out Crowe for best actor in last year's Academy Awards.  Harris gave a brilliant performance playing Jackson Pollock in `Pollock' (also featuring Jennifer Connelly in a small role) that was trampled under by the `Gladiator' Oscar juggernaut.  As if to say, `If you can't beat him, join him', Harris goes toe to toe with Crowe in some of the most intense scenes in the film.  Harris lends significant energy and intrigue to the movie with an urgent performance as the operative who recruits Nash to break codes for the government.This film is nothing short of fantastic.  It is expertly directed, superbly acted and meticulously crafted.  It presents great drama while also bringing insight into a stigmatizing disease to a wide audience.  I rated it a 10/10. It rightfully ran away with the Best Picture Oscar.  If you see only one motion picture this year, make sure it is this one.",10,0,2,14 August 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A timeless classic
","This film is a giant in a very crowded genre of WWII movies released in the 1940's and 50's.  It was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven including Best Picture, Best Actor (Alec Guinness) and Best Director (David Lean).  The story is atypical of the WWII genre.  Instead of showing the glory of battle, it presents the psychological and physical torment of life in a POW camp.  It focuses on the human story, a story of principles, will and courage in the face of adversity.Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) is the commander of a group of prisoners of war interned in a Japanese camp in Southeast Asia during WWII.  He is told by the camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) that the prisoners will build a bridge across the river Kwai to complete the Japanese railroad that will supply their troops.  Saito orders that officers will work beside enlisted men, to which Nicholson objects because it is a violation of the rules of war agreed to at the Geneva Convention.  This leads to a standoff, a test of wills that is ultimately won by the irrationally stubborn Brit after many days in solitary confinement.The result is that Nicholson agrees to build the bridge on his own terms, using his own engineers.  This seems to be insane, since building the bridge would aid the enemy.  However, Nicholson's has a high-minded goal that transcends the war.  He wants to build a bridge that will endure as a testament to the superiority of the British civilization, especially since it will be built under such extreme circumstances.  He also feels that building a bridge of which they can be proud will boost the moral of the men while living under such oppressive conditions.The psychological aspect of the film is fascinating.  Saito's personal sense of honor does not allow him to use the brutality necessary to coerce the prisoners into building the bridge properly.  Ironically, once he succumbs to defeat in the battle of wills against Nicholson, he gets everything he wants.  By losing, he actually wins.The acting in this film is superb.  Alec Guinness is magnificent as the idealistic and staunchly principled Colonel.  This was probably his best role in a stellar career.  William Holden is also terrific as the sardonic and cowardly sailor that fate continued to throw into situations that required him to become a reluctant hero.  Sessue Hayakawa delivers a masterful performance, as the hapless commander who succumbs to Nicholson's iron will.The ending evokes conflicting emotions, as it is simultaneously ironic, triumphant and devastating.  At the end, the viewer is not sure whom to pull for since there is no neat way to resolve the collision of converging forces.  This makes the film even more interesting.This film is a timeless classic.  I rated it a 10/10.  I'm looking forward to seeing it on the newly released DVD.",10,0,1,4 December 2000
The Green Mile," Well crafted character study
","Stephen King knows how to spin a yarn.  This is another terrific adaptation of a King novel that delivers a bittersweet story of a depression era Louisiana prison on the death row cell block.  It presents numerous interesting character studies that induce strong emotions for the various characters.  There is also a lot of irony here with good guys who are evil and bad guys who are good.Director Frank Darabont, who missed out on an Oscar with Shawshank Redemption' (also by Stephen King) to Forrest Gump' must have decided he wasn't going to beaten by Tom Hanks again and secured him for this film with wonderful results.  Unfortunately, he was trumped at the Academy by Kevin Spacey and American Beauty', an injustice in my opinion.Darabont again does a superlative job of creating the right mix of drama, imagery and human interest.   My only criticism of his direction is that the film was much too long.  It certainly could have been done in two hours instead of three with very little lost in the editing.  We could have eliminated the entire first execution and rehearsal without any loss to the story except perhaps the sponge issue.The acting was outstanding by all.  Tom Hanks turns in another great performance as the tough but kind cell block boss.  Hanks continues to show his versatility, excelling in both dramatic and comedic roles and moving effortlessly between them like a chameleon.  David Morse mirrored Hanks as another tough guy with a heart and played the part nicely.  Michael Clarke Duncan engendered a very sensitive and lovable nature to his character, making the contrast between his demeanor and physiognomy all the more striking.  And I cannot leave out the uncredited star of the show, the little mouse who played Jangles.Overall, a well crafted film and an excellent story that suffered slightly from excessive length.  I rated it a 9/10.  I would recommend it highly to anyone except those who are squeamish about graphic violence (such as the electrocution scenes).",9,1,1,15 June 2000
Bring It On," High Energy Entertainment
","A crowd pleaser of a film, `Bring It On' is essentially a high school sports story for girls.  Though the cheering squad has boys on it, the film is clearly dominated by the young women.  This represents a fresh entry into that genre, as I can't remember ever seeing another film that focuses on competitive cheerleading.  The film is actually well constructed, with an interesting story underlying numerous highly athletic cheerleading scenes.Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is the new captain of the National Champion cheerleading squad from Rancho Carne High (that name cracks me up, literally translated it means `Meat Ranch').  She discovers that the former captain stole all their cheers from an inner city high school and this year that high school intends to compete in the regional championships with the same routine.  Torrance has to come up with a new routine in just a few weeks. This is an appealing twist on the normal sports story because it focuses on the champions as the underdogs (like the Rocky sequels).  They also throw in a Cinderella story with the East Compton Clovers, who are coming from obscurity to compete at the national level.The film is lively, energetic, and generally fun to watch, although we aren't delving into the mysteries of the universe here.  It takes cheerleading seriously and attempts to legitimize it as a serious endeavor, dealing candidly with the team members' self consciousness about their own sport.  The teen scenes are well written, giving a frank look at some real issues teens face, like the back biting rivalries and mocking condescension between cliques.  They even pack in a teen love story to further engage their target audience, which is clearly teenage girls.Kirsten Dunst is spunky, perky, sprightly, vivacious, and otherwise youthfully exuberant.  In short, she is perfect for the part.  While it is true, a strong breeze could have blown Torrance away (literally and figuratively) Dunst captures the emotions and concerns of her character realistically and effectively (Dunst's being 18 undoubtedly helped).  There are numerous other good performances.  I am particularly impressed with Eliza Dushku as Missy.  She is by far the most substantial character in the film and brings a great deal of maturity to the part.  Among the entire cast, Dushku is the only actor I can see succeeding in role outside the teen genre.  Gabrielle Union, as Clovers' team captain Isis, is powerful and audacious and gives the entire Clovers team a strong image.  I also enjoyed Cody McMains as Torrance's sarcastic kid brother who goes to see his sister compete in the National Championships wearing a Cheerleading = Death tee-shirt.This is a good film for young girls and is highly entertaining for just about anyone.  It was a resounding financial success grossing seven times its meager $10 million budget.  It is well directed and has numerous funny high school moments, along with plenty of scenes where teens take themselves all too seriously.  I rated it 8/10, since it is better than many of the films in its genre.  It's true that it is cotton candy cinema, (insubstantial but sweet), however it is worth seeing if you enjoy teen flicks.",8,1,2,24 February 2001
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best films of the 1990's
","This was one of the best films of the 1990's and was all but snubbed by the Academy.  It was nominated for seven Oscars in 1995 including best picture, but it came up empty, trodden under by the Gump stampede.Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's short story was a thing of beauty.  The story of an accountant who thinks his way out of a maximum-security prison, and survives on sheer intelligence, guile and will is expertly spun and engrossing.  The ending is uplifting and exhilarating.Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman gave career performances.  Robbins was outstanding in the portrayal of a character whose phlegmatic and understated persona belied his cunning and razor sharp intellect.  Freeman was also fantastic as the old convict who knew how to get things done in the joint. Freeman's performance got him a Best Actor nomination in a year when Tom Hanks was a cinch.  Everything about this film was superlative.  The direction, the cinematography, the sound and the music were all top flight.  It is difficult to comprehend how such an accomplished film was left with so little acclaim.I rated this film a 10/10.  I highly recommend it, although viewers should be advised that there is some disturbing prison violence.  Don't miss it.",10,1,2,31 August 2000
Blow," Standout performances by Depp and Cruz
","Blow is a very good biopic on the life of cocaine kingpin George Jung (Johnny Depp) who rose to prominence in the 1980's as one of the largest cocaine traffickers in the United States.  The story is an interesting character study of Jung, who started selling marijuana to pay some bills and found that demand continued to outpace his ability to supply until he had built a cocaine empire.In an interview from prison included on the DVD, Jung states that the story was very true to actual events, and that in certain cases it was like a flashback.  Jung appears from this interview to be a hapless soul who was willingly swept along by a riptide of forces that were beyond his sway, which is exactly how Depp portrayed him.Johnny Depp is an excellent character actor who relishes playing odd and offbeat characters.  In this film he gives one of his best and most nuanced performances with a clear understanding of the motivations and circumstances that spun Jung out of control.  He plays Jung with naivetÃ© rather than giving him the sinister character that one might expect from a drug lord. After having seen the interview with the real Jung it seems Depp was right on target.Penelope Cruz also expands her horizons, shedding her normally sweet persona to take on the part of Jung's shrewish, drug addicted wife.  Cruz plays the part with great force and emotion, like a woman possessed.  It is a fantastic portrayal of a bitter, self centered woman with a drug problem.Paul Reubens continues his comeback from the ill fated Pee-wee Herman days with a solid portrayal of Derek, the double dealing hair dresser who becomes Jung's primary distributor.  Rachel Griffiths and Ray Liotta also give fine performances as Jung's clueless parents.This character study is well written and sympathetically presented by director Ted Demme.  I rated it an 8/10.  It contains standout performances by both Depp and Cruz and is well worth seeing.",8,0,0,9 November 2001
Vanilla Sky," A mind warping experience
","Cameron Crowe's dark remake of Alejandro Amenabar's 1997 Spanish film, `Abre los ojos' (also starring Penelope Cruz) is a mind warping experience. Welcome to a world where dreams and reality are seamlessly interwoven, so it is impossible for the characters, the viewers and maybe even Crowe to tell where one ends and the other begins.  This will be a frustrating film for anyone who hopes to make sense of it.  To enjoy it one must relax and allow oneself to be mentally flagellated for two plus hours.Like all lady or tiger stories, the film will generate great debates among the intelligentsia about which parts of the story are real and which are the dreams.  However, for the majority the response will be, `Huh?'  Crowe keeps us guessing until the very last frame at which point he throws us the final curve and abruptly ends the film.  In the featurette that comes with the DVD, it is clear the Crowe is relishing his role as tantalizer, taking great pains to make each scene as ambiguous as possible to keep it open to multiple interpretations.  That's what makes the film fun, if you like that sort of thing.  Personally, I like closure, but I can appreciate Crowe's deliciously evil intentions.As is always the case with Cameron Crowe, the presentation is innovative and visually interesting.  Crowe has a terrific and unique way of crafting his films that is very engaging.  In this film, he purposely avoids defining his characters, preferring to keep their motivations abstruse.  For him to maintain the vagueness, it is important that we remain confused about the characters' personalities.  In this regard, he succeeds spectacularly.  The film is a bit too long and bogs down slightly in the middle, but just when we are about to get bored, Crowe throws us another brain bender to keep it interesting.Kudos go to the makeup department in the creation of Tom Cruise's facial disfigurement, which is realistically hideous and effective.The acting ranges from good to great.  This is a particularly difficult film for actors since the characters are meant to remain indistinct.  It is hard to render a character when the director demands that his/her motivations and personality keep changing, but the cast adapts beautifully.  Tom Cruise is powerful and tortured as Aames, the convoluted protagonist.  Since the entire film is essentially shot from his perspective, it is important that we share his bewilderment and consternation, which means he must project those emotions onto us.  This he does with extraordinary effect, delivering a gut wrenching performance that takes him (and us) to the brink of insanity.  Penelope Cruz is excellent as his sexy and supportive love interest.  But Cruz is eclipsed by Cameron Diaz, who steals the show with minimal screen time.  Diaz swings from sweet and adorable to vicious and maniacal with such ease that it is frightening.  Jason Lee is also good as Aames' fickle best friend and rival.  Lee naturally projects a trustworthy persona, so when he turns on Aames it creates the startling effect that Crowe wants.  Kurt Russell is okay as the psychologist, but this is a more cerebral role than his skills can handle.  Russell is a naturally visceral performer, great in roles as the tough guy with a big heart.  Here he seems a bit out of place.This film is deviously crafted and expertly presented with deft performances by the cast.  It will drive most viewers a little nuts, which is its intention.  This will also mean that some people will really dislike it.  I rated it 9/10.  If you think you can figure it out, you're dreaming.",9,2,4,23 August 2002
Any Given Sunday," Caution: Egomaniac At Work
","I love sports and sports flicks.  That is the very reason I didn't care for this film.  This film is not a film about football; it is a film about Oliver Stone.  With `Any Given Sunday', Stone has created his most ambitious tribute to his own megalomania.  This film is a classic example of excessive style negating substance.  Stone was so intent on showing us the sizzle, that he cooked all of the flavor out of the steak.  A good director uses innovative technique to enhance the telling of the story.  An egomaniac uses the story as an excuse to show off his talent and creativity.  The result of such self-indulgence is almost always a diminishment of the final product.Here Stone tries to out-hip the hip generation of directors by providing a staccato progression of weird angles, extreme close-ups and disjointed perspective shots with so many jump cuts that it makes `The Limey' look like it is on tranquilizers.  I have never seen so much dialogue delivered by actors with half their heads cut off.  The hand held football sequences were dreadful; as cameras were pounded into the turf without regard to the action that we were supposed to be following.  The entire movie was like a three-hour music video, with images flitting willy-nilly as if they were being shot by a drunken mosquito.  Ironically, Stone failed to learn the lesson learned by Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) in the story; that is that the good of the whole is more important than the glory of the individual.It is a pity, because buried beneath all this decadent directorial tripe, there was a good sports story and some terrific acting.  We saw how money and greed adulterates the sport and how athletes too often become selfish and conceited as they bask in the limelight.  There was also the drama of the comeback in the critical game, which was dissipated by Stone's erratic camera work and editing.Al Pacino gave a great performance as the legendary coach past his prime, who let his pride stand in the way of the team's success.  Cameron Diaz rose above her accustomed quirky lightweight roles to deliver a stunning performance as the hard-as-nails club owner trying to move out of her dead father's shadow.  Jamie Foxx was electric as the third string quarterback who explodes into the public eye and begins taking himself far too seriously, evoking the ire of his teammates.This film had a great cast and a solid story that was marred by a narcissistic director who rendered it annoying to watch.  I rated it a 5/10. It's a shame, because I love sports stories and I never got a chance to enjoy this one.",5,0,0,2 September 2000
Ben-Hur," The Quintessential Epic
","In the late 1950's MGM was in trouble financially.  They desperately needed a hit that would put the studio back in the black and re-establish it as a major player.  They decided to bet the ranch on Ben-Hur.  They brought in William Wyler (`Wuthering Heights', `The Best Years of Our Lives', `Roman Holiday') to direct and gave him carte blanche to spend whatever it took to make the film successful.  The result was the most expensive film made to that date at $50 Million (equivalent to $300 Million in today's dollars). Many of the sets took over a year to build.  It was lucky the film ever was finished at all.  After six months in production, they still didn't have a cast and the script by Karl Tunberg was deemed unacceptable by Wyler.  Wyler brought in Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson (`All Quiet on the Western Front', `Death Takes a Holiday', `Key Largo') to rewrite the screenplay and they frequently were doing desperate rewrites the night before shooting.  Producer Sam Zimbalist died during production.  The roman ships they built for the naval battle were top heavy and capsized, so they had to build a special tank where the ships were guided by wires and held upright.  An expensive 65mm camera was destroyed in a collision with a chariot. Numerous leading men were reported to have turned down the part of Ben-Hur, most notably Paul Newman, who said he didn't have the legs to appear in a tunic.  Others who were considered were Rock Hudson, Burt Lancaster, and Kirk Douglas.  Wyler couldn't find the right actor for the lead, so he turned to Charlton Heston, with whom he had done the film `The Big Country', the year before.  Heston accepted the part and the rest is history.Despite all its production problems, the film is brilliantly done and stands as an archetype of film epics.  The sets and costumes are glorious, the direction superb and the acting compelling.  The chariot race is an outstanding orchestration of set construction, stunt work and filming that is superlative even by today's standards.  Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did almost all their own chariot driving, using stuntmen for only the most dangerous stunts.  This lent greater realism to the scenes, allowing more close-ups during the intense action.  Somehow, despite all the rewrites using three different writers, the story flowed smoothly to its final resolution.  The bitter rivalry between Judah and Messala, boyhood friends turned enemies by Messala's ambition, is well conceived and creates a sense of purpose that makes the ultimate confrontation as powerful as it is inevitable.The entire cast is terrific.  Charlton Heston gives a career performance as Judah Ben-Hur.  His combination of strength, courage, compassion and perseverance creates an attractive and heroic character that few in film history have been able to equal.  Stephen Boyd is also fantastic as Messala, with a ruthless ambition and a cold heart that stamps out lifelong friendships for personal gain.  Jack Hawkins and Hugh Griffith lead a wonderful supporting cast.This film is one of the most honored epics ever made.  It was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won 11 including Best Picture, Best Actor (Charlton Heston), Best Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), Best Director (William Wyler), and Best Music.  It is number 72 on AFI's top 100 of the century. The chariot race is one of the most exciting sequences ever filmed.  I rated it a 10/10.  They don't come much better than this.",10,2,5,20 April 2001
Sweet and Lowdown," Intriguing Character Study, Great Music
","Every so often a film comes along where the music alone is worth the ticket. This is such a film.  This is an intriguing character study about a fictional jazz guitarist in the 1930's named Emmet Ray (Sean Penn).  Woody Allen, who wrote and directed the film, cleverly uses an autobiographical documentary format, and anyone who is unfamiliar with jazz or didn't know in advance, might easily believe this was a true story.  That is a testimonial to Allen's skills, because despite the fact that Ray was a rogue and a degenerate, the whole story seemed extremely believable.Ray was renowned as the second greatest jazz guitarist in the world, behind a European gypsy named Django Reinhardt.  Ray had a deep seated insecurity about being number two, and both times he saw Reinhardt play, he passed out. We follow his meandering life as a musician, pimp and carouser with occasional side trips to watch trains and shoot rats.  Unlike most of Allen's films, this one wasn't peppered with stiletto humor and irony. There were some funny bits, but this was mostly a serious character study. Although Ray wasn't an endearing character, he certainly was a fascinating one.  That along with the fabulous music made this film work nicely.I also enjoyed the way Allen shot this film.  He gave it a nice old look. The indoor scenes were shot with an amber filter and the entire film had a very soft focus to it.  There were lots of good period props and costumes that brought the thirties alive.I'm not normally a big fan of Sean Penn, but he did a terrific job in the lead role.  Penn is not a versatile actor, but he is excellent in certain types of roles.  He is adroit at roles that involve gritty, visceral characters with raw and crude emotions.  In this regard, he was perfectly cast for this part.  The only minor criticism I had was that his guitar fingering was not particularly realistic.  Otherwise it was masterful work. His Oscar nomination was well deserved.This is the second film this month where I've had a chance to see Samantha Morton.  I enjoyed her work in Dreaming of Joseph Lees' and again here as Hattie.  Since Hattie is a mute, Morton didn't have a single line, but she had a pivotal role and a lot of screen time.  Morton had to do all her acting with her facial expressions and body language and she was fantastic. I have seen numerous actors who have conveyed less with twenty minutes of dialogue than she did with a single look.  She has a very wholesome and amiable quality about her, very genuine and sincere.  She seems to be a very promising young talent and I am eager to see her next role.This film is a must see for anyone who loves jazz and the character study ain't bad either.  I rate it an 8/10.",8,0,0,25 June 2000
Amélie," Delicious, like a glass of sparkling burgundy
","I don't often view foreign language films.  I find it maddening to try to read the subtitles and watch the film at the same time.  Also, I had heard such glowing reviews about this film that I was prepared to be disappointed as well as frazzled.  I could not have been more wrong.This is a wonderful, wonderful film.  Amelie (Audrey Tautou) is a mousey girl living in Paris whose life is so ordinary that it borders on pathetic. One day she discovers a tin box in her apartment with little toys and keepsakes of a young child that was hidden behind a wall decades ago.  She sets out on a mission to find the boy and return the treasures to him.  If the mission has a positive effect, she vows to devote herself to doing good deeds for others.  This leads to numerous touching and droll adventures, where Amelie doles out her own personal brand of justice to various characters, both good and evil.  Along the way she discovers love and turns it into a cat and mouse game of mystery and fascination, making her lover fall for her and pursue her without ever knowing who she is.The story is brilliantly written, with a wry sense of humor.  Only the French could make mundane situations so funny, ironic, charming and philosophical at the same time.  It is a marvelous mix of intrigue, misdirection and offbeat humor.  Director Jean Pierre Jeunet squeezes the maximum amount of wit, sentimentality and humanness from every frame.  The Parisian street scenes are wonderfully done showing us more of an insider's look at Paris than a tourist's guidebook.Audrey Tautou is captivating in the lead role.  She reminds me of Audrey Hepburn, full of breathy enthusiasm with a twinkle in her eye and mischief on her mind.  When she is good she's wonderful, and when she's bad she's even better.This is an enthralling delight of a film, like a glass of sparkling French burgundy.  It will make you chuckle and tug your heart strings.  I rated it a 10/10.  Even if you hate subtitles, see this film.  You won't regret it.",10,1,4,9 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," Clever story with too many holes (SPOILER WARNING)
","THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS INCLUDING SPECIFIC REFERENCES THAT REVEAL THE ENDING.  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU SEE THE FILM BEFORE READING THIS COMMENT.It seems most people fall into one of two camps on this film.  They either love it or hate it (it would seem that more love it).  My sentiments lie with neither camp.  This is a fascinating and clever story that is well filmed but poorly crafted.  Plot holes abound and Director/Writer M. Night Shyamalan has to fudge all over the place to keep the surprise ending a surprise.  In my comments here, I have commented many times on the dangers of writers directing their own work.  In almost every case, the director lacks the necessary objectivity to identify and excise plot flaws.  In this case they were glaring.Many questions come to mind.  Why was Cole (Haley Joel Osment) afraid of every ghost but Malcolm (Bruce Willis)?  Why did every ghost appear in a form that showed how they died except Malcolm?  They were all bloody and disfigured; why not Malcolm?  Where was the bullet hole in his shirt and the blood?  I watched the movie a second time and there were a number of scenes where he had no jacket.  He always wore the same shirt, but there was no bullet hole or blood in any scene.Clearly the biggest question is why it was never cold when Malcolm was in the room except in the very last scene with his wife (Olivia Williams).  He was in scenes with Cole's mother (Toni Collette), a restaurant full of people, a theater full of parents, a doctor, and on and on and yet in no scene did anyone seem remotely chilly, no less seeing their breath.So, I have a fundamental problem calling this a great motion picture. However, it was very well filmed from a technical standpoint and produced some excellent suspense throughout that kept the viewer engaged.The acting was fair to excellent.  Toni Collette was mediocre at best as Cole's mother.  She overacted in almost every scene and her chemistry wasn't very good with the boy until the last scene when he told her what her mother said.  Likewise, Olivia Williams didn't bowl me over as Malcolm's wife.Bruce Willis gave a good performance, but he is out of his element playing the sensitive and self doubting type.  He always comes across as a bit whiny when he tries to play nice guy parts.  His forte is playing the tough, strong courageous type and he would best serve his career by staying with those types of parts.Finally, there is young Haley Joel Osment as Cole.  He gave an excellent performance and was the linchpin that held the whole film together.  He was very versatile in his portrayal of various emotions.  He handled fear, playfulness, affection and anger with equal aplomb.  His physiognomy was right for the part as well, as he looked very nerdy and self conscious, exactly what was needed for the part.I rated this film a 7/10.  It was entertaining and it had real potential, but it had too many flaws to realize it.",7,0,0,13 April 2000
Final Destination," A fresh and entertaining approach to horror
","It is refreshing to see a film that innovates.  The last film to do that in the horror genre was `Scream'.  `Final Destination' has introduced an inventive approach to the genre, giving it a supernatural killer rather than a lunatic slasher dress up in some kind of costume.  Using `Death' as the killer opens up myriad possibilities for the method of death and choice of victims.  This film was excellent at presenting the supernatural stalker's manipulation of the physical world to find murder weapons in everyday objects.  While the concept of Death taking people from earth is hardly new in films, the idea of Death as a malevolent attacker that has a plan that can be outwitted is a novelty.This film is the germination of an interesting direction, but does not bring the concept to maturation.  It is unsophisticated in its storytelling and the characters lack subtlety and realism in their reactions to their situation.  They are undifferentiated from their hollow horror counterparts in that regard, just fodder for the beast.  Director James Wong, who has mostly TV credits on his resume, breaks into feature films with a vengeance.  From the standpoint of the photography and visual effects, the film was excellent.  His camera perspectives were creative and lent greater force to the suspense.  His crafting of the scenes was less effective.  The prescient clues to the next murder lacked nuance. There were no surprises except perhaps the last murder.  The formula was always the same, Alex predicts a murder and then rushes frantically to prevent it with mixed results.As is often the case in this genre, the acting had a broad range from terrible to very good.  Devon Sawa was excellent.  He gave his character much more range and depth than we are used to seeing from horror heroes.  He was the closest to having genuine human responses to the tragedies, at least in the beginning of the film.  Ali Larter was good as Clear, but her character didn't have much range and she did little to expand the envelope. The same is true of Kerr Smith whose character had even less dimensionality. On the awful side, there were Daniel Robuck and Roger Guenveur Smith as the hapless FBI agents and Tony Todd as the completely implausible undertaker.This was an entertaining film and a terrific story concept.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is a must-see for horror fans, but still enjoyable for a broader audience.  Few films of this genre have the potential to improve in the sequel.  This may be one of them.",8,1,3,10 October 2000
Rear Window," Another Hitchcock masterpiece
","Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism. When we watch a film, aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?Hitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While `Rear Window' as a whole is probably not quite at a level with `Vertigo' (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions. Hitchcock's mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa's nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle's reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says `Be Careful, Tom'.  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.Hitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn't see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the `Ice Maiden' in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between `Psycho' (#18) and `Vertigo' (#61).  I personally think more highly of `Vertigo' but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10/10. `Rear Window' is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense.",10,100,122,10 April 2001
Hart's War," A war story that defies credulity
","It is hard to imagine a more contrived story than this WWII POW film.  There are just so many unrealistic plot elements that the story loses all credibility.  Director Gregory Hoblit, (`Frequency', `Primal Fear') has delivered good dramatic films in the past, but this one simply loses its grip on reality.  While the production values are excellent, Hoblit doesn't seem to notice or care that plot and the behavior of his characters range from inconsistent to implausible.Take Colonel Werner Visser (Marcel Iures).  The workup on him shows him to be evil, intolerant, cruel and autocratic and those are his nicer qualities. Then suddenly, for no reason we can discern, he develops a soft spot for Lt. Hart (Colin Farrell).   This is a conniving, manipulative, hard hearted creature and just because he went to the same college as Hart, he becomes his avuncular advisor and benefactor.  Let's get real here.Yes, and I am sure they are going to send a lieutenant assigned to headquarters and privileged to strategic information, who has never been in combat, to shuttle another officer to the front lines so he can get captured and spill his guts to the enemy.  That detail would have been given to a non commissioned officer with no exposure to such intelligence.The one bright spot in this film is the acting of Colin Farrell.  Farrell combines rugged good looks and excellent dramatic skills to bring this film whatever shred of credibility it has.  He manages to make his character believable, despite the unbelievable nature of everything that is going on around him.  Bruce Willis gets top billing in this film, but doesn't log 20% of the screen time that Farrell commands.  Willis plays the hard shelled West Point officer well, although his switch from heartless malevolence to heroic nobility is just a bit too abrupt to accept.Everything about this film stretches credulity.  By the end of the film, my eye sockets were sore from all the eye rolling.  I rated it a 5/10.  Despite some good performances and technical elements, this kind of drama needs realism to be effective and in this regard `Hart's War' fails spectacularly.",5,20,38,27 July 2002
The Replacements," Unoriginal but hilarious
","Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners' sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things. You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational `Hoosiers' imitation was misplaced.This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel `The Leg' Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren't amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren't a football fan.  For the rest of you, be prepared to split a gut.",8,74,84,7 December 2000
Gladiator," An epic masterpiece that lives up to the hype.
","`Gladiator' is one of those rare blockbusters that actually lives up to the hype.  Produced in the mold of old fashioned Hollywood epics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra and Spartacus, this film was every bit as spectacular as they used to make them in the heyday of the studios.  With a lavish budget and an eye for detail, director Ridley Scott (`Alien', `Blade Runner', `GI Jane') combines the splendor of ancient Rome (brought to life in stunning detail through awesome, computer generated visual effects) with a human story of gripping intensity, to create one of the most complete entertainment experiences I can remember in quite some time.The story involves the fall from grace of Maximus, a famous general of the Northern Army whom Marcus Aurelius favors over his own son for succession to the throne.  When Marcus dies before making this wish known, his son Commodus is elevated and orders Maximus killed.  Maximus escapes his executioners, but is taken as a slave and turned into a Gladiator.  This sets up a dramatic confrontation between Maximus and Commodus in the Roman Coliseum.This is an ingenious meld of fantasy and reality that plays fast and loose with historical fact.  Marcus Aurelius was, in fact, a roman Caesar during the period in question.  His portrayal as a kind and thoughtful leader was accurate.  He would come to be known historically as the `Philosopher King' and the `Benevolent Dictator'.  He was also a great military leader and conqueror.  Commodus was altered considerably from historical accounts, but the essence of his evil and egocentric personality was well represented. By historical accounts, Commodus was fair and blond.  He was not the sniveling brat who avoided battle as he was portrayed.  In fact, he fought by his father's side for the last five years of Marcus Aurelius' life.  Nor was he passed over by his father for succession.  Marcus was proud of Commodus and named him Caesar at the age of five.  He publicly named him as his successor at seventeen.It is universally accepted that Marcus Aurelius died of plague in March of 180 A.D. and not as depicted in the film.  There is no historical record of any general named Maximus.  Commodus died in a carefully planned coup d'etat, strangled in his bath by a gladiator named Narcissus.  This is also at odds with events depicted in the film.Despite these inaccuracies, much of this film maintained a great deal of historical authenticity.  Commodus did indeed cease the conquering wars and focused on gaining favor with `the mob', a derisive term used by the Patricians to describe the masses.  He would give away food and other gifts and hold extensive games to keep them amused.  He was also wildly popular for personally fighting gladiators in the arena, just as depicted.  He was a ruthless dictator, who had numerous attempts made on his life, and he routinely had Senators and other enemies executed.  His was a reign of terror and debauchery that rivaled that of Caligula.The most impressive feat of historical authenticity was the computer generated views of Ancient Rome.  These were done in meticulous detail and consistent with what is know from records and ruins.  The costumes were also precise and authentic, as were the battle tactics seen in the opening battle.  This film brings Ancient Rome to life in a way that is more realistic than ever before.The story was a cross between the story of Commodus and the story of Spartacus.  Spartacus was a roman soldier who deserted and who was taken into slavery, later becoming a gladiator and then the leader of a slave uprising against Rome.  (For those who enjoyed `Gladiator' and have never seen `Spartacus' starring Kirk Douglas, I highly recommend that you dig it out of the rental stacks.)This film was a directorial masterpiece.  Though the battles were intense, the graphic violence was understated without losing effect.  Scott uses strobe photography to intensify the battle scenes rather than showing a great deal of gore.  Scott chose to emphasize the human story, binding us to Maximus emotionally through excellent character development.  This is a classic struggle of good against evil that turned the viewer into a devoted member of the Roman mob.  It is a story that hooks you and doesn't let you go.  Scott understood the importance of this and made sure that the human story didn't get lost in the spectacle.The acting was superb.  Russell Crowe is becoming bigger than life as a box office attraction, and with good reason.  His performance was awesome, offering both physical and emotional prowess.  Joaquin Phoenix was also deliciously evil as the self tormented Commodus.  This breakout performance for Phoenix is Oscar worthy in a supporting role.  At seventy years old, Richard Harris dusted himself off for yet another powerful supporting role as Marcus Aurelius.The sound on the DVD was excellent and it included an entire second disk of extras, including an interesting featurette on the making of the film.  It was enjoyable to have an opportunity to see another side of Russell Crowe. He always plays such dour characters that it is fun to see him continually mugging for the camera and telling jokes.  It is refreshing to see that after all the fame he has enjoyed, he doesn't take himself at all seriously.This film was off the rating charts.  I deducted two points for historical inaccuracies and still gave it a 10/10.  They don't make films like this anymore.  Don't miss it.",10,0,0,3 December 2000
High Fidelity," Worth seeing
","High Fidelity is an angst ridden narrative comedy about Rob's (John Cusack) bad luck with women.  His girlfriend Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle) has just dumped him.  This sends him into a hurricane of self-doubt and introspection about all the most traumatic breakups in his life complete with flashbacks of each of the top five.  While vainly trying to get Laura back, he contacts all the other breakup perpetrators in an attempt to exorcise the ghosts of relationships past.The film has plenty of funny moments and a high identification factor for single adults suffering through the dating scene.  Director Stephen Frears gives it a Woody Allenesque presentation and does it as well as if had been done by Allen himself.  Though there is not much that is original about the story, it borrows good techniques and ideas from various romantic comedy formats, and melds them together effectively.The biggest problem for me was the main character, Rob.  This was more the way he was written than the way Cusack played him, because I thought the acting was excellent.  Rob was seriously out of touch with his hand in his own demise, which made him seem like a jerk.  His rationalizations for relieving his guilt and sense of failure for past relationships made him a very superficial and hollow character, regardless of the sincerity of his self inflicted torment.  This inability for me to identify with the lead detracted somewhat from a story that was otherwise well done.John Cusack was terrific.  He was fabulous at licking his litany of self-inflicted wounds, and though I didn't fall in love with the character, his portrayal of this anguished lovelorn puppy was first rate.  Iben Hjejle was also very good as Laura, giving her a sort of dignified confusion as she tried to sort things out.This film was good and definitely worth seeing, but it didn't send me over the edge.  As is often true, the hype was overblown.  I rated it a 7/10. Add a point or two if you are single and you just broke up with someone.",7,0,2,4 October 2000
The Godfather," An enduring classic
","Often mentioned among the greatest films of all time (#3 on AFI's top 100), `The Godfather' brings us an intimate look at a Mafia crime family.  America has always had a romantic fascination with organized crime and this film takes us inside `the family' like never before.The script is nearly flawless.  The dialogue is engaging and emotional and the pace never lets up.  The story is mesmerizing.  The characters are so carefully and intimately developed that we can't help but get emotionally involved with them.  Though the violence is graphic and disturbing, it is never random or gratuitous and always has a direct link to a vital plot element.However, the appeal of this film goes beyond its great script to the characters and the actors who played them.  The ensemble has such amazing chemistry that it hard to imagine they are not actually related to one another.  They have such charisma that we fall in love with every member of this band of ruthless criminals, despite their moral decadence.  We come to understand that they are immoral by our standards, but not amoral, since they have their own codes of honor that they take very seriously.Though this was more of an ensemble piece than the sequels, two actors clearly stand out, namely Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Brando was already an established superstar at that point, although he hadn't had a meaty role in a few years.  His performance as Don Vito was powerful and commanding. Outstanding as he was, it was probably not his best performance (See `On The Waterfront', `A Streetcar Named Desire', or `Mutiny On The Bounty'), yet it is the one for which he is most famous.  Brando redefined our notions of the mafia patriarch from that of a ruthless dictator, to a shrewd diplomat who only wielded power when absolutely necessary.  He presented him as a potent but sympathetic character with a cunning mind and an astute understanding of the human dynamics of the other families.Pacino, in contrast, was a fresh face with only two films to his credit at that time.  Despite his lack of film experience, he delivered a tour de force performance portraying a complex character that required a great deal of range.  Michael Corleone starts as a goody two shoes and is ultimately hardened into a cold-blooded crime boss, with a touching romantic interlude along the way.  Pacino shined in every scene and established himself as one of the truly great actors of our time.Other standouts include Robert Duvall and James Caan, who was brilliant as the hot headed Sonny Corleone.  Caan's performance was raw, brutal and visceral, yet he somehow was able to render Sonny a magnetic and charming character with a strong sense of family loyalty.This film was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1973 and won three, including Best Actor for Brando and Best Picture.  It is one of the very few videos that I actually own.  It is hard to imagine that anyone born before 1982 hasn't seen it yet, but if you haven't, you should make it the very next film you see.  It is an utterly perfect 10.",10,1,3,8 September 2000
