Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Stylish, entertaining, but not Holms
","I personally don't like the interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. I think that Robert Downey Jr. does not fit for the role. Though he may be a good actor, he and Sherlock have different psychological types, I think. Besides, Guy Ritchie's style (too much kinetic, benny-hill-ish knockabout comedy) does not suit the noble, measured classic novels.There is nothing really special. Meanwhile the movie is pretty watchable, stylish, entertaining. It has many neat details, sometime proper atmosphere, sometime funny (not so often). It's worth to see it at least once. Just for entertainment. Some evening after some brain crushing hard work, you know, just for relaxation. At least it's not kill your brain by its stupidity as Sherlock BBC may do.",6,2,5,20 April 2012
Terminator Salvation," The movie isn't bad, but the screen script isn't good
","T1 and T2 were a shock each one, they had a strong dramatic impact (even with moderate special effects as in T1). And even today they are classic. But what is and has this movie? The movie isn't bad, it's watchable. There is good actors. But it also has a lame plot and isn't able to create a good believably story. Because the lame plot ruins its atmosphere. Alas. Many right things have been said by other commentators. I point just one total cliché that is most annoying for me. I'm saying about heart giving thing. The act of sacrifice, that was used in previous series, because of good plot which organic part it was, worked, was true and believable. In this movie it seems completely false, stupid and melodramatic. The authors trying convince us that there is a total war for survival of entire human race. And there is no donor-heart for dying leader (no cadavers, no severely injured in the permanent battle, no wishful donation from disabled man or woman, unfit for active service), except one from the allied cyborg with full human identity who one costs half of the whole resistance? And they dump him just for heart? Are you kidding? Or it's morally OK for director and the main auditory because he has too much artificial implants and couldn't be considered as pure blood citizen anymore and henceforth may be dead, nobody cares (the usual popular chauvinistic motive about second rate people in American movies)? «They killed Kenny! Bastards!»",5,0,3,11 November 2010
Event Horizon," I wonder why they say that it is Sci-Fi?
","What were good:1. The premise (or intrigue) was promising (alas, when «hell» was started all the sci-fi plot was spoiled).2. The entourage was moderately fine (except the Gothic EH-ship — it's ridiculous).3. Sometimes there is a mood.What were fishy:1. The crew behave themselves like a street gang (is it normal behavior on American special elite naval ships even today?).2. There was one guy flying in open space without spacesuit and still was alive (I am not kidding!).3. To appeal to «hell», «god» and other religious nonsense in the Sci-Fi movie is a fail (it means that writer has been totally bankrupt and spoils the plot and give us some (evil in the case) «Deus ex machina»). If such things occur in the Sci-Fi, they should be scientifically explained (like in the Solaris, f.E.).4. Almost every crew member in the crisis situation behaves him|her-self like a dumb. Think for a moment: You are in the space somewhere far, far away from the Earth, somewhere near to the Pluto. OK? And on the weird wrecked ship you suddenly see your boy or friend from the Earth, which beckon You to a dark corridor. Yeah, it's creepy. And what You would to do? Do You believe that it's really Your boy or friend? Well, members of our crew thought so. :)5. One guy was thrown away to the orbit by really huge explosion and come back with (sic!) opening one of air valve on his spacesuit. %)6. There was a broken (from inside) windows on the spaceship (can you imagine it?)7. When window was broken and it had started to suck the air out, our astronauts had overcome it by the force of their hands (yeah, that the old funny trick from Aliens, unbelievably cool! :) ).8. If my memory doesn't betray me, they travel from Earth to Pluto in about 56 days (It's really cool!).9. It seems that I forgot somethingAnyway, it's not what we call Sci-Fi.P.S. Actually, it left a some good aftertaste. And p. 2 should be canceled, because if to think a bit more the incident with exposure to open space should be somehow like that (may be with extreme swelling owing to ebullism, but the guy had finished here extremely damaged anyway). I've raised the rating.",6,0,2,16 November 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," Original, but the premise is a bit wooden
","Well, the story is not without originality (which we so lack in modern movies). But I wonder, isn't Freedom'n'Democracy mass-kills enough on regular basis to satisfy any possible evil gods? I mean, all the invasions under false pretext, bombing, insurgencies, etc. You know what I mean, just turn on TV news. All over the world for centuries now. Hundreds of thousands or even millions dead. Effectively slaughtered with effective modern hi-tech means of destruction.Makes the death of some other five guys any difference? Oh, really? Or, may be, that's because of just better qualities of them. Well, you know, something like that: one white American virgin costs some hundreds thousands of Arab (f.e.) men, women and children. Such currency rate on free hell-market. Huh? OK, if cast aside the excursus to the interesting phenomenon of popular consciousness (to be scared by simple fantasy, and turn blind on scariest reality), the film is pretty watchable. There is mood. The story develops well and is involving. Entertaining.So to reality: there is no god. All the regular mass killings we have seem ritual and are useless. Should we interpret the message of the movie in this way: trash all the smoothfaced sacrificers in firepot! P.S. That such girl is still a virgin is sad anyway. Something definitely wrong with the reality.",8,0,1,2 October 2013
