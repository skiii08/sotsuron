It," Don't take your kid to see this. Please.
","The performances are outstanding, the film is creepy as hell, but it has no idea how to end. It seems to drag on forever. Great group of kid actors! I'm sure some of these juveniles will be turning up in more films. The time setting (1988-1989) really works. But NOT a film for kids, despite the theme of overcoming ones fears.",7,2,4,25 September 2017
Dawn of the Dead," Astonishing...an awesome film which earns it's place in history independent of the original
","DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the most astonishing films I've seen recently. When I heard it was being re-made, I rolled my eyes. The original was fine, thank you very much. I missed the theatrical release, and just saw the uncut version on DVD. What makes DAWN OF THE DEAD so good is that at no time does it draw comparison to the original. Although the basic story line is the same, the style and interpretation is so different, that DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) earns it's place in history independent of the original. For a remake, that is unheard of. It's one of the best remakes I have ever seen, along with THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (2005). If you are curious about the WORST remake in the history of cinema, check out PSYCHO (1998). DAWN OF THE DEAD benefits from an outstanding cast, lead by Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames. The director, Zach Snyder, should be in the horror hall of fame for making such a great film. He seems to be a director more interested in action than horror, but he pulls no punches with the gore.",10,0,1,19 June 2005
The Terminator," A classic! Holds up well over time.
","Expertly paced, well-acted, and a true classic. An eighties sci-fi film that is as enjoyable today as when it was first released. Watching it today, Michael Biehn gives the strongest performance. He's passionate, sincere, and at all times believable. Linda Hamilton does a great job as Sarah Connor. It's hard to imagine anyone else in this role. See it. And see it again.",10,1,4,30 June 2019
Carrie," this film isn't even remotely dated
","Watching this film, some 43 years after its initial release, is a revelation. It's well made, superbly photographed, and features a stellar, phenomenal cast. Piper Laurie, lured out of retirement after 15 years, is amazing as Margaret White. She looks too young to be Carrie's mother (the producers originally wanted Joan Fontaine, a good dozen or more years older than Laurie). But Laurie's performance is outstanding. She has so many memorable lines, some that I still quote to this day. 'Pimples are the Lord's way of chastising you.' Sissy Spacek puts 110% into her portrayal of Carrie. William Katt is a shining star who, amazingly, never got another role he could sparkle in like this one. Amy Irving play the level-headed part, understated for maximum sympathy. P.J. Soles is delightful, and it's clear why Carpenter was thrilled to get her for Halloween (she was a bigger name than Jamie Lee Curtis at the time). Nancy Allen is unforgettable as Chris. Sydney Lassick and Pricilla Pointer both put in good work in their parts. And John Travolta, in a part only slightly larger than in The Devil's Rain, gets second billing...lol. Check it out!",10,1,3,29 June 2019
Godzilla," Impressive, very well done, faithful to Toho
","It's refreshing to see a Godzilla movie that takes its subject seriously. GODZILLA 2014 is an impressive work by a director who clearly wanted to pay tribute to Toho Studios original creation. Having said that, Godzilla isn't in the film all that much. But he looks realistic and is the Godzilla we know and love. This is one of the few films that actually lives up to the expectations set up by the trailer. There are two other creatures in the film, as well as a few human characters. It's not often I see a film where 'big Hollywood special effects' as balance with a good, solid, well-told story. Kudos to all involved. This is a Godzilla film to remember.",9,1,4,19 June 2014
