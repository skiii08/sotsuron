It," Awesome Movie
","This is a much better IT then the 90 version and that one was a good movie and still is. This is a much more gory movie and ramps up the horror aspect to a closer way as horror movies should be. The two problems with the movie is that the horror and gore could have still been ramp 'IT' up higher ( I say that for all horror movies though). The second is that is was only 2D. 3D would have been so much better, there were two scenes that would have been really good in 3D.",10,6,15,10 September 2017
