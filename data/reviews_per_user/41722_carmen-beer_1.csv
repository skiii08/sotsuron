Marie Antoinette," Unique vision of Versailles by Sofia: a bubblegum dream
","I liked the movie, it's a not masterpiece, but it is definitely memorable.First, the photography is beautiful, there really are some beautiful shots. The soundtrack somehow fits perfectly. Kirsten Dunst is amazing in the part and the actor that does Louis Auguste is really good too. Though many people felt the plot was empty, I kinda liked that. It's true, nothing major happens and changes M.A's whole life, except at the beginning when she is forced to become the future queen of France and abandon Austria and her family. Sofia dared to write a script which escapes from the obvious ones, where everything that happens is calculated , so that the average audience is satisfied and doesn't complain about seeing something that 's different. In this film, you really feel the boredom of her life, and how she felt trapped in this little world outside reality that was versailles. I liked the fact that the picture only focuses on Versailles, and nothing else. It's not a historical, political movie. It's a bubblegum vision of the palace. Also, I really enjoyed the pop touch added to the life in Versailles, with the champaign, the candy, the card games, that did not affect the spectator's belief in the truthfulness of it all, something that ''A Knight's Tale'' couldn't possibly achieve. I give it a 7 because, for me, an 8 is already a very good movie, But it's simply a GOOD movie.",7,0,1,19 March 2007
