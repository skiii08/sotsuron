The Avengers," Good! But not worthy of Top 250...
","I saw 'The Avengers' due to the constant praise and elevated status in the 'Top 250 Films of All Time.' When those final credits rolled and the short sequence ended which promises a sequel, I was thinking. Storyline: Amazing, Acting: Amazing, Action: AMAZING! Well then why did I sit back with a big 'meh' ? Every aspect of this film was perfectly executed yet for some reason it lacked that absolute WOW factor for me. That final touch that makes a good movie into a great movie. Perhaps it was the constant humour instigated into the story which by the way were hilarious, that possibly was overdone and seemed to ruin the movie a bit for me. At times it felt like a bit of a joke to me, which left me cackling endlessly but evidently shaking my head at how they could do this. I just lacked the ability to take this film seriously at times. However immediately giving 'The Avengers' a 6 or even 5/10 I realised that it did what it did perfectly, and although I didn't get what I wanted out of it, and the fact that it didn't live up to my expectations, doesn't make it a bad film. In fact looking back it was quite the contrary. I enjoyed it, and it is most likely that you will too. If I had of gone into it with an open mind I would of loved it, and I intend to do that on my second viewing. However I recommend that you definitely see 'The Avengers' as it certainly is a good and entertaining film, definitely Marvels Best! Just enjoy the film and you will laugh and gasp at its perfect execution of action that at times puts CGI to its test. I look forward to a sequel and a second viewing of this.8/10",7,1,4,4 May 2012
The Hangover Part II," Good sequel with plenty of laughs !MINOR SPOILERS!
","I had heard many negative things about the 'Hangover Part II' however nonetheless I went and saw it in cinemas 2 weeks after release. The first thing that hit me was the similarity it has with the first one. It starts off with the phone call from Phil telling their friends at the wedding that they really 'f***ed up this time.' From there it follows the same course that the first one did however this didn't affect the quality of the film too much. I believe the story and 'twist' was much smarter and thought out than the first one. However some things such as the quality of the acting, repetitivity and things that just didn't make sense, really brought down the rating from a potential 8 to a 6. Yet this is a must see for all that watched the first one and hopefully Todd Phillips can give us a different and equally funny conclusion to this Trilogy. Story - 7, Some minor loopholes but a fantastic twist in the end. Screenplay - 6, funny but very similar to the first. Cinematography - 7,gives a great perspective of Bangkok and was the high of the film. Acting - 5, Not as good as the first one and at times very unrealistic especially with characters Phil and Stu.In conclusion 'The Hangover Part II' lived up to expectations but was somewhat downgraded to a 6 due to some unrealistic acting, minor loopholes and repetitivity from the first film. I look forward the third and (hopefully) final chapter in the hangover series and I am interested in seeing where Todd Phillips will take 'three best friends' next time.",6,0,0,19 June 2011
