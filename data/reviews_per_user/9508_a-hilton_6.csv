Blade Runner 2049," Sci-Fi hits a new all-time level
","I agree pretty much with the positive reviews and here is why I disagree with the negatives reviews I have read: The movie did not feel slow at all and held my attention throughout. Maybe it is good to have some things at a slow pace because that helped to make this film beautiful and intriguing. It's a masterpiece of cinematography and deserves to be studied. Ryan Gosling is a flawless, perfect casting. Harrison Ford also puts in an excellent performance as do the rest of the cast.I watched the original Blade Runner again before I saw this and found it useful in putting some of the new story into context. But as much as the original was ground-breaking when it first came out, it now looks dated and a little disjointed. The new film does not disappoint. It is just as ground-breaking in pushing forward new boundaries for Sci-Fi and leaves enough questions for the audience to use their imagination, so making it an interesting story.",10,2,9,11 October 2017
Wind River," Enjoyable but Flawed
","Four of us watched this together after which we had a fairly balanced dissection of the film including the role of women in the film. Although it (just) passed the Bechdel test there was a needless shot of bare flesh as titillation yet the background story is supposedly focused on the injustice towards native american women. Indeed it states this misleadingly in the ending credits whereas the film is actually told from the point of view of the hunter played by Jeremy Renner. 
Also it seemed that the FBI agent, played by Elizabeth Olsen, was inserted as the female interest in much the same way that the director used Emily Blunt in Sicario. 
So even though we felt the film misrepresented itself, the central story was still very interesting and compelling to watch.",6,1,4,6 July 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Unique and Entertaining
","Three Billboards is the sort of film that you wish you had stumbled upon by accident, which turns out to be a gem, which you can then urge other people to watch. However the annual awards hype around Three Billboards had just started to gather when I went with my partner to see the film. Yes it richly deserves praise but I also hope it is not over-exposed and over-analysed via the publicity of the Oscars.Anyway we both thoroughly enjoyed it - the story is fresh and the script is superbly written and acted. It is a wonderful study of characters, emotions and consequences with all the actors, particularly McDormand, Rockwell and Harrelson, at the top of their game. The behaviour and dialogue manage to hold a fine line between being shocking yet hilarious, while maintaining the gravity of the underlying story.
I hope it's a great surprise for you too !",9,2,5,24 January 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Could have been much better
",I confess I am not an Avengers fan having missed much of the franchise since Iron Man. However as preparation for my trip to the cinema to see Endgame I thought I would catch up on the story by watching Infinity War and Ragnarok. I actually enjoyed both of these a lot more than Endgame. It promised to be quite a spectacle and the scale of the action sequences didn't disappoint. Some of the personal stories of the characters were also introduced quite well into the film. However unlike the simpler story lines of the previous two films as mentioned I think they tried just too hard with Endgame. Too many pieces of the plot thrown into the story just made it overwhelming and took the shine off what would otherwise have been a good conclusion.,5,3,5,2 June 2019
1917," My thanks to Sam Mendes for a fantastic piece of work
","It is easy to give this a perfect score - a hugely enjoyable piece of theatre that I couldn't fault and which was made for watching on a big screen. It was an extraordinary piece of work and all credit to those involved in putting it together.
I thought the film got the balance between the narrative, action, drama and emotion just right.I will add a footnote on my frustration with trailers however which fortunately I didn't see for 1917. The trailer for this film apparently gives away some of the vital plot points which will spoil it - in fact I try hard to avoid any trailers of films I am interested in seeing. I know they tend to be put together by the marketeers rather than the directors which is a real shame when they reveal too much.",10,0,2,28 January 2020
Joker," The Anti-Superhero
","An incredible performance by Joaquin Pheonix who expertly brings to life a character that was very difficult to like yet is compelling to watch.The story nicely flows through the key events in the Joker's life that drive his insanity and make him question his place in a dystopian world. We feel pity for him, we feel the injustice and we squirm knowing there will be a consequence to his anger.While the film neatly introduces the threads to the Batman story it can also stand alone as a story of human suffering. It's a tough story but the characters and narrative make it very enjoyable film to watch. It is the anti-superhero film without gadgets and without gimmicks.",8,2,4,19 October 2019
