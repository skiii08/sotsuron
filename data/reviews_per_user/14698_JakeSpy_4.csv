Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," After the hype has passed, this film falls flat.
","I have cogitated on this film since May, wondering where to place this film in the Star Wars canon.  This film undeniably set the standard for visual effects and sound design, much like A New Hope did in 1977.  There is no denying the technical accomplishments of this film.  For many, it is this technical accomplishment that is used to judge an entire film.  The pod race is perhaps one of the most exhilarating race sequences to ever be put on film, and the lightsaber duel with Darth Maul certainly has energy.  From beginning to end the film is full of visual 'treats.'
That said, Episode I ultimately has to have more to be a good film.  A New Hope had more with its epic feeling, ominous star destroyers and sleek x-wings, the presence of Darth Vader who makes an impression from scene one, and the archetypal, mythical appeal of Luke, Obi Wan, Han Solo, and Leia. And this all from episode IV--in medias rez.  Episode I should be all that more compelling having such a complete future already established.  Obi Wan and Anakin inspired no such feelings and neither did any other character. We all know the ultimate realization of these characters, but they play flat and unrealized in spite of what we know they will become.  Not a good start for a film series.The story also falls short.  There is no clear conflict and the villains are laughably ineffective.  Darth Maul is only a villain because he opposes the Jedi, but there is no development of why he should be considered a villain. Stripped of a few battles, there is no conflict and no solid, developed explanation for why they are fighting (Yeah, yeah, yeah I know about the Trade Federation blockade and such nonsense, but that is a thin veil for lacking conflict).  The main problem is that Episode I is working too hard at being the prologue to Episode II and not enough at being its own movie. We get too much foreshadowing and setting up for events to come (which makes the die hard fans giddy with moments of realization but makes for a shallow film).  Despite its interconnectedness with future and past films in a series, this film needs to hold its own and it does not.",6,0,1,2 March 2000
The Patriot," Films are not history . . .
","I have grown weary of people who bash films for historical inaccuracies, as if to suggest all films are meant to serve the same purpose as history books.  I am even more amazed at how when someone likes a movie they conveniently forgive historical revisionism (Titanic or Saving Private Ryan anyone?).  Much of the criticism against The Patriot is leveled not at the film, but at the history the film supposedly presents.  The filmmakers made it very clear to reasonable people that they had no intention of making a historical film.  They changed the main character's name to avoid confusion, they intentionally kept most real historical figures of the American Revolution at a distance.  History is not always good storytelling, but good films always are about good storytelling.  Basically, nowhere in the film itself is there any suggestion that it should be viewed as or aspires to be a history lesson of any kind.  That being said, people can debate the merits of the real actions of the real Francis Marion and the cause of the real American Revolution until they are blue in the face, but it has nothing to do with this film.  Suspension of disbelief is a big part of any filmmaking endeavor, and when a filmmaker wishes to bypass that mechanism it is pointed out to the audience (Schindler's List for example).  Yet storytelling still prevails even in the most historically accurate films as most filmmakers will attest.  The Patriot is not such a film, it is intended to entertain, not educate, and that is just fine--we need both types of films, just as much as we need people who can tell the difference.The Patriot is a truly remarkable achievement considering the last film from this producing/directing team was Godzilla.  The film is centered and held together by Mel Gibson's performance which is certainly his best to date. Still, much credit is due the cinematographer, director, screenwriter, and editor for being able to take melodrama to such high levels.  There are many characters here and their inner-struggles are brought out. Benjamin Marten's character is most compelling in that he is not so perfect--he makes mistakes, has regrets, and is still dealing with his temper.There is no pretense in this film--it does not 'reinvent the wheel,' but never claims to either.  It is just a film that gives us some great characters, a compelling story, and solid delivery.  In the end (at least for those of us who leave our baggage about PC historical accuracy at the door) we are well-rewarded with a solid film that pays off more than most.",9,0,2,28 June 2000
Titanic," Years from now, people will look back and wonder why.
","Why did James Cameron go to so much trouble making a film that presented the physical and visual dimensions of Titanic and take the human dimensions on a fantasy-romp of titanic-sized contrivances? There are enough historical documents and memoirs about REAL people on that ship who had REAL lives and some were actually very compelling.  So why did Cameron opt to give these REAL people bit parts and invent two shallow characters? 
Good acting and high production values go a long way to cover up a poor script, and Titanic is proof of that with the Oscar frenzy that surrounded it (However, it was the first film in a long time that did not earn a screenplay nomination and won best picture).  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet both did excellent jobs acting as did Gloria Stuart and Kathy Bates. They all deserved an Oscar in light of what they had to work with on the page.  How conventional, shallow and contrived does this sound?  Rose is in what is for all intents and purposes an arranged marriage, but she is really a free spirit ready to fly away from her upper-class roots.  If it wasn't for her darn mother.  Now to make this issue even more clear, her fiance is controlling and abusive.  The decision is clear.  She has to fall for Jack, a fellow free spirit who shows her real love.  Alas, Jack must be symbolically sacrificed so she can avoid being drowned in her life and truly find freedom in the new land.  Not only are the mechanics of the script clear, but the story is old and tired.  Titanic works because it plays on stereotypical conventions and latent emotions; it does not earn its emotional climax on its own merit.  This subject has the opportunity to be so much more genuine and powerful if only someone had taken the time to look beyond fictional romance and into true life tragedy.",Null,17,29,25 March 2000
Heat," Lost among the giants, HEAT is vastly underappreciated
","I must admit that when I first saw Michael Mann's HEAT I was not too impressed.  However, now that I have had the chance to watch it again on DVD (twice this week), I am struck by what Mann, Pacino and de Niro have accomplished.  HEAT capably juggles many characters and situations.  It resists the temptation to go for melodrama.  Mann gives us characters and lets their lives play out on the screen.  The opportunities for extended weeping and the emotional trappings of long soliloquies are resisted even though opportunities are ample, especially when the film delves into the relationships of the characters.  The film also has confidence enough to meander through the lives of its characters--in and out of the main plot. It is a masterful case study not of crime and action, but of the lives of the people who inhabit these lifestyles as 'cops and robbers.'  Pacino and de Niro both shine in the character-types they do best--Pacino over the top, borderline maniac and de Niro as the cool and confident man of action. But it all comes down to the observation made in this film that there is no difference between these two characters on opposite sides of the law.  In fact, the de Niro character seems more admirable than Pacino's much of the time.  HEAT could easily run ten hours, and it is admirable that Mann was able to condense this film down to just under three hours and still cover the ground he does (I would love to see an expanded cut of this film). Finally, this film looks good--from cold blue nights to amazing action sequences.  One of the best films of the 90s.",9,0,0,25 February 2000
