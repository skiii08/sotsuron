The Hangover," *Much* more painful than having a hangover
","Like our intrepid protagonists, I think somebody drugged me before seeing the Hangover. This is the only possible explanation for why I found this movie so terrible while critics and audiences alike seem to rave about it. There were maybe two funny jokes in the entire movie. In between the offensive portrayals of minorities, women, and gays, the screenwriters managed to fulfill every 12-year-old boy's supposed fantasies: heart-of-gold strippers, hijinks with a tiger, a painfully unfunny Mike Tyson cameo, and the egregious use of tasers, among other overused tropes (Tyson aside). I'm guessing the director thinks that because the audience has in the past enjoyed scenes with tasers, the mere use of them in the movie instantly makes them funny. Not so.What this movie lacked was everything that a successful film possesses: likable (or at least sympathetic) characters, some semblance of a realistic (or at least internally consistent) plot line, and an ending that satisfies (or at least relieves) the audience's journey. Instead, we get four unsympathetic, idiotic, unfunny characters. The conceit of piecing together a drunken wild night out could be funny - could be - but none of the jokes are funny.",2,12,28,30 June 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," As good as Episodes 4, 5, and 6
","First, let me start by saying yes, much, much better than Episode I it was. Where Menace was overindulgent in its special effects, cheesy characters (Jar Jar, anyone?), and chunky dialogue, Clones was much more character-driven. In addition, the largely reduced roles of the Digitally Animated characters led to a movie that felt much more like Episodes 4-6.I won't bother explaining the plot  you'll either already know it or won't want to, but rest assured, it's a doozy. By far the most memorable battle in all of Star Wars occurs at the end of the episode, and the Midnight showing I went to had fans wildly cheering throughout the battle. If you're a fan of Star Wars, this battle is everything you've wanted to see. Yoda also gets by far his largest role in any of the films, and he even kicks a little butt.Haydn Christianson was quite believable as Anakin, and he definitely portrayed the internal anger well. Natalie Portman was surprisingly flat as Amidala  she's usually the best actor in any movie she's in, but I thought both Christianson and Ewan McGregor, reprising his role as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi, were better. Jar Jar Binks was actually likeable  yes, likeable  in his role as an assistant to the now-Senator Amidala.The plot explains a lot of the origins of what you see in Episodes 4-6  the death star, the storm troopers, the rise of the Emperor  but it was also slightly confusing. Just which side is the good side, anyway? If I have any complaint with the movie, it's that exactly what makes it so exhilarating is also what makes it so flat. The huge digitalized battles were awesome to watch, but they were much less personal than the smaller battles of 4, 5, and 6. You never saw armies of thousands fighting at once which makes it hard to understand why the battles would be so much smaller later on.Nevertheless, this movie is definitely up there with the best of the Star Wars series, and will go down as a much, much more satisfying encounter than Episode I.",8,0,0,16 May 2002
