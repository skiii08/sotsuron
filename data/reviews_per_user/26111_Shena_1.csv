Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Treat For Fans of Fantasy!
","People have analyzed, dissected, chewed up and regurgitated the movie so many times that the last thing you probably want to hear is another review. Despite all the critics, for the average movie-goer who wants to be entertained this is as good as it gets!!! Come on people, this movie never professed to have the answers to all the questions in the universe - it was meant to rekindle the Star Wars spirit we felt when we were kids and introduce The Force to a whole new generation. So loosen up - watch the movie - and you'll be in for the ride of a lifetime!!!",10,5,7,14 June 1999
