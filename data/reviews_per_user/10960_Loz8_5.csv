The Ring," Perturbed, Disturbed, Curiosity Uncurbed
","After having gone to see 'The Ring' on Friday night, I decided to see if other people felt the same I did about the movie, and hoped to find some answers to the many questions I had to ask. I was not disappointed opinion-wise, contrasting and contradictory opinions litter the comments board. But answers I found none. Similar confusion? Plentyful.
I was overall both incredibly impressed and slightly disappointed with 'The Ring'. It disturbed me immensely, more than most horror/thriller films even come close to doing. The cinematography, direction, sound effects, acting and soundtrack were overwhelmingly effective and left me feeling chilled. I got my money's worth of scare factor, that i know for sure. Many people have said that this film bored them, or didn't frighten them, and I have to ask - were they watching the same film, did they have earplugs or am I just easily perturbed?
I don't know whether to be impressed or disappointed with the unfinished/unpolished sense I get from the plot of the film. It is a clever marketing ploy that you spend that much time ruminating over the powers of Samara. I, for one, have spent the past few days thinking carefully about why there were so many plotholes that need to be filled. They could so easily have made everything clear, but that would have made the film less powerful, memorable and interesting wouldn't it?I understood the ending perfectly, I think. I cannot see why anyone would be confused by the ending, but maybe I have missed something along the way. I ask myself questions about everything else in the film, but not the conclusion. I do wish it had ended the first time it appeared to, and not the second, but found the real conclusion to be just as satisfying intellectually. I suggest this film if you wish to be frightened and can easily suspend disbelief.",Null,0,0,17 November 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Wonderfully Imperfect
","I went to see Lilo and Stitch yesterday. Let me tell you straight off, it was worth the admission fee. Every single cent. I was amazed at just how different, refreshing and enchanting this film was. It is not only set in a location never used by Disney before but has a style of animation that is not only beautiful but interesting. There are no perfectly proportioned faces or bodies, even in the humans. I'm not going to say that the characters look realistic, but they are a lot more realistic than Snow White and Belle in their simple imperfection. 
There are no Disney musical numbers, not typical ones, anyway, and this seemed right. It would have been disheartening to grow to understand, perhaps love these characters and then see them launch into a verse of 'a whole new world'. From the beginning you could tell this was not going to be a normal Disney film. Apart from the straight-to-video release of 'Buzz Lightyear', this was Disney tackling something they had never done in a film before. Extra Terrestrials. These new characters and characterisations are astounding. Hilarious. Well crafted and well executed. Who wouldn't be scared of the Captain voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson (seriously, you should hear that man roar...  it is terrifying). Who wouldn't find Stitch (Chris Sanders) offensive yet funny?
I thought the voice acting was brilliant and I am very impressed with Lilo's voice artist Daveigh Chase who has also done the voice of Chihiro in the American dub of 'Spirited Away'. The animation is beautiful. I have never been to Hawaii, but now I have a determination to go. The backdrops, the characters, the way they move. It is all unique to this film. The storyline is well developed, simple to understand and the themes surrounding it are obvious. Love. Friendship. Family. Community. No-one gets left behind. These are integral to the spell which Lilo and Stitch casts on you whilst watching. I didn't look at my watch once, and even if I'm enjoying a film, I usually do. The film follows Lilo and her sister Nani as they try to keep their family together whilst contending with not only interstellar nuisances but social services authority, Mr Bubbles (Ving Rhames). I won't give any more away, because, let's face it. Everyone else has anyway. I didn't think I would say this about a Disney feature again, what with half-thought-out sequels being released every which-way, but this film deserves 10/10. Go buy your ticket today!",Null,1,1,3 October 2002
Spirited Away," The Spiriting Away of Loz
","I can quite honestly say I had never actually watched an Anime film before going to see 'Spirited Away'. I can honestly say that I must have been crazy! What have I been missing out on? Why have I been subjecting myself to Disney drivel, when absolutely breathtaking animation films are coming from Japan? Of course the English/American dubbing of 'Spirited Away' was actually a Disney venture, using actors that have provided voices for Disney films before Daveigh Chase in 'Lilo and Stitch' and Jason Marsden in 'A Goofy Movie'). I was generally very impressed with the voice acting, however after a while Daveigh Chase's high pitched tones started to grate on my nerves, distracting me from the greater good. Jason Marsden was perfect as the mysterious boy Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette was brilliant as Yubaba & Zeniba.However the wonder of this film is all thanks to Hayao Miyazaki. He is truly an amazing Director and Writer! The story was multi-faceted. Every time you thought you had come to the end of a mystery, more layers were pulled back to reveal more mysteries. Characters are not what they appear, and what they are is too enigmatic to explain. There is a lot of humour in the film, and a deep well of emotion. I really found myself caring for Chihiro's well being, and hoped she would get back to her parents. I was completely sucked into the film. Even though, thinking back, all the things which happen in the film are confusing and complex, I never found myself bewildered or bored, as has sometimes been the case.
The animation was beautiful, the colours were used so well to accentuate every minute detail. The landscapes and buildings were incredibly realistic.
The music, however, is what really got me. JÃ´ Hisaishi did an amazing job putting the score together, it was haunting and beautiful, and suited the film very well. 
Well, I'm now off to go and raid the Anime section of my local video store... I wholeheartedly suggest going to see 'Spirited Away'!",Null,0,1,15 December 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," One word - Fantastic!
","To those who don't enjoy a story, that's full of action, adventure and glory, then don't see this film, and spend your quids, unless you have a bunch of kids. This is not to say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a children's film, but merely that if it is not your style (fantasy, action, light entertainment), you will most probably not like it.
I'm an eighteen year old woman (19 in 19 days surprisingly enough) and I enjoy the Harry Potter novels immensely. I'm an escapist, and the novels, and now the films provide me with an exciting and adventurous place to escape to. I was not disappointed with this film at all. I thought it not only lived up to it's predecessor (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) but surpassed it. There was more action in this film, but if possible, more character development. As Harry, Ron and Hermione go through the year we see them grow up. The direction and cinematography were wonderful. The landscapes, no matter how computer generated, were impressive. The action sequences were exciting, the special effects amazing. The acting was superb. All the actors were convincing, including the young main stars, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and I hazard to say, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. Jason Issacs as Lucius Malfoy was absolutely brilliantly evil. The words 'nasty piece of work' spring to mind. I did not think the film was over long, or too short. The beginning started amusingly. The ending perfectly rounded off the film.I suggest this film to anyone with a vivid imagination, whether a Harry Potter fan or not. They may not like it... but at least they would know what everyone is going on about ;)",10,0,0,28 November 2002
The Green Mile," Spectacular
","I was surprised and delighted with 'The Green Mile'. It set me on an emotional rollercoaster. The actors were amazing, especially Michael Clarke Duncan. I was wrapped up in their character's stories, and didn't need to suspend my disbelief at the miracles, it all seemed real. Someone mentioned that the good characters are portrayed as good and need to be rewarded and the bad as bad and need to be punished, but I didn't get that sense from the film at all. Is Del good or bad? He's on death row, so he can hardly be good, and yet he is rewarded with Mr. Jingles. Who can truly say if Percy deserves his fate? This has to be one of the films most covered in shades of grey I have seen in my life. I get a very anti-capital punishment feeling from it.Whilst I'm one of those people who usually complains at the length movies are getting these days (90 minutes if you're lucky), i did find this film overlong. I thought 30 minutes of the film could have been condensed.
Overall, i give the filme 4 and a half out of five.",Null,0,1,24 November 2002
