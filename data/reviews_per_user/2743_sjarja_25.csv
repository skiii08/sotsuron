The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," satisfied my expectations
",I liked this movie (although i seriously become annoyed by Hollywoods habit of splitting movies into part 1 and 2 like that!!!).It shows a lot more character development than the first 2 movies and explains more about 'the world' the hunger games are played in (for the people who did not read the novels) The effect of the propaganda movies is well done (a little blunt maybe but still well done) - and the replacement of politics and the escalation of the rebellion seemed believable.What i did not like too much is that the displayed districts 'felt' more like small stages than actual - well... countries (or states). But i guess there is only so much one can do in a movie. Also - i would have loved to see more action/reaction between district 13 and the Capitol to show that the conflict had entered exactly those stages where there were people actually fighting in the field and also fighting in the media - just as fiercely.Especially the reveal that the Capitol had been the architect of pretty much everything should have been a MUCH greater shock than it came across.,7,0,10,9 January 2015
The Babadook," reminded me that i really REALLY do not like kids in movies
","*sigh* What can i say... I am not a fan of the movie. What ruins movies the most for me is when the protagonists actually annoy me. That is not the same as the protagonists being bad/evil or twisted or anything. I mean ... actually annoying.The mother is an incompetent and emotional wreck, the son is annoying - bordering on mental illness (he does come across as mentally challenged but the issue is not addressed as it would be in 'real life'). Now i do not quite accuse the actors for it - but the story itself. However - i do accuse the kid for bad acting - and shouting nearly every line he has with three exclamation marks. - Which becomes really really tiring. Meanwhile the mother gives a perfect example of 'how not to do parenting'.. . She is a textbook case of incompetence.In a horror movie where one is meant to kind of hope for the protagonists to overcome and survive - well... the horror. - It is a really bad thing when the viewer hopes they die a horrible, painful and slow death. Well - i am being too hard on them, i admit. I do generally dislike kids in movies - and they do have to work extra hard for me not to dislike them. This child is not a good actor - and/or did not get good enough directions. The mother and the supporting cast are alright - but quite one dimensional.The main factor about this movie though ... : Is it scary?Well - i think it might have been... but for me the annoyance with the protagonists well overweighed any sense of dread or suspense.",3,5,13,15 October 2015
Knives Out," very enjoyable
","I watched this movie just recently .. and i was captivated. It is one of those movies that feels very condensed to one location. So the location needs to be exciting and varied enough.In terms of plot - it is the 'usual' clue/murder mystery. In terms of storytelling, there is a lot of flashback (some right, some wrong) and the accompanying interrogation.The characters are for the very most part interesting and very well acted (although they do portray strong character stereotypes - so not too subtle) - but the chemistry and likability/or dis-likability .. is that a word? .. is quite well done.While the plot is straight forward, it quickly gets more complex - morally as well as technically .. but never so convoluted that one is not able to follow it anymore.conclusion: i can fully recommend this movie. Due to the nature of it (being a murder mystery) .. it is not suited for re-watching though.",7,1,2,31 December 2019
Hot Fuzz," so much fun!
","This movie is a ton of fun. It is grotesque, it is surprisingly gory and also hilariously funny. The story is not too original but as a novel feeling about it.I particularly liked all the characters - each with their recognizable personality (exaggerated and comical - so not too deep of course) So far - i have yet to be disappointed by this Nick Frost, Simon Pegg duo.. hope they make more films like this.It must be said that i watched that movie on a video night, not in the theater - i am not sure how i would have liked it on the big screen. It certainly helped being with a bunch of friends being able to drink and laugh aloud - compared to sitting in a cinema relatively silent.",9,0,0,11 January 2015
The Others," I love this movie
","This is one great movie! - Considering i feel that way DESPITE there being two children that play a major role is even higher praise (for me ... because children in movies - and especially children in horror movies is usually a black mark destined to fail) I love the atmosphere, the plot as such - and the acting (hm - alright, everyone 'except' the little boy - who i wish had ha died a terrible and gory death, indeed) The movie does not step too deep into 'the usual' horror tropes - like bad communication, splitting up or pointless jump scares that result in nothing (usually during the first act of almost every horror movie).Nicole Kidman is great and i always love Christopher Ecclestone. Actually the whole cast is great (yes, even the boy - i am not annoyed at his acting abilities - but at what role he has to play as a character) I also liked the conclusion of the story - i am not sure if this 'twist' has been used before - but for me it was quite new, especially the 'tone' of it.I have just recently re-watched it (2017) - and the movie has aged incredibly well (of course mostly because it relies on atmosphere and acting, and only on very low key effects (which seem to be mostly practical - or off screen anyway) i can fully recommend this movie.",9,3,3,29 July 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," it made captain America much more likable
","Again a movie where i was kind of 'dragged' into by my friend. I was expecting to be not only bored but actually annoyed by it - mainly because off of all the A-list heroes, captain America is probably my least favorite...or has been.What can i say - i was not bored - and actually liked the character shortly into the movie. Captain America and Widow have a pretty good chemistry and work well on screen. A fair warning though to people like me - who have no or very little background knowledge about all the Marvel heroes.. There is not much explanation given. When i was in the theater - everyone seemed to know who hydra was or why they tried to infiltrate the secret service of America. It seemed like a big deal that was never explained.The only criticism i have is Wasn't that an avengers movie? They could have called more of them in. Ironman, Halk or the Arrowguy. Instead they had this man with the wings that did not feel like a real hero.Anyway - it was fun to watch - and i wouldn't mind watching it again on a video night.",8,0,0,11 January 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," it was OK - i guess?
","I am not a big Star Wars fan. In fact, i did not really want to see this movie - but was kind of pushed by my friend to join him.So - what do i think about it? It was watchable .. not a trainwreck but also not quite remarkable. There were tons of plotpoints that made no sense to me. And i dont mean Star Wars lore stuff (cause i do not know the lore) - i mean just things in the storytelling of this one movie.The last Star Wars movie i have watched was Rogue One .. and i was much, MUCH more impressed by that.Not much i can add to it. It was your run of the mill sci-fi movie. Still doesnt really make me want to watch more of those .. voluntarily.",5,3,12,29 January 2020
Oblivion," enjoyable
","This is a Tom Cruise movie - most and foremost. It offers amazing visuals (that you only get when you watch the movie on the big screen) .. and pretty good acting, which is expected of the cast - even if you do not like Tom Cruise much - you have to give him that he can do action and even drama reasonably well.The story is not so new though. Quickly - you can anticipate the conclusion - which does not make the movie worse much .. but of course it does take away fromt he surprise. (especially when you consider the movie Moon, not so long before Oblivion - well, not so long being 3 or 4 years i think) There are flaws in the story of course - flaws that are obvious when you think about it - but not so relevant when you just enjoy watching it - mostly due to the movies pace.Worth watching ... but it has little to no re-watch quality.",7,0,1,20 October 2016
Ender's Game," good, but could have been much better
","This movie kind of reminds me on the first Harry Potter movie. No, not for its story of course - but for its pacing. It feels like a rather disconnected series of scenes that were considered to be 'key' scenes - and that can only really be connected with the lore and meta-knowledge of the book.Characters in the movie are well acted - but lack depths and development. But not so much to be annoying. So it is a slight disappointment for such a big movie.I have to agree with some reviewers on the fact that this movie should have been split into two or maybe even 3 parts of 2 or 2.5 hours each. At no point did i become greatly immersed or did i start to care much about the characters - because all i got was flickers of their progression.Story-wise it reminded me on the TV series 'space above and beyond' - especially the ending. But the series did a better job getting immersed (of course, because it had so much more time to develop the characters) The movie is good - but one cannot shake the feeling that it could have been great ... if it had been more detailed and focused on the characters.",7,2,3,19 September 2015
The Lego Movie," love on second sight
","I love(d) Lego... they are among my fondest childhood memories. Even as an adult i consider Lego to be one if not the best children's 'toys'.It is exactly that which is addressed in the movie. - the way children use Lego and the way an adult might use Lego - and the movie does a great job displaying it.I have read plenty reviews that speak of the antagonist as being 'evil' - but personally i did not think of him that way. He was using Lego from a different point of view for a different purpose - but of course that prohibited the child to make use of Lego his way. There is a morality about creativity and joy in the movie of course - but most and foremost there is the very basic joy to create.Style and artistic creativity is well done, the mixture between CGI and stop motion is for the most part seamless.An easy 8/10 - i had a lot of fun watching that movie.",8,0,1,11 January 2015
The Conjuring 2," classic horror
","Classic is how i d call this movie. And that is not meant in a negative way. Story and progression is highly predictable if you a casual horror movie person - but it is the quality and pacing that makes this movie stand out.The acting is very good, not just for a horror movie - but all in all. The chemistry between the protagonists is interesting and never really stereotypical (much). - Or lets say - it is of course clichéd but in a good way. (hard to explain, cause i d usually consider a clichéd character a bad thing) The characters do act as expected in a horror movie - but do not come across like morons (like so many horror movie character come across) - What i liked very much was that the characters actually communicate with each other. - A feature that is used in just so many horror movies (that is the non-communication-factor) to actually make the story possible in the first place.Special effects and scares were well done.All in all - the movie is not really too scary (nothing you loose your sleep about) - but it is enjoyable and suspenseful. Highly recommended.",8,0,2,23 June 2016
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," surprisingly awesome
","i just watched that movie last night with friends (video night). i did not know anything about that movie before and so i had no idea what to expect.the story is of course a bit cheesy but the storytelling is a piece of art. these days one is rarely confronted with a truly new way of storytelling but this one is very unique - or at least i have not seen any other movie of that kind.it caused some nostalgia from old arcade games and a very fresh pace all throughout the movie. cool characters, cool effects - the entire package was totally worth the time.",10,3,9,11 November 2012
Big Hero 6," your average 'teenage hero finds his place in society' movie
","Enjoyable but without any surprises.The character designs are the wide eyed Disney CGI designs seen in Frozen, Tangled etc. . The setting itself is a futuristic .. well, lets say utopian city (not sure if it may not be dystopian, but i think it leans more to the utopian side).The story follows your stereotypical arc. Unwilling kid becomes hero, finds his place in society and a team, beats bad guy.The bad guy is a bad guy with a twist - a twist that is sadly never really explored much (probably because it is primarily a kids movie and i daresay a kid of the target age range is unlikely to complain about such things) The good guys is your typical 'nerdy' gang of people that are of course brilliant, rich and deeply caring for each other (especially the protagonist whom they seem to care for a lot more than i would have expected from the brief time they actually got to know each other) The bad guy is someone unsurprising that is shown a 'kind of motivation' for his actions - but the justification of the extend of his actions is hardly justified ... at all.However - even if the story seemed to have more problems than i d like to see in such a simple setup - the pacing and humor is well placed.It may sound a little harsh - but all in all - the movie was kind of forgettable. A time well spent ( not boring ) but 10 minutes afterwards - the rather bland characters popped out of my mind.The only thing that actually stayed was the idea of Japan and American culture (the good parts of it) merged together to become something quite exotic and amazing.",5,42,120,9 January 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," very enjoyable
","This was not the movie i went out to see yesterday. I was more in the mood to watch < Porco Rosso > in a small cinema. But because my friend messed up the dates, we ended up seeing this film.I did not expect much, because those hero movies are not my type much; but was positively surprised.While the story is quite forgettable or stereotypical, the characters were likable. The movie was well paced and i cannot say that i did not enjoy it.It is a typical popcorn movie where you can turn off your braincells...at least when you are not into the comic stuff, i guess - because my friend and various other people in the cinema seemed to see a lot more in the characters than i did.However from the point of view of someone who usually avoids action movies and hero movies - it is a good 7/10.",7,2,7,18 November 2014
Don't Breathe," worse the more you think about it...
","At first i liked it. The idea of 3 cocky burglers exploiting a blind but finding a terrible secret and then turning from the hunters to the hunted seemed nice.But the more i thought about the whole setup and how the movie staged those events - the more flaws.. deal-breaking flaws popped up.The most problamatic flaw of the movie is the chemistry between the three protagonists. Or rather - the absence of any. It feels very strange how those 3 fit together, how they seem to be friends (?) or how they trust each other enough to pull off those heists. The movie presents the viewer with some sort of motivation for the female lead to go on those break ins (which is greed/or breaking out of poverty) - but all that is blatantly stereotypical and also needless.Then there is the actual execution of their big plan to raid this blind mans home. A plan so flawed and idiotic that one has to wonder if those three spend any thought on planning the event. A little bit of information gathering and intel - which cannot be that hard to come by, considering the nature of the man they attempt to raid, - would have gone very far. Furthermore a neighbourhood that seems perfectly fine with several gunshots fired in the night seems rather special. Gunshots are very loud .. and while i can understand that the sound gets muffled when fired within a big house - quite some shots were fired outside. To make it short - had they spend even a minimal amount of time scouting the premise - they would have found out that.<ul><li>the guy lives alone and has no house keeper - that means he must go shopping by himself - meaning that he would be away for quite a long time, leaving the house unattended during the day (you know, when its bright outside)</li></ul>Not only would they have been surprised by a watchdog, but they could have dealt with the heist easily. That is especially odd, since they seemed to do the other break ins when the owners were out - during daytime. So one has to wonder ... why would they do this ones home at night - while the owner is at home?Then there is the problem with the blind man. I can understand that he is a tough guy alright. I can also understand that he may move with quite some certainty in his own home. BUT .. his own home is a wreck. What a blind person needs most is to have his all his stuff in its place to be able to navigate securely. Not only is the house way too run down and stuffed full of garbage. But he also moves too fast. We briefly see him rush to around to lock the house down - which he does reasonably fast. But there are scenes where he seems to move from the basement to the upper floor in what feels like an instant. Well - i could go one and on with plot holes - but the point of it is... the more you think about it the more infuriating the story becomes. The old guys motivation is creepy and scary enough - and a great foundation - but the protagonists were weak and the whole setup rather lame. I would give that movie a 5/10 for being just about average. It is not a great disappointment - but it certainly is not a breathtaking revelation.",5,3,8,16 October 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," a little disappointed, but on a higher level
","I went into that movie with higher hopes. I was not hyped, but i had heard more good than bad about it. I was also in the mood for an action film that evening.Now how can i say it without sounding overcritical... . The action sequences are good, but pretty much standard for high budget movies these days i think.The alien design is one aspect that i disagreed with. Comparing the possibilities today (meaning CGI and near unlimited creative freedom) the alien design was outright mainstream/boring.The two protagonists were fine. Tom Cruise did an average acting job (average as in - what he usually does) and the supporting characters were alright but a bit flat and/or stereotypically one dimensional.Aside from Cruise - there was very little character development present (which makes sense considering the nature of the time-line) - and his development again ... was fine.The solution was another part of the movie i disagreed with. It was uncreative and felt like such plot solutions occurred in many movies before - and even more computer games (which the movie oddly reminded me on) All in all, i would give that movie a score slightly above average. Story and creativity is low, execution is well done - but most importantly, - it is not boring.",6,1,4,9 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," unbelievably disappointing
","When Lord of the Rings came into the theaters i was full of praise for how well the key parts of the book were translated into a movie. Of course i was a little disappointed even then about compromises that had been made that i considered important - but realized that for the sake of the story - most decisions were pretty much correct. Years later - and after the Hobbit part 1 and 2 - i was sitting in the theater watching part 3 - getting more and more annoyed.As predicted - making 3 parts out of a rather thin kids book was certainly not the best idea, but may have worked if some 'key' scenes had been unaltered. Especially the centerpiece of the last part, the actual battle, was just so different from the tale that it was not more than a very generic battle - been there, done that.The book has a certain atmosphere about the clashing of the armies that the movie failed to catch. The more important part - the struggle of the characters does not come across, the dialog feels very flat.For example - in the book - it is very well explained why the company of dwarfs supports Thorin even when he sinks deeper into madness - in the movie however they become 'background' - none of the dwarfs really has a significant personality - they are interchangeable at best - and irrelevant at worst. Oddly - even the visuals felt not even the same as the old Lord of the Rings movies - but worse. Choreography and camera dynamics were - well, not bad - but not better than average. For me - sadly - it was the biggest disappointment of the movies i really wanted to see.",3,12,22,11 January 2015
The Conjuring," very nice
","This is certainly one of the better horror movies of recent years. High production value, good acting and a classic story that still does not feel stale.Most of the suspense is very low key - with a few stereotypical jump scares every now and then. It could have done without most of those scares as the non jump scares are nice enough on their own.Of course the entire plot of the movie is kind of ridiculous. The entire house is so dark and kind of gritty that one has to wonder what the family did when they moved in. (usually i would expect a new house owner to cleanly paint the walls and install sufficient light... also to study the blueprints of the house so not to run into unexpected HUGE cellars or hidden compartments behind wardrobes.However - what i do like about the Conjuring movies is that the people talk to each other and do not fall for the most prominent horror movie cliché ... that is miscommunication.Also on a personal level - i love this 60s/70s look ... at least i think its that time era. It fits nicely - without all the technical gadjets. At least there is an excuse for blurred video and non HD pictures.In short - i really liked it...",8,0,0,14 October 2016
Wonder Woman," Despite mostly positive reviews - i was not impressed
","I heard a lot of good reviews about this movie - and how it might save the DC franchise.... but i cannot agree.The story was really, REALLY bad. While having a nice framework of 'who is good, who is bad', 'is men good or bad by design, innocent but manipulated by higher forces' etc. it gets lost in exposition, a rather scattered assortment of scenes and bad guys that are not memorable.A big disappointment was Ares - mostly because i could not look past seeing Remus Lupin from Harry Potter there. I do like the actor but his performance was weak, not at all menacing - not in a sense of godly power, nor in the sense of manipulating intelligence or even arrogance. He was just Lupin in a silly costume made of too much bad CGI.The setting of WW1 could have been good - if it had actually described WW1. The characteristic of the desolate no-mans-land, the stalemate and the human meat grinder was only really pointed out in a short scene - and then quickly forgotten. The rest could have been a stock WW2 battle, too.The movie itself had pacing issues in my opinion. It started with the childhood of wonder woman on her home island. At that point - the story was coherent and compact - with few but memorable characters. Once she left the island though...... the story began to dissolve into small scenes of quickly changing locations. There was no connection with the new characters (the members of the team), no connection to the village they 'liberated' - and the enemy side was just a bunch of weak villains.All in all ... i had more fun watching Batman vs. Superman ... and i did not really enjoy that very much either.It is a shame, because i think that Wonder Woman herself was well acted and done in that movie - only the story was bad (i have seen many MUCH better ones from the DC animated movie features in the past years - so i know they CAN tell good stories) - But a superhero is only as good as the villain they fight... and the villain was disappointing.",4,60,121,9 July 2017
1408," a good movie - for the most part
","This movie is enjoyable - but embarrassingly predictable. The acting was .... over the top. (to a point that it was rather funny) The pacing of the movie is its greatest flaw. Twists and turns happen at a time when it can not possibly be happening, considering the length of the movie - which renders those twists (unsurprisingly) pointless.There are some great scenes that reminded me on something out of a Lovecraft story - but all in all - it was a simple story of redemption.",6,0,1,29 July 2017
Lucy," standard but not beyond
","I was not bored during the show of that film - but not too excited either. The story is forgettable, the action is about as good as expected but certainly nothing special.The acting is kind of flat and did not motivate me to care too much for the characters. The idea of expanding the brain capacity and capability was something i did not like much - considering that it reminded me on that silly theory that 'humans only use 10% of their brain...' which is kind of rubbish - and has been proved wrong many times.Well, there are many better movies out there - but on a video night with friends (and alcohol) - it might do.",4,0,2,10 January 2015
Life," a 'realistic' space monster movie? sadly no
",I enjoyed it - plain and simple. Does it have plenty of plot holes? yes it does.The scientists - while not as moronic as the ones in 'Prometheus'(Alien) - do not seem to be the smartest ones ... driven by emotional decisions rather than scientific/logical ones. ... But it is not sooo bad as seen in countless other horror/monster movies.The Achilles-heel of many horror movies is the poor communication between the protagonists... something that for a positive surprise - does not apply here.However - the entire movie is 'decision-driven' as it is primarily a story about action vs. reaction. And so - the quality of the decisions make or break the movie. As said before - the decisions are not entirely bad - but they are also not good - and when a casual movie viewer get the feeling that those supposed-to-be much smarter people make one poor choice after another - the immersion breaks.So whats left is a good movie that could have been much better had the story allowed it to be.,6,2,4,3 July 2017
Moon," hidden gem
","First of all - i loved this movie.It is original (original enough anyway..) and a true science fiction movie. Not just some fantasy movie in space or so.Acting, sound design and visuals are spot on. Storytelling is done through acting and not some voice over - but the story itself is not really that complicated. What i really loved about the movie is that it avoided action for the sake of action (actually it avoided action completely) while never being drawn out or boring. But there are a few things that did not quite work in terms of logic.Considering the size of the cloning facility .. it is very unlikely that this concept of perpetual qualified work is more economical than to train someone else every 3 years. - Not only would it be terribly expensive to build what looked like a MASSIVE cavern beneath the base - but the whole effort to keep it secret seemed rather strange.If the 'excuse' was that the training was too sophisticated and expensive to do each 3 years. - Well .. it is kind of hard to tell what work Sam was meant to be qualified in. We do not see him do sophisticated stuff. Most of the base runs on autopilot - and he is not able to fix the live feed or circumvent the problems. (after all, they can still receive messages - so for a trained engineer - i do not think it would be an impossible task to build a sender strong enough to reach an earth satellite)However - those are just nitpicks that do not spoil the story or movie. And so i am happy to say it was a delight watching Moon.",8,1,2,2 July 2016
Warcraft," looks good, surprisingly OK-ish acting but confusing
","Well, i should say that i do not know Warcraft the video game. I know of its existence of course and i know it by name - but i never played it, nor did i ever learn about the story, factions and everything else.With that said - i should say that i found the story to be highly confusing. Most of the time i had no idea what was going on, who were the good or the bad guys.However - the movie looks good. It merges CGI and human characters surprisingly well (mostly by making the live action actors more cartoonish - in a good way) But is it a good movie? - i was not bored; but i did not understand most of it. -... sooo - yeah.",6,0,0,31 July 2016
Alien: Covenant," Ruined by stupid character writing
","I do hate to do that - but sometimes single character decisions CAN ruin the entire movie - because all the time you have to think back and remember how moronic the characters acted.So that movie - while actually being a good above average one - is ruined and utterly brought down by the character writing.After Prometheus - and the plentiful criticism about its scientists idiotic behaviour - i did expect a much 'smarter' crew in Covenant... just to be disappointed. And although they did not try to outrun a thin wheel by running straight instead of doing a single sidestep - or remove their helmets when confronted by an alien and unknown life form.... they did pretty much destroy the entire mission by making an irrational, emotional - and outright stupid decision by altering the course to investigate a planet - as if they were a scout ship, instead of a ship responsible for thousands of colonists.The bridge crew acted on a responsibility level of a drunk teenager.And it is that writing that ruined the movie for me, because it made me angry to see the plot unfold based on stupidity.On a more technical side ... the characters were too many to be properly introduced and experienced to really care about. In the first Alien movie, there was a small crew with mostly memorable characters - in the Aliens movie, there was a small band of marines that had VERY exaggerated personalities to remember them.Here we have a lot of 'red shirts' - and i did not care a bit for most of them being killed off.To conclude...Sadly - the new Alien franchise is still plagued by moronic scientists and their decisions. It does affect the enjoyment of the story and significantly ruins the fun of even a casual movie goer.The cinematography was good for the most part (except the melee fight scene that was cut in a very disorientating way ... and hence looked pretty bad) Acting was alright - considering the only character that had sufficient time dedicated was David/Walter.In terms of being a sequel to Prometheus .... i went out of the cinema with a feeling that the 10 years that Covenant happens AFTER the events of Prometheus ... were probably MUCH more interesting than this new crew of no bodies.all in all 4/10 - not recommended - but possibly still a 'must see' cause it is part of a franchise...",4,4,8,14 July 2017
