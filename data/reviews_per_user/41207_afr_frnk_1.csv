Ford v Ferrari," Absolute masterpiece.
","I am blown away by this movie. And feel like I must leave a review while it's still fresh.First off, I'm a tough critic. I want to love movies, but it's been years since I've watched one that I really loved. Then came F v F.... This movie is absolutely brilliant! From the acting to the cinematography, even the soundtrack and sound effects, everything is on point.I've always love racing, watched F1 and WRC when I was young, but didn't know much about Le Mans, let alone the story behind Ford and Shelby teaming up. The story line was captivating, the plot twists were unpredictable. The rivalry with Ferrari was palpable, yet being only a medium for a much deeper story. The paste of the movie is perfect, always leaving you wanting to know what's coming next. The dialogue is rich, the details, credible. It plunges you into the world of racing in quite a convincing manner, with technicalities and politics that doesn't overwhelm the audience. The performance of Bale and Deamon are outstanding, touching at times. You heard it, I almost cried...I don't know how factually accurate this story is, but I don't care. This movie is a masterpiece.",10,1,1,11 February 2020
