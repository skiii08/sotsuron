The Benchwarmers," Rob's changing persona, but its still melted cheese
","Not the greatest of movies, but then again Rob never tries to make out that he is the best actor around. Rob Schnieder is witty and clever in most of his movies, basically what you see is what you get with Rob Schnieder movies.At least in this movie he is not the geek or butt of all jokes, he is almost trying to be serious. Despite the cheesy script and naff jokes the movie survives on Schnieder trying to challenge himself, Lovitz and Spade adding with their comic talents and the other trying to be a geek.Don't take the movie too seriously but enjoy the comic moments and have a laugh. It is not that bad to be nominated for Razzie, although it will never win an Oscar. Just let your hair down and indulgent in the cheese.",6,0,0,12 October 2006
United 93," Absorbing and Humantarian Courage
","All I can say is that I have left the cinema full of emotion and frustration as I wanted to cry for the lives that were lost on this tragic but heroic day. This film may be controversial with reference to this event, but Greengrass portrays this historic day as a celebration of humanity and sacrifice against the war on terror. This has enabled me to understand the loss that USA has had to come to terms with and made me realise that London's loss last year was also significant and that we in the West need to make a unified stance against terrorism and ensure that we do not mix this up with war between Christanity and Islam. Religion is not the problem, but ignorance is.",10,1,2,2 June 2006
Hostel," Poor and Unoriginal Horror Flick
","Poor horror film that has no ingenuity and has a dire script. I was expected a gore fest in the same mould as Saw 1 and Saw 2 but this has no suspense and the storyline is so predictable that it becomes so ridiculous. A disappointment, not worth the Â£6 ticket.The only real beauty within the film were the two gorgeous girls that the backpackers met at the hostel.I can not believe that there has been so much hype about this film and for it's supposedly talented director/scriptwriter Eli Roth. I just hope that he does deliver the goods in his next films. Although he does deserve credit to the amount of cult success that he has achieved with his low budgeted films.",2,0,0,2 April 2006
Silver Linings Playbook," A beautiful small film that delights with splendid performances.
","After watching this film, you will be emotionally attached. It is in my opinion a drama comedy rather than a Rom-com. The story is well told and the performances from the four main characters excellent. Bradley Cooper at the beginning of the Oscar Season buzz was only rated as a short chance of a nomination. Well, I actually thought his work was well measured and his performance was strong. Jennifer Lawrence and De Niro were well deserved nominees too. But, in my opinion Jacki Weaver was a pleasure to watch as the mother of Brad's character. An understated performance who also deserved her nomination. Regardless if the film only managers to achieve a few Oscars. It was pleasant piece of work. Well directed and even Chris Rock had to act and not rely on comedy. The story was pleasing and showed the real nature of Bi-Polar disorder in a well informed manner and David O Russell has worked hard again. An excellent piece of work.",9,1,3,20 January 2013
Saw III," AN OK SAW movie
","Saw was outstanding and original. Saw II was interesting and effective. Saw III was gory but too messy! Saw as a whole is a good series of films that a nerve wracking and written with ingenuity, except for this latest addition. Saw III set the tone that it would be a gory film and it delivered but it's fault is that the storyline became too messy and at times convoluted. I feel that the scriptwriter try to add in so many add ons from the previous two films that it lost focus.Although as i stated earlier this film was gory and it did make me squirm at times in the cinema e.g. Donnie Wahlberg breaking his own foot ouch! It is a fair film and is watchable, do enjoy. I thought that this would be the last on the series and ended well, but they have just announced a fourth check it out.",6,0,1,5 November 2006
Transformers," Wow! Outstanding Action adaptation of Retro Cartoon.
","I watched the original cartoons as child in the 1980's and i was always hooked. When I heard that there was going to be a big screen movie based on the cartoon I thought dreams had been granted.This movie ticked all the correct boxes. Great action sequences, effects, story, music and laughs as well. There were so many moments that stood out and the comedy also enhanced the film.I thought it was a surprise that Shia LeBouf had been cast as the lead character, all i could remember watching him in the children's programme Even Stevens. I did not expect him to pull off his role, he did not look like the stereotypical hero, he excelled and handle the delivery of his lines superbly, especially one liners. A brave and well casted. Well done Shia.Everyone will enjoy the film, it has everything for everyone and the pace is well suited. An awesome and well executed piece of work from Michael Bay.",10,8,15,1 August 2007
The Departed," Excellence in contrast and delivery
","As ever Scorese has brought together an array of outstanding actors. Jack Nicholson's performance is as usual competent and a well thought out character study. But the gem of the film is Di Caprio, he is awesome it is as though he is growing in stature and becoming a much more grounded actor with immense passion. He really does enlighten the scenes as his character continues to struggle with the conflicts and demons that he faces. He is in the same form as he was in The Aviator in which he deserved an Oscar nomination, maybe a little early to tip him for an Oscar, but certainly worth another Oscar nod for Best Actor.Scorese is such a clever director, this is probably the only mixed form film he has made. The film ventures to the two extremes of comedy and drama within this film, Scorese carefully delivers the most appropriate balance of comedy to lift the gloomy content within this film (for example the very last shot on the window as the film ends). He continually shows his early influences in many scenes, particularly the scene when Di Caprio is following Damon after the cinema visit (enough said don't want to spoil the story), this reminded me of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets.Another great partnership is the combination Scorsese with Schoonmaker's editing. She has won several Oscars when working with Scorese and this is certainly her best work. The editing is snappy and executed superbly, creating immense tension especially towards the climax of the film. Thelma Schoonmaker is an outstanding editor and deserves another Oscar, well done.The complex, clever and intertwining narrative enables the script to follow an excellent structure which never detracts itself away from the core action.Overall an excellent film, well done Scorese!",10,3,7,6 October 2006
There Will Be Blood," A complete film?
","I bought the DVD last night and thought what a lousy box! But Hey,the film by contrast was impeccable.I know this film has had rave reviews and I saw No Country for Old Men before this. There Will Be Blood is such a complete and tragic film. Despite it's long running time, the film appeared to me to flow so well and its elements seem to create the almost 'Complete film' as did Dr Zchivago or Schindler's List.I truly respect Day Lewis's performance being compared to De Niro's Jake La Motta. He was just absorbing, I was in awe with every word, particularly in the Bar Scene when he confronted that Oil guy who he had threatened to cut his throat, you truly saw a demented demon breaking out. He took centre stage and practically took 99% of the film's running time. His performance deserves to be in the top 10 of all time.As for the script it really brought out the period of the time and the film was epic in scale. Beautifully constructed and Best film of the year. Good solid direction and lets not forget Paul Dano's performance. An excellent supporting role, where at least was his Oscar Nomination!!!! Hey, I know Javiar Bardem and was the right choice for the Oscar in that category, but Dano deserved at least a nomination for his over exaggerated (not overacted there's a difference trust me I am employed in this field to train actors).A final note almost a Complete film!",10,2,4,12 September 2008
