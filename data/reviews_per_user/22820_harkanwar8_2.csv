The Avengers," this is it!!!...the perfect concoction...
","I didn't sleep the day before I went to see avengers...i was so excited...before it started..i said to myself, it better be worth it..and it was more.. the avengers is not justa perfect movie, its a masterpiece...i can't believe a action movie can be so funny, throughout the movie there was a smile on my face .Brilliant characterization, screenplay, acting and action.this is a revolutionary movie as it has raised the bar for upcoming action flicks.take out all the action and its still worth watching.i can guarantee one thing that this movie will expand the fan base of hulk..he is much more believable than the previous ones and no character is prefect...the one amusing thought for me was that how can petty humans like hawk eye and black widow can contribute in the arsenal of superheroes..buy I was wrong this is a must see movie for all ages, go see out tonight..",10,9,18,27 April 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," the NOT so amazing spiderman......
",OK first of all I am a huge fan of superhero movies including the spiderman franchise.... when I review the movie I try to highlight the strong points but I will make an exception in this case because spiderman is one of my favorite comic book characters I had very high expectations for this movie but it kind of let me down....there are many reviews lauding the effort of marc webb and saying that the movie had strong emotions and good acting. though I admit the acting was much better than the other installments but are they forgetting something......? This is a superhero movie not a chick flick.. few lovey dovey..scenes were totally unnecessary....ina movie of 2.5 hours there where barely half an hour of action scenes...there was a moment when I forgot I was watching spiderman...okay enough with the negativity let's sere the positive aspects..... some 3d scenes were mind blowing but there weren't enough of them....the story was much more realistic than the previous franchise....because it showed peter parker just an average man..with extra ordinary abilities..and the technologically more realistic...however there tad excess emotional drama in some scenes there was total absence in some important ones ...not to mention it also managed to pull out some laughs.... so all in all if you are looking for a emotional and mind stirring superhero movie....see how absurd it sounds...then go see it our of u have a3d TV at home I recommend u watch out on bluray..,7,0,2,6 July 2012
