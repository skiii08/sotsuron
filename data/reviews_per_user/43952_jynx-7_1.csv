The Blair Witch Project," trembling...
","I remember seeing just a mere 15 minute clip of 'BWP' on IFC on Friday nights on BRAVO in the early spring of 1998. That was the most terrifying 15 minutes that I've ever witnessed on TV (aside from an unedited suicide on the news), and I haven't forgotten any images yet.Do you remember the first time you felt fear? The first time that you were terrified that you were in trouble and that you knew that you'd be getting a beating? Those feelings will come back. I have never been paralyzed by fear from anything I've ever seen on any screen of any shape, but the short clip that I saw came very close. As a child, I was interested in the theory of witches but after about 14, I discounted everything. Because of the clip of the Blair Witch Project that I saw, I can't help but think that there is some truth to some of the stories. After seeing the clip of BWP, I've been wary of walking into the woods after dusk. I just can't do it. Every crinkle of every leaf spooks me.Not to seem condescending or paternal, but I really feel that this movie should only be seen by those over the age of 20 and be in stable mental health. If you don't meet these two requirements, don't see this movie.",Null,1,2,17 June 1999
