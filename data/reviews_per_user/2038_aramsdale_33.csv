First Man," Dreadful
","Mankinds greatest achievement told in one of mankinds worst film. Boring, slow & just poor. Very disappointing.",1,4,10,20 November 2018
Rocketman," TO SOON AFTER BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY
","Bohemian Rhapsody is just brilliant in every way with an outstanding performance by Rami Malek. Well deserved oscar winner.
This is just ok thanks to a good portrayal by Taron & an even better one by Jamie.
You don't have to be a queen fan to like Rhapsody but i think you have to be to enjoy Eltons story.
3/10",3,44,115,24 May 2019
Gravity," VISUALLY STUNNING & BRILLIANT
","First off. I love this film.
From the opening scene to the last shot, this film is worthy of a 10/10 for it's visuals. I can not believe this was directed by the same man who made the dreadful Roma, which i detest, along everyone else i know who saw Roma.
I do not care about reputations or who the director is - I just want to be entertained & this kept me thrilled & entertained.
Seen it in 3d first then upgraded to imax, which made it even better. I then watched it on my phone & still love it & lastly on dvd, & it is just as good on all formats, which just proves how outstanding this film is.
Sandra Bullock pulled of an Oscar winning performance. I simply can not fault Gravity.

Us," WHAT WAS THAT?
","What was that was my 2nd thought after seeing this crap. Expletives were my 1st thought.
Terrible storyline. Stupid characters. Ridiculous acting. Just an all-round poor movie that i wanted to walk out of but I was waiting for school run. 2/10",2,2,6,26 March 2019
Aquaman," I agree. It is the best DC movie
","A very good, funny & entertaining movie but would've been better without the romance nonsense. When will Hollywood realise, they don't have to crowbar a love story in every film. One scene is unbelievably stupid & spoilt the film. Had to knock a star off for it.",7,7,16,12 December 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Best ever superhero movie
",Belly laughs from beginning to the end & great action. Loved every minute & Geoff Goldblum is superb. 10/10,10,3,5,21 November 2018
"I, Tonya"," Superb
",Highly underrated. Deserves a lot more credit & plaudits than it gets & what a performance.,8,0,0,21 November 2018
Snatch," ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE!
","Guy Ritchie has wrote and directed one of the best films ever made.
It is one of the few film in which every actor shines, especially Robbie Gee, Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones. I could rave on about all the characters like Bricktop and Boris 'the blade', but it would take forever, as there are so many to praise.
It is simply an hilarious and smart film put together perfectly which, no matter how many times I watch it, i still love it as much as the 1st time.
Thank you Mr Ritchie, cast and crew.
10/10",10,0,2,29 April 2019
Tangled," IN TOP 5 ALL TIME ANIMATIONS
","To quote Ms Poppins....'perfect in every way'. Every song is a 10/10. Characters, are also 10/10 along with storyline. I just love it all. How anyone can think Frozen is better than this, is beyond me.
Maximus, (the horse), alone, is better than most animated movies.",10,1,1,19 April 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Proved me & critics wrong
","I didn't want to see this cos I hated his Mr Robot series but - how wrong was I?
Ramis performance is just brilliant. Regardless of 'historical inaccuracies', it is a foot stomping, hand clapping, head nodding monster musical. Seen it 3 times, twice in imax & after each show there was a spontaneous round of applause. Will imax it again",9,4,7,20 November 2018
American Psycho," CHRISTIAN BALE WAS ROBBED!
","Been reading these reviews & bewildered how anyone could give this a 1.
Bales performance is his best so are they saying, he can't act?
He deserved best actor Oscar for 2000.
We're not reviewing the book here so has no relevance here.
Great direction & all round movie. 9/10",9,2,2,29 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," I don't get all the high scores
","I'm not a comic book fan but enjoy most comic book movies if they're entertaining but this was visually, to fast & cluttered but better than most cgi films this year. Hotel Transylvania 3 is the best of 2018 by far. 5 stars only.",5,6,38,20 December 2018
Alien vs. Predator," BEST MIX OF TWO FRANCHISES
","How can anyone be disappointed with this film. It is pure genius how they made this storyline work perfectly.
I do not know what else they could've done to make this any better.
Just brilliant. 9/10",9,2,2,20 June 2019
The Favourite," 90% Metascore.....WHY?
","Why all the praise?
This movie is all about winning critical acclaim as only critics & pretentious movie goers could possibly enjoy this dross. If you liked the worst movie ever, 'Moonlight', (i hate that movie with a passion), you'll like this rubbish.
Great performances & costumes but the WORST MUSIC score - EVER & half of it seemed to be filmed with a drone....seriously!
It has to much unnecessary language & nonsensical scenes with a dire ending.
3/10 for the acting & costumes only.",3,5,12,13 January 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," PURE GENIUS
","You muppet 'metascore' critics. How is it possible to rate this work of Pure Genius lower than the Truly Awful Load Of Rubbish 'moonlight'. You bunch of clowns. This movie is astounding in every way. A flawless 10 star rating, without a doubt. CRITICS NO NOTHING",10,1,2,16 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," How did they do it?
",How they made such a great film with so many characters is amazing. Loved it,9,0,3,20 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," HOLLYWOOD TRYPE
","I think Taratino has great individual scenes in all his films but as a whole, fall short as great films for me except Jackie Brown, which for me, is his best film with most scenes, (though some too long), very well done & as a whole - a brilliant film.
This trype is just dull, boring, slow & dreadful.
Leonardo is the only thing good on it & Margot Robbie is totally wasted. Walked out during the scene when Brad picked up the hitchhiker & struggled to last that long
1/10 because i can't give a minus rating.",1,4,8,18 August 2019
Aladdin," DISNEY GENIUS OF THE LAMP
","I was reluctant to see this as the original, with Robin Williams was perfection, but this comes surprisingly close.
Love the changes from the cartoon plus, where they took the story & characters. So much better than the remakes of Beauty & the beast & 100 times better than Dumbo.
Whatsapped family & friends to see it in cinema, not on tv.....deserves it.
Excellent
8/10",9,1,4,28 May 2019
The Lion King," A WHIMPER NOT A ROAR
","I loved the original cartoon. I loved all the characters, both visually & voice overs. I love the stage play....(amazing), but this is all about the animators genius.
We spent most of the movie in awe of what we were looking at & not the movie itself, as it just didn't grab your interest.
Dull voice overs. Lack of humour & emotion & every song ruined.
6/10 for the realistic look of it but everything else, lets it down.
The new Aladdin with Will Smith is by far the best remake yet....it's brilliant.",6,1,2,22 July 2019
Midsommar," FLORENCE IS WASTED IN THIS CRAP
","I struggled to last as long as I did watching this rubbish - almost 2 hours of my life wasted before I walked out.
Just totally ridiculous in every way.
Florence gives a great performance and some other decent acting from her co-stars but nothing can save this nonsense.
I will not bore you with the 'dull' details nor waste anymore time on this trash, save to try warn the paying public. Save your money & time.
1/10 as that's the lowest I can give.",1,26,45,10 July 2019
The Shape of Water," How did this win best movie oscar?
","I have had my Cineworld card for over 14 years so see a lot of movies. This has to be one of the worst I've seen. Boring, slow & ridiculous but not as awful as the previous years winner... MOONLIGHT. That film literally gets me angry just thinking about it. These 2 are why we do not watch the Oscars anymore. Pretentious rubbish.",2,14,26,20 November 2018
12 Years a Slave," Simply brilliant
",Truly deserving of 'best picture' Oscar. Easily better than any other winner that has come after. What has happened to the judges since? Should have won a lot more awards. 10/10 for all involved,10,0,1,20 November 2018
Joker," HEATH LEDGER HAS COMPETITION
","Great performance & story telling of the origins of The Joker.
I have recommened it but advise it is dark, twisted & disturbing but without being exploitative or grossly violent for shocks sake.
Oscar nomination guaranteed.
8/10",8,1,5,21 October 2019
It Chapter Two," I FELT LIKE A CLOWN WATCHING THIS
","Bored me from the second it started until i eventually couldn't take anymore & walked out.
I tried to stay but after 2 hours i realised i only get one life & this has wasted too much of it.
I didn't like 1st one & this was even worse.
I will give any film a chance regardless of what i thought of it's predecessors but i disliked both.
1/10",1,8,11,24 October 2019
The Croods," VERY UNDERRATED
","Ever since this came out we've been waiting for the 2nd one. Very funny, clever & entertaining. DreamWorks make sillier thus more old school childrens films unlike the new Disney 'deep & politically correct' dullness, except Tangled which was Disneys last good film. 9/10",9,5,6,27 December 2018
Black Panther," Michael B Jordan
","It is a very good movie with some brilliant performances, especially, Michael B Jordan/Killmonger & Andy Serkis. Without them, it would've been another mediocre superhero movie. Thor Ragnorok is by far the better film",7,0,4,21 November 2018
Tombstone," BEST WESTERN....EVER
","Val Kilmer gives one of the greatest performances ever. The whole cast are superb & credit to the casting crew, script/screenplay & especially, the director who has made a masterpiece of a movie.
This movie is outstanding in every way.
10/10",10,1,3,20 June 2019
The Emperor's New Groove," BEST DISNEY FILM...EVER
","'BOOM BABY'
This has the best voice cast...ever, with David Spade & especially Eartha Kitt as Yzma. My favourite character...ever. The animators, produced the best characters Disney ever put on screen. I just love every aspect of her.
The script & jokes are pure genius.
I can not praise the film highly enough, even after 20 years of watching it.
BOOYAH
10/10.",10,0,1,4 April 2020
The Greatest Showman," Critics get it wrong - again
","Everyone i know who have seen this, love it without exception. I bought the CD, which has been in my car ever since & dvd which has been played several times. Deserving of several Oscars but simply, to good for them. Everyone from the dancers to director deserve the highest praise. OUTSTANDING",10,2,3,21 November 2018
300," THIS IS SPARTA!!
","Ridiculously brilliant.
Visually stunning. Quotable lines, throughout.
The action scenes are breathtaking.
Watchable, over & over.

Green Book," ONE OF THE BEST OF 2018
","So good, I've seen it twice & will go again & take my grandchild, grandparents & all the family.
A refreshing change to have a film so well made that you can watch with the whole family especially with this adult subject matter. It's old school film making. Deserves awards galore.
Mahershala Ali was in the worst film I've ever seen, to the point it makes my blood boil but he has been forgiven for that with this 8/10",8,2,4,11 February 2019
Incredibles 2," Did not like
",I would've walked out but took my granddaughter so stopped for her but when it finished she said it was boring too.,2,2,8,21 November 2018
Valkyrie," Superb
","This is one of the best films ever. Tense, thrilling, brilliantly acted & directed. It is just 10/10. Fantastic",10,2,2,3 December 2018
