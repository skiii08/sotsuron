Your Name.," Just amazing!
","I don't watch anime but my friend recommended this movie, and its been a week now since I last watched it and I still can't move on how good it is. I love the story, the animation and the soundtrack! Although, I did not cry watching this film, the sadness it portrays still affect me to this day - the longing for someone that does not exist, the nostalgia, all the feels!",10,0,1,27 August 2019
