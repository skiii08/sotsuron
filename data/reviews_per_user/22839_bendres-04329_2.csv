Blade Runner 2049," Not Just a Sequel, But Also a Film to Remember
","Blade Runner 2049 is possibly the best movie of the year, joining the likes of Logan and It Comes at Night so far. Not only is it potentially one of the best movies of the year, it is up there with the best sequels of all time. It doesn't bring out the old characters we love and have them do the same exact thing except with their children (Even though I did enjoy Force Awakens), it builds upon themes that were in the previous film. It probes more questions such as if replicants can be considered humans, what about A.I., does society or our inner selves determine what we think of ourselves, and many more.The story is fantastic as it constantly peaks the audience's interest and keeps them engaged, even when scenes that would usually draw out in a typical movie are interesting and propelling the plot. While it is constantly moving, the film also takes its' time with scenes, allowing us to connect with the characters and take in the visuals. Denis Villeneuve proves yet again that he is the best new filmmaker with his most stunning film yet with the help of the equally incredible Roger Deakins. Ryan Gosling gives a performance we've seen from him but somehow with even more emotion from his eyes and his character has a beautiful arc. This movie constantly builds and improves its' predecessor. Harrison Ford's character is given charisma I felt lacked in the original. One complaint is that I feel Jared Leto's villain, which he did play very well, could use more presence. While the inner conflict is incredible, the exterior conflict could use a bit more urgency. This movie is a fantastic sequel and a blockbuster that doesn't involve quips and blue lights in the sky. It asks serious question and gives stunning visuals. It's 2 hours and 45 minutes but I felt as though an hour had passed once the credits rolled.",9,1,6,31 October 2017
The Greatest Showman," Dream Showman
","I dreamt that I saw 40 minutes of this movie last night and let me tell you, I want my dream back. So here I am to review my dream version of The Greatest Showman. Shallow characters, every shot was overexposed, and the movie theatre was in an abandoned warehouse for some reason. Hugh Jackman wasn't even in the movie. Also, The Backstreet Boys did the soundtrack for the movie and the only song was I Want It That Way but in different styles. Terrible dream.",4,4,6,27 June 2018
