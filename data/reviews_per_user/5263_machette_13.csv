The Ring," Very, very creepy and intense...
","Wow.  I just got back from seeing this and all I can say is...wow.  It's been a long time since a movie creeped me out this much. If the American version was this good;  I've got to see the original.  The thing is; I don't know why this movie affected me the way it did.  I know it's just a movie, but; damn! Definately picking this one when it comes to DVD.",Null,0,0,14 December 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," All good things must come to an end
",Well what can I say? All good things must have an end. So George Lucas ends the first trilogy just as wonderfully as he began it. A great ending to a great trilogy although I really could've done without the Ewoks.,Null,0,0,28 August 1999
The Exorcist," Still packs a horror-filled punch some 27 years later
",Being only 2 at the time it was released; I was too young to have enjoyed this masterpeice at the theater. I first saw it when I was 8 and it scared the hell out of me! It still does to this day. Starts kinda slow but once it gets going; it doesn't stop until the ending credits. Heart-stopping terror at its best. See this one...if you're brave enough,Null,0,0,11 March 2000
JFK," Makes you think doesn't it?
","If you are one of the people that believe that Lee Harvey Oswald is the assassin and the only one at that, then you need to view this film.  I'm not saying that this film is 100% fact. But it's not 100% fiction either.  What Oliver Stone does(brilliantly I might add) is he takes an important event in American history and turns it upside down.  Like I said this isn't 100% fact; but even after viewing this you have to ask yourself: 'What happened November 22,1963?' We all know what happened. Now ask yourself: Who did it'?  Watch this film and the answer may surprise you.",Null,0,10,1 March 2000
Psycho," We all go a little mad sometimes.
","This is the father of all slasher films. it is also one of the best. Without Norman Bates there would be no Michael Meyers, Freddy Krueger, or Jason Vorhees(whom I might add will kick Freddy's kentucky fried butt in Jason vs Freddy). The makers of Halloween realised this and even named one of their main characters after a character in Psycho: Sam Loomis. So if wanted to see the movie that stared  the slasher genre this it. Worth the time and money to see.",Null,8,16,11 March 2000
Scream 2," It should have been titled 'Yawn'
","After viewing this and all of the other lame attempts at horror movies in this decade; I can easily say that it was the worst decade for horror movies ever. As a horror movie fan who grew up in the 70's and 80's when they where at their peak; I truly am dissapointed in this attempt of a horror movie. I hope with the new millennium, that we will see the comeback of the true horror movie. As a side note; I recently saw House On Haunted Hill and can I believe that this film is a step in that direction.",Null,0,0,20 November 1999
Jaws," 'I think you're going to need a bigger boat!' (small spoilers)
",This is quite possibly the greatest movie ever. It is without a doubt Spielbergs finest. What he does with movie is he plays on our biggest of fears: the unknown. For the first hour of this movie we aren't sure what's out there killing people; but we know that it's big and and it's not where it belongs. It also gives us three complex characters to root for: First there's Chief Brody; he's cop on an island and he hates the water. But he knows that he must do something. then there's Matt Hooper the scientist who studies sharks. He knows what's out there and tries in vain to get the Mayor to understand.('You are going to ignore this particular problem until it swims up and bites you in the a**!) And then there's Quint. The hardned shark hunter who's scared of nothing and wants the shark. Speilberg does a great job into developing these characters into people you actually like. If you have not seen this movie then by all means rent it or buy it. It's defenately worht the money. On a scale from 1 to 10 it gets a 10 for sure.,Null,0,1,19 March 2000
Scream," Ya got to follow the rules!(spoilers?)
","This is a great movie. When this came to my town, I went to see it with the here's-another-halloween-ripoff-attitude. Boy was I wrong! Craven pulls a very good hitchcock move by killing off one of the biggest names right off the bat and it just keeps getting better. Too bad the sequel didnt live up to this one. Oh well here's hoping number 3 will rescue the series.P.S. Try to find all of the horror movie reference in this movie. I watched it last night and found 10.",Null,0,0,23 January 2000
Halloween," This is the one
",This is the one that started it all. It was the first and best of the 'slasher flicks'. It is also the one that made me a horror movie buff. It was the first movie I ever saw in a movie theater. And 20 years later it still stands as one of the best. If you have not seen this gem; then go buy it and be prepared for a treat.,Null,0,0,22 January 2000
The Emperor's New Groove," BOOM-BABY!
",This is a true Disney masterpiece.  While I enjoyed Disney's usual animated formula which is basically cartoon musicals; this move is a refreshing change of pace.  Dave Spade is perfect as the Emporer. And all John Goodman and Ertha Kitt are great in their roles; Patrick Warrburton absolutely steals the show as Kronk the more loveable than evil henchman. I rate this ***** out of *****,Null,0,1,21 May 2001
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One Two...Freddy's Coming For You....
",This is Wes Craven's best work. In this the first installment of the series we see Freddy as a more sinister being than the stand up comic he later became. The movies dark and eerie atmosphere and sense of reality in some ways are what make this movie truly scary. If you havent seen any of this series; watch this one; for it is truly the best one.,Null,0,0,5 March 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," There is a God and his name is George Lucas
","I saw for the first time when I was six years old way back in 1977. Now when you get older you tend to have trouble remembering what you did at six. Me, I saw perhaps the greatest movie ever that year. And oh, the effect it had on my life from then on. For the next 8 birthdays and Christmases it was all about Star Wars. Thank you George Lucas for bringing something so wonderful into our lives. And as corny as this may sound:The Force will be with you; always",Null,0,0,28 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," It just keeps getting better
",It's 1980 and here I am 9 years old and enjoying for the first time a true masterpiece. George Lucas does what no one thought possible. He made a sequel that was better than the first. Ad who can forget the music of John Williams? every time I hear that oh so familiar theme I feel just like a kid again. Thanks again Mr. Lucas.,Null,0,0,28 August 1999
