Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time.
","This movie is truly worthy of the trilogy. Although Jar-Jar is very annoying, the lightsaber duel at the end alone is worth the admission price. The plot fits nicely with the rest of the movies. George Lucas is brilliant. This is the best movie I have seen in a very long time.",9,0,0,30 May 1999
