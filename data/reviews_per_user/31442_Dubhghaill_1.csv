Come and See," 'Come and See' - A movie of enduring impact
","I saw 'Come and See', only once (on the big screen, in 1987) and it remains one, of very few, dramatic works that have had an immediate, and lasting, impact on my life.  This movie's artistry, emotional power, and integrity, combined to produce a profoudly disturbing affect, on me, at the time of viewing; its lasting legacy, is that it made the onset of  'shell shock' seem, not just readily understandable, but almost inevitable, among combatants, in a total war situation.  Even though World War Two may seem historically remote, to some, I would, unreservedly, recommend this film, to anyone who would like a greater insight into, any, post-Soviet society.",10,4,7,2 January 2004
