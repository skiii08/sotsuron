Hereditary," Damn good. Go see. Slow start, build a strong
","Not much to say not much I can say not much I should say, go see it. you enjoy",8,6,13,17 June 2018
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," It hurt to watch
","I should have known.Hollywood can't help it. It talks the big talk about being PC and woke, and then insults a nation with this. And it was sexist too. Making the female character a dumb doormatWill Ferrel was funny. 20 years ago. Blades of Glory, Elf, Zoolander. But the jokes are 20 years old. He's blue steel.If Sherlock Holmes was a low point, this was down there too.Europe, And Iceland deserves an apology.And the past contestants appearing in this should pause, reflect, and be ashamed.",3,10,24,28 June 2020
Knives Out," Overlong and a convenient ending
",Not sure about this one. It had the premise but lacked something.Not sure what. Maybe seeing Daniel Craig do what he did.,5,3,6,20 January 2020
Molly's Game," Everyone did a fair job with a thin story
","I will save you half an hour. Anything with a flashback to her youth, or with Kevin Costner, just fast forward. Its not that those parts are bad- they're just fill. And it needed that fill because there wasn't much going on, Although it was still entertaining, the moment it ends you won't even remember you watched it nor care to think about it again.
Perfectly entertaining, just thin for substance. With that, everyone did well enough to entertain. (And trying to draw her life to a certain book was pretty weak imo)",5,2,6,28 May 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Zzzzzzz and politics
","He wasnt a jew, there was no lie detector, no one committed any crimes, no one was ever arrested . But it's an election year right?
Come on Spike, you can do better",3,8,17,4 November 2018
It Follows," Mildly entertaining, good premise but doesn't deliver
","One day someone will revisit the premise and deliver a very solid film.
In this one acting was fine, sound, editing, all top quality. Much better than the film itself, which was too slow, took to long to get to the premise (27 minutes), and really, nothing happened.
Boring",6,0,0,11 March 2019
Get Out," Huge potential but didn't know how to finish it properly
","Great premise, well acted, great characters, but just one problem. A lame flaccid ending.It was as though the writer/ director has never seen a suspense film before.It is a film you may see again, but not one that deserves to be in any top anything lists",6,0,3,23 June 2018
Insidious," I went with it, it scared me, and i laugh at Conjuring and Exorcist
","Full credit to all involved, they did a good job. Lots of homages, great screen play, good acting
A confused overlong end sequence didn't destroy the film, And I LOVED the ending",8,0,1,19 March 2019
The Evil Dead," A lot of fun, go with it
","After this Part 11 was 25% laughs 75% horror, then Part 3 (Army of Darkness) is 75% humour.
Pat 2 dials up the character of Ash, and it really is a lot of fun.
Part 1 is a classic that will make you squirm a little, maybe say OMG, but otherwise just enjoy",8,0,1,12 March 2019
Hotel Mumbai," Good film, worth a watch
","Not a perfect film but entertaining, fast paced and on spot.
Good credit to all involved. Absolutely watchable.
Must have been completely traumatic for all in Mumbai that day",8,4,13,22 June 2019
The Descent," So much potential wated
","First half fine, for all the reasons others have said, 2nd half an insult.
The cave itself offered so much more. Whoever made this film just wanted to make a film about cave creatures that made no sense.
Sad really, could have been claustrophobic-ally a great film",4,3,10,8 March 2019
12 Strong," It hurt to watch. It physically hurt to watch. 'Murica...boo yah!
","I I saved this app to watch on the aeroplane it meant that little to me . where do I begin? in fact it's not worth it you see the writers the Directors the actors, no one gave a toss, no one made an effort it is trash, slop, gruel from a bowl of dogs vomit 
 I think there was a moment in the film about 37 minutes in where they didn't have a one-dimensional moment. Puppies- yes, the only thing this film was missing was taleban drowning puppies. I don't know enough words to describe how bad films like this are. Unwatchable it's embarrassing to watch but I know why I did it I think it was Morbid fascination, after 20 minutes to just keep watching. Not to see if it got better like some films can but just to see if it could stay as bad not even to see if you could get worse just to see if I could stay as bad as it already was . I thought the Rambo film against the Russians was nonsensical to the extreme this film needed Rambo that's what it needed booyah 
Who green lights this trash? Who films it who goes into the desert who gives it a budget who edits it ? Aren't these people just plain ashamed? do they have no integrity have no pride in their career?
