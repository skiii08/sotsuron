The Legend of Bagger Vance," Horrible!
","I love golf. I love Will Smith. I love Matt Damon. I love the south. I ADORE Robert Redford and Jack Lemmon. I can even stand Charlize Theron... but I detest 'The Legend of Bagger Vance.' The writing is awful. The characters are flat. The accents are fake. Bagger should have been played by Morgan Freeman in my opinion. The movie was also way too long.And then at the end, when Bagger just up and leaves before the end of the match... it left me screaming out loud at my TV 'Why are you doing that? Why?' There's absolutely no reason, no setup, no foreshadowing. He just turns around and leaves. It's obviously supposed to be an emotional point in the film, but it falls far short. There's no explaining it.Sad sad sad.",Null,4,9,4 August 2005
