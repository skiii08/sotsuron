Captain Phillips," Wow! Great Movie
","Captain Phillips was not at all what I expected it be, especially since I had not seen any of the previews prior to seeing this movie. However, because I am such a big Tom Hanks fan, I decided to give it a shot and boy am I glad I did. I had no idea what the movie was about until my boyfriend told me that it was based on the true story of the pirates taking over a ship in 2009, a story I remember seeing on the news.Well I just got finished watching this movie and it was great! It moved at just the right pace. Held my interest the whole time. The actors portraying the pirates did a convincing job in their roles as the villains. They acted with such passion which help to bring some realism to the movie, almost as if I were watching a documentary. Needless to say, Tom Hanks has given yet another Stella performance in a role. Again, it was if I were watching then real Capt. Phillips. I'm so glad that I watched this movie. I must say that our military is awesome!!! I recommend this movie to everyone. You will not be disappointed!",9,0,1,16 January 2014
Kick-Ass," Better then I expected!
","All I can say is that I was in no way interested in watching this movie at all. But my friend & finally decided to watch it last night & I must say it's 1 one of the best movies I have seen. Full of action & fun! The acting was great! I especially enjoyed watching Chloe Grace! She was a beast!!I was a bit surprised to see Nicolas Cage play the role he played. But as usual, he did a great job. The plot/story line was good & kept my attention. Everything gelled together nicely surprisingly. It was nothing like I expected it to be. I thoroughly enjoyed it!!! If you don't see anything else, see this movie!",8,3,8,27 April 2011
