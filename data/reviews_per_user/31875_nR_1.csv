The Blair Witch Project," The perils of hype
","I have to say that there are certain disadvantages to seeing a movie after you have heard the rumours surrounding it.  I had heard that this was the scariest movie of all time, with girls and guys having to leave the theatre early because they were so terrified.  I am not going to give anything away in this review but I just don't want people to have any misconceptions going into it.  I am one of the most easily scared people I know ('Jurassic Park' made me cry and hide my head in my lap) but all through this movie I kept thinking, 'this isn't very scary at all.'  It almost ruined the movie for me because I kept wanting it to be scarier than it was.  I think that people should not go in to it expecting a typical thrills/chills type horror movie because they will probably be disappointed.  I would still recommend this movie, though, because it is an interesting movie to see and I appreciate this type of novelty in film making and believe that it should be encouraged.  And even though it wasn't really scary, it did affect me.  I find myself still thinking about it days afterwards and I don't think that I will go camping any time soon.  Without saying too much, at one point it did terrify me and that moment was so chilling that I can't get the image out of my mind.",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
