50 First Dates," Loved this movie!
","I really enjoyed this movie. I believe it is Adam Sandler's best work! I don't always enjoy everything he does but this and the Wedding Singer are both very good and thoroughly wonderful to watch. Rob Schiender was very VERY funny as Ula but then he always makes me laugh! Drew Barrymore is beautiful here and very convincing. You know, seeing this movie makes me want to visit Hawaii! There are incredibly beautiful scenes...lovely. I've purchased this movie on DVD and like to watch it from time to time as it never fails to be quite uplifting. So if you're after something light, funny, sad and beautiful this might just be the movie your after. I'm sure Adam Sandler & Rob Schiender will continue to 'hook up' for future ventures which will be just as enjoyable.",8,0,0,17 September 2005
