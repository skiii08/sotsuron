Requiem for a Dream," Dead on
","I first saw this movie three weeks out of a four month rehab for cocaine and heroine addiction. I had thrown away a professional career, personal relationships and all else for drugs.On first viewing, I considered Requiem lightweight and overstated. Having participated in the activities depicted- and more- the movie seemed like yet another 'Drugs Are Bad For You' movie.I have since watched it several times and- seven years out of the drug life- its impact is very powerful. While no film will accurately portray the true events and effects of an overwhelming addiction, Requiem does convey the impact that such an addiction has on others.This is on my Top Ten list and contains a worthwhile statement effectively delivered.",10,6,11,3 February 2007
The Hunger Games," Just another foreign movie ripoff- Spoiler Alert
","This awful movie is nothing more than an extremely poor ripoff of Battle Royale. Pretty much a Twilight version of the original Japanese movie.The characters- especially Peeta- are insipid and the acting- if it can be referred to as such- is awful. Peeta should have been dispensed with at the beginning of the Games. For most of the movie he follows The Twilight character Katniss around like a lost puppy doing little to defend himself or his true love. At almost three hours, there is so much pure fluff that the movie- or is it a 'film'?- just drags on. An hour of garbage unnecessary to what little story there is could have been easily cut.And the Games- what a joke. Battle Royale so far outshines this piece of Hollywood garbage. This movie is yet another in a long line of Hollywood ripoffs of really great foreign movies- Contraband and Dragon Tattoo being just two other examples.The last 20 minutes of the movie is just plain dumb.I don't doubt that this movie appeals to the typical American audience. No need to go into that statement.A '1' rating is way too high for this trash. I'm sure, just as with Twilight, there will be countless sequels. Hollywood has long since lost any creative talent it once had and is now reduced to comic book movies, third remakes of movies and television series not that good to begin with and really awful ripoffs of very good foreign movies.",1,31,43,19 August 2012
