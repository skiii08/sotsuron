Hereditary," This movie blew my head off
","Incredible movie. CHILLING! I was seriously thrilled by this one. Great, great work. I can't claim to 'get' every thing that happened, but wow, was it disturbing. It was so on point with the dread and the foreshadowing let you know everything you needed to without spoiling anything. Watch this movie, but maybe not with your mom. She probably won't like it!!",9,2,5,1 October 2018
Blade II," It's ok, I guess, if you like dumb action....
","No style to this one. The first movie had real visual flair, creative camera work, lots of cool, stylized shots. This movie had none of that. It's full of crappy CGI, really noticeable in several scenes, including the introductory fight between Blade and Nyssa, in front of the hot lights, which I think must have been used as an attempt to mask the cgi, but failed, as Nyssa's acrobatics are clearly artificial and cartoony, and the movie really overplayed the vampires death bit, where they burn up, right from the first scene of this movie. That concept, introduced in the first movie, was used fairly artfully, until Blade II. 
The inclusion of the thought-dead Whistler, reprised by Kris Kristofferson, was ponderous at best. I guess they just thought this movie need 'grizzled, old, angry man', and it was worth subverting the most emotional sequence of the first movie get it. 
I will admit that I didn't hate this movie as much as when I saw it in the theater, (I write this on 10/3/18, right after watching it for only the second time), but it's still not good. 
It's hard to say what makes a movie bad, but they really nailed it with this one. It's a bad sequel and it's unfortunate for many reasons, including the fact that it was directed by Del Toro, who I admire. This is not some of his better work, though I have enjoyed several of his movies. It's also irksome to me that Snipes considers this his favorite Blade movie. WTF? Snipes likes THIS over the first one??? WHY???
It's on Netflix, so no extra cost.....",3,2,3,4 October 2018
