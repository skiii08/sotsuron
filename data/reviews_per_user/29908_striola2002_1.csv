The Ring," Not very scary and not very good
","Granted, there are some 'disturbing' moments in this flick, but there is really nothing scary about it.  There were only a couple of 'legitimate' scary scenes and the only thing creepy about the little boy was that he called him mom by her first name.",Null,0,0,1 December 2002
