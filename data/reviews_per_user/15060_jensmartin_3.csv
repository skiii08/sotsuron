Ford v Ferrari," Christian Bale at his finest
","There is a lot of good in this movie but for me by far the best is the performance by Christian Bale. He is faultless in this move, even down to the subtly Brummie twang and expressions. Very believable.The actions keeps you on the edge of your seat and even though you probably know the story beforehand, its delivery is superb.",9,2,2,14 February 2020
Yesterday," Great Fun
","As a Richard Curtis written movie, Yesterday is exactly what you would expect it to be. Only knowing the basic concept of the movie before it starts you can quite easily predict the entire storyline with relative accuracy. You also know that it is going to be sweet, fluffy and feelgood.As such, there isn't anything particularly original going on here and it's not going to be remembered as one of the greatest movies of all time but nevertheless it is still great fun. The music is of course fantastic and there are some good jokes in there to keep you entertained. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it and could quite easily watch it again.",9,0,1,26 September 2019
1917," Has its flaws but who cares?
","Yes, there are flaws in this movie. The plot is a bit unrealistic and one does have to question how bullets repeatedly miss our hero.These are things that you will only reflect on afterwards though. As you watch it, you are pulled into the story and I defy you to take your eyes off the screen for even a moment. The cinematography is truly epic and fully deserving of its Oscar. Set design is also very impressive and doesn't pull many punches when it comes depicting the horrors of war.This is a must see movie. Even if afterwards you decide that actually you didn't like it as much as you expected, for the two hours you are watching it, you will be utterly immersed and you can't say that of too many movies.",10,1,3,5 March 2020
