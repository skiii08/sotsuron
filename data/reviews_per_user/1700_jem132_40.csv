Changeling," Mostly gripping
","Very good drama directed by Clint Eastwood. Angelina Jolie overcomes being the most photographed woman on the planet and constant tabloid fodder by delivering a restrained yet powerful performance as the determined mother who only wants her son back. Beautiful design and attention to 1920's period detail, and solid direction from Eastwood. I like how the film references the 1935 Oscars ceremony to explain a future plot point--anyone with a reasonable knowledge of film history would know that Collins (at least in the film, that is) does accept the date! It dragged a bit towards the end, after Jolie's release from the asylum, but otherwise very gripping throughout. No Oscars for 'Changeling', but a very worthy film.",8,2,4,26 February 2009
Walk the Line," Well, I loved it
","Terrific film looking at Johnny Cash's early stardom, and his love for his soulmate, singer June Carter. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon are excellent in their roles, giving fully-rounded portrayals and displaying the great chemistry that the real-life couple must have shared. Witherspoon is perfect as June, spunky, warm and strong, and her performance makes you wonder why she is still wasting her time doing crappy romantic comedies like 'Just Like Heaven'. I'm not saying she should do a Meryl Streep and go after every dramatic role in Hollywood (because, after all, her performance as June is really quite atypical of most of the Best Actress wins), but the lady clearly has talent and deserves better films. Phoenix also does a great job with Johnny Cash, he is intense and flawed, and deeply in love with June Carter. Both did their own vocals, and I'm very impressed! The songs are paced well, and the film really captures the feel of the era. I read a few average reviews of the film at the time of release, but heck, I LOVED it.",9,1,1,30 August 2008
Casablanca," It just gets better with every new viewing!
","It is very apt that my 200th IMDb comment (I review classic films on here) should be for CASABLANCA, a film that is surely the most iconic of the Golden Age of Hollywood. So much has already been written and said about CASABLANCA that to add anything new would seem perfunctory (even this sentence sounds a little trite!), but I'll just add a few points in as to what makes this film so wonderful.-Curtiz's direction. Understated, almost invisible and never intrusive, Mike Curtiz directed what seems like hundreds of Warner Brothers studio films without ever letting personal style intrude upon great story-telling. Curtiz was not a showy director, and CASABLANCA is hardly a showy film. Yet I can hardly think of any director who could have handled the final scene of the picture (the airport sequence) with such a fine sleight of hand. Bravo, Mr Curtiz.-The script, with so many quotable lines. CASABLANCA's script is such a thing of perfection, even more astonishing when one learns that it was re-worked almost daily. Nearly every line (save Bogart's line to Henreid 'It seems that destiny has taken a hand'- it really does feel 'written')is crisp; the screenplay is a mastery of the art of constructing film dialogue.-It is still such a 'cool' film. Bogart is perhaps the most 'cool' of all classic film stars, and CASABLANCA still feels so fresh and modern, despite all the now-classic clich√©s.-The duelling anthems scene is the highpoint of the picture, even more so than Bogart and Bergman's romantic scenes. It is truly an inspirational film moment, and has enormous power. Just one more reason to see the film.-The supporting cast feel as if they haven't been cast in the film, they simply 'belong' there. Even bit-characters like Yvonne are so perfectly cast and balanced with the protagonists. Rains is especially superb as Captain Renault, delivering many of the film's best lines.-Of course, the romance between Bogart and Bergman...forever Rick and Ilsa. For lovers of romantic films, CASABLANCA is a doozy (and if you don't like romantic films, there is still much to admire here). I cannot fail to be drawn in by Bergman's 'Kiss me as if it were the last time' of Bogie's 'Here's looking at you, kid' every single time.A film treasure.",10,2,4,7 March 2008
Lifeboat," Tallulah dominates the Lifeboat.....
","What happens when you plonk Tallulah Bankhead ('Darling!') into a lifeboat with a bunch of other supporting players? Well, Hitchcock's great, very entertaining Lifeboat is the result. Bankhead gives a terrific performance as Connie Porter, pretty much dominating the picture. Hitchcock was reportedly very fond of her, and shaped the film around her performance. After their boat is sunk by the Germans at the height of WW2, a bunch of weary, disparate survivors climb aboard a lifeboat and must face the elements, starvation, and each other, in order to survive. They make a crucial mistake in allowing a Nazi (Walter Slezak) aboard, and this drama unfolds as Bankhead has a rough and ready romance with an earthy John Hodiak (you know that they would jump each other if they just weren't on a darn lifeboat), William Bendix has his leg amputated, Heather Angel's baby is drowned and she jumps overboard to join it, among other things. An unusual Hithcock film, but a very satisfying one.",8,0,0,14 July 2008
In Bruges," Terrific comedy-tragedy, with great work from Gleeson, Farrell and Fienes
","I really enjoyed this one, a terrific comedy-tragedy that features great performances from it's three central players, a sharp script and gorgeous location shooting. The plot is pretty simple: two Irish hit men hide out in Bruges after a job. It would be a shame to give away any more plot spoilers, because it's such a fun ride. This is my type of humour, and the film is amazing in that one moment it has you laughing your head off, then less than 10 seconds later you are struck silent by the emotional depth or poignancy of a single line. Case in point: the scene in the children's playground. First-time director Martin McDonagh masterfully steers this film around the beautiful city of Bruges, a setting cleverly juxtaposed with the action. Farrell hasn't been in such good form for ages, and he and Gleeson have great acting chemistry together. Fiennes is also great as the ruthless crime boss who is also a man of principle. While the ending is maybe just a little too cute, this is still wonderful film-making.",9,1,3,20 September 2008
Citizen Kane," A textbook I would have liked to study in school...
","Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE (1941)was perhaps the first American film since the silent era to fully demonstrate the possibilities of the film medium, and the role of the camera. Welles' camera is mobile, no longer the static device used to merely show faces, and Toland's deep-focus cinematography revolutionary. Welles tinkers with traditional filmic narrative conventions to craft a work that is now often termed a 'textbook' of the cinema.Welles himself plays Kane in a remarkable acting performance that requires him to age progressively (which Welles does very convincingly) over the decades. Welles draws significant parallels between Kane and media mogul William Hearst in a statement that probes wealth, power figures and what we perceive as 'truth'.Kane is presented to the audience as an enigma- we never do get a full-bodied portrait of the man, only snippets of highly subjective memories from those who say they 'knew him'. In the newsreel, a montage of images that details Kane's life and eventual decline, a variety of viewpoints are established. He could be both a Fascist and a Communist- a megalomaniac manipulating power to his advantage or, indeed, being manipulated himself. It is ironic that the true meaning of 'Rosebud' is never discovered by the on-screen reporters, just as the true essence of the man Kane is never fully revealed to the audience. What is Kane searching for? Is it the untouched youth and innocence symbolized in 'Rosebud', or something he himself is not aware of? Kane is never truly sympathetic, yet he is wholly fascinating. He seems to lament the status and power that wealth has given him ('If I hadn't been very rich than I may have been a very great man'), then buys another load of cold statues and ornaments. His cruel treatment of second wife Susan Alexander in his insistence that she train as an opera singer suggest his unwavering persistence, and unwillingness to accept defeat. Kane is willing to stand alone ('I am Charles Foster Kane!') yet seems to crave a filler to his loneliness ('I know too many people. I guess we're both lonely'). Kane is ultimately indefinable; a jigsaw puzzle that both Susan and the audience struggle to piece together into anything whole or real.Welles used actors from his Mercury Theatre to populate this story of greed, corruption and vanity. Friend and close confidant Joseph Cotten becomes friend and observer Jebediah, who is a witness to Kane's slide into moral decay. Dorothy Cormingmore portrays Susan Alexander, a thinly veiled take on Hearst's real-life mistress Marion Davies. She possesses a similar honking Bronx whine and limited talent in her master's chosen area of success (For Davies this was dramatic roles in films; her talent lay in comedy). Distinguished actors Moorehead, Sanford and Sloane also feature in support.One aspect that is perhaps ignored in favor of focusing on the technical innovations is the truly amazing screenplay, one which offers just as many quotable snippets of dialogue as a 'CASABLANCA' or 'ALL ABOUT EVE'. Welles' understanding of the soundtrack is often overlooked. A memorable scene involves a bored Susan Alexander whining to Kane that she 'never gets any fun' because they 'live in a castle'. The visual portrait is fascinating, with Alexander perched on a seat as a princess, complete with tiara in her hair. The echo of her words and Kane's mechanical replies in the huge, yet empty, room speaks volumes for Welles' understanding of the film as a sum of all parts. Here, the sum adds up to perfect- direction, acting, writing, photography and music.The imposing, haunting Xanadu is similar to Hitchcock's Manderlay in REBECCA (filmed the previous year) in that the mansion operates as a both a character and a symbol of the protagonist. Kane's half-finished palace seems to come the closest to suggesting his character- grandiose, larger than life, powerful...yet strangely empty and unfulfilled.",10,38,57,9 February 2007
The Birth of a Nation," Revolutionary, yet a difficult epic
","D.W Griffith was the cinema's first true master. Audiences today may find his films trite, moralistic and (in this case) racist, but he is an undisputed king of film-making. THE BIRTH OF A NATION is Griffith's landmark Civil-War epic, over three hours long and packing in lot of story and technique. Yes, the subject matter (the Civil War told from a racially charged, anti-Abolitionist view) is difficult and quite disturbing, but it's still a very important film.Griffith must be commended for his epic vision- the scope of the film is breath-taking. He also was the first to use massive sets and location shooting extensively. Griffith crafted many of cinema's most basic techniques- cross-cutting, juxtaposing and layering different story lines, close-ups (though Lillian Gish also had something to do with that!) and, really, the dramatic structure that is so unique to film. We should be able to look past the unpleasant story (a Southern and Northern families lives and fortunes interlink and contrast before, during and after the Civil War, culminating in the formation of the 'heroic' Ku Klux Klan), and appreciate the significance of Griffith's film-making. The acting, from an ensemble cast, is also quite good, especially Lillian Gish.",8,2,5,10 April 2008
The Other Boleyn Girl," Saucy fun while it lasts, but empty. The two leading ladies are horrible.
","Entertaining enough while it lasts, but ultimately a throwaway costume drama. It doesn't really even resonate for longer than 10 minutes after the end credits. But it's still kind of fun to watch badly miscast Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen give horrible performances as the Boleyn sisters. Scarlett Johannsen's sultriness is smothered by her passive role as Mary, and Natalie Portman fails to deliver in her big emotional scenes as Anne. Eric Bana's King is pushed into the background by the focus on the sisters, so he never really gets a chance to give us insight into the much-married King. Despite all it's flaws, I still found the royal intrigue enjoyable enough to while away a lazy Sunday afternoon. And I do enjoy anything with costumes. Sets and design were quite nice, but it was a shame to see Kristin Scott Thomas become part of the furniture in her thankless role as the mother of the girls. Luckily she is getting major wraps for a new French drama, 'I've Loved You So Long', so I can stand it. If you want good period drama this year, see 'The Duchess', with a much better leading lady in Keira Knightley, and all-round better production.",5,0,0,20 December 2008
The Great Dictator," In his first talkie, Chaplin is strangely overcome by....too many words
","A good, but not great film, 'The Great Dictator' is Chaplin's first talkie. It's a good effort, and at times a remarkable satire on Hitler, but unfortunately the moments of Chaplin brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue. Yes, Chaplin, the silent screen master, just uses too many words in this film, and his tendency towards writing long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue would carry over into his other talkie films, such as (better) 'Limelight'. Still, Chaplin was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly memorable. Paulette Goddard doesn't have the glow she did in 'Modern Times' (her off-screen affair with Chaplin was cooling at the time), but she is always worth seeing, and Jack Oakie just about steals the show as a rival dictator to Chaplin's famous creation Hynkel.",7,0,3,17 June 2008
Juno," Don't waste your time
","This wasn't worth watching, and I had that feeling after I saw a trailer for it while I was in the cinema waiting for 'Atonement' (that film should not be mentioned on the same page as this one). I got it out from my Uni library, so at least it didn't cost me money. It's not all bad, Jennifer Garner's performance as the woman desperate for a child is very touching, but the rest of the film is so obnoxious and pretentious that I just want to kick it.For starters, how is Juno a 'whip-smart' teen as the fawning movie critics had it? OK, she has a hamburger phone and listens to indie music. Wow, so original. She certainly wasn't smart enough to use protection during sex, so how could she possibly be surprised to find herself pregnant? It's not Ellen Page's fault, she is quite good in the role, but the terrible writing. Then again, what can you expect when it's written by a former stripper who re-named herself 'Diablo Cody'?The 'teen-speak' dialogue that was much talked about on release is just rubbish writing. No-one in the role world speaks or acts like the characters presented here, save the adoptive parents. The whole thing just left a foul taste in my mouth. Juno has the baby, gives it up, and then happily goes back to strumming her guitar like nothing happened? Is that growing up and facing life's problems? In short, no. And that's what the theme of the film wanted to be about, and it miserably failed. I'm not usually so negative in my comments but I just can't believe how adored this film was by the critics, and Miss Cody got an Oscar for writing? Best Original Screenplay? The same Award that Casablanca won in 1942? Huh?",3,19,32,1 November 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Hmmm....
","This one seems to be better on reflection. After seeing it 24 hours ago, I think more highly of it than when I was actually watching it. The movie entertained me, but most of the time I was thinking 'this is pretty overrated'. Yet right now I want to watch it again! This is probably mostly due to the unique screen chemistry shared by the two leads, Paul Newman (Butch) and Redford (Sundance). The famed robbers probably weren't as charming as these two, but who cares? It's a classic character study of the extrovert, Butch, and the introvert, Sundance, who bicker but can't really live without each other. What I find striking is how this menage a trois angle, with Katherine Ross as schoolteacher Etta, plays out. She may be in love with them both, or may just have nothing better to do. They like having her around, but they are really in love with each other. Nary are they apart, and Etta fades into the background so that when she leaves we don't even notice. Ross may be accused of playing bland but I think that was what was intended with the character. Then again, director Hill had her banned off set apart from doing her scenes, so it couldn't have helped her with the part.I didn't like the sepia bits at all. The opening credits seemed ripped straight from Penn's 'Bonnie And Clyde'. And the film wasn't as funny as it makes out to be (the line 'Who ARE those guys?' wears out fast). The song 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' jars. Some scenes I really liked, others I didn't. But I'll go back to it, because I thought Newman and Redford were special together. Obviously audiences felt it too, as they teamed again later.",7,1,2,16 February 2009
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Bloody terrific
","Johnny Depp in weirdo mode for Tim Burton! This is a dark, hypnotic and thoroughly cinematic adaptation of Sondheim's successful stage musical. Great visuals, and Burton achieves a bizarre and beautiful sort of poetry with the crooning effortlessly intercut with throat slashing. Depp is the screwed-up serial killer barber, and he's a perfect fit for the role. Bonham Carter is suitably quirky as Miss Lovett, and the conclusion (sort of like Shakespeare, bodies littered across the stage and everything)left me speechless. I really liked it, even if does drag in a few places. One of 2007's best releases, and very entertaining overall.",8,1,2,14 September 2008
The Grapes of Wrath," Starkly realistic...
","...Well, as starkly realistic as Hollywood could get in the 1940's.Ford's adaptation of Steinbeck's amazing social novel is terrific. The atmosphere of the source material is brilliantly maintained. The thing that impressed me most was that the film wasn't glossed over in the Hollywood studio-style. Yes, there are some omissions in the plot to comply with the Hayes Code, but it's still very dark and realistic. The hungry children rummaging through the waste piles for a sliver of food is shockingly compelling, as are the machines sent out to destroy the farmer's houses, crushing them easily as the onlookers watch in disbelief. It feels authentic.Henry Fonda is perfectly cast as Tom Joad, the hero of the tale. Fonda's underplaying and sense of the 'everyman' suit his character perfectly. The supporting cast are terrific, and they are not glossed-over, either. Jane Darwell appears to have just jumped off the pages of Steinbeck's epic as Ma Joad. So many families made the journey from the Mid-West to California, the land of supposed 'milk and honey' (which the Joad's find out is not true), but the Joad's struggle feels very personal to us.Very depressing in content- I had to watch this film in portions simply because it overwhelmed my emotions so completely. But the Great Depression was an awful event in America's history, and it's portrayed so accurately here. Students should watch this at school to realize how lucky they've got it now, and how dangerous it would be to fall into a recession once again (it would be different now, but still have the same effect on morale). This is draining to watch, but ultimately uplifting. Ford's direction is always convincing; Steinbeck's great work is in fine hands. The black-and-white photography emphasises the bleakness and realism.10/10.",10,2,4,16 May 2006
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Dreyer's 'Passion' Has Rarely Been Equalled On Film...
","One of the single greatest performances in film history came from Carl Dreyer's amazingly powerful THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC. Renee Falconetti, in the only performance she ever committed to film, is just about as flawless as an actress can be as the persecuted French woman who is sentenced to burn on the stake, accused of witchcraft, after a highly unjust trial.Dreyer's film was a huge gamble at the time and he pulled it off astoundingly. It is amazing that the director dared to film much of the the entire first-half in close-ups of Falconetti's face as she stands trial. Falconetti's facial expressions and tragic, yet hopeful eyes beautifully transcend silent cinema. Although the first-half of the film takes place in essentially one room and involves the audience essentially watching the thoughts and reaction of one actor, it is a compelling sequence.The second half of the film focuses on Falconetti's resignation and preparation for her fate. Dreyer burns stark, profound silent images into the viewer's head and leaves them etched in the memory forever as Falconetti's dignity is corroded by her torture, head shaving and eventual burning.Dreyer, in a sense, takes a very minimalist approach to filming THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (1927) that seems to echo the German Expressionist movement (Dreyer was Danish). He instead chooses to frame the entire film around Falconetti's performance-as bare as the sets may be, her bare-boned performance towers above everything else.It is an outstanding work of cinema and one that all cinema purists should see. However, it is painful to watch at times- not because it is a 110 minute silent film with minimal inter-titles and no extravagance, but because of the painful journey we witness Falconetti go on. The final look in her eyes as the flames engulf her on the stake is forever haunting.",10,3,5,5 June 2007
Cold Mountain," 'Come back--come back to me'
","I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, thought not quite so much as 'The English Patient' (a modern-day classic). The first 20 minutes or so feel awkward, but as Inman (Jude Law) embarks on the journey back to his love Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently it is fashionable to hate Kidman at the moment, but I don't agree at all, and she does well here. I actually think that the romance between Inman and Ada is weakly developed in the script (they really don;t get much screen time together to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman give it their all and convince. Ada's journey is the crux of the film- she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything. Zellweger at first seems all wrong as Ruby, but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later scenes. The film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. Jack White, in particular, has long straggly hair and a pale rocker's complexion that look completely out of place with the setting. Cillian Murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented Irish actor in an early bit part, and Natalie Portman actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence. It's a pity that in 'The Other Boleyn Girl' she's so inadequate.",8,1,2,20 December 2008
North by Northwest," Thrill, Spills....and Hitch!
","Cary Grant is THE James Bond who never was.He was approached to play the role in the early 60's but he declined, citing that he was too old. Sean Connery got the job instead, and was a huge success. But one feels that Grant would have been the definitive Bond if he ever played the role. This, and 'Notorious', are certainly his best films for Hitchcock, and this is certainly his best Bond-type role. He stars as Roger O. Thornhill, a suave, womanising, New York advertising executive who is drawn into a web of intrigue after suffering a case of mistaken identity. He ends up being pursued across the country, unwittingly embroiling himself further in the web with his dalliances with Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint, as the Is She Good Or Is She Bad? femme)and others.Hitchock's favoured 'Wrong Man' situation is utilised perfectly here, as Grant is caught up in circumstances that he has no control over. But Grant takes it on the chin, and his charisma and comedic timing as Thornhill are excellent. This is a most entertaining and humorous Hitchcock film that maintains it's pace and action for over two hours. The suspense never lets up, as we are treated with some truly amazing sequences, including the finale atop Mt Rushmore, a UN headquarters visit, and THAT pesky crop duster. And keep in mind that these are just a few of the many, many amazing scenes here.Eva Marie Saint is so different here from the innocent Edie Doyle role in 'On The Waterfront' that garnered her an Oscar. She's matured into a sweetly seductive woman of the world who Grant falls head over heels for. Their encounter on the train is filled with corny pick-up lines and rather silly yet juicy dialogue, but it WORKS. One feels cheated when the train affair actually ends; re-winding is essential.Hitch's love of trains is also conveyed perfectly here, with the train symbolising sexual attraction and mystery (check the closing shot especially- very overt symbolism!), as Grant and Saint ride on board. We also have great villains in James Mason and Marty Landau. The very charismatic James Mason is wonderful as the trademark very charismatic Hitchcock villain, Phillip Vandamm. His trademark mellifluous voice and dark good looks (is this man not insanely attractive?)are used to great effect here. He gets many great lines.This is a re-working of Hitchcock's British film, The Thirty-Nine Steps (1935) with Robert Donat and Madeleine Carroll. Comparison is not really warranted, as they films from entirely different era's and made in different countries with vastly differing budgets. However, 'North by Northwest' jumps over the earlier effort when they are compared as just two Hitchcock films from the cannon.Made a year after 'Vertigo' bombed, 'North By Northwest' is seen by many as Hitch's safe, crowd-pleaser film. True in many ways, yet it is an unassailable classic regardless of any formulaic overtones. Grant is perfect in this rip-roaring ride full of suspense.10/10.",10,2,3,26 May 2006
The Duchess," Knightley dominates the screen in The Duchess!
","Yes, you heard right. The critical reviews have been mixed so far, but this ordinary little film-goer thought 'The Duchess' was quite wonderful, and young British leading lady Keira Knightley carries the film. She appears in almost every scene as Georgiana, an intriguing figure in royal history. Married off in her teens to the Duke of Devonshire for the sake of producing a male heir, she rebelled against the constraints of her time by indulging in extravagant partying and gambling. She became a fashion darling of the press. Even though she could not legally vote, she wheeled and dealed in political issues. She bedded a future Prime Minister and bore his illegitimate child. It's a magnificent part for any actress, but not everyone could pulls this off. Keira Knightley does.In her past few films, the actress has really left behind her awful performances in the 'Pirates of Caribbean' series (and she's still only 23). In 'The Duchess', she could easily have been swallowed up by the presence of Ralph Fiennes and those huge, elaborate costumes. But she gives a wonderful, emotional and compulsively watchable performance here. Completely convincing! Fiennes at first seems to be on auto-pilot, but a subtle movement, glance or inflection of speech suggests a man who doesn't necessarily like the times, either. Saul Dibb, previously a TV director, doesn't really do anything elaborate or unique with his direction. It plays very much like a television BBC production, and one of my few complaints of the film is that I would have liked to see some more imaginative direction. The costumes and sets are lovingly recreated, and we do gain a real sense of time and place.In supporting roles are the always satisfying Charlotte Rampling, and two newcomers in Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell. Atwell's character, Bess, forms the plot's most interesting arc. Bess is first Georgiana's friend, taking up residence in the castle at her insistence. Not too long after she has been moved in, she jumps into bed with the Duke. In Knightley's most effective scene she rips into Fiennes, as the 'one woman in England he had to choose' is her best friend. Yet a truce and intriguing mutual respect is formed between the two women, linked by the man who Georgiana refers to as 'our husband'. Atwell is a lovely presence and hopefully will do well in the future. Dominic Cooper is Charles Grey, ambitious young politician and Georgiana's eventual bedmate. Cooper tries his best but he's just miscast as Grey, he doesn't understand the complexities of his character, and he doesn't really suit the period. Still, I love tragic, forbidden romance and this angle of the film satisfied me.",9,3,5,4 October 2008
Twilight," Quite good
","Okay, I just HAD to see this one. Yep, it's a 'tween movie' (cue horrible 14 year-old girls pegging Maltesers at the back of your head while accompanying adolescent boys earnestly attempt to stick the tongue in). I felt odd even entering the cinema, and I'm only one month shy of 20. But I see no reason why I should have to justify seeing a movie, because movies are fun. Plus this one had vampires and enough forbidden teenage romance/angst to make an Emo Kid weep with ecstasy. And I quite enjoyed it! It's about a lonely, probably mildly depressed 16 year old girl (Kristen Stewart, convincing) who moves to a new school and falls for the one guy she shouldn't't--the icily beautiful and irresistible Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). Soon she discovers his secret. He's a vampire.How far vampire flicks have come since the Nosferatu-days. Movie vampires are no longer rat-like things that cause beautiful damsels to faint in distress and get rescued at the last minute by blandly handsome heroes ('Nosferatu'). They no longer look like Bela Lugosi, speak in a monotone and advance creakily to the ladies boudoir. Instead, they are more likely to turn the heroine on and make the female audience fall in love with them. That includes me. There's something sexy about vampires. Yes, this teen movie is clich√©, has moments of terrible dialogue and the acting isn't that great. But I can see why it's so successful among the teenagers of today. And Robert Pattinson can bite me any old time",7,3,7,19 January 2009
The Lives of Others," Remarkable film-making; Muhe and Koche are excellent
","THE LIVES OF OTHERS is a work that puts your faith back into the film-making of today. Nearly every component is perfect- acting, direction, writing, editing, music and more. I am sure that it will become a modern classic, and it is certainly one of the strongest films produced this decade.Muhe is brilliant as a Eadt German Stasi official who becomes emotionally involved with the suspects (a playwright and his actress lover) he is spying on. Muhe has very little dialogue in the film, and much of his acting is done with facial expression, reaction and small movements. He is superb. Sebastian Koch, who also did an excellent job in BLACK BOOK, is marvellous as the playwright, capturing his intelligence, anguish and eventual discovery. All the other cast members also put in great work- as I said earlier, the acting is near perfect.The final twenty minutes or so are shattering, and Muhe's last look at the camera (the closing shot of the film) is haunting and entirely appropriate.",10,1,2,4 April 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Absolutely wonderful!
","A completely wonderful experience! Really, the best film experiences are the hardest to fully describe, and I'm having difficulty surmising into words just what an amazing film this is. As you have probably seen from the trailer, it's the story of a man who is born in his 80's and ages backwards. No medical explanation is attempted for this 'unusual circumstance'. Director Fincher perfectly captures the magical life of Button, and really the magic of life itself. I guess you could say it poses quite a few philosophical questions on death, life and love, but in no way is it pretentious or attention-grabbing. We are just encouraged to enjoy every experience. Brad Pitt is excellent in the title role; if he doesn't get an Academy Award nomination I will eat my hat. The next best performances come from Taraji P. Henson (as Benjamin's adoptive mother) and Tilda Swinson, as an English socialite who Button has an affair with. Unfortunately Cate Blanchett is terribly mannered and so self-important and actressy as Daisy, the great love of Benjamin's life. It's a wonderful romance, and I loved every bit of it, but Blanchett, especially in her early scenes as a sort of bohemian ballerina, lacks exactly what Pitt seems to emit effortlessly- being natural. Every bit of her performance seems so carefully studied. But I can't leave this review on a negative note, because it's such an amazing movie. A true testament as to how good this film is? It went for 2 hours, 40 minutes. I could easily have sat there for another two hours.",10,1,3,28 December 2008
The Piano," Haunting and mysterious
","Technically this was not my first viewing of Jane Campion's 'The Piano'. I have been haunted by images of this film since I was 7 years old (yes, you may ask, what was a kid that young doing watching this film? Answer: I wanted to watch absolutely everything my 17 year old sister watched). Of course, I didn't understand the complexities of the character's relationships, and I couldn't understand why Ada would be attracted to a tattooed, craggy man (Harvey Keitel). At that age it's all about bland Prince Charming! But the beautiful cinematography, and the muddy 'punishment scene' stayed with me. As an adult, I view it as peculiar, but very good, film. It is quite striking how little exposition there is in this film. We never find out exactly why Ada turned mute at the age of 6. Campion never forces the issue, so we accept it as a state of being, something beyond the character's control, just as Ada and George's attraction is. I see it as a mood piece that probes female self-expression in the 19th century, but it's a film that really can't be summed up or pigeonhold. It is quite unique. Holly Hunter won the Academy Award for her Ada, her piercing gaze and ability to express a range of emotion without dialogue is very memorable. Keitel and Sam Neill are also very good, but the performance of a then 10-year old Anna Paquin stands out most. She was terrific.",8,1,4,13 October 2008
Annie Hall," Slightly Overrated, But Still A Great Film
","Woody Allen's neuroses and introspection were never so finely presented as they are in the classic 'Annie Hall'.He stars as Alvy Singer, a paranoid New Yorker comedian Jew with a decidedly neurotic view on life. After breaking up with his girlfriend Annie Hall (Diane Keaton, in an Oscar-winning performance), Alvy recounts their relationship, his life and his problems.This is one of those 'stream of consciousness' films that viewers began to lap up in the 70's. There is a very little narrative structure to the thing, and Allen breaks many boundaries. He often speaks directly to the camera, asking questions of the viewer as well as himself. Animation and out-of-body experiences are also present in this odd mix of a film. I can't really put my finger on what distinguishes this film as a classic, apart from Diane Keaton's wonderful performance and the great script.At times it is overly neurotic and veers off into unnecessary places, but Keaton brings us back every time. I enjoyed the film most when Annie was at the forefront, being all quirky and nonsensical. The overall product is bittersweet, with Alvy reminiscing the good times he has had with Annie but realising things cannot go back to what they once were. He's a Pygmalion figure, moulding and teaching Annie Hall, but inevitably she outgrows him and must move on. Still, the experience was worth it for Alvy and Allen's overall message is clear: Love's worth it, even if it hurts.",8,0,1,23 April 2006
The Graduate," Coming-of-age
","A film for the jaded, indecisive, angered youth in all of us, 'The Graduate' is as much as a coming-of-age of saga as it is a tale about a young guy's dalliance with an older, married woman.Dustin Hoffman stars as Ben Braddock, a rather awkward young man who is a little confused about his future after graduating from college with flying colours. Life seems so strange and fruitless to him, so he embarks on an affair with Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft, who wasn't much older than Dustin at the time!) out of desire for experimentation and his need to fulfill his boredom. But he ends up falling for Mrs Robinson's understanding, pretty daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross), who is much close to his age, and the older woman will stop at nothing to ensure the two can't be together.Ben is the hero of the tale, although he clearly doesn't want to be. When he replies 'You Got Me' to his father's questioning over whether the years of college were really worth it, I feel like standing up and cheering him on.Hoffman is excellent in the role; his short, gawky yet cute appearance making him a very endearing Ben. His type of actor would never have got a second look in Old Hollywood, so it is a testament to the changing times that such a film as this with such a leading man was made. Bancroft is great too as the seductive, hardened yet fragile Mrs Robinson. She is a very ambiguous character; touching in her loneliness at one minute, exasperating with her cruelty the next. One gets the sense her affair with Ben is an attempt to recapture lost youth as much as it is an avenue for sexual fulfillment. Does she try to keep Elaine away from Ben out of her own selfish motives or is she trying to protect the girl from falling into the same circumstances (marrying young, with a child, to a man she didn't love) as she did? 'The Graduate' provides an interesting character study, indeed.It also provides an interesting study of the social period that was the 60's, where long-held conventions were broken down and youth found avenues to voice their discontent after many years of confusion and anguish. Also interesting to note that the Plastics industry went through the roof after that little comment to Braddock: 'I've got one word for you, Ben: Plastics'.This is a very humorous satire, with Hoffman getting many chances for deadpan comedy. You've got to love his reactions to Bancroft in the classic seduction scene- it's very entertaining.Ross is rather weak in support, I feel a lot more could have been done with her character. This also has some acute problems with pacing throughout, that aren't really rectified in the end. However, many amazing scenes are on show throughout, and the Simon and Garfunkel (a symbol of youth) music is brilliantly used and is justifiably well-remembered. It has that stream-of-consciousness, Salinger feel to it, with Braddock probably being a variation on Holden Caulfield.9/10.",9,2,4,26 May 2006
Singin' in the Rain," The Sum Of All Parts- A Musical Celebration!
","Perhaps the true greatness of Singin' In The Rain (1952) lies not solely in it's excellent musical numbers, but the clever plot and sparkling screenplay that the song-and-dance numbers are set to. Singin' In The Rain is a rare musical in that it is also an amazing, accomplished feat of film-making.It is also amazing that this most fresh, witty and original of all musicals is, at it's most basic, a nostalgic mi sh-mash of Early Hollywood. Most components are copied- Kelly's legendary title number had already been rolled out in a creaky early talkie (with not much success) and the brilliant 'Good Mornin'' number is a re-hash of Kelly's dance with Rita Hayworth and Phil Silvers in Cover Girl's (1944) 'Make Way For Tomorrow' number. Previous stock footage of Kelly from 'The Three Musketeers'(1948) is used, and the Kelly/Reynolds relationship is very reminiscent of the March/Gaynor relationship (minus the drinking) in A Star Is Born (1937)- Kelly even resembling March in a number of scenes. It is remarkable that Singin' In The Rain did so well, as all but two of the musical numbers ('Moses Supposes, a simple, catchy, little ditty set to Kelly and O'Connor's toe-tapping, and 'Make Em Laugh', a rather blatant rip-off of the previous 'Be A Clown') were re-worked old MGM musical staples way past their use-by-date.Yet this relentless copying and re-working is what makes the film the masterpiece it remains today. It works primarily as a celebration AND an affectionate send-up of early Hollywood. It's plot, revolving around the awkward transition of the film industry from silents to talkies, takes in many actual occurrences and insider-jokes to provide a truly wonderful portrait of late 1920's Hollywood. The screenplay is deceptively hilarious yet rich in detail- those who are not overly familiar with this period of history should do some research, as these sly pokes at early Hollywood are fascinating. The more you know about classic Hollywood, early talkies and the birth of the musical genre, the more you will appreciate this.Many famous screen stars are parodied- from a heavily-accented European silent film star who dismisses the talkies as 'Vulgar!'(an obvious take on Pola Negri, who actress who didn't make the transition to sound) to the now-famous scene in Bebe Daniels' early musical Rio Rita (1929), where Bebe 'lightly taps' her leading man with a fan. Lina Lamont's (Jean Hagen) heavy Brooklyn accent (both a copy of Judy Holliday's 'Born Yesterday' voice and a jibe at Clara Bow, whose honking tones coupled with her wild partying and mental instability ruined her career)and the over-sized blonde-white wig Lina must wear (actually the wig Norma Shearer famously wore in Marie Antoinette, an MGm film from 1938!) represent Kelly and Donen's subtle parodying of the era. Rita Moreno's 'Zip Girl', vamping it at a movie premiere, is a play at Miss Bow's 'It Girl' persona. Kelly's hilarious 'I love you, I love you!' dialog is a direct reference to failed silent matin√©e idol John Gilbert, who made a flop talkie debut in His Glorious Night (1929). Kelly and Donen do misrepresent history, as Gilbert's voice, evidenced from clips, was not all that effeminate, it was in fact a combination of an outdated image, horrendous dialog, L.B Mayer's vendetta to ruin him and his own personal insecurities that led to his downfall and premature death. However, Singin' opts for a more light-hearted focus in capturing the essence of the failings of many early sound films.Aside from the history, the remarkable and captivating musical numbers are what viewers remember from the film. O'Connor's' 'Make Em Laugh' routine is a masterpiece of physicality, almost Chaplin-like in it's humor and appeal. Kelly's title number is nothing short of stunning and is justifiably one of the most memorable sequences in cinema. The Kelly/Reynolds number 'You Were Meant For Me' is both a a beautiful ballad and an ironic comment on the setting-up of the romantic musical number- a look at the artifice needed to create such an intimate moment.The ballet sequence (added after the success of 'An American In Paris' a year earlier) merges traditional balletic movements with the jazz/blues rhythms of the 'Roaring Twenties', again evoking the era. Kelly's partner in this astonishing sequence, Cyd Charisse, sports a sexy green flapper dress and a 'Lulu'- a severe page-boy cut popularized by Louise Brooks in the brilliant silent Pandora's Box. Cyd's moll is accompanied by her coin-flipping gangster boyfriend, a bizarre creation who merges the looks of Peter Lorre in 'The Maltese Falcon', the scar of Muni's Tony Camonte in Scarface (1932) and the coin-flipping of George Raft from the same film. The 'Broadway Melody' ballet is a highlight of stylized dancing, a blazing array of color, sound and movement, a parade for Walter Plunkett's terrific costume design, and a journey through the musical, with Kelly dancing in revues and as Florenz Ziegfeld in a 'Follies' tribute.In a word: Terrific.",10,1,4,3 February 2007
Some Like It Hot," Gender-bending fun!..
","...But there's more to 'Some Like It Hot' than just it's cross-dressing element. This is a terrific comedy farce that may just well be the funniest film ever made (AFI certainly agrees with me, naming 'Some Like It Hot' as the No.1 comedy of all time in their list).So many great gags and an unbelievably witty script filled with double entendres are just some of the reasons to watch this. Lemmon gives maybe his greatest comedy performance, in the deliciously over-the-top role of Jerry/Daphne. Lemmon's completely uninhibited performance in drag works well with Tony Curtis' more self-conscious Joe/Josephine. Today the modern viewer sees this film with many homosexual overtones, but the film-makers made a point to stress the pair's heterosexuality in this film. They are given a very good reason to be in drag- they are on the run from mob bosses after witnessing the St Valentine's Day massacre. Disguised as female musicians, they join an all-girls band and meet boozy singer Sugar (Monroe).Without Monroe's performance (difficultly elicited from her), this film would not be half the classic it is today. Her presence illuminated every film she was in, and her dumb-blonde demeanor belied a great acting talent. Marilyn certainly is great here as the floozy Sugar Kane who is lonely and on the look for love.Joe E. Brown has a lot of fun with his role as a rich millionaire who falls in love Lemmon's Daphne. He also gets the best line of the film. George Raft appears to be sending himself and his suspected gangster connections up in his role as Spats Colombo, the mob boss who wants Lemmon and Curtis fixed up.Very sexy dialogue, costumes from Monroe (pretty much see-through!) and the gender-bending turns from the boys combine for great fun, but some forget how Wilder achieved the great atmosphere of this film. He made a conscious decision to shoot in black-and-white not only to lessen the impact of two males playing women, but for authenticity. This is set in 1929, and Wilder wanted the gritty feel of the Prohibition-era. One is reminded of Hawks' 'Scarface' in a number of scenes (this could also be due to the presence of Raft), and there are many gags referring to the historical period. Watch the mentions of Valentino, Pickford, Fairbanks and Wall Street and you'll see what I mean.Loads and loads of FUN! 10/10.",10,11,14,20 May 2006
Psycho," Creating a Sympathetic, Multi-Layered Villain...
","Was what Hitchcock did best, and he reached his apex here in 'Psycho'. I suppose one can put the blame on Hitch for the seemingly-relentless cycle of slasher flicks that are churned out today, for 'Psycho' started the rot. Yet what terrific 'rot' this granddaddy of the horror genre is.So much has already been said about 'Psycho' that adding a comment seems unnecessary, but I'll try and give a brief summary of my feelings towards this film: Hitchcock created one of his most fascinating characters (and one of cinema's absolute finest) in Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins gives a performance that is nothing short of brilliant as the conflicted protagonist, evoking both sympathy for his loneliness and disgust for his actions. Hitchcock manipulates the audiences feelings towards the villain, as he did memorably in the earlier 'Notorious' and 'Shadow Of A Doubt'. Perkins would never break free of this role for the rest of his life, and his Norman is truly haunting. His chilling final scene (his face) will blow you away.Our supporting cast give varied performances. Miles is excellent as usual in her role as Lila Crane; her and Perkins carry the acting honours away. Both John Gavin and Janet Leigh are reasonably good (Leigh handles the notorious 'shower scene' very well), but noticeably weaker in support (particularly Gavin- he just isn't a leading man).Hitch shot this in black-and-white for a purpose- the gore of his scenes would not go down well in colour. Also, shooting in black-and-white gives 'Psycho' an even darker, mysterious quality, with Hitchcock's brilliant use of lighting and shadow to create mood and suspense. It has the feel of a low-budget, roadhouse film, and this effect suits it perfectly.The suspense flows nicely throughout, apart from a rather slow and, at times, frankly irritating, opening sequence. Hitch takes a long time to set this one up, yet once we reach the Bates residence we know that we are in for one hell of a ride- that's when the picture becomes great. The only other significant downer comes near the end where the shocking order of events are explained through some rather (for today) quaint psychobabble. Apparently it was added in to try and explain the horror and motives to terrified audiences in the 60's, yet it comes across as hokey today.'Psycho' deals with then-shocking elements of theft, necrophilia, incest (you'll look at the term 'Mummy's Boy' on an entirely new level after watching this), adultery and murder. This was shocking on first release and it's content is still powerful today, resonating with a modern audience.The murders are handled brilliantly- the amazing, classic shower scene that takes everything we have viewed in the first half of the film and distorts it completely. It is brutal, compelling and, accompanied by Bernard Hermann's screeching violin score, quite terrifying. We don't actually see the knife jabbing into Leigh, yet we still see so much. In this, Hitch effectively 'shifted' the role of key protagonist from one character to another.It's so atmospheric- look at the visual effects used in the Bates Motel, the predatory birds (a recurring Hitchcock motif)that surround Norman as he eats with Marion Crane (another 'bird' from 'Phoenix'). Vera Miles searching Mother's bedroom for clues. The revealing scene with 'Mother' and the swinging light bulb.To say any more would be to spoil a fascinating cinema experience- just go out and SEE IT.9/10.",9,0,0,1 July 2006
All Quiet on the Western Front," Holds up extremely well today, almost 80 years on from its original release
","A masterpiece, and one of the greatest films of all time is Milestone's war classic 'All Quiet On The Western Front'. I still find it remarkable that the film was even made in 1930, given that the novel the film is based on was told from the German perspective. A truly harrowing, and one feels, incredibly realistic, portrayal of the horrors of WW1, this is uncomfortable, yet essential and compelling viewing. Lew Ayres gives a beautiful performance as the young soldier protagonist. For a film made when sound was in its infancy, it is astonishingly fresh on a technical level. The camera-work is innovate and imaginative, the dialogue well-written and considered, the directing excellent, and the acting profound. An extremely important film on many levels.",10,6,8,17 June 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," Tender Humanity
","Harper Lee's novel is required reading for many school students, and with good reason. It is a terrific exploration of childhood, growing up, the individual and what the individual can achieve, the justice system and human values. Atticus Finch is surely one of the most heroic and true characters ever created, and Gregory Peck does a marvellous job portraying him in the film version of 'To Kill A Mockingbird'.His interaction with the kids is the thing I enjoy most about this film-how both the adult and the child grow to understand each other through the course of the film's events. Atticus is a great father figure, in the fact that he isn't perfect, but strives to do the best he can, as a widower, by his children. When I was a child, I used to sit and watch this and pretend Gregory Peck was my real father instead of my own (we don't have a very close relationship), because of his sincerity and goodness of heart. Peck's understated qualities as an actor perfectly suited the role, it is one of the best male dramatic performances you'll see.The child actors are excellent also- particularly young Mary Badham as Scout, the little girl whose eyes we see the action with. The use of black-and-white cinematography conveys the mood of Depression-era small-town America perfectly, and Mulligan's direction is almost flawless. The courtroom sequences are some of the best ever put to the screen; filled with high emotion as Peck, the town's most upstanding citizen, puts his reputation on the line to defend a black man accused of rape. Due to the town's (and America at large)racial prejudices, the trial is a foregone conclusion even though the black man is obviously innocent, but Atticus' true character and faith shine through.This is an amazing film adaptation of a powerful novel.10/10.",10,3,6,26 May 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Romantic take on the Dracula tale
","Francis Ford Coppola's interpretation of Bram Stoker's legendary tale seems to have plenty of mixed reviews. Many Dracula purists loathe it, some love it's romance and stunning images. Even though I've read the novel, I'm no purist, and I thoroughly enjoyed this take on the novel. In Coppola's hands Dracula is a tortured soul who searches for his lost love across oceans of time. Gary Oldman's Dracula is completely different from Bela Lugosi in that he is sexy! I actually think Oldman's performance and the ramped-up eroticism is closer to what Bram Stoker actually intended in his novel. I remember all these wonderful descriptions of draining veins, re-birth, flesh and women who seem more turned on than scared by the vampire. It's an incredibly visual film, and great to look at. Winona Ryder is little and sweet as Mina, the re-incarnation of Dracula's beloved Elisabeta. Keanu Reeves is just a terrible actor and I wonder why he was cast as Jonathon Harker. He was a teen heart-throb at the time, so maybe it was to broaden the appeal of the movie? Maybe Coppola wanted a conventional pretty-boy who acts like a piece of wood juxtaposed with the interesting Oldman, to make him doubly attractive? I was a little bit disappointed with Anthony Hopkin's performance, by his standards he's not really memorable. Overall, I liked the film a lot.",8,0,1,11 October 2008
The Reader," Good, but I was vaguely disappointed by Winslet's performance
","I was vaguely disappointed by this one. I thought it was a good film, well worth the time, but I just didn't see the greatness of Kate Winslet's performance. Sure, she's excellent as Hanna, the former SS prison guard who has an affair with a young man (David Kross, amazing), but I wasn't bowled over by her acting. It's a thoughtful drama that quietly makes you question yourself, although I don't think the *big secret* is handled very well-- it all seems rather predictable. Stephen Daldry directs and he's very good at period drama, capturing his settings well and bridging between the decades with ease. The cinematography is lovely. However, in a film that's very much about the power of literature, the writing at times seems sloppy. I've never read the Bernhard Schlink novel, so maybe someone could shed some light on this one for me. Did it fail in it's translation from novel to the screen?",7,2,4,4 May 2009
Defiance," Interesting and Entertaining
","At the height of WW2, four Jewish brothers (Daniel Craig, Liev Schreiber, Jamie Bell and George MacKay) and hide deep in the Belarussian forest to evade the Nazis that have murdered their parents and countless others. Other persecuted Jews join them in their struggle to keep their freedom and fight against Nazism. This is the basic premise of 'Defiance', an interesting, entertaining movie that, while too long, is alternately action-packed and quietly moving. It's primarily about their struggle for freedom, but its also a study of the relationships between brothers and group dynamics. Craig of course is a sturdy leading man, even if he doesn't quite convince at times in his role. I thought Liev Schreiber outdid 007 himself in the 'he-man' role-- once Schreiber gets the machine gun in his hands, you know they're going to be safe. Jamie Bell also looks to have a promising future. The main problem with the film is it's weak pacing and often sluggish writing. Craig's inspiring speeches feel very written and the film just ebbs along at times without anything happening. The female love interests are very underwritten. However, the performances across the board are good and the cinematography (beautiful winter scenes) and score are excellent.",7,1,3,4 May 2009
Stalag 17," The essential POW drama!
","This exciting POW drama has to be one of Wilder's best films. Like nearly all his work, it is extremely well-written, cynical and very witty. It also surprises how much (dark) humour Wilder managed to pull out this situation.William Holden (winner of the Best Actor Oscar, an interesting and worthy choice by the Academy) stars as Sefton, a Sergeant in a POW camp in Germany in WW2, who may or not be selling out his fellow soldiers in order to get a better deal from the Nazi's. Another thing that really impressed me was how Wilder sustained the suspense of the plot (Who is the traitor?) for so long. Wilder encourages us, nay, implores us through his silently roving camera and objectivity, to question everyone. And we do, from Sefton to 'Animal' to Joey.This should be regarded as one of Wilder's best films. It's exceptional film-making. Wilder's films remain so fresh today because of his near-perfect scripts that have possess honesty instead of sentimentality, and his willingness to let his characters and story impress instead of burdening the film with showy technique. He also took on a range of different story lines. Bravo, Billy Wilder!",10,7,10,7 April 2008
Before Sunrise," Quite lovely
","Taking a simple premise (two twenty-something travelers, a French woman and an American man), director Linklater creates something lovely and magical in giving us 'Before Sunrise'. Floppy-haired Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and charming Celine meet on a train, and spontaneously decide to spend the night together exploring Vienna. They talk, fall in love, and talk some more. They then go their separate ways in the morning, but the joy is in the amazing experience they have just shared.Ever had a special moment with a person where you completely lose track of time and just spend hours in conversation, discovering someone and yet feeling you have known them all their lives? I have. While my experience was on a platonic level, and didn't involve wine, Vienna or Ethan Hawke, the moment is something you treasure and that's why 'Before Sunrise' struck a real chord with me. Believe me, there is plenty to talk about when you're with the right person.Hawke is certainly not a great actor, but he is perfect for the role of Jesse. Delpy is charming and unaffected as Celine. While she is the more socially-conscious of the two, I was glad the film didn't deviate into some of the socio-political claptrap that really dogs some of the newer films. By the film's end, Celine goes off on her train and Jesse on the bus, and Linklater takes us back to all the places they have visited in a series of shots. His point? Vienna is lovely, but it's the people that inhabit the places that give it colour. And it's even better when shared with someone special.",8,1,2,9 August 2008
Saboteur," A Worthy Hitchcock Film With Some Terrific Suspense Sequences
","This plot-driven early American Hitchcock film bears more than a few similarities to the director's earlier British offering, THE 39 STEPS (1935). Both films involved an innocent man accused of a crime he did not commit (a common theme in Hitchcock films), who is forced to go on a cross-country chase to clear his name. It's a neat warm-up for NORTHY BY NORTHWEST (1959) and seems to be a 'feeler' film for Hitchcock (if there is such a term)- he is feeling his way across the American continent in SABOTEUR (1942), investigating a cross-section of the American way of life and it's many famous landmarks.Robert Cummings (very young here) and Priscilla Lane (in a rare leading-lady role) are the male and female leads who are drawn together when Cummings is accused of sabotage in a factory explosion (his best friend is also killed in the blast)and finds himself a wanted criminal. Lane is the woman who is initially mistrustful, yet later warms to him, falls in love with him and vows to help him.As SABOTEUR( 1942)is plot-driven, unlike other Hitchcock films there is little deep assessment of character. Cummings and Lane are likable as the two leads (Lane bearing a striking resemblance to a young Barbara Stanwyck here)yet don't really hit any new acting heights (though I much prefer Cummings in this film to his bland role in DIAL M FOR MURDER). However, the romance between the two lead characters is well handled by the actors and is quite touching.The film is built around set pieces and an intriguing bunch of supporting characters. Most memorable are the slick villain and the blind man who Cummings lands upon when on the run. The script is generally good, although a few overly-patriotic, distracting speeches (though this was made in the middle of WW2) accompanied by an intrusive, jarring score hamper the production.The set pieces and suspense sequences make SABOTEUR (1942) a worthy entry in the Hitchcock cannon. This is the film where a man hangs off the Statue Of Liberty (no doubt a studio model)with his jacket thrillingly tearing at the seams. This oft-imitated shot is one of Hitchcock's most memorable moments of suspense.Hitchcock also recognizes the irony and fallacies of the American lifestyle in SABOTEUR (1942). It is deeply ironic that Montgomery is shown the most help and sympathy by a blind man, an ordinary truck driver and members of a traveling freak show, whilst the rich, outwardly decent and honest ranch owner is really a part of the Anti-American establishment.Interestingly, Hitchcock practically lifted one key scene of SABOTEUR (1942) straight into his later work NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959). The early scene which has Montgomery going to a luxurious property and finding himself in mortal danger foreshadows Cary Grant and James Mason's first meeting in NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959). Like the Grant film, the whole set-up of the ranch is a complete fake- a maid even pulls a gun on Montgomery! Hitchcock also borrows from THE 39 STEPS (1935) a scene involving Montgomery, handcuffed in a police car, being stopped by a mob of sheep. It is fascinating to see how SABOTEUR (1942) interrelates with other key Hitchcock works.All in all, SABOTEUR (1942) is a worthy Hitchcock films that serves a viewing. This plot-driven vehicle is full of memorable suspense moments and deals with many emerging Hitchcockian themes and concerns in it's action-packed running time.",8,2,4,4 June 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," Makes you feel like you can touch the sky...or at least win the million!
","The film that's probably going to Best Picture at the Oscar's isn't brilliant, but it's mostly excellent, very enjoyable, and such a crowd-pleaser. Danny Boyle takes a scenario most Western viewers are familiar with (the show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?) and sets it against one underdog slumdog's journey to winning the ultimate prize. Of course I already knew how the film would end (very happy, with dancing all round), because it's a Bollywood hybrid, and the fact that the promo posters are all so brightly coloured and happy looking. You can also tell pretty early on that The Three Muskeeters will be the big question. Even if it is obvious, it's utterly irresistible and that's why audiences and critics are loving it. It took me about 15-20 minutes to adjust to the very frenetic filming style (shot after shot), but I enjoyed it's energy. Dev Patel is cute as the lead.",9,0,1,2 February 2009
The Breakfast Club," The 80's style may have outdated, but the heart hasn't
","I was born in 1989, so I don't actually remember a thing about the 80's, the decade that infamously gave us the worst hairdo's and movies (though that's debatable- I think its quite a swell decade). Lucky I have great flicks like 'The Breakfast Club' to turn to. I have seen the concept re-worked on many sitcoms and teen drama shows, so I didn't really find too many surprises, plot-wise, with this film. Five high school kids, all representing 'types', are stuck in detention together one Saturday. They can't stand or understand each other, of course, but with some shouting and group pot-smoking, they get to. While the slang may be dated, the sharp dialogue and engaging performances are not. Considering 95% of the film takes place in a single room, the fact that it never outstays its welcome, and is purely entertaining yet thoughtful, is quite a triumph. The teens (including Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall and Nelson)are obvious clich√©s, but they are meant to be-- so we can pick apart that stereotype too. My teen experience wasn't quite like theirs (we don't have as much of the cliques here in Australia), but I found a bit of myself in each character.",9,0,1,20 May 2009
The Birds," When birds go bad
","One of Hitchcock's favourite recurring motifs gets a thorough run-around here. Birds are a presence in many Hitchcock films, from 'Sabotage' to 'Psycho'. In his 1963 effort, Hitch went all out with his favourite species, and churned out an unusual and decidedly macabre product.The whole film is unsettling, not just the bird attacks. The love story between Hedren and Taylor is generally not romantic, more strange than anything. His mother (another favourite Hitchcock theme) tends to dominate proceedings, and Hedren's own attachment to Taylor (following him to another town to deliver a pair of lovebirds?!) borders on obsession. The set-up is very flimsy, with the remarkable Jessica Tandy saving the production, acting-wise, in her scenes. Hedren marks a fall in the quality of Hitchcock's blondes; she is an actress of limited talent and unremarkable beauty. One wonders why Hitchcock became so obsessed with her.However, despite the dodgy plot and wooden acting performances by the leads, there are some very, very good sequences here. The bird attacks are magnificently handled by Hitchcock, and they are disturbingly realistic (apparently Hedren herself was set upon by real-live birds in Hitch's effort for realism- then again, Hitchcoc's leading ladies often got the worst of it terms of violence and ill fate). One wonders at the reactions of a 60's audience towards scenes of a man pecked to death, his eye sockets empty and splattered with blood. The special effects were remarkable in their day, and they hold up pretty well, too. The electronic musical score (composed of bird noises) is chiefly memorable and effectively used here.Many critics have noted that the sudden, and unwarranted, bird attacks seem to reflect the growing fear of nuclear warfare in the 1960's. Interesting theory.A friend told me of a childhood memory involving a viewing of 'The Birds'. She was about 8 years old, living in Holland, and had just watched 'The Birds' on television for the first time. It scared her, most notably because great flocks of birds used to come right up to their windows at night, pecking on the glass, as they lived by the lakes. Her brother and herself both slept at the foot of their mother and father's bed that night. Yes, this film does give a person chills, and even made me (usually a cynic when it comes to horror) have a second look at the next crow that I came across. Birds have now been revealed to be a much more intelligent species than initially thought, so 'The Birds' has added significance.One of Hitchcock's last genuinely good films.6/10.",6,1,4,12 May 2006
The Wizard of Oz," An Endurable Fantasy...Will Continue To Last For Many Years Yet...
","Probably the world's most-watched film (GONE WITH THE WIND running a close second), THE WIZARD OF OZ is an enduring, magical piece of fantasy that has permeated popular culture like no other film before or since. There are hundreds of unforgettable, instant-classic moments in the film, with the Yellow Brick Road, Dorothy and Toto, the songs, Garland's dazzling ruby red slippers, sepia-toned Kansas and the closing line 'There's no place like a home!' just a few of the wondrous delights that THE WIZARD OF OZ offers.It is hard to believe that the filing of 'Oz' was so fraught with problems when you view the finished product. It seems a thing of absolute perfection, with Garland's casting a stroke of genius. Her wistful interpretation of 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' is the stuff of legend. The spellbinding Technicolour photography is still a massive achievement, as is Oz, the utopia land of dreams and magic.Most audiences discover the film in childhood, and they will be pleased to find out that the film is just as magical when viewed as an adult, perhaps many years later, if not more.",10,18,22,15 June 2007
From Here to Eternity," A Hollywood Great
","This is one of the finest examples of Hollywood craftsmanship during the studio system in the 'Golden Age' of film. 'From Here To Eternity' is perhaps the most famous of all war films, yet very little action is seen. Rather, this is a human drama that shows the 'other side' of war.The key ingredient that makes 'From Here To Eternity' work is it's fantastic cast. Sure, this was always going to be a big hit because of it's subject matter, but the reason it remains so critically acclaimed toward is because of the vivid performances. Montgomery Clift turns in one of his finest portrayals as army private Prewitt. A champion boxer before he came to the Hawaii base, Prewitt resists joining the boxing company, and his new captain and army mates make his life living for it. Clift is at his tortured best here, brilliant in his loneliness and confusion. Lancaster's performance is the better known today (because of his famous frolic with Kerr on the beach), but Clift exceeds him here in talent and depth of feeling.That said, Lancaster is very good as the second-in-command Milton Warden who falls in love with his senior's wife, Karen Holmes. Lancaster and Kerr make movie magic in their love scenes, sharing wonderful chemistry. Kerr's performance is amazing also. She was cast against type here as the nymphomaniac wife- Kerr, the English rose, generally played English roses. Kerr shows she has range in the role and incredible acting talent. Nice Donna Reed is also cast against type here as a sort of 'good-time girl' Lorene, who Clift falls in love with. Reed and Sinatra won Best Supporting Oscars for their performances. Indeed, Sinatra's turn is more presence and charisma than great acting skill, but he proved he was more than just a crooner in this one.A range of classic scenes here- the justifiably memorable 'beach scene' between Kerr and Lancaster, Clift's emotional bugle playing etc. The final scene though, between Kerr and Reed, is what gets me.This film brings out emotion from it's audience like very few others. Through focusing on character interaction rather than stunning battle scenes like many other war dramas have done, by the time Pearl Harbour is inevitably attacked by the Japanese we really feel a connection with this group of people. Zinnemann's direction never fails either. Many have compared 'Eternity' to the modern-day film 'Pearl Harbour' (2001) because of it's similar subject matter. That's where the similarity ends. FHTE is emotional and deeply felt, 'Pearl Harbour' is gimmicky and more concerned with special effects than plot development. If you are faced with a choice between seeing the two, run towards 'From Here To Eternity' and don't look back. FHTE is a true monument to cinema and acting.10/10.",10,9,10,5 May 2006
Atonement," Wonderful
","While it didn't hold as much power for me when viewed on DVD, compared to a theatre viewing, this is still an excellent work from director Joe Wright. I have read Ian McEwan's beautifully written, but nearly impossible to film, novel, and Wright really does an amazing job in bringing it to the screen. I have to argue with both camps who say its either about atoning for past wrongs or the perspective of the writer. Great works of literature and great films are rarely concerned with just one central theme- there are so many amazing parts to this film, and things to think about. The acting from an ensemble cast is throughly excellent. The young actress playing Briony got the Oscar nomination, but its Redgrave who really ties the threads together, and her appearance packs a huge emotional punch. That said, Romola Garai, one of my favourites, is unnervingly perfect as Briony, too. Knightley is growing into a better actress in leaps and bounds with each film, and McAvoy is the perfect Robbie.I still think that the famous one-take beach scene is a piece of 'showy' direction, but it doesn't really detract from the film overall. The film begins sort of like a Merchant-Ivory production (and I love those films!), with rich and beautiful English characters pondering over life while smoking copious amounts of cigarettes, which may be off-putting for some viewers. But it becomes something different entirely, and it really is wonderful. My favourite scene? McAvoy and Knightley's brief encounter in the tea shop. So poignant.",9,2,5,25 August 2008
