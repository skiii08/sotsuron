The Benchwarmers," Hilarious Laugh out Loud comedy!
","This movie is probably my favourite Sport Comedy I have seen by far (That includes The Longest Yard!) It was very childish humour at times but thats what made it so funny! This is a 100% Family comedy but I watched it with a few friends and it had us rolling around laughing all night! I rated this 10 for it's never ending attempts of making me laugh, and each attempt was successful! Great comedy for everyone! Another thing this movie covers is bullies around schools and young kids, not just in America but all over the world, it gives you a good feeling that the kids that get bullied are ganging up in numbers and getting their own back, it's a comedy with a feel good twist. A definite recommendation!",10,0,3,22 May 2007
