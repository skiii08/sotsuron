Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I hope this isn't the future of film...
","America is being sold bill of goods at the box office. In the past few years what the majority of Americans consider good film (Titanic, Jurassic Park, The Phantom Menace), is sub-moronic.  While I will agree that these films are visually enticing they lack good scripting and acting. Does Hollywood think that their target market is 13 year old boys and girls?In the original Star Wars although the scripting was mediocre, it had likable and memorable characters that were witty. The Phantom Menace had no likable characters that were either dull or trying to be blatantly and mostly annoyingly funny.  How many JarJar toys is Lucas expecting to sell? I was very surprised I thought that Neeson would have at least provided a more memorable performance (he was phenomenal in Rob Roy).In closing it is sad when a director starts making film for the almighty dollar. Lucas didn't do this with the original Star Wars films and it unfortunately in his latest effort, or lack thereof all too clear.",5,0,1,21 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A decent film that already has continuity problems...
","The film was decent, but not great.  I wish OB1 would have mis-handled his light saber and took Jar Jar's head off but that didn't happen, oh well.The effects were great and the little boy who portrayed Anakin did a great job.  Liam Neeson and Ewan MagGregor also did a fine.I found the plot to be a bit weak.  C'mon a 10 year old boy building a droid and a pod racer and he's supposed to be a slave?  There also exist some continuity problems that Lucas will have to address such as Anakin Skywalker cannot be an only child, as Luke Skywalker lived with his aunt and uncle's farm on Tatooine in the first movie.  I found the pod racing scene to be a bit weak also, I read another comment on this board about the scene being stolen from Ben Hur I concur with that assessment.  I also find it interesting that technology goes backwards in this film.  Robots fighting in this movie as opposed to stormtroopers who are humans 60 years later?Maybe the smartest thing for directors to do would be to stop trying to make sequels and prequels.  The only reason Lucas did this for was the greenback and his latest 'effort' and I use that term lightly, shows this all too clearly.6 out of 10 stars",5,0,1,30 June 1999
Notting Hill," Julia Roberts cannot act...
","My wife and I have just finished watching this horribly long, tedious film on Direct TV.  Aside from a few humorous quips from Hugh Grant and his roommate Spike, this was a predictable, typical romantic comedy.  Does the general public really enjoy watching boring and mindless females in these sappy love stories (Roberts, Winslet and Bullock)?  I cannot recall one memorable line that was uttered from Julia's large mouth (probably one of the reasons that she's so popular with men) in this film.  I also found the relationship between Grant and Roberts totally unbelievable in both the sense that an actress with Roberts IQ would never go for a poor bookstore owner, and that there was just no reason for Roberts to have ever went for Grant in the first place.  Let's leave these far fetched romantic 'love at first sight' stories to Disney cartoons.

Pearl Harbor," Why Do We Have to Turn Every Film into a Romance Film?
","Pearl Harbor was a significant event in American history. One interesting enough without the addition of soap opera melodrama stuck in the middle of the film.I should have turned it off during the very cheesy champagne scene. Too bad the cork didn't penetrate Affleck's skull and kill him right then and there.I mean really, did we need the added melodrama of a 'torn between two lovers' plot? How trite. 'Rafe I really love her'. Well duh, you boned her and now she is having your child, I hope that is the case. Wouldn't the attack on Pearl Harbor been enough drama to concentrate on? Too bad too, the CGI effects of the attack were actually quite palatable. Instead we have to endure blubbering females in a Naval hospital in the midst of the attack screaming 'oh no what do I do?'. What do you think you should do? Maybe attempt to save some lives? Then of course we have the ending where of course Dudley Do Right wins the good looking female after the dopey looking male that knocked up the good looking female dies in a Chinese field. How utterly convenient.Thankfully I didn't pay to see this rubbish in the theaters.",3,1,2,30 August 2010
Titanic," A Titanic loser...
","My wife and I have just finished watching, or shall I say wasted our time watching this movie.  The script was obviously written or geared towards 13 and 14 year old girls.  A few observations:# 1  Why would a character as shallow and ignorant as the one Winslow portrayed fall for DeCaprio?  Should we believe that she would leave Zane's character who is a multi-millionaire?  The ignorant character that she portrayed would have never married a homeless painter.# 2  I have never seen so many stereotypes in one movie.  Rich snobbish people, drunken Irish and English people.# 3  Dolphins do not habitate the North Atlantic.# 4  When it's 30 degrees outside you can see your breath.# 5  When it's 30 degrees outside you can't survive in water for more than 3 minutes.# 6  This movie is a plain and simple cornball.  I can see why it isn't in the IMDB top 250 after watching it.4 stars out of 10 for the special effects.",4,2,3,8 October 1999
Titanic," Boy wins trip on titanic, poor boy meets rich girl, They fall in love, ship sinks...
","Please don't think I am just a male coming here to bombard Titanic.  My wife and I watched it together on HBO the other evening and she concurs with me about the following summary.Why did James Cameron need 3 hours to tell this story?  This was one of the longest and most tedious films I have ever watched.  The contrived storyline was incredibly dull and unbelieveable.  Come on folks do you really think Winslet would have fallen in love with baby faced DiCaprio in real life? Like a shallow character like Winslet would have left a millionaire for a person that doesn't even have a home.  Also, DiCaprio would have been never invited to dinner from steerage.  Above all of that there was no chemistry that existed between DiCaprio and Winslet.  As far as the effects were concerned. I don't know what all the hype was as the effects looked very fake.  Granted I watched it on my TV on HBO and not at the movies mind you. Thank God I did watch it at home I would have been very angry at myself if my wife and I had spent 7 dollars to see this film.  I agree with the other negative comments on this board.  People who say this is good film, don't know what good film is.  Try watching Casablanca and you will understand my character chemistry comment above.",4,2,3,11 June 1999
Titanic," Great film if you lack a college degree
","This film must only appeal to a person with the mentality of someone who has gone as far as the 8th grade.  If you want to see real film watch Shawshank Redemption or the Godfather.  The dialogue in this film is an insult to anyone's intelligence who has went past high school education-wise.  The most terrible line in the film?  'Jack I'm flying!!!'  I felt like saying great keep flying off of the bow of this ship so this movie will end, you obese sow.  This movie was very painful.  By the way, this film was and is not 'awesome' or 'way cool' as some have stated.  The approving comments below and their lack of grammatical accuracy, just proves that people who like this film are trailer trash who do not have a good grasp on the king's English.",4,2,5,27 November 2002
Titanic," Terrible and too long...
","I wish someone would tell me what made this such a box office hit with it's rich people bad, poor people good theme.  I would also like to know why it took 3 hours to tell this story, the movie was outrageously slow in most parts.  The acting was also terrible, and there was no visible chemistry that existed between DiCaprio and Winslet.  I have liked DiCaprio in other works i.e. Man in the Iron Mask and I think he has a bright future. The only decent character was Kathy Bates, playing the part of a Nevus Riche socialite.The scenes where they show the boat on the water look very fake.  I would hate to see what Cameron paid to make these scenes.  Also, how did DiCaprio survive for that long in sub-freezing waters?This movie would be great if you were a 13 year old girl who has never had exposure to good film.  On an adult level however I am surprised at the fact that many people liked it because there are many more films out there that are much worthier of praise than this piece of fluff.",4,2,5,17 May 1999
Titanic," A Titanic disaster of a film...
","Judging by the grammar of the comments by the people who like this film on this board, all I can say is that these 'film critics' must be 13-year-old females.  It's a sad commentary on our society that most people who watched this film need a simplistic dialogue to understand a film.  The dialogue left nothing to the imagination as it was trying so hard to stereotype everyone in this film.  Here's a clue; rich people are not all bad and poor people are not all beer-swilling drunkards.  The other stereotype you had was Jack the typical poor, starving artist.  Then you had Billy Zane the villain, who was I assume was supposed to act and look like Snidely Whiplash (dark hair, dark clothing) from a Dudley Doright cartoon.  I'm surprised they didn't put a moustache on him.  And let's not forget Rose's rich up-tight mother (the rich are all uptight and snobbish you know), who is automatically supposed to allow a gambling, low life, starving artist delve right into the family fortune. The effects were in fact good, but If you need your movie dialogue spoon fed to you, then this is the movie for you.",4,1,5,8 May 2000
Signs," Terrible
","Swing away Merrill, how lame, Gibson remembers to tell this to Phoenix's character after Gibson's flashback to his wife dying in between the car? The fake and contrived 'crying' scene at their 'last supper'? Gibson's daughter is obsessed with having water in glasses and conveniently we find that water is how to kill the aliens? Maybe the poison didn't enter his son's lungs as he was having an asthma attack? His son survives yet we are to believe that this is some miracle? Lame script and thoroughly boring.P.S., shame on the writers for the obvious religious undertones in this film.2 out of 10",2,2,3,21 January 2005
A Night at the Roxbury," A funny movie...
",Who hasn't gone clubbing and not seen 2 'swingin' single guys' in love with themselves like the 2 young men portrayed in this film?  I went to college in the 80's and you could always guarantee you would see 2 guidos like this in any bar that you went to.  The only problem is that the 2 characters in the movie weren't driving a Trans Am with a gold emblem on the hood like the people I used to run into in the 80's. Bravo to the script and to the soundtrack for taking me back to my 'clubbing' days in the 80's.,7,2,2,25 May 1999
