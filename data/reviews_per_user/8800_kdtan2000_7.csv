Mission: Impossible III," Not a bad action flick
","Went to catch the show last night..To be honest, I did have some trepidation as recently I've become quite bored with Tom Cruise and his acting (or limited acting).Overall, I would classify this as an okay action popcorn flick. i.e. you won't come out of the cinema feeling like you didn't get your money's worth, but neither will you come out of the cinema thinking you have just watched the best movie of the year.The story line is fairly straight forward, although there are a couple of plot holes. There are to be fair, there are a couple of twists that I personally did not expect.Action wise, it was pretty good. Some high tech toys, lots and lots of explosions and a decent pace throughout. Shot on location in a few interesting places, which was also good.The script was generally well written, but no memorable one-liners. Acting wise, Cruise did well, although roles like this are pretty much his bread and butter roles. His love interest I thought did pretty well and there was reasonable chemistry between them.As to how it rates compared to the previous two, I would actually say I liked this one the most.",6,0,1,9 May 2006
Star Trek," Stunning.
","I am not a huge trekkie. But i have followed the original series, through to TNG.It was sad after the last star trek movie, when one realised that the movie franchise seemed to have run its course.However, this movie was am amazing accomplishment and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is head and shoulders above any of the other Star Trek movies that have been made. The tight script, very well casted actors, special effects. well, basically i can only echo all the other comments that have been made here.The best thing about it, is that it sets the scene for future movies, which i very much look forward to seeing.",10,4,13,12 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," Very Disappointing
","I was very much looking forward to this. Christian Bale, a terminator movie, it had all the ingredients for success..But, after the credits rolled, i walked out of the cinema feeling somewhat, deflated. the friend i was with also felt the same way.in a way, its hard to put down exactly what was wrong with the movie. the cinematography, CGI was all okay. the acting was also okay.i think it was generally that the script was a bit poor, the story was also kinda draggy. also, i was expecting a lot more men v terminator epic kind of battles, but apart from a couple of fight scenes, a lot of them were repetitions of previous terminator movies.as my friend said, all in all, it was very predictable.the other nagging thing that i had, was the huge number of plot holes in the movie which just didn't ring true.i mean, they are quite a few years into the way, and they are still able to field aircraft and helicopters (which crash or get blown up regularly)? whats up with that.and how can skynet allow them to just operate airbases etc like that.the weapons (and their effectiveness) in this show also don't really make much sense. they seem to be much more effective here with standard carbines, than in the previous terminators... that just didn't make any sense to me.so apparently we are led to believe, that kyle reese is to be termninated. but, when he is captured, instead of just killing him they put him in lock up? again.. just didn't make any sense with me.and oh, john connor, can infiltrate an entire skynet base, just by himself, and with an eye taken from a terminator? that was just ridiculous.finally, the way that they blow up the aircraft on the bridge.. that was also nonsensical and defied the laws of gravity.. i think the director was looking at too many transporter movies when he planned that scene.all in all, very very disappointed.",4,1,3,31 May 2009
Pan's Labyrinth," Best Movie of the Year
","I wasn't actually going to see this movie because I thought it was just an all out horror movie. But I chanced upon some really good reviews so I caught it over the weekend.Although it's the only movie I've seen in the new year, I really don't think I will see a better film. Everything about this film was perfect. Casting, acting, storytelling, special effects/ visuals and cinematography.The premise of the story is quite simple.Girl goes with pregnant mother to meet stepfather, who is captain of a unit fighting the rebels at the end of the Spanish civil war.During her stay, she comes across a fairy who leads her to Pan. She is told she is a princess from another kingdom, and to win her way back she needs to perform 3 tasks.These tasks are juxtaposed against the real life situation that she finds herself in and they are merged seamlessly, right up to the edge of your seat climax. Aside from the tasks she is performing, there are a couple of other sub-plots, including a rebel working in the household and the stepfather's fight against them.The movie really isn't what I would call a horror movie. But it is dark. And one of the creatures she comes across is genuinely scary. Would make freddy Krueger seem like a baby kitten.After watching dribble like Eragon, it was a pleasure again to watch a well written and acted film. All of the actor's performances were stellar. From the sadistic stepfather, to the helpless and sick mother, to the stoic and brave housekeeper and finally to the two other main protagonists, ofelia and the faun played by Doug Jones.Please do go watch this movie. The only pity about this movie, is that it will probably only win Best Foreign language movie at the Oscars, when by right it is a no brainer to win in the main category.",10,2,4,7 January 2007
Quantum of Solace," A lot of action but little else
","There were a lot of action sequences in this movie.. from the beginning vehicle chase through to the end.however, they lacked the really big stunt impact, of previous bond outings.. and a lot of it was really just chasing and fighting and jumping over buildings.judi dench and daniel craig did commendably well.. but that was about it.the ending, was a real let down and very anti climactic. there were also a lot of loose ends that were not followed up.all in all, i did not think this was anywhere near as good as CR.",5,51,97,5 November 2008
Stardust," Everything a movie should be.
","I went to see this by chance yesterday. I had not heard about it, nor seen any previews. However,I was intrigued by the casting so thought i would see it.I had not previously read the novel by Neil Gaiman.what can i say, by the end of the movie i was truly captivated. Apart from the LOTR movies, pan's labyrinth and a maybe one or two others, there really hasn't been a top notch fantasy movie out for a while now. but stardust has changed that.it has everything. a really good storyline, enthralling characters, witty dialogue and most of all, the requisite happy ending. robert de niro, in the relatively short time he was on screen , also gave to me what was one of his more memorable performances.there was good chemistry between the two leads and i thought they were very appropriately cast.",9,3,5,28 October 2007
Transformers," Best Moview this year
","no spoilers.. but i just wanted to say.. i never really saw the original cartoons (apart from the odd one) so i didn't have any expectations going into the cinema.. but from the beginning to the end, i was blown away and it was just a really fun action packed movie.the CGI effects are mind bogglingly realistic. there's a few surprise cameos.. the story is relatively straightforward, the acting was competent and there was a requisite amount of cheese.it seems that every time there is an adaptation, the traditionalists always rear their ugly heads and say.. oh the movie didn't follow this, didn't follow that... well, as far as im concerned so what?this was just a great movie. and surely anyone making an adaptation, is allowed some degree of artistic license..so please, if you haven't seen this movie yet, don't bother about whats been said, just go and see it.",9,2,8,30 June 2007
