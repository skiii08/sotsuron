Mission: Impossible III," Mission possible ??
","Gone are the days of MI, where Tom Cruise was going to hang himself upside down to steal an obscured spy list. Gone are the days when Tom Cruise was going to present a high flying action thriller. MI:III is just disappointing. The good thing is that there may not be anymore MI movies, because if the trend it is to be believed it just gets worse every time. True MI: III may be just better than its predecessor, but still its disappointing. I mean can you believe that the director affords a 3 minute sequence where Ethan Hunt simply stares at his fiancée/wife telling her to trust him. The action is still pretty much same as its predecessor. Full of unbelievable stunts, but the one single one with Agent Hunt falling from the roof is just getting boring right now.In this sequel we actually get to see how IMF agents make the masks to conceal their identities and go undercover, and although Ethan Hunt may have met his greatest adversary in Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffmann), it still leaves much to be desired. Michelle Monaghan is just superb as Tom Cruise's love interest. Keri Russel also turns out to be decent as Hunt's apprentice, and fellow IMF agent. Ving Rhames as usual is superb in his small part. His witty replies keep the humor rolling. Laurence Fishbourne is also superb in his small role as The head of IMF. Jonathan Rhys Myer is also impressive in his small role, along with Rhames he keeps the humor rolling. Maggie Q does a small cameo as the elusive sexy IMF agent seducing Davian. But overall it leaves a lot to be desired. Screenplay is satisfactory but you don't come to watch a MI movie to be impressed with dialogs.A very disappointing 6/10...",6,1,2,1 July 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Amazing truly amazing, drug watchers look out...
","Requiem For a Dream, supposedly a movie about drug abuse, which I thought was going to be yet again another big bore.After enduring it, I found out, that I was totally in love with it. A story about a family, which gets totally destroyed with the effects of drugs.The movie starts off with a boy dragging the TV, giving it out on rent for some immediate need for cash, literally forcing his mother in doing so. We find out that his need fro money is nothing but drugs. We find out that the mother gets a call to be on TV on a popular TV show, so she starts thinning out, by taking drugs. Eventually we find out that the boy needs more money for drugs so he forces his girlfriend to have sex with another man for cash. When the drugs run out, the boy and his mate travel to la to get new stocks, when they get arrested for drug trafficking, and the boy gets his amputated because his hand got way too much infected, Connelly becomes a full time whore and the motehr is admitted to a mental institution.The movie is very moving with some excellent camera work and a mind blowing score. a true masterpiece, this should be rated even a bit more, deserves to be in the top 20 if not the top 10....",9,1,2,18 February 2006
Rang De Basanti," Freedom For a Cause
","Freedom for a Cause... That seems to be the theme for this movie. I have no interests in Hindi movies, anyone checking my review list can say that. But this one is different. Rang de Basanti, is a movie made for the teen generation. The generation which decides the future of the country. Many believe that its easy to criticize, but difficult to actually make a difference to the country. Well, to those people kudos to them, cause this is a movie about such guys. About people who actually make a difference to the country, following the examples of the revolutionaries, in a similar way as they did when they fought for India's independence. They try to make a difference, by causing an uproar among the genX people. They defy all odds, doing it, and they give their lives for it, to make the country a better place to live in for the other people, by ridding people who are corrupt.The movie is based upon a young English lady, who wishes to make a movie on the lives of the Indian revolutionaries who gave their lives for the independence. She reads through her grandfather's journal, who was a officer during those tirade times. Seh comes to India, and meets the jolly group of five friends, who have nothing to worry, all the time making masti. She offers them roles in her documentary film. By the time shooting finishes, she has a crush on one of the actors, and also, tragedy strikes the group of friends. The fiancée of the girl in the group, who was a pilot in the Air force dies. They learn that the death was due to faulty parts in the airplane, and that the defense minister, has ordered those parts to be placed. They protest against the injustice, but they are rudely beaten up. Then they decide to follow the examples of the revolutionaries they were portraying. They kill the corrupt defense minister, and then they confess the truth in a radio station. But they pay with their lives. Special ops recover the radio station, with orders that 'Spare none'. So they die, with a smile on their lips, knowing that they made a difference with their lives.It's a movie to arise the teenage generation from their slumber. And it certainly did affect me. Being a teen myself. The story is superb, dialogs awesome, camera work mind blowing, and A.R. Rahman does magic with the music as well. Overall RDB was a good see, rare one for Hindi movies nowadays. 9/10!!!",9,1,6,5 February 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Johnny Depp does it again
","He did it back in 2003, and he has done it so again. Johnny Depp comes up with another scintillating performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, as he tries to overcome his greatest fear, to undo himself of the bind of Davey Jones of the Flying Dutchman. And we are left to wonder what will happen at The World's End next year, will Jack Sparrow return with the help of the treacherous Barbossa ?? Or shall the East India Company reign supreme now that they have Davey Jones at their side.Gore Verbinsky leave the movie with full of riddles and thoughts, but indeed like the previous movie, this one is also all about Jack Sparrow. Although the plot is based on Will Turner, by all necessities Jack Sparrow is the one who controls the entire speed of the movie. Johnny Depp is again mind blowing as the wily pirate. Orlando Bloom is a huge disappointment, although the script didn't actually give him much scope too. Bill Nighy is good, but I felt, he could have been better if the needs be. Keira Knightley also gives a heart warming performance as the luscious Elizabeth Swann.The entire movie is full of action. Whether its a chase of two ships, or some great sword fighting, or some hilarious escapes. Gore Verbinsky sets the pace of the movie early, and gives us a great movie. But the only drawback of Dead Man's Chest is that it didn't give me the complete movie experience. Because the story remains incomplete. Unlike Black Pearl where the story became complete, Dead Man' Chest clearly gives way to a sequel. Although unlike other trilogies (Matrix, LOTR), here the second part is equally good. The camera work is good, original score by Hans Zimmer, isn't flashy but still well appropriate. Visual Effects will also score a point.Overall, its a good movie, but its all Johnny Depp through and through.A very well deserved 8/10 !!!",8,3,6,26 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," All hail, Captain Jack Sparrow is on board
","It is so unfortunate this movie releases alongside LOTR. Otherwise it was bound to snatch up many many awards. Black Pearl, is in all respect a classic. A super super movie, coupled with Johnny Depp's massive skills, it is just mind blowing. Its a pity that a actor of his caliber hasn't got an Academy Award in his belt. I though expect that it wont be far away.The movie brings up many legendary facts, which makes it so fascinating to watch. Instances which speak of the secret Pirates Code known to none but the pirates themselves, and curses that the pirates suffer under the consequences of trying to steal a cursed treasure and lastly treachery. The movie fills you end to end with excitement. Johnny Depp is the evergreen Captain Jack Sparrow, probably the most unfortunate pirate in history, because of his ill luck, with which he always ends up loses his ship. But no one knew about his colorful past, when he was the captain of the most feared pirate ships in history, The Black Pearl. Even lesser knows of his consequences, where he was left stranded on an unhabitated island with a pistol loaded with a single bullet. He escaped by making ropes with his own hair, and he comes back to take back his ship, the Black Pearl. And with some help from young Will Turner and the aristocrat daughter of the ambassador Miss Elizabeth Swann, he succeeds in killing Captain Barbossa, and evading capture by the British army.The movie is extremely well done, with a superb plot, superb direction, superb screen play, and some excellent on screen performances by Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and Johnny Depp. He really does deserve some special recognition. Klaus Badelt does a good job with the music, and with some pretty neat visual effects. This is just a movie which you cannot afford missing.8/10 !!!",8,0,3,15 July 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A War In a Fantasy land
","I definitely wasn't expecting a movie of such epic proportions when I wen to see Narnia. But indeed it turned out to be exactly that. True, if you are a LOTR addict, then it will constantly remind you of LOTR. But still it's worthy of a praise. The soundtrack/score is mind blowing, utterly mind blowing. The acting is good, pretty mature, the camera works, special effects is also neat. Overall its a real damn good movie. As for the story, well, 4 kids, are under a professor during World War 2. One day, whilst playing they accidentally discover a wardrobe which is a portal to a fantasy land, the land of Narnia. There, they understand that a witch has been ruling for a 100 years and they are a part of a prophecy, which states that they will overthrow the witches' rule of Narnia. Against their will, they are caught up in the battle, and they fight bravely, finally killing the witch, and ending the rule. Afterwards, they become the rulers of Narnia, and they rule well, for many years, until one day they again accidentally stumble back into the wardrobe, back to their own world in the 1940's. A nice surprise ending for the viewers. A certain must see, and a 9/10!!!",7,0,0,3 February 2006
The Girl Next Door," Wicked Sexy Comedy
","Wicked Sexy Comedy, thats just what may sum this movie up... Its not quite just another punk movie from Hollywood, but this one's different... It's about devotion and love...I bought the DVD expecting just another teen movie, but was quite surprised... Elisha Cuthbert looked like a goddess... Totally cool... The plot is also nice, about a porno star who falls in love with just another ordinary kid... Emile Hersch also does a nice job, playing that ordinary kid... His friends especially 'Eli' is totally cool, and will bring you on your knees with his antics... I wont say much, cos it will spoil your anticipation... Buy the DVD, its loaded with special features, fully packed with it... Its worth every penny...",8,6,6,2 September 2005
Ice Age: The Meltdown," The race for survival
","Meltdown turned out to be quite the way it should have. The director made it look very similar to the original Ice Age. Last time they had to battle the cold blizzards to get a human baby to safety. THis time around they are saving their own behinds. The ice is melting and they have to get out of the bowl shaped valley in order to survive.In the mean time Manfred(a.k.a Manny) is reminded by Sid that he is the last remaining mammoth. But to his disbelief he finds out another mammoth, a female, who thinks that she is a possum. Somehow this misguided 'possom' realizes her true identity, and tehy risk everything to get out of the valley. Again like last time, we have the annoying yet hilarious nut seeking creature, and like last time around, the movie ends just wen our little friend has finally got his claim on his prized possession, he is rudely taken away.Its a gala of a movie, a total screamer and will keep your sides aching long after the movie... a well deserved 8/10...",8,1,1,21 April 2006
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Finally, a video game movie to be remembered!!
","Like millions of people, I am too a huge fan of the Prince of Persia Video Game series. When 2 years ago, it was announced that Prince of Persia: Sands of Time was going to be made into a movie, I totally disappointed that arguably the best game of the series was going to be made into a movie, and people will totally hate it. It was further compounded with the fact that Gemma Arterton was going to be the Princess Tamina (Farah, in the game) and Jake Gyllenhal was the fabled Prince. But come last October when the first trailer came out, it seemed really impressive. UBISOFT did it right when they sold the rights to Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer Films, rather than the usual distributors. Sands of Time stands alone as a movie, and you need not play the game to enjoy it. It follows the general premise of the game, but the makers have added some more middle east folklore to make the movie interesting, like the addition of the mythical Hassansins. The movie is visually stunning. The special effects as expected is top notch. It was a joy to see some of the moves which a player can make the prince do in-game, shown on screen. Jake Gyllenhal for all his critics did make an impressive Prince Dastan. Gemma Arterton also didn't do a bad job, as Tamina. A huge turn off though was the accent being used by the actors. The story is set in medieval Persia, and Gemma Arterton and Ben Kingsley are speaking in perfect British accent. That was something that could have been rectified. But this is one fun popcorn loving movie, which can be an ideal getaway from your daily lives for 2 hours.",8,7,12,30 May 2010
Troy," Best War Movie For a Long time
","WHAT A GREAT MOVIE. Absolutely mind blowing. I went to watch this movie at the theater, and what a movie. Stupendous acting. Finally after a long time, Bradd Pitt proves his worth as an actor. Also Eric Bana is superb. Totally mind blowing.The story is well written, although there are a few goof ups, (like Menelaus, who never actually dies in the entire Trojan war is killed even before it starts, also, Agamemnon, is not killed according to Homer, Helen who supposedly goes back to Menelaus after the end of the war, flees from the Greeks, and the best of the lot, Paris, the prince of Troy who supposedly was to be brutally killed by the Greeks manages to escape through a secret tunnel), but all these goof ups can be overlooked, after watching the movie. The epic battle, the love for one's country, the love for a family member, the love for a brother. Everyhing is so amazingly depicted, it is hard to ignore it. An amazing amazing story, which will surely move your heart. The scene where Hector takes his father's blessing before going out to battle with Achilles, knowing fully well, only death awaits him, is mind blowing. Also, extra ordinary, is the sequence where Achilles' nephew gets killed by Hector, and his men are shocked into learning that he killed a child. And Lastly, the scene where old King Priam begs for Hector's body before Achilles, will surely make your eyes moist. Troy, is indeed a classic, and'm truly surprised that its rating is so low. With such amazing screenplay, mind blowing action, and soothing music, Troy has all the qualities of making a classic, it is very unfortunate that it is so lowly rated.I give it a full 10/10....",10,22,42,19 June 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A worthy ending to a dazzling trilogy
","Like last year, pirates is the best movie of this summer as well. Hands down, the swashbuckling Jack Sparrow, the suave Hector Barbossa the courageous Elizabeth Swann and the determined William Turner. All of them together in one 3 hour epic. At World's End is the one movie, which really brings out the truth about Pirates as a whole. Betrayals for their own needs. Throughout the movie until the very end, almost everyone is ready to defy anything to match their own needs. Every character throughout the whole trilogy has some say in this movie. Apart from the aforementioned four, the sensational Sao Feng, the good minded Jack Norrington, the evil Davey Jones, the comic Raghetti and Pintel(There are many more, rest assured). Each and everyone meets out their ends.This last part of the trilogy starts off with death, signifying the end of the realm of piracy. but things get interesting from there on. Action packed and fast paced, we witness the fellowship of pirates braving the strong winds, the chilly weather to get to Davey Jones' locker. The story moves on and after they all get out of the locker, things get even more interesting (and confusing?). Its not until the final parlay is decided upon, that the odd viewer would get to know whats gonna happen. The final battle sequence is one to remember for a long time. The sequence of the Dutchman and the Pearl in the midst of a whirlpool was absolutely mind blowing. Not to forget the witty tactics of Sparrow swinging on a rope. In the end however all works out well. And its strange irony that about the fate of the characters which is so different from the one chalked out in the beginning. Turner becomes the captain of the most notorious ship of the seven seas and Elizabeth becomes the Pirate lord. Sparrow as usual the witty sailor gets his ends meted out floating on a dingy with his destination on course, Barbossa suffers from Jack Sparrow's wit.The producers did leave an opening for a sequel and I pray they do so. This entire trilogy was great. I never thought that only 3 years after the Lord Of The Rings we will be showcased to such a epic event of this magnitude. But undoubtedly Captain Jack Sparrow will be one of the most coveted and unforgettable characters in Hollywood history.No point harping on the cinematic of the movie. Right from the acting, the direction, the background score, the plot, screenplay, cinematography, visual effects. Everything was stunningly exquisite. Although one might say that it was a tad to long. But I felt it was just about right. Though I did feel Gore Verbinsky had too many sub plots. And that might have bogged the movie down a slight bit. He could have played the sub plots a bit longer that would have put a lot more focus on them, or could have clipped a few of them.Needless to say this should be showered with Oscars. Thank you Jerry Bruckheimer for a wonderful trilogy. Thank you Gore Verbinsky for an epic cinematic experience. And thank you Johnny Depp for creating Jack Sparrow.",10,4,6,2 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Well, frankly speaking.... it sucked
","I wasted 50 bucks and I want it back Sam Raimi. Spidey 3 is one of those sort of movie which directors make, when they don't have anything to do, and they are sure irrespective of how much crap they put in the movie, its gonna work in the box office. Same with Spidey 3.Each of its prequels had something to remember by. Spidey 1 had that famous quote, 'With great powers come great responsibilities' Spidey 2 had that unbelievable train action sequence. Spidey 3 has nothing. Absolutely nothing. I though with 3 villains maybe this franchise is maturing to the level of the batman franchises. Instead it has pummeled down the drain. The only logical thing to remember this sequence by would probably be, th comic relief of Bruce Campbell, and a bad Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst was awful, no scratch that she was woeful. Topher Grace, I really had high expectations for Venom, but he was shunted to the sidelines which made his character so trivial. Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko was decent. His animations as the Sandman were the only thing about special effects that were up to the mark. James Franco was probably the only person who was really good in the movie. His expressions even during the fight sequences were good. They should have re christened the movie as Harry 3. LOL !!!Bryce Dallas Howard !!! She looked stunning. I agree with one of the reviewers, she really should stop making those Shaymalan movies,and take up some romantic roles. She is a visual stunner.Everything else was crap. Many are complaining that the movie was too long. Well considering the junk it was, it literally was too too long. But had Raimi elongated the movie to another 20-25 minutes and stretched the individual plots, I feel that would have been a better package.No point harping on the plot, since by this time all of you should have come to know of it. Taking in about the rest of the stuff behind the scenes, well, visual effects were moderately good enough but not quite the standard you expect in a spidey movie. The score was dreadful compared to the previous 2. Screen play pathetic.Simple enough, 4/10 is an overrated vote for me !!!",4,1,2,8 May 2007
Sleepy Hollow," The Best Horror Movie After A Long time.............
","'Sleepy Hollow' has to be one of the best horror movies that I've seen for a long time. The story has been brought to life by excellent camera work and mind blowing cinematography. Tim Burton does another brilliant work directing this movie, securing his spot as one of the best directors in present day Hollywood. Also the veteran Francis Ford Coppola comes back from 'retirement' by being the executive producer for this big budgeted movie. The visual effects are stunning, and the dolby surround sound makes the regular cinema goer feel like he is back to the mysterious village of Sleepy Hollow. The background music is also very soothing, and it sets the tone for the movie.The movie could have turned into 'The Exorcist' fame of horror but Johnny Depp uncanny knack of being creative in front of the camera has turned Detective Ichabod Crane into some sort of Comic Relief. But this relieves the tension greatly as the dark and foggy village creates a sense of utmost mystery and drama and makes the viewer believe that something terrible is about to happen.......Christopher Walken, though barely has any lines to say in the entire movie he is concrete and is superb through his body actions, re creating the terrifying Headless Horse man a.k.a. 'The Hessian Horseman' Michael Gambon is also very good as the Landlord Van Tassel, and young Christina Ricci portraying the young witch, the love interest of Johnny Depp steals the show away from Miranda Richardson, the evil witch plotting to take away all the gold of old Baltus Van Tassel, even at the expense of her rich husband, step daughter and her own flesh and blood, her sister. The movie can be a bit graphic at certain stages especially during the murders but overall, if you watch this in a movie theatre it is bound to give you the creeps, and it will make you feel jittery for a loong time. Overall 10/10..........",10,18,28,24 January 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Boring!!!!
","Ocean's 12, doesn't even come close to comparison with its prequel Ocean's 11. Ocean's 11 was funny and had an absolutely amazing heist, which the guys pull off amazingly.....Ocean's 12 begins, as all of you know, with Terry Benedict, tracking down all the members of Ocean's 11 (who now have the most bizarre jobs), and asks them to pay his money back with a heap of interest..... An anonymous call tips him off about the identity of Ocean's 11, and he pays them a visit and gives them 2 weeks to pay him back.....Danny Ocean feels he needs some time off, so they decide to goto Amsterdam, since they were well known in the Us, to pull off any major heist....Amsterdam incidentally is, the place where Rusty's ex girl friend, an ex-cop stays.... They do a starting job, which they feel would pay them off a little bit and buy them some time, but when they open the vault they find their object of interest already stolen and a tape stating, the fact that the night fox has been before them........Meanwhile Ocean's 12, had been visited by Rusty's ex, and they are furious about it.... Anyways they meet up with Nightfox, and they find out that he had given the tip to Benedict, since his master made a mistake to judge them as the best thieves in the world.... His master incidentally was the legendary, Van Der Woude, so the only way to make sure who is the best, is to loot a common object.....Next the movie rolls on, and apparently it seems that everything has gone wrong as Ocean's 12 fail to make the deadline for the job....But, apparently all is not what it seems, as, it appears the Nightfox got the replica, and Ocean's troupe of men got the real thing.......The drawback of this movie is the lack of a proper high tech heist, true Nightfox did good, but we want to see Ocean's 12 do the job right.... Also, the story seemed to drawn and laid off, it lacked a proper solidity and was pretty translucent..... The music was good, and so was the dialogs making you laugh in short bursts, there is more interaction between, the characters, and now that you know them better.... Linus Caldwell,Matt Damon's character plays a more important role in the movie and he brings about most of the fun..... Julia Roberts' performance is totally appalling, primarily due to the script, where she is made to play as Julia Roberts, imagine that!!! Bruce Willis gives an appearance..... but the most important of all is Catherine Zeta-Jones........If there was anyone in this movie who you'd be watching for it is her....... She was superb, with not only her looks, but also her acting was well measured, and up to the mark..... End of the Day she rocked.....But overall the movie was disappointing....an average 6/10........",6,0,0,1 April 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," Smooth, Suave & Gritty
","I was highly skeptical about O13. Ever since the disappointment of O12, I surmised that this series is finished. Soderburgh did not have anything more to give with regards to Danny Ocean and his crew. How wrong I was. He produced the greatest trick up his sleeve. His Ace, Al Pacino. Putting Al Pacino as a negative character as well as Andy Garcia as a pseudo negative role, Soderburgh wins over the audience.O13 has the simplest of all plots. Something that any man can relate to. One of the eleven is bullied out of his own plans to make a hotel (Elliout Gould) by a high flying business man, known as dirtiest player in his game,(Al Pacino). He bullies Reuben Tishkoff from his own dreams, which results in his heart attack, and he is admitted to a hospital. So, the eleven conspire to take him down, and they put up with a plan that is a dream of every casino goer. They create an atmosphere for 3.5 minutes where every player in the casino wins. Admittedly however vague and idiotic it sounds, they do this very well, and that brings about a smile in your face.Like in the first movie it was Danny Ocean(George Clooney), Rusty Ryan(Brad Pitt) in the second its Linus Caldwell's (Matt Damon) turn for lady luck. His part is a assistant/secretary for a rich Japanese client,(Shaobo Kin) as well as a translator. He seduces Al Pacino's right hand man or rather woman, Abigail Sponder.Like the first movie, this one has a detailed plot, with a slick way to steal the cash off. In the end, when Terry Benedict(Andy Garcia) tried to pull one over them, they fool him over once again. There's a small cameo by Vincent Cassel although I hardly felt it was necessary. Maybe Soderburgh was thinking of ending this trilogy with this one, but I hardly think he succeeded in doing that. You cannot end Ocean's trilogy without Julia Roberts and Catherine-Zeta Jones. For all those who are moaning their absence from this movie, Danny Ocean makes it a point that they would not be involved in this heist since it was a matter of avenging their friend and not any normal job.The acting yet again is superb. Geroge Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon who are the lead roles in this movie are really good. Especially Matt Damon, who gets a bit of extra reel space due to his supposed affair with Ellen Barkin's character. The rest of the crew, Elliout Gould, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Carl Reiner, Shaobo Kin, Scott Caan and Eddie Jameson all have small parts that they do with perfection. Elliout Gould does a fine job of playing the guy in bed, unattached from the world. Don Cheadle, is the one preparing the huge magnetic device, who has a finer aspect of character of writing a poem for the bed ridden Reuben Tishkoff, to help him feel better. The usual animosity between the Malloy brothers, Casey Affleck and Scott Caan is missing, but even then working together for a change they do a fine job of it. Carl Reiner and Shabo Kin probably has the smallest of parts in the movie. Shaobo Kin's role is basically a rich Japanese aristocrat who orders Linus Caldwell about. Carl Reiner posing as a undercover agent for the 5-Star Diamond Awards also has little to offer. Eddie Jameson does a great job solving the codes for the blackjack and working as an employee in Al Pacino's(Willy Banks) hotel. But lastly, no one is more brilliant than Bernie Mac. He basically has 2 scenes to his credit. And even in those 2 scenes he stands out brightly.O13 is certainly not the best movie of the year, but it certainly is not the worse. It's a fun watch, but when is Danny Ocean and his crew not fun to watch !!!! The direction is good, the acting like always is up to a very high level. The cinematography is good, the background score very nice, special effects though used scantily was also superb. All in all 8/10 !!!",8,0,2,13 July 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne is Back, and Back with a Bang
","It was difficult to imagine Jason Bourne rushing through the streets of top European countries, and bashing box office records at the same time. Especially after the records set by its precedent, it seemed unthinkable, perhaps unimaginable. But it really does. And it also wins the average movie goer's hearts. To be honest, I had read a couple of reviews of Ultimatum before heading down to see this flick, and I have to say I was a bit skeptical. Especially since the same reviewer had bashed 'At World's End' and 'Ocean's 13', both of which in my opinion were classics. But I was equally impressed. This is probably the first movie of the year which fulfills your expectations and more. Yes, the shaky cameras are back. Yes, the classic hand-to-hand combat moves are back. Yes, the exhilarating chase sequences are back. Yes, Jason Bourne is back. And yes, he does remember now. From start to finish, Ultimatum keeps you at the edge of your seat. The director has done a fabulous job by the method that he has adopted. He has told the story in a very nice manner, which always keeps the audience pondering what is going to happen next. The story picks up almost from where Supremacy ended. From Moscow, we find Bourne escaping the clutches of the Moscow police and then travel all across Europe and over the Atlantic to New York. The catchy dialogs which have been impressing in supremacy are more gritty this time around, and Bourne becomes a more suave and a much more deadly assassin. As if he wasn't deadly enough in the first place.The action sequences are obviously very good. Especially the hand-to-hand combat. And of course the fabulous car chase in the heart of NYC towards the end. The shaky camera adds fuel to the action, making it much more realistic in nature.The acting is once again undoubtedly superb. Matt Damon returns for one last time to reprise his role as Jason Bourne. So does Julia Stiles as the ex-CIA agent Nicky Parsons. We discover a chemistry between these two characters which have been surprisingly absent from the last two movies, suggesting that there might have been a bit more than matches the eye. Joan Allen also makes a comeback as Pamela Landy, the CIA agent who is out for Bourne. We are introduced to CIA deputy director Noah Vosen, played by David Strathairn, as the man out for Bourne's blood. He fills in the shoes of the chief antagonistic character and takes up the place of Brian Cox from the previous two movies. A small but significant role is also given to veteran actor Albert Finney.The background score along with the soundtrack is also perfect. Moby's 'Extreme Ways' is fast catching up to my list of Must Listen songs. Something also must be said about the ending. Ironically we find Bourne comes back to the first movie where he kills 'The Professor', Clive Owen. He says, 'Look at us. Look at what they made you give.' They are the same as of David Webb a.k.a Jason Bourne. It my just as seem that Bourne finally realizes the gravity of the Treadstone project and the Blackbriar program.This exciting out of the edge thriller certainly deserves a special place in my heart. 9/10 !!!",9,2,4,15 September 2007
The Aviator," Di Caprio all the way
","This is just a movie that Scorsese made for DiCaprio. After the Oscar fiasco, I thought the Academy was a little harsh on Scorsese, especially for a man who has got 6 nominations in his career, but after watching both the movies 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'the Aviator' I have to say that the Academy was right in giving the former the best picture award. Why would I disregard Scorsese's epic with such disregard???Well just like Howard Hughes' epic Hell's Angels was ignored by critics in its early days as depicted in the movie many would agree with The Aviator as well........ The only difference is that Hell's Angels was an epic hit whereas the Aviator would just remain a sideway movie, which people will cease to remember a few days later......Don't think I'm full of harsh words for the movie, because Leonardo DiCaprio was fabulous..... He tried his level best to pull the movie away, but with the genuine lack of a definite plot, his efforts were mostly to the drain..... Apart from the characters of Hepburn and Hughes all the other characters lacked a proper definition.. I mean Alan Alda was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for the movie.... After watching the movie all I can say is that he was a total BS, instead John Reilly was a better option.... The very essence of the movie, the eccentricity of the great Hughes is not very well depicted.... Like Beautiful Mind where the eccentricity stole the show, Scorsese fails to show us the reason for the eccentricity of Hughes.....All in all the great epic of Scorsese remains as an actor's failed chance to fame. DiCaprio finally proved his acting talents but he put his name in a poor movie which lacks a proper direction.....In the end a very scratchy 7/10 from me..........",7,0,1,4 March 2005
Burn After Reading," A Brilliant American Satire
","The Coens are at it again. After No Country for Old Men, they have produced another ace. But both movies are highly contrasting. No Country was dark, but Burn After Reading is one hell of a laughter riot. Its been a long time since the Coens gave us something to laugh at. It involves some brilliant performances, including the paranoid George Clooney, the ex CIA Chief John Malkovich, the clueless gym employee Brad Pitt, and like always in a Coen movie, Frances Mcdormand. She has put forward yet another astounding performance. Even Richard Jenkins the gym boss was very impressive. Add to this useful cameos by J.K. Simmons, Olek Krupa.On a serious note, the movie also has a subtle message. Just like most other Coen movies, the last scene was reserved to put forward this message. When JK Simmons says,'What did we learn from this ?? To not repeat what we did. But what did we do ??' Amidst this laughter riot, and the twists and turns, there this one line which stands out. Heads up mates. A brilliant 8/10!!",8,1,5,11 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One ring To rule them all, and the darkness bind them
","What a movie........I expected something good, but this is beyond words, this is great!!!!!!JRR Tolkien's fantasy land is brought to life by veteran director Peter Jackson and his visualization of middle earth........Initially I read the original book, and I must say, that it was one of the best fiction works I have read till date.......The movie has spell bounding visual effects and costume designing. The action sequels will keep you asking for more, and the shooting locations will stun your eyes... The sound is also good, especially Enya's song, truly brings out the theme of the movie..... A band of the most bizarre persons set out to do the impossible against all odds... They are met with the harsh weather, and betrayal, and ultimately death, to one of their com padres........Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom all are excellent in their parts, but special mention must be made of Ian McKellen, he has been the focus of the movie........Some people may find it boring, because of the fast pace of events, thats because Jackson had to somehow fit the first part of the trilogy under 3 hrs...But this is simply too good.......10/10.......",10,1,2,7 April 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A Mature HP Movie
","A great movie, by Cuaron. A mature tone setting which sets it out from its prequels. Although a major part from the book has been excluded, still the rest stands out as OUTSTANDING. Especially the scenes of the Marauder's Map. Also there are plenty of comedy in the movie. There is a hint of a budding romance between Ron and Hermione, Harry's two best friends. Also the sound and music of the movie is especially awesome. John Williams has left all of us spellbound by his ingenuinity. The portion where young Professor Lupin tells Potter about his parents is magnified by the outstanding slow background music. (A Window To The Past) And most important of all is the deadly 'villain', Sirius Black, who also happens to Harry's godfather. Although this movie lacks Quidditch, it has Buckbeak the Hippogriff flying over the Lake in the Castle. Overall it's a definite must see for all HP fans.",9,0,0,20 October 2004
Batman Begins," Finally, Batman Comes To Life
","In what is the most comprehensive Batman movie till date, it appears that this is the only movie where the director actually gets in the brain Of Bruce Wayne, A.K.A BtamanChristopher Nolan does a superb of work of coordinating a star studded cast, which was although wholly unnecessary as most of the big names were hardly used, (Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman, and Katie Holmes hardly have a major part to play). The acting is spectacular, Christian Bale, makes a convincing Batman, with an extraordinary dubbed voice that makes the Dark Knight truly the Kingpin of Gotham. The camera action is unbelievably god, and so is the special effects for the movie. Also mention should be made of the mind blowing shooting locations. The action sequences will remind you of Spiderman 2, making this movie a favorite for next years' Academy Awards.Batman Begins, is different from all the previous Batman franchise in many aspects. First of all, it doesn't portray Gotham, nor Bruce Wayne as the famous person he is. In all the last 4 movies, Gotham has been looked upon as a Neverland, but in Batman Begins, we find looking at a darker Gotham, much like the Shadow Of the Bat franchise of DC Comics. And unlike the previous Bruce Wayne, who loves to party, this one hates them. And it takes us inside the mind of a young orphan who has lost his parents. The story has been superbly plotted, with a terrific climax. A train sequence which ends the climax will leave the audience open mouthed. This movie shows the transformation of the young orphan who goes bad, to the Dark Crusader, of Gotham. It is this transformation that makes this movie extra special. A word of praise for the director once again, for the clever finish of the movie, aligning it perfectly well, with the original Batman movie, starring Michael Keaton. I went to watch this movie expecting a boring comic flick, but it turned out to be brilliant. I'm sure there'll be many who will echo my feelings. There are so many things that can be written about this movie, but 1000 words are quite not enough for it. Look out for Liam Neeson, and Michael Caine, who give outstanding performances. Liam Neeson in particular as this is first portrayal of a negative role(OOPS, I shouldn't have said that), was a treat to watch. And watch out for the new Batmobile, it rocks!!!!Overall 9/10....",9,3,6,19 June 2005
Ghost Rider," Dull, Lacklustre, fails to make an impact
","Ghost Rider was just the movie I expected. Visually stunning, but fails to make a long term impact. Its small run time contributes to the fact. Nowadays almost all comic adaptations are close to 125-140 minutes long. Compared to Ghost Rider's 114 minute adaptation will disappoint the fans of this franchise. Packed with a star studded star cast(comparing with other comic adaptations of late) a regular movie goer might have thought this would be a decent watch. But I'm afraid they will be highly disappointed.The entire story of Ghost Rider, the history, everything seems to so hurriedly paced. Although the starting scene seems to think otherwise. I cant understand why it was so hurriedly paced. Also the director and the screenplay writer could have included a few sub plots, which would have made the movie mildly interesting, instead, it focuses on the central plot which is why the movie finishes just when it was getting interesting.There are few things that are worthy of praise in Ghost Rider. And one of them is the Visual Effects. Visual Effects for this movie have been stunning. Mind Blowing. The stunts were also cool, no scratch that ultra cool. Even the viability of the stunts are questionable, still they are good. Eva Mendes looks gorgeous, just like everyone hoped. Wes Bentley looks superb as the villainous Blackheart. Peter Fonda is underutilized. And Nicholas Cage. What can can I say about him? He sure can act and he has proved that here also, since he has retained his suave nature. But his physique isn't good enough for action roles such as this. He is losing his touch if he keeps on acting in such movies as these.The background score is decent enough. And even though the screen play was short, it was good. The dialogs were pretty good. All in all, a disappointment but still because of the stunning visual effects I'll give it a 7/10 !!!",7,0,1,28 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Lame real Lame
","The Xmen trilogy has deteriorated ever since its inception. X-Men was good, real good. X2 was also good with some parts of humor. X3 is real disappointing. It is filled with odd blocks of unexplained parts. Like how Scot dies ?? And whats so important with Angel ? And what was the history of the child ?? All these questions pop up and they are left unexplained. this will lead you to believe that the director would have sense to finish off the trilogy covering all ends, obviously he doesn't. I will not comment on the story, since the plot on IMDb tells it all, but really this movie stinks. Out of the blue Jean Grey appears all good and fine. I mean how come one could live for more than six months under water even if that person is a mutant ?? I am quite surprised to see this movie getting a 7.9. Really shocking. Saw DaVinci Code the same day and really loved that. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are superb. Especially Hugh Jackman, from start to finish he sets the tone of the movie. He sets the tone of the entire trilogy, come to think of it, cos he is the principle character in all of them. Ian McKellen is also brilliant, Rebecca Romijin Stamos in her small role is also charismatic as ever. Anne Pacquin is wasted, in her small miserable role. Halle Berry was also pretty decent. This movie features loads of new mutants but we miss a few of the old ones. Plus the movie goes on to feature a few mutants who never feature in the comics. May be Stan lee is thinking of adding new characters in his series. Gambon, who was thought to make an appearance in this movie earlier has been cut off, it would have been nice to see his charismatic dark side. Toad, Nightcrawler, all are missing.This movie just turns out to be yet another lame action flick. I would certainly not recommend anyone watching it. A pathetic effort to end the wonderful story.A poorly deserved 6/10...",6,2,4,27 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," The battle for Helmsdeep has begun
","The second part of Peter Jackson's epic LOTR trilogy.....This is basically a conjunction to the first and the last part of the trilogy, so it isn't as good as its predecessor....But then again it isn't that bad either....In this part we basically get to know the characters more, we know about their likes and dislikes, who they favor, etc....We start off right from where the first movie finished, the journey through middle earth continues, and Frodo and his mate take a new member in, one who eventually betrays them....The others are all separated, but they all meet up in the end......Like the first movie, this also has a sad theme, as people die, also the movie features a dazzling battle during the night, something we didn't have in the first movie..... Legolas(Orlando Bloom), does a series of mind blowing moves, which leave you open mouthed, stunned.........Gimli the dwarf offers some comic to the movie, and Aragorn, proves his selflessness..... and we find a surprise through Gandalf....It is also worth mentioning Elijah Wood, through whom the story revolves and his companion Samwise Gamgee(Sean Austin).... If anyone stands out in this movie, it must be him, some of his words sticks to your mind for a long time......The visual effects improve in this movie, so does the costume and cinematography.....8/10.........",9,0,0,7 April 2005
The Incredibles," Incredibly Incredible
","One of the best animated feature of all time, if not the best.......The Incredibles is a story of supers, who are acclaimed for their fame and mysterious powers... But when mankind feels the days of the supers are over, they order the supers to go under cover and live with their secret identities, and stop using their super powers....Their lives becomes monotonic, and instead of their exciting jobs, they are stuck to punching papers all day and cleaning diapers.... But when these ex-supers start disappearing, one of them takes up the responsibility, to catch up with the bad guy, once and for all.... So, Mr. Incredible, and his family of Incredible super heroes, take it up to save the day........Overall, it is a pretty neat movie with a very good story, and nice script.... The animation is naturally superb, but what it stands out from rest of the animation releases this year, is the completeness....This was exactly the case with Finding Nemo, and like it, this is yet again, a movie which one can say that is a complete movie.....So, that's why it got the damn Academy Award, for animation plus the other 2....Overall 8/10.....",8,0,1,1 April 2005
The Illusionist," Nothing is what it seems !!!
","What a movie... I didn't expect a movie to be this good, after everyone had threw this out, seeing The Prestige. But for me,(although I haven't seen Prestige)I have been blown away. A movie based on the late nineteenth century, early twentieth century. During the days of the monarchy of Austria. I will not go into the story, being a simple romantic story, but the magic tricks shown, plus the screenplay... WOW !!! I mean just WOW !!! Absolutely amazing. Edward Norton fit like a glove in his role as Eisenheim the illusionist. Although I was skeptical, because this is a kind of unlike of him. But he was brilliant. Paul Giamatti, is also wonderful in his role as the narrator/Police Chief Uhl. But nothing tops the magic. The magic trick, the illusion is unbelievable. Full credits to the director and the screenplay writer. They took their time, pulled together a great cast. And gave a superb result. Dunno why people are screaming about The Prestige, but I'm gonna put my vote in for the Illusionist.8/10 !!!",8,1,2,14 January 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Silver Surfer Rules !!!
","Being the first sequel of this year which has a chance to improve upon the box office records of its successor, Silver Surfer casts a cosmic charm on the big screen. Rise of the Silver surfer improvises on the original movie, it starts off with the impending wedding of Susan Storm and Reed Richards. We find a deepening relationship amongst them.There is a lot of chemistry amongst the four super heroes. Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm who cannot tolerate each other, overcome odds and become great buddies towards the end. We see a new side to Johnny Storm, The human torch. He is still the one to deliver the comic lines, but with a twist of events, he becomes the person responsible leading to missions getting haywire. Its a serious side to his character. Reed Richards, Mr.Fantastic becomes the character he truly is, he leaves the scientist bit, and becomes the leader of the Fantastic Four.If the first movie was focused on The Thing, then this one is based on the Human Torch. Unlike the first movie where he gets any girl to his liking, in this sequel he is vexed with an army vixen who doesn't spare a moment with him. There is a return of Von Doom, who becomes evil personified with the help of the Surfer's board.But truly unique is the character of the Surfer. He has feelings for Susan, because she reminds him of his loved one from his faraway planet. His mission is to make ready a planet for destruction. He becomes the tragic hero, the bidder of evil deeds, left with no choice. But his character is truly enigmatic, he is the all powerful being when conjoint with the board. He feeds on cosmic energy which is why practically speaking he cannot be killed or destroyed. His powers are immense. He can consume a missile, without scratching himself.The special effects are a whole lot better than the previous movie. The final sequence when the Four combine to give their powers to Johnny to destroy Von Doom. Then the initial chase sequence between the Human Torch and the Surfer is also mind blowing. the Fantastic Four vehicle sequence is also pretty neat.All in all a fair watch, mildly entertaining and good to keep your mind off from work for 2 hours.",7,2,5,1 July 2007
Transformers," Transformers rock
","It was quite a surprise watching Transformers evolve to such a good flick. I was of the opinion that apart from Quentin Tarantino no other director can successfully make a good movie based on junk topics. But Michael Bay overcomes the odds. Sure he needed a movie loaded with out of the world special effects, but still it was indeed a good movie nonetheless.It didn't have any big names on the screen. Just numerous robots, good and evil fighting for the world. Surprisingly, however odd this sounds, Michael Bay promoted the story just superbly. Not too much unrealistic, and neither a shade too realism. He had a great visual effects team working with him. Along with teenage beauties Megan Fox & Rachael Taylor, and Shia LaBeouf. He had Jon Voight on a nominal role plus Anthony Anderson as the funny man.The movie features some unbelievable action sequences amongst the Autobots and the Decepticons. The story is indeed junk. But the movie lives on the action sequences and the visual effects, which are literally out of this world.An unbelievable 8/10 !!!",8,1,4,15 September 2007
Million Dollar Baby," 'Mo Cuishle', My Darling, My Blood
","I just came back from the theater after watching this year's Top Movie so far........'Million Dollar Baby', is one heck of a ride. It takes us through the various emotions of human life from betrayal to love, anguish, grief, faith and lastly determination. It is a story of a young American waitress living in extreme poverty whose ambition is to be a WBA Champ....But to be a champ, you need a trainer and the best person to that is Frankie... Frankie himself has a lot of tragedies in his life, that of being an unsuccessful husband and father..... He considers himself at fault at losing his friend and colleague, Morgan Freeman's right eye.....But he is the best trainer around, and he doesn't train girls, especially not over aged girls..... But when his fighter dumps him, things take a turn and soon we find him at the corner of Maggie Fritgerald, the Mo Cuishle.....Maggie wins matches, mostly through knockouts, becomes famous and buys herself out of poverty but her own family, a bitch of a mother and assholes of siblings look at her as a money pond....She gets a shot at the title, and she has control of the match when the champ, does a dirty trick on her causing her a spinal cord fracture....This leads to the end of her career, as she is stuck to her bed, eventually her legs had to be amputated due to infection, and she is left crippled, for life.....But the 'Mo Cuishle' is a born fighter and she convinces her 'Boss' to kill her and instead of letting her live this pathetic life.... Her death drives away Frankie fro m the regular training job and he reclines himself to a street side diner eating lemon pies.....The entire story of the movie is superb and though the dialog is slightly weak in nature the acting qualities overshadows it pretty easily.... The sound effects are outstanding and so is the cinematography.... The music is also very soothing to the ear.... The camera work is amazing, especially during the fights.....A special mention has to be made for Hilary Swank, for an outstanding performance.... She really took the movie into another level... Morgtan Freeman was also very impressive, in his part as the ex-boxer and the caretaker of the Gym..... Clint Eastwood looked slightly overshadowed by these two, and it is probably because of the lack of strong dialogs... Especially after the accident, the dialogs were very weak, and that may be the only part, where the movie looked vulnerable.....Overall a thumbs up and a 8/10.....",8,1,2,1 April 2005
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Impressive, but disappointing...
","Harry Potter & The Order Of The Phoenix was and is, the longest book of the series. It appealed to me as the most interesting book of the heptalogy. The character development in this book is superb. Many potter movie buffs will find this disappointing, and to some extent I'll agree with them.OOTP is all flashy on the outside, true Radcliffe shows more acting sense/skills than any other stuff he has done. Whereas in the previous movies all the time I felt Rupert Grint was overshadowing Radcliffe's role, it's the other way round this time.The good stuff of this movie is the visual effects, which are pretty neat. Radcliffe's acting prowess shows a great maturity. The Phelps twins as always are great. Imelda Staunton is superb as Dolores Umbridge, there cannot have been a better choice for Umbridge, she brings the character to life like no other can possibly have done.The bad stuff is well, the direction, the screenplay, the background score. You always identify a Harry Potter movie with the score. For the first time the central theme of the Harry Potter movies(Hedwig's theme) is missing. That makes a load of difference for the movie watching experience. The screenplay like always is bad. There's bound to be complains about the screenplay if you are a fan of the book. Steve Kloves had raped the books and so has Michael Goldenberg. The direction I felt was poor.The acting has been of the highest order. Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black, Helena Bonham-Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore, Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, The Phelps twins as the Weasley twins. The scene where Sirius Black dies, has got to be the highlight of the 5 movies so far. It has got to be the highlight of Radcliffe's career. It was the one scene which was amazingly done.The special effects were mostly ordinary for the whole movie, but it reached great heights on 2 particular occasions. One during the escapade of the Weasley twins and the other during the final duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore.",7,0,0,18 July 2007
Blood Diamond," Diamonds are Death
","Blood Diamond is one hell of a movie, and I will rate it as a must see.Definitely is the best movie I have seen this year so far, and i felt mighty surprised that the Academy Awards have snubbed this movie in the nominations especially in the best Picture category which I feel it rightly deserves.What can I say about a movie which revolves around such a sentimental and touching topic ? Illegal Diamond trading in Africa and the civil wars is the primary theme of the movie. The makers of this movie have joined these two ideas and produced a superb script. With some amazing casting, this movie has been brought to life by Mr.Danny Archer and Solomon Vandy. Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be getting better and better with each Academy Awards nomination he collects. This being his third, he is a very strong contender for Forest Whitaker. The character of Danny Archer the shrewd and cunning diamond trader who exploits the system, the government and the poor fisherman, farmers to get the diamonds. But even then late in the movie we find a soft side of him, when he sacrifices his own life to save the fisherman and his son. We find out about his horrific past. Djimon Honsu's portrayal of the fisherman is again superb. The poor fisherman estranged from his family by the war, finds his son taken by the rebels, brainwashed and fighting for them. His wife and daughter in a refugee camp. Jennifer Connelly's character Maddy Brown i again precise. A side character who in turn can do anything to meet her own needs, in this case a story about illegal diamond trading. Blood Diamonds. She unfolds the story about the Blood Diamonds and brings down the entire facade.Its really hard to tell your feelings for the movie after the end. I for one was at a loss for words. The one scene where, the fisherman is telling his son,'You are Dia Vandy. You are a good boy, who loves soccer and school. I am your father who loves you and is ready to take you back as my son again.' and the son has an automatic trained on him, will surely bring a tear to ones' eye. The background score for this movie was superb. So was the camera work. Some breathtaking footages about raw African beauty has been captured in the movie. An applause for the director for making a movie on this topic. Thank you sir for such a wonderful 2.5 hours experience.A 9/10 !!!!",9,3,4,23 February 2007
Life Is Beautiful," Life is truly Beautiful
","One of the amazing movies that I've seen in a long time.....Everyone recommended this movie to me, but I was pessimistic... But after watching the movie, I have to say that it is truly a masterpiece.... It doesn't show the effects of the holocausts or the brutal torture suffered by the Jews, although there are brief references about it, but the most marvelous thing about it is the fact that the entire thing is brought about in a beautiful manner with full of laughs.... The beauty of the script and screenplay, makes it amazing.... It portrays, the importance of family ties, and the love of a father for a son... The love which ultimately leads to sacrificing his own life for the welfare of his wife and son....",9,4,7,12 May 2005
National Treasure," 'Jack Of All Trades, Master Of None'
","Last week I went to see National Treasure with 2 things on my mind. First, I was a Cage fanatic, I love his movies packed with unbelievable action and second, this movie was given thumbs down by practically all critics. After seeing the movie I can understand why the critics disliked the film. All the incidents happens at such a tremendous pace that it is hard to believe that just 2 mere guys happen to steal the Declaration Of Independence which must surely be the most protected document existing on the face of this earth. Although the entire concept of the movie is excellent and it has a lot of historical references, (I dunno if they are incorrect, since I'm not a history prof). The plot of the movie is somewhat similar to 'The DaVinci Code'. But the entire movie would be highly underestimated if you are judging by the fast pace of the movie. At the beginning young Gates finds out that his family holds a secret, a secret that leads to a treasure, a treasure so big and so huge that it is not for one person to handle. Then he gets the first clue to the treasure, and the next scene he is at some polar ice caps searching for a ship. I mean where do we know the clue is a ship.........Also, the entire affair, if indeed there was an affair, between Cage and Kruger is extremely patchy, to say the least. Jon Voight is marvelous as Cage's father, he plays an unforgettable role. Also, Riley Cage's assistant adds comic relief to the movie. I must say that the director tried to create a classic but extremely patchy screenplay, plays down his attempt to create a 'Jack of all trades'. He wanted a mixture of all recent Cage movies in one. We can clearly see a touch of 'Gone In 60 Seconds', 'Con Air' and 'Windtalkers'. Apart from these minute omissions of detailing, mainly to reduce the length of the movie, it is thoroughly enjoyable. If you are a Nicholas Cage fanatic, I'm sure you'd love this movie. As for others go and have a glimpse of it. Don't listen to the critics, it ain't that bad. And if you love watching movies about high priority steals, then also there is a scope of liking to your plate.I give it a 9/10.",9,2,2,12 February 2005
The Da Vinci Code," Ron Howard does it again...
","Ron Howard has done it again. He has yet again created a brilliant piece of work from pure fiction. A pure work of sheer incredulance, the book comes alive. Acting was superb, mind blowing, the music calls for special praise, the music pulls out all blocks from the movie. Direction, screenplay, film editing, and the special effects, every thing has been brilliant. This movie calls fro special praise of Paul Bettany as the albino monk. He was absolutely unbelievable. Tom Hanks gives a credible performance, but really he had nothing to prove in this movie, it didn't require his special acting abilities. Audrey Tatou is brilliant, after Amelie she again steals the show. Ian McKellen proves once again why he is one of the grand old men of British Actors. Alfred Molina was a bit lame in his small part. Jean Reno was also too good. The casting guy was brilliant in his part, he chose every person to perfection.Overall this is a too god movie to miss. My advice read the book, and then rush to the theaters. 9/10 !!!",9,1,3,27 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry comes to wonderland
","Well, I went to see this movie, expecting it to be some sort of a fantasy story, not unlike LOTR........But it turned out to be pretty enjoyable and exciting, and I feel that maybe the best so far, after watching part II and III, this seems to be a proper complete movie.....The young stars are pretty neat and cool with their acting knowledge and there is no doubt that their acting would improve with time.... Chris Columbus does a fabulous job behind the cameras and the visual effects in the movie are also stunning.........Overall, it is a thoroughly enjoyable, family movie........8/10....",8,0,2,7 April 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," HP Books finally come alive through the movies...
","Goblet Of Fire, the fourth movie of the ongoing Harry Potter series is finally a movie that the hardcore fans of the books would appreciate. It has been a mammoth task for Mike Newell and his crew to put together a 500 page book into a 2.5 hrs long movie. And he performed the task admirably. Whereas the first movie, was pretty good, the second disastrous, the third being a good once but kept the hardcore book fans wanting for more, this one would surely fulfill everyone's needs. All the important parts including some well invited comic relief is included.This movie is likewise, the third, where it is set in a much serious tone. Plus, it is much dark and for the first time we see Lord Voldemort, the nemesis of Harry Potter. It sets off just like in the books, and Mike Newell very subtly clips some unnecessary portions of the books. Although the hardest of the hardcore fans may complain that the quidditch World Cup could have lingered a bit more, but for your information fellas, the quidditch world cup was cut from the original script, just because it caused a massive uproar, Steve Kloves decided to put it in for a few minutes. Also the maze wasn't quite up to the mark, there wasn't any fanciful/dangerous creatures that Dumbledore (Gambon) warns the champions about.The special effects is state of the art, so is the camera direction. As I stated previously, the acting is way better, particularly because it is a much mature movie, now that all the guys are 16. The music, and score was good, but frankly Harry potter scores aren't the same without John Williams.Overall 9/10, a must see for all Potter fans...",9,1,3,18 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Behind the Dark Chambers, a powerful force lies hidden
","After watching the first movie, and the trailer I was under the impression this was going to be a worthy sequel, but it turned out to be extremely poor.....The entire HP series is based on kids and is also about kids, and if they don't enjoy the movie then all the efforts are in vain, and that is exactly what happened in Cos....Although the entire cast and crew were kept intact, somehow Chris Columbus lost his touch along the way, and the dialogs and the acting was awful.........I felt that after 1 year the scripts and the acting would improve, but the poor acting had remained and this time around it was more to the eye due to the weak script.......The original book is fabulous like the previous but somehow Steve Kloves had lost his way trying to squeeze the film in two hours, a task that he didn't bother in the first movie, because the book was too short.......Overall 6/10, and I thought that it deserved 8.........",6,0,1,7 April 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Guns, Guns And Only Sexy Guns
","I went to this movie to clear my mind from my recently concluded exam, and I wasn't disappointed. The movie is not much of a thriller or a comedy, and it certainly doesn't boast the action sequences of action thrillers like Matrix, Rambo, etc....But its fun watching. The plot is funny, and Angelina Jolie is goddamn sexy(who said she's not???) and the guns.....If there's one reason you want to buy the DVD of this movie, its to loom at such great guns up close. It has all, starting from bazookas, to rocket launchers, Carbines to SMG's, Desert Eagles, Mags, everything.The story is simple, 2 hired killers, are husband and wife, neither knows about the other's true profession. By 'accident' both of their agencies give them the same job, to eliminate a high security prisoner. They mess it up by getting in each other's ways. Their agencies gives them 48 hrs. to eliminate the person responsible for the slip. They come to learn that their spouse is the person involved. When they come face to face, they learn that they love each other too much to kill themselves, but 48 hrs are up and all hell breaks loose, the entire NYPD plus the SWAT are after them, they get themselves into a mess.....Thats where I think I will stop, at least you'll have to find out what actually *happened* in the end....The last action sequence was well shot though overall the camera action was poor... And well after this movie you'll fall in love with Angelina Jolie, she was drop dead gorgeous....In the end a tough 7/10 (And thats only for Angelina Jolie)",7,0,4,15 June 2005
The Departed," Scorsese hits the jackpot..... again !!!
","The Departed is one of the best contemporary thrillers that I have seen. True its a remake, and critics will be be saying,'So what the Chinese did this before and even made sequel to it..' But Scorsese's Departed is a whole new thing. Firstly Jack Nicholson.(Screw me, but I'm a big fan of him...) Even though Nicholson is the villain, the movie doesn't give him much of a headway. He starts off as a local absconder and rises up to a mafia boss, but throughout the movie he rules about every other actor. Be it DiCaprio or Damon. Even in the scene where he dies he commands an aura of respect. Second point making this a must see, is undoubtedly its marvelous star cast. True again that some of the actors were not used to their potential like Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg but still no one would be able to resist the temptation of such an unbelievable cast. Thirdly Martin Scorsese. The bloke has given Hollywood some amazing movies over the years. He may go down in history as the greatest director not to get a Academy Award(I cant see him bagging an award for this, since its a remake) but he truly is a genius. And lastly Pink Floyd. If you people are wondering if I have lost my nuts, then no. Indeed Floyd's most remarkable song,'Comfortably Numb' does feature in the movie in the love making scene between DiCaprio's character and Vera Farmiga.No point harping about the story cause many people saw the smash hit, Infernal Affairs and its a clone of that. Every odd scene, leaving out the ending. The technical bits was good. Screenplay was solid, acting out of the world, there was some bits for comic relief. Some real cool stuff shown with cell phones. Matt Damon, DiCaprio and Martin Sheen all were very good. Vera Farmiga also looked good, even being a new face. Alec Baldwin was vastly underused, so was Mark Wahlberg. But end of the day Jack Nicholson owned the movie. He set the tone, and even at the age of 75, he commands such respect. The scene at the porn theater, I couldn't comprehend Nicholson enacting that masturbating drama, but he pulled it off. Its like a tug of war, with all the heavy weights on one side and the 75 year old man on the other. So bottom line Departed is one hell of a movie, a rated must see. 8/10 !!!!",8,2,4,11 November 2006
War of the Worlds," War of Annoyance
","If there's one thing that'll stand out in this movie, is the annoyance. I just returned after watching the movie(not even 10 minutes have passed), and all I can say is that, the annoying little girl(Dakota Fanning) and her elder brother(Justin Chatwin) will surely irritate anyone to hell. Tom Cruise does a good job of being the divorced father, and his affection for both of his children is very apparent, but like most divorcées, his children thinks otherwise. They dislike him, because they feel that he feels too much about himself. The young girl of 10 years must surely know when there is a crisis and when to keep calm and shut up and when to listen to her father. Even more goes for her brother, who is old enough to be in college, and yet acts so immature and childish.Saying all these, you once again have to praise Spielberg for pulling off an extraordinary action sequences, and incredible camera work. You have to appreciate the pace of the movie. It started of very fast, then it mellowed down, and then fast again, only to mellow down for am incredibly long slow sequence where, the humans stealthily escape from the clutches of the aliens, then finally fast again till the end. Tom Cruise, as Ray Ferrier, gives a reasonably good performance. Tim Robbins plays a small but nice role as the eccentric Ogilvy, who is bent upon destroying th aliens. Dakota Fanning, although was extremely irritating as the young Rachel Ferrier, is commendable. Overall, this is yet again an Independence Day remake, with great computer graphics, and a sci-fi plot. The animation, recreated during the sequence where, the aliens are seen extracting the blood of humans, and planting their pods is awesome. But even after watching this much acclaimed movie, I have to say, that something is still nagging in the back of my mind. It really didn't satisfy me greatly.An ordinary 6/10!!!!",6,0,3,4 July 2005
The Reader," A wonderful Gripping Drama
","The Reader is a post World War 2 drama set in Germany. It involves a middle aged woman, Hanna Schmitz, played by Kate Winslet, who works for the transport company but has a dark past and a young boy who falls in love with her. Their meeting was per chance when young Michael Berg stumbled upon her building very sick. Hanna takes care of him and sends him home. Later after he recovers from his illness he comes to thank her, and their affair starts to blossom. Hanna, has a dark history of being a guard in concentration camps, and being involved in mass killings. She's illiterate but has a fascination for literature. She liked being read to. And she requests Michael to always read to her. Eventually she leaves Berlin, after she gets her promotion. Years later, when Michael is in law school, he finds out about Hanna and her past, and despite knowledge which can help reduce her sentence he disclose it during the trial. Hanna gets the maximum sentence amongst the accused, and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Michael, repentant of his earlier actions, starts sending her audio tapes of books, which slowly helps Hanna, learn to read and write.Its a gripping drama, one of the few which has interested me recently. Kate Winslet and David Kross, the young Michael Berg, have been extraordinary. They eclipse Ralph Fiennes' performance by a mile. Kate Winslet might finally be given the Oscar nod for her role in The Reader, though David Kross, in my mind is equally competent for getting an Oscar nomination, in my mind. Kate Winslet's German accent sounded funny at times, but its easy to overlook such things when you see such a level of performance in front of you. The story is told in a good manner, switching between the present and the past. Little things like the soft musical background score sets the tone of the movie. Kate Winslet does brilliantly to portray an immensely complex character, Hanna Schmitz. She does greatly in distancing herself a bit from the audience, keeps a stone face in front of emotions. A truly great performance.",8,1,2,31 January 2009
The Wrestler," Rourke's return ticket to Hollywood
","Lets cut to the chase. The Wrestler is a 100% Micky Rourke movie. He is on screen for more than 95% of the movie. And Darren Aronofsky has shot the movie in a third person perspective. We are almost all the time following Rourke along. Its the story of a beaten down ex A-List Wrestler, a top entertainer. We have an inside look in the wrestling business. The pain that one has to endure, push their bodies to the limits, day in and day out, to earn a few hundred dollars.Right from the first scene, we see Randy 'The Ram' Robinson, hunched over after a gruelling night of wrestling, disappointed that his pay is less than usual. He goes to his worn down trailer to see that the owner of the trailer park has locked it up because he his late for his payments. We see him struggling through day jobs and weekend pay-per- views, and try and fix his relationship with his daughter. But like everything else his life starts going spiralling down. He collapses after a particularly brutal match and is diagnosed with a bypass surgery. After that we see, him getting frustrated at his life in general, he cant date the woman he loves, his daughter hates him and he cant wrestle. In the end he decides to come back to wrestle, come what may be the consequence, because as he puts it, 'You(the fans) are my true and only family. And I will continue till the day my body goes on, and until you people stay I', done for good!'The movie is not about a comeback, per se. Because, we really doesn't come back to his former glory, and its more of a symbolic gesture. But its got very good moral values. Micky Rourke is extraordinary, and he pulls together a stupendous performance, come awards functions, he will be a very strong contender for the Best Actor performance. This movie also gives us an insight to the wrestling business, and being a wrestling fan for many years, I have a biased view of the movie, but it still is awesome. You see how much of its real, and the pain that the professional wrestlers have to endure, their battering bodies. Its truly extraordinary. Marisa Tomei is also impressive in her role as the stripper who is a good friend of 'The Ram'. We see how their relationship evolves along the movie, her dilemma to get into a relationship with a 'customer'. Evan Rachael Wood is also good in her very small role as Randy's daughter. But like I said in the very beginning, this movie is all about Mickey Rourke, nobody else comes close to steal his glory at the end. A well deserved 8/10!",8,1,1,31 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Saga Concludes To a Fitting End
","I just rented a Screener DVD of the movie, cos I missed it when it was in the theaters... I was under the impression of a great movie, with superb visual effects and excellent acting... I was not slightly disappointed...Like most Star Wars movies, the beginning of the movie is slightly haphazard... It takes a bit of time to realize that the Clone Wars are ending... But when Ian McDermaid is first shown he appears clumsy, with a lot of 'strained' acting... Especially the scene where Count Dooku gets killed, Palpatine definitely looked pretty poor. Also the part when Anakin finally accepts Palpatine as his mentor, that part was kinda foolish. One moment he is wailing for attacking a Jedi, and the next moment he turns to Palpatine....But everything is overshadowed by the awesome ending to the movie, which portrays the final transformation of Anakin Skywalker to the Sith Lord Darth Vader... The death of Padme, finishing the transformation.. Ewan McGregor was awesome, especially in the final sequences of the battle when he wails out,'You were the chosen one...' The special effects were very neat. Ian Mcdermaid also gives a stalwart performance, overlooking his errors at the start, as the Dark Lord Sidious. Natalie Portman, is also very well portrayed. But probably, the best acting was from Anakin Skywalker, Hayden Christensen. This was his movie, which finished what everyone wanted to know, ever since it was revealed that Darth Vader was a Jedi himself... His every move, his every look, had the gleam, and his every movement seemed to portray something... Right from the very beginning, when he learns that Padme is pregnant, we see a flurry of emotions...But the story is also very well crafted. We see that the one thing that drew him towards the Dark Side, his love for Padme, the urge to protect her, even at the cost of death, change when he turns his back to the Jedi. Ironically, his thirst for power becomes so great that he chokes Padme, in her delicate condition, in his anger for betrayal, that he felt for her and Obi Wan. The duel between Master Yoda and Palpatine is also very nice. For the first time in the prequel movies we find someone who is as powerful as Master Yoda, and who can wield the Light Saber as fast and efficiently like he does. There is so much to say about this movie that it can go on and on and on. Not everything can be said within a 1000 words. But one thing has to be mentioned, before concluding this review. The seduction of Anakin Skywalker to wards the Dark Side of the Force... This has to be mentioned. Lucas does a brilliant job of actually creating the sense of insecurity and doubt in his mind, about who to trust and who to follow. On one side he has his friend and mentor Obi Wan and the Jedi council, and on the other hand we have Palpatine. Both these sides manipulate him to come over to their side. Both use him as a spy for the other. But Palpatine has the upper hand, since he knows about Padme's condition, and he gives him an offer that he couldn't refuse. The false promise was the only thing that kept him from turning him over to the Jedi, or even killing him. In his mind, we see that his trust for the Jedi order has started to crumble, because he is asked to do things by his superiors which are exactly what is not supposed to be done by a Jedi. But overall this is an incredible pull off by Geroge Lucas. And we feel for the characters, especially Obi Wan. Perhaps only Ewan McGregor can be comparable to Hayden Christensen in this movie, due to his powerful dialogs. Quotes such as, 'Anakin, I've failed you, I've failed you...'or 'You were the chosen one... You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them, you were to bring balance to the force, not plunge it in darkness....'Or 'Anakin is the father isn't he... I'm so sorry....'but perhaps the best one is...'You were like my brother.... I loved you....'An amazing movie, and 8/10 from me.....",8,5,8,2 July 2005
Casino Royale," Physical, yet smooth, Craig does it best
","Its been a long time since we have seen a Bond fighting with his bare hands doing some death defying stunts minus any gadgets. Casino Royale brings you back to those days, when Bond was a spy, but still a human. To those who claim that sensational chase sequence in the beginning was exhilarating, I'd recommend go and see District 13. This movie is one which has a pretty bare plot. It features more on Bond showing that he is very vulnerable without the gadgets. Noticeably there is a scarcity of Bond girls in this flick. Eva Green is good but nothing compared to her predecessors. This movie shows Bond's tastes and dislikes, his trademark martini and vodka shot, his passion for poker, and also how he comes by his favorite car, the 1964 Ashton Martin.Daniel Craig is a much better Bond than many I believe. Certainly better than Roger Moore and maybe even better than Pierce Brosnan. He lacks Brosnan's suave nature but he has the typical style of Connery's quirky humor. His ability to crack the witty jokes makes him a more presentable Bond on screen. Nothing much to say about the pot, because Casino Royale is one of Fleming's most read novels. It is noticeable that there are very few big names in this movie. The absence of Q and Miss Moneypenny is felt greatly. The stunts, well previous Bonds were better. And the best stunt of the movie is greatly inspired from District 13. The movie stretches unnecessarily to wards the end. And a quite abrupt ending. This probably is the only Bond movie where Bond doesn't get a girl in the end.All in all a fabulous Bond but a wasted effort. 6/10 !!!",6,0,2,19 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Finally a movie worth watching
","Blockbusters after block busters this summer, and I finally got the movie I was looking for. It was absolutely proper what I though it to be. Pirates O13 were good, but below my expectations. Live Free Or Die Hard is just perfect. Its actually amazing, Bruce Willis the 50 plus guy doing what he did. And truth be told I had my reservations against this movie. All through summer all the blockbusters failed due to a weak script. But Live Free comes with an awesome script, plus some mind blowing CGI. True you get to see loads of vehicles getting blown off, that includes a chopper, and a F-35 not to mention the countless cars. But Bruce Willis does what he does best. Those quirky jokes, and strong language is back.Acting is perfect, the visual effects stunning, camera work brilliant, dialogs/screen play too good. Die Hard 4.0 was just about perfect. I normally don't give commercial mainstream movies a 9 but going by the current trend this one deserves every bit of it.",9,4,9,9 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Jackson comes of age
","Peter Jackson finally completes his epic tale, and what a tale it was. An unforgettable journey through middle earth comes to an end with the destruction of the one ring, and Sauron, the dark lord. The Age of men comes and the elves and the wizards leave the middle earth. That's just about what happens in the movie.But nothing can be expressed, about what the actual experience feels like, the fight on the fields of Gondor, the Rohan's armies war cry, it still fills me up, with emotion. It's just about perfect. I mean I literally cannot write anything about this movie, untoward. The special effects will be a benchmark for days to come, the score was mind blowing, the acting was stupendous, the screenplay, costumes, well, I'm running out of words to write in this review... It's a must watch for every man, woman or child capable for a movie going experience...A perfect 10/10...",10,1,3,25 December 2005
Munich," pretty hopeless of a movie from Spielberg
","Munich, or Black September has always remained a sensitive issue with all Jews. This effort by Steven Spielberg as we all know is a effort by him to redeem the events that happened some 34 years ago. The movie starts off as we know, Eric Bana son of a super secret agent is hired as a group leader to assassinate eleven people who were *supposedly* behind the Munich massacre. The group starts off, travels all over Europe eliminating targets, until they find out that they themselves have become the targets and their cover has been compromised. Then they start to fight for their own existence as their own people starts getting knocked off.The brilliance of Spielberg is evident when he finishes off the movie in an abstract fashion. From start till the end we have seen Eric Bana bear a deep hatred for the Arabs and a national pride. Somewhat through the movie he meets up with an Arab extremist and he realizes that they are on the same boat. Both are killers just fighting on the opposite side. In the end, thats what happens. He learns that of the 11 targets he was to finish, only 1 was the mastermind, the rest else were either suspects with no real proof, or sum one who had been involved against some anti Jewish movement in the past. He realizes the nature of the world has made him to be a terrorist just like the Arabs from Black September, no different. He realizes the pain of the Jewsh athletes when they die, knowing that they cant do anything to save themselves and it was their own country that let them down rather than the Arabs assassinating them. An individual brilliance of Eric Bana, with some witty direction by Spielberg is all that you can expect from Munich. It's a thriller, but Spielberg has made better movies I can assure you.A 7/10 !!",7,0,2,12 May 2006
300," Frank Miller's best till date
","To be true to myself, I was a bit worried if 300 was worth the 100 bucks that I spent to get a balcony ticket at the theaters. 10 minutes into the movies and I realized that I had more of my money's worth already. The movie not only depicts the great struggle of the 300 Spartans but also the indomitable courage of King Leonidas.The movie similarly shot as Sin City, is mostly on a B/W basis, with traces of red(blood). It features mind boggling visual effects completely of a different scale. Heads getting chopped off, and every specks of blood flying away, is clearly visible. The scene where the Spartans witness the Persians ships getting shipwrecked in the fiery storm, you could see the rain splattering on the shields so clearly it would seem that the persons are standing right in front of you.Now getting into the story...We all know of the tales of Leonidas, courtesy of poems and folk tales. But the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic takes the story to another level. Right from the first scene of Leonidas being trained by his father, till the scene he dies, the movie will keep you breathless, be it the magic of the special effects or the superb dialogs. Gerard Butler and Lena Headley as the Spartan King and Queen are fabulous. Both contrast each other perfectly. Vincent Regan as the Captain is awesome, and the scene where he watches his son die helplessly is so superbly done, every frame of that scene wants you to leap into the movie and help them.Onto the technical details...What to say ?? Direction has been superb, the screenplay awesome, casting top notch,acting marvelous. Special mention must be made of the background score,it really reflected the mood of the movie in every possible angle. The cinematography and costume designing were out of the world. And lastly, the visual effects. I already harped on it at the beginning, and I really have to mention it again. Ladies and gents, all who are reading this review, let me tell you, the visual effects shown here are totally out of this world, and I can assure you that you haven't seen any movie with this much quality before. Me thinks they manually edited every frame to put in those effects...Finally a word for all those who are thinking this movie to be crap. Let me assure you guys and gals, that this is one movie which is a must see. Spend some of your cash and go watch this. Believe me you wont want to miss this.A well deserving 9/10 !!! (I could give more but I stuck to 9. LOL !!!)",10,3,8,18 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Fantastic 4, Fantastic Film
","I never read any Fantastic Four comics, so I cannot tell if the director followed with the comics or not, but all I can tell after watching the movie is that it's better than any MARVEL comics inspired movie that I'd seen (that includes Spiderman).The story has been intricately plot, and makes the characters certainly much better than the cartoon series, if not the comics(which I don't know about). The four guys plus Van Doom, their sponsor, go on a space mission to study human DNA better, but that mission goes haywire, as all of them get exposed to heavy radiation of an unknown kind.Next the story follows, how each of the five come to realize their own powers. Something which gives us more insight on the characters. Special focus is given on 'The Thing' as because of his hideous looks. Also the subtle romance between invisible Girl and Mr.Fanatastic is good to watch, but the action sequences are simply superb. The sequences about dodging the rockets, and the ones between the fight between Doom and Fantastic Four is also very well shot. Torchd is well portrayed as the flamboyant playboy, much like the original story.After watching the movie in the theater however, I realize that this is again a one time movie, just to give you a break from the monotonic day to day life. It doesn't stick to your heart like other movies. But no doubt it's still a great fun watching it. 8/10 from me...",4,3,6,23 July 2005
Happy Feet," Funny,Emotional&Charismatic
","Those are the three words to sum this up.2006 was a big year for animations.We had Cars, Ice Age2, Monster House, Over The Hedge to name a few that stood out from the pack. Another animation joining this group is Happy Feet. With stellar casting voices such as Elijah Wood, Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Robin Williams and Hugo Weaving, this was already an expected success.And they deliver.Packed with a story and some utterly mind blowing animations, Happy Feet has got it all for a hit. I wont be surprised if it gets an Academy Award nod. With a unique plot(penguins have heart songs) we venture into the world of the Antarctic residents. And so unfolds the story of Mumble, considered an outcast by his peers and the source of ill luck by the wise.Driven away by his fellow penguins, Mumble ventures out to find out the real cause of shortage of food, and finds out the reason.Aliens(as in humans).He is taken to captivity but somehow is able to communicate via his feet.The same reason for which he is driven away from his homeland.When he returns back, he brings with himself all glory and joys with unlimited food.Happy Feet in its essence turns out to be a musical.What do you expect, if penguins are supposed to have heart songs ?? But even through the musical story unfolds with the epic journey of Mumble Happy Feet. Nicole Kidman, Elijah Wood and Robin Williams are superb in their respective character voices. Comic relief of the ghettoized little penguins are a laugh.But all in all this is one movie which must not be missed. True it is a centrally focused movie. Only a few characters remain in focus, not much is available for the rest. But even then the characters play it out nicely for Elijah to punch it out.The animation is groundbreaking. Nothing like I've ever seen previously. The sliding sequences and the abandoned factory sequence is just unbelievable. The story as I said was good, actors were good, animation was good. So all in all 8/10 !!!",8,0,0,1 January 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," An awesome movie, based on true facts
","I didn't read Vikas Swarup's book, but I can tell you for certain, that this is one movie which you can see without reading the book and feel bad about it later. Slumdog is a refreshing movie, one which I for one hope will open the gates of Bollywood to the Western world, if it hasn't already. It shows the character of Mumbai, the heart of India, the financial hub. Starting from the communal riots to the life of poverty that is led by the homeless. The cruelty inflicted on them, the inhumanity makes your heart go out. The scene where young Jamal gets kicked in the face by the cab driver when he sees that his cab has been ransacked, and Jamal says,'You wanted to see the real India, this is it!!' What an ironic and true statement!!This movie apparently has all the qualities of a typical Bollywood flick, but yet so different. Firstly the excellent screenplay and casting of characters. The sequence of young Jamal explaining to the American couple about the Taj Mahal was hilarious. Also the scene when the evil Maman gouges the eye out of a boy, so that he can earn more,just because he has a special talent in singing.(Trust me folks, such things happen, and even more worse things too) You can shudder at the gore, and your heart will go out when a grown up Jamal sees him later and gives him the 100$ because he wants to, makes your heart go out to the poor kid.The casting, I felt was brilliant. Right from the young Jamal and Salim to the middle-aged Jamal and Salim, it was absolutely awesome, and Danny Boyle got the best out of both the actors. Of course Dev Patel, himself was brilliant as well, so was Anil Kapoor as the shrewd, evil host of the show. The film also has its bit for the Western Audience, and the ones who don't understand Hindi, in an innovative way of putting in subtitles. The music, is also too good. A.R. Rahman does it again, like he has done so many times, and an Oscar nod may be on its way, it was a long time coming. Not going to harp on the story, since the trailer pretty much gives you an idea about it. But I'll just sign off saying Kudos to Danny Boyle and the 'Slumdog Millionaire' team for this wonderful movie.",9,0,3,24 December 2008
Shark Tale," A Tale Of A Nobody
","I thought Shark Tale would be much similar to Finding Nemo, but after watching the movie I must say that its predecessor was way too good.....The one thing which maybe was a little more enjoyable than Nemo, was the script.... And that was expectable, since Will Smith had to have a funny script.... Tha animation and underwater graphics, is still the same if not a little better, than Nemo, but the entire story line is hopelessly weak.....The story revolves around a tiny little fish, Oscar, who aspires to be the most popular fish of the reef, but hasn't got the capability.... He owes loads of money to his boss, who decides to get rid of him... He orders his henchmen, 2 jellyfishes, to scratch him, but whilst they were planning, a shark comes out of nowhere, to have a bite.... Here in a an accident of the most freakiest kind, the shark dies.... But this shark was no ordinary shark, he was the son of the mafia don..... Maddened with grief, the dead shark's younger vegetarian brother, goes away, and stumbles upon Oscar.....From here on, the story goes on revolving upon the love interest of Oscar, and how he gets everything okay between, the sharks and the fishes.... The movie has parts which are sure to remind you of the godfather, and Robert DeNiro, gives an amazing performance as the shark don.....(For instance the don's right hand man's name was Luca, remember The Godfather) Also, Jack Black gives another great role as Leni, the vegetarian shark.... Renee Zelwegger's role as Oscar's love interest is also, very good and stellar, Angelina Jolie's small role as the illustrious Lola, the sex doll, is also pretty good, Martin Scorsese, does a cameo, as Oscar's boss, but doesn't create much of a mark to the movie.... And lastly Will Smith, well basically this was his movie and his voice gave a new life to Oscar, the shark slayer, and he brought the character to life, giving him the cool attitude that he is known for, and that may well be the only thing worth watching for in Shark Tale, otherwise a pretty forgettable movie.........7/10 from me.....",7,1,2,1 April 2005
The Island," Clone Fun
","The Island is not the usual Sci-Fi movie. It's not the usual fights with humans and clones nor is it about fraudness, like in Multiplicity or The Sixth Day. This is a movie first of its kind taken from the perspective of a clone. The plot is good, and coupled with some good acting, and some awesome special effects it is quite promising. Both Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlett Johansson puts up good displays. Sean Bean puts up another great show as the ever enigmatic villain. The story is basically, that a secret underground bunker is being used as a human clone laboratory. The clones are made so as to free the human world of pain and diseases. The clones donate body organs for transplants, bear the child for the mother, but as soon as their purposes are served they are killed away. SeanBean the person in charge of this society does a great job. For once we realize that all his intentions are good but are used as a bad propaganda. The clones as he puts it are not humans, but vegetative organisms, incapable tot think and live a life as a human. Lincoln Echo 6 was the first to break out of this rule. He started to think about the facility, kept asking questions. The clones were told that there was a massive radiation contamination in the earth, thats why people were kept there safe. Each month there was a lottery where a person was sent to a paradise isle called The Island. 'The Island' in fact was no more than a myth, in other words, it was the Operation Theater for them, signifying that their purpose was served and they were to be finished of soon enough. Lincoln Echo 6 discovered the hard truth, and knowing that his best friend Jordan Delta 2 was also headed to the Islnd, he takes up matters in his own hands. He escapes the facility with her out in the real world, to face the hard truth. There was no contamination at all. After that they overcome all odds to survive in the real world, throwing off the trail of a deadly assassin after them. In the end they return to the facility to over rule the authorities freeing all the people inside. The Action sequences of this movie is superb, makes you think back to the days of the Matrix. Don't be surprised if it walks away with an award later this year for visual effects. The camera work is superb. Ewan Mcgregor was amazing and so was Sean Bean. And you can't just describe in words how good Scarlett Johansson was. She was awesome, and SO hot. The score was also mind blowing, (I have already ordered for my copy in amazon.com) Michael Bay does a good job in this movie, and a overall 9/10 for me...",9,0,2,29 July 2005
