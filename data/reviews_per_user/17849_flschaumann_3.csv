Hereditary," I have no idea why people like this movie
","There's barely any tension, the characters aren't likable at all, barely anything happens and if something happens it's not even remotely scary.For a 'horror' flick this movie is just bad.",1,2,6,26 September 2018
Us," Meanders between generic, boring and awful
","I watched it because of the 7+ imdb rating and what a let down this movie was.It is a bog standard clichee horror flic with several unnecessary lengths and a plot that has more holes than swiss cheese which ultimately leaves you with a 'wtf did I watch this for'-feeling.
Nothing about this movie makes it stand out. Setting, Effects, Actors...nothing noteworthy at all that would justify the high rating it has.I can't recommend anyone to pay money to watch this, it's just not worth it.",3,0,0,31 May 2019
A Quiet Place," The best of this genre in a long time.
","Thrilling from beginning to end, great acting, very well presented and written characters.I think the only minus is that the CGI looks a bit dated.",9,2,4,26 September 2018
