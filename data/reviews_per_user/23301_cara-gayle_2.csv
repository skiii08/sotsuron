Black Swan," Trailer better than the Movie
","I went into this only having seen the trailer. I was excited about it. It looked dark, creepy, and intriguing with the ballet aspect. I was going into it not knowing much but the trailer.From the beginning I saw the scene from the trailer of Natalie portman dancing with a black swan. Within the first 10 minutes I had seen and heard everything else from the trailer. Natalie portman obviously did not do most of her footwork, as the cameras OBVIOUSLY never showed her feet except in closeups, the plot was obvious and direct and PREDICTABLE, and the acting was terribly contrived. There was a moment where when the teacher told her to touch herself, it was funny in its awkwardness. It lost the humor when she actually did in fact go home and not only touch herself, but masturbate herself and lucky us, we got to see the whole thing. It was disgusting. The cameras were ALL off-balance and made me SICK, and I got so sick of seeing the back of her neck for minutes at a time. I would not have minded the IMPLICATION of masturbation if she hadn't done it at least 3 times and we didn't have to see it in great detail. Come on, we get it. If we wanted to see porn we would have done something else besides go to THIS MOVIE.What dumb asses wrote this? It TOLD you what was going to happen from the very first two sentences of the movie. That's not foreshadowing, that's bullshit.And we left mid-movie during the lesbian make out/oral scene. I'm sorry, but it did NOTHING for the plot and it made us very uncomfortable. I don't care if it was a guy and a woman, something that explicit should be left out of a freaking SWAN LAKE movie about BALLERINAS. What the hell, people? I guess they were going for intense but instead went for pornographic.The 'horror' scenes were just gross and unnecessary, and the people were so one-dimensional it hurt me. So she was crazy, who cares? I surely didn't. I just wanted to get the hell out so I wouldn't be subjected to the nonsense of this movie anymore. I didn't see the ending and I could care less to know it. That is how bad this movie is.",1,30,83,5 January 2011
The Fly," First half much different than second half
","I watched this movie on TV, not really knowing much about it but by the sound of it, it was a horror film. I love Jeff Goldblum, he's gorgeous, he's tall, he's built like a God, great actor, etc. and I love Geena Davis as well. So naturally I enjoyed the first 40 minutes to an hour of this movie. Jeff Goldblum plays the quirky yet lovable scientist who is on the verge of the greatest discovery of the 20th century, teleportation. Geena Davis is the journalist who becomes interested in his projects and realizes it has much potential. They fall for each other, but her ex-boyfriend who happens to be the editor of her profession, tries to intervene. I found the first half of the movie to have a different feel, almost like a romance. But I knew that this could not and would not last just from the title of the movie. I love Jeff Goldblum, and of course enjoyed seeing him nude in many scenes, as well as in his skivvies...hey it's as close to full frontal nudity I'll get in this movie! Ahem, anyway, then the movie gets really gross really fast. Geena notices he has some weird hairs growing on his back. He becomes less mellow and very high-strung. She is not pleasing him sexually, as he can last much longer than she can (my utter fantasy, without the morphing into a fly part). He becomes stronger and more agile. Then the creepy stuff begins (if you don't count the baboon inside-out). He arm wrestles a guy until the guy's arm bone breaks. (Gross). He uses canes and his hands are emitting pus-like substances. Geena meanwhile doesn't see him for a while. When she does, he is utterly grotesque, looks like he was in an acid accident, and vomits on his food to eat it (I almost lost MY food while watching this, so sudden and disgusting!) Then she feels sorry for him and tries to help him. I must admit I stopped watching at this point so I guess I really have no place writing a review. I will say though, that i did tune in to see more horrific stuff, and if you've already seen it you know what it is, and if not, just read the parental guide on this website. Basically, he morphs into a humanoid fly to the point that he just wants to die (if it were me I'd have just ended it much sooner) and Geena's character shoots its head off with a shotgun after an attempt to reverse the transformation failed. It is horrifying, sad, and disgusting. It makes me feel so sick and sad inside, but the good thing is that it is so far from reality that it is hard to relate to.The beginning was more interesting and enjoyable in my opinion but I love to see Jeff Goldblum...like I said.' It's a 'classic' remake, and it stands alone well without having seen the first one with Vincent Price.But it is quite intense and gross at the end. I would recommend for people like me to just watch the first half or so, and then be done with it.",5,2,11,23 January 2011
