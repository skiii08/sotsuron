Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," it is a adventure movie
",I liked this movie because I liked the effects that it shows on the film and I liked all of the famous pirates that is tells you about like the pirate black beard and all the other type of mythical creatures it show on it like mermaids. I also liked that while they were on an adventure looking for a very valuable treasure there was a bit of romance and I like all the main characters on it like (captain Jack Sparrow) Johnny Depp who is in all the pirates of the Caribbean movies and Sweeney Todd and the tourists and there is (Angelica) Penelope Cruz who is in many other films like spy kids three and Sahara and grown-ups and dogma. I also like it because it is a bit funny and has a lot of adventure in it.,10,1,2,12 November 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," it is a animation, musical and cheerful film
",I liked the movie because there was a lot of music on the movie and on the film there are a lot of things on it that would be impossible to do because it is animation instead of live actors. I liked the graphics that are on the movie and all the different type of animated effects and I think that is one of the reasons the movie is so good. I like all the voices of the characters that are of other shows like (Alex) Ben Stiller of night of the museum 1 and 2 and Zoolander and Dodgeball and (Marty) Chris Rock of grown-ups and dogma and what to expect when you're expecting and (Melman) David Schwimmer off of the TV series friends. I think this film is similar to ice age because they are Animation movies about talking animals and they are both lost and trying to get somewhere and then get there.,8,1,2,12 November 2012
