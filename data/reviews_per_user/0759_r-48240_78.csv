","MacDonald is really good at writing dialogue. Every time the hostess scolds, she scolds brilliantly. The more she scolds, the more she has the courage of 'one against the world'; the stronger she is, the lonelier she is. The more desperate she is in her search.

The Usual Suspects," This is a film that will never be tired of seeing
","Classic suspense film, a nearly flawless lie, a wonderful cover up. The narrative of the film is very successful, and the suspense of appropriately shaking the burden keeps the audience's attention from beginning to end. The mystery is revealed at the last moment, which makes people have a long aftertaste. The moral of the story is also thought-provoking: there is no equal between the appearance of evil spirits and the appearance of great evils. Maybe the standard of the devil is the cunning lies and the poor appearance. It's a film that can't be tired of seeing. It chews on the hidden links left by dialogue and plot. The highlights are amazing.",8,0,1,31 March 2020
Batman Begins," A wonderful movie

Room," Gripping and thought-provoking
","The first half of the movie 'room' is gripping and the second half is thought-provoking. Frankel talked about a victim syndrome, that is, being persecuted for a long time can lead to emotional numbness and cognitive errors. For example, they would think, 'how do you all deal with all the suffering I've suffered...' Therefore, it is difficult to integrate into the original living environment. After all, it's more difficult to reconstruct the original world when it collapses than to return to the real environment from ignorance. That's why mom can't stand it and son is braver. That's why 'room' is more profound than the general suspense movie. Fortunately, love is the best medicine to save everything.",9,0,0,12 April 2020

1917," A full-length shot
","This level of long lens can only be the product of this era. I think he has gone beyond the traditional so-called lens movement and scheduling techniques, because it is impossible to achieve this long lens from that perspective. This long shot is simply creating reality. I also have the feeling that after the only shot in that movie is cut off, the whole plot becomes surreal. The sun like flares, the virgin like girls in the basement, the river full of corpses, the homesickness song the soldiers heard before going to battle, and the gallop in front of the trench. All this is so dreamy that I doubt whether the protagonist has actually died in the cutting Black shot.",7,0,1,3 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A movie worth watching
","I feel Quentin is very relaxed. He talks about revenge like a wandering dance. The first person main line plus narration is really good, it can be super succinct to talk about complex multi line. A lot of caricature's exaggeration performance technique and the memory which flashed back wantonly. There are many interesting ways to split the mirror in the fighting scene, but most of them are blood fountains. There are a lot of long shots in the dance hall, but they are of little practical significance.",8,0,0,12 April 2020

Toy Story," A good movie about growth and dreams
","Hu Di has low self-esteem, jealousy and no sense of security. He always comforts himself. He is Andy's favorite toy. In fact, he worries about others replacing him all the time. At last, he admitted that bath Lightyear was cool, he admitted that he was ordinary, and finally he could face up to himself. Ordinary is not terrible. What's terrible is not to accept your ordinary. Buzz Lightyear always thought he was a space trooper and a superhero. A TV advertisement broke his dream and let him hit the wall of reality. Cowboys and astronauts, civilians and heroes, have different identities and different positions, but the transformation of re understanding themselves is the same. The first growth is from ambition to reality; the second growth is to learn to pursue dreams after being down-to-earth. The most common Hu Di can also unite all toys, scare away the villains and save Buzz Lightyear; Buzz Lightyear, who can't fly, actually soars in the sky and fulfills his dream of flying. The most touching moment is not the great achievements of heroes, but the highlight of the little ones.",9,0,0,16 April 2020
Once Upon a Time in America," The use of sound in this movie is very ingenious
","Sound is the most important element in this film. It not only constructs a complete space-time span of 30 years, but also completes the psychological transition by a series of means, such as the sound painting counterpoint, the sound painting separation and so on. The era symbol of music is extremely accurate, and the soundtrack shows the nostalgic atmosphere of sadness and indulgence.",7,0,3,17 April 2020
3 Idiots," A comedy film worth watching
","Three idiots, it's satire, but it's the self righteous audience. You can definitely piece together all the elements of Hollywood comedies in nearly three hours of movies, and despise these old-fashioned plots.

Pulp Fiction," Classic
","The representative works of non-linear narrative films. The structure is ingenious and meaningful, and the dialogue is wonderful.

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," A very wonderful British comedy film
","The interlaced multi-threaded movie technique makes the plot brilliant in 'Lock,Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', the logical and rigorous black humor, which makes people see the unique charm of British comedy.

The Godfather: Part III," The same excellent finish as the previous one
","'Godfather' series of the end of the work, expression and depth is no less than the first two! Al Pacino is still charming when he is old, not to mention his acting skills. There are still a lot of right to the point maxims in the film. In addition, compared with the previous two films, the film has more emotional and family scenes.

Psycho," The forerunner of split personality movie
",The low-cost movie can also be immortal. Hitchcock's careful thinking and unique mirror operation add to the depiction of details. Its metaphor is also worth remembering. The skull at the end is even more chilling. This film pioneered the split personality movie,9,1,1,27 April 2020
12 Years a Slave," Another version of Shawshank's redemption
","In a sense, this is the slave version of Shawshank's redemption, but it doesn't have so many clever tricks, but its essence is the same - although the body is not free, it always pursues to realize the value of being a person. The greater significance of the film is that it is so intuitively displayed on the screen about all aspects of slavery in the South Manor - dirty, cruel, especially hypocritical.",8,0,1,14 April 2020
Joker," A wonderful movie
","Really beyond expectations. I haven't seen DC Comics. The movie tells the story of the gap between the bottom edge of the society and the rich and the poor from the perspective of clowns.

The Shawshank Redemption," A great movie
","Andy and Rhett's conversation is so classic. When Andy says he wants to go to a hotel on Mexico's Pacific coast to spend his life. How can it be said that Rhett did not believe it? A man sentenced to life in prison is daydreaming. This is the gap, the gap of thought, the gap of value. It is the gap between the world, that is why there will be winners and losers in this world, there will be the poor and the rich, there will be this story It is not terrible that people are trapped by high walls, because some people are not trapped.

Parasite," Very disappointing movie
","The movie won an Oscar, so I went to watch it with interest. But I was very disappointed! The actor's performance is good, but many of the plots of the movie are too rigid to make people seem stupid. Many people say metaphors, but I think that's a stereotype of class. The film portrays the poor as unscrupulous, and the rich are stupid. The director may express something worth thinking about, but the carrier of expression, that is, the plot of the film is stiff and failed. I'm puzzled that this film won an Oscar.",2,5,10,20 March 2020
