Hereditary," Really.......
","Because of all the high marks and comments from other viewers I was encouraged to see this film. Wow what a disappointment and total waste of time. Instead of having a scare factor scenario the movie ends up just trying to gross you out on a junior high level. The story itself was so slow and never went anywhere. We did ask for our money back ( didn't happen, you have to leave before 1/2 way through, wish we did that)",1,2,5,23 June 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Using the big names Pitt, Leo and Margo to pull in the first weekend.
","Not close to a 9.5 rating. Will tumble to 7.4 I predict. Should be 'Helter Skelter Part 2'. Typical Tarantino plot--change history, like 'Inglorious Bastards.' NOt quite as boring as 'Hateful Eight' but similar in that the only action happens in the last 20 minutes.",6,2,7,26 July 2019
