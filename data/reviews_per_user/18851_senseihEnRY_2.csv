The Avengers," Pretty Cool Superheroes Movie for Marvel Standard
","Marvel's The Avengers is a movie like nothing else, it's a movie that play a role as the finale from 5 different movies: Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and Thor (2011). It's a movie where you can see some of the finest, and most popular superheroes of American comic packed together in action-heavy sequences for more than 2 hours.But, just like the other Marvel Studio's movies, The Avengers is simply a sci-fi action that purpose only to entertain the watchers with its flashy special effect and outrageous action.Joss Whedon (Buffy The Vampire Slayer) did a good job directing this movie, every superhero get the same amount of role and enough background story (although it might not necessary since 4 of 'em have their own movie) so no one feel left behind. The story is pretty standard with Thor brother, Loki try to rule the earth by borrowing Chitauri's Army which he'll bring to earth using the power of Tesseract, hidden in earth. The Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Nick Fury decide to run the Avengers Initiative to collect the earth's mightiest soldiers including Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Black Widow to fight against the global threat. Of course, Thor join the force later because, you know, he have responsibility for his naughty little brother.Most of the movie contain heavy action sequences but one thing that i really like is the filmmaker try to show us that collecting these superheroes and force them to fight together is not always gonna work right. They are, however, just humans with their own personality and ego. The problem is, when they finally settle their problems, nothing more interesting happens in the movie. I like action movie but maybe because there's too many superheroes movie out there and every one of 'em always using heavy special effects (to destroy a major city of USA), the action become bland and sometimes boring. There's no jaw-dropping moments, no tense, no thrill, it's just the same 'America getting' attack by the alien again' movie.Robert Downy Jr. of course steal most of the attention here (he's the freakin' Tony Stark!). Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner also act remarkably. The rest of the cast is pretty standard, yep, including the badass Academy Awward winner, Samuel L. Jackson. Tom Hiddleton as Loki is good but seriously, why the writers decide to make Loki look very, very weak? he's far from threatening, he can be easily defeated, he's the main bad guy but he post no serious threat to the Avengers (he even become part of the joke in many sequence).It's hard not to compare Marvel's The Avengers with another big superhero movie coming out this year, The Dark Knight Rises but looking at how The Avengers come out, i have no doubt that Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises will kick The Avengers ass.",7,1,6,11 May 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," After 'Revenge of the Fallen' we can't hope much for this
","After the disappointing Revenge of the Fallen, director Michael Bay and producer Steven Spielberg release the latest entry of their Transformers series. I'm not hoping much from this one because well...Michael Bay rarely make a good sequel, and my prediction is right, Dark of the Moon is a standard action adventure movie and just like other sci-fi series, flashy special effect won't help much on the thirdThe leader of Autobot, Sentinel Prime, carry an invention that can end the war between Decepticon and Autobot. Unfortunately, his ship crashed on the moon and the invention is forever lost, well, until the autobot come to earth. Dark of the Moon's main story is the fight between Decepticon and Autobot to retrieve this invention because whoever possess it have the power to turn the tide of the war. The story actually pretty good if only Bay didn't mixed it (probably in 70/30 portion) with Sam's story. The human side of story in Transformers is not only unimportant, it's annoying and take too much of the film. I don't care about Sam's hardship to get work and settle down, i don't care about Sam's romance story. I watch Transformers because i want to see Transformers, i want to see Optimus Prime! Dark of the Moon is just as boring as the 2nd. The last stand on Chicago is definitely too long to enjoy. Too many unnecessary scenes and the continuity and logic of each scenes is simply bad. The special effect is good but like i say, on the third, it doesn't matter anymore.Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) 6/10",5,1,4,3 October 2011
