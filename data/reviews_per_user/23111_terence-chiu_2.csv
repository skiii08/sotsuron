Blade Runner 2049," If the original Blade Runner was a classic, the 2049 sequel is a masterpiece
","Superior to the original Blade Runner, and one of the best scifi films for both scifi fans and non-fans alike. I just rewatched the original Blade Runner last night so this is not a comparison based on distant memories. The sequel has a richer but also more approachable and understandable story, better acting and cast, and even better cinematography and music. Must see! Don't be scared away by the weak box office results or long run-time.",10,8,17,7 October 2017
Warcraft," Best movie based on video game source material I've seen... better than critics say, give it a chance!
","I admit that the story may be confusing for viewers who are not familiar with the Warcraft universe, this is by far the best movie based on video game source material. Unlike most movies that turn out far worse than the trailer, Warcraft is surprisingly better than the trailers and promotional material.The story is much more complex and actions of the characters have significant consequences, unlike most other video game and fantasy movies where the 'good guys' always win. Unfortunately, the story does begin abruptly, so for people not familiar with Warcraft, keep an open mind and let yourself get into the world of Azeroth.I hope Blizzard will continue to make more movies in the Warcraft universe, as the story has only just begun. Oh, and please make an Overwatch movie as well!",10,5,9,11 June 2016
