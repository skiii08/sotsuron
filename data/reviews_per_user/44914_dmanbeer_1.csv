The Expendables 2," Great to see all again in 1 platform
","I saw The Expendables II this morning at a pr-screening. What can I tell you about this movie. Firstly, it's really action packed. You're blasted off in the first few minutes leading up to the actual story. Obviously, this is not a film with a great script or impressive acting.However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone,Willis and many more. The addition of Chuck Norris and van Dame to the cast worked out well. It's really good to see Chuck Norris in action again and he really pulls it off! I expect that the people who will like this movie most will be the fans of the old guard like Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Norris and the other cast members. Someone I really liked was Liam Hems worth who did a great job and stood his own between these action giants! Nan as Maggie was also a good casting choice an did what she was supposed to do.",8,2,9,7 September 2012
