The Blair Witch Project," Go to this film knowing as little as possible
","I was disappointed with how little 'The Blair Witch Project' scared me.  I felt like they concentrated too much on the being lost parts rather than the being stalked parts (which were truly creepy).  It woulda been cool if during the day, they could hear something following them but couldn't see anything.  When they stop, it stops, if they reverse, it reverses. Something like that.  It was a really good movie, though.  Original to say the least.  I'd put it on the scare-o-meter level with 'Jaws' and 'Psycho', but much lower than 'The Shining', 'Halloween' and 'Alien'.  Hopefully the inevitable copycats to follow will be really good and old-school scary.  I will say this; though, I think 'The Blair Witch Project' has the scariest ending I've ever seen.  On the other hand, the scariest beginning I've ever seen was 'The Hitcher' which, after the first scene, was not a scary (or good) movie at all.  The moral:  A scary scene does not necessarily make a scary movie. One last word of advice:  The less you know about this movie, the scarier it will be when you watch it.  If I were you, I wouldn't read anymore user comments or reviews.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too many lose ends
","First of all, I was very impressed by this film visually (how could you not be) and, in particular, the lightsaber fight at the end was cool to the point of overload. Overall, however, this film was a disappointment for me, but not in the same way as the critics.  True, the characters weren't as vivid as the other movies, but that doesn't bother me because the two main characters in SW1 were Jedi and therefore were supposed to be solemn as opposed to eccentric. What bothered me were the implausibilities, inconsistencies, and cameos of characters that were only in the movie so the audience would cheer. C-3PO's part in the film was ridiculous because in SW4, when he was on Tatooine, he told Luke he didn't know what planet he was on and I doubt he'd forget.  Threepio may be a coward, but he's not an idiot.  Also, the idea that Anakin built him and 30 years later, of all people, Luke ends up buying him is just too much of a coincidence for me to swallow.  Let me get this straight, not only is Vader Luke's father and Leia Luke's sister, but now Threepio's his brother?  Come on!  What is this a Sci-Fi soap opera?  Next thing you know, in episodes 2 & 3, Chewbacca will be Anakin's dog! R2-D2's part also seemed forced.  Any arbitrary droid would have sufficed in that role and it seems like, again Lucas put him in there just to have a familiar character. One thing I've always wondered is why does Lucas feel compelled to keep coming back to Tatooine?  Is he running out of ideas for planets or does he just like filming in the desert?  You'd think in the vastness of space with as many aliens you see in these films, odds are Luke and Anakin would come from different planets. Space battle at the end seemed forced, too.  At one point, they're shooting each other on Naboo, the next, they're shooting each other in space.  It wasn't like SW4&6 when they had a set-up so we knew what the point of the attack was.  I didn't even know what they were trying to accomplish, until they accomplished it.  It seemed with the obligatory climactic dog fight and maximum possible cameos, that Lucas was trying to re-create the Star Wars formula with no logical reasoning. Maybe I'm being too analytical, but I don't consider myself a huge Star Wars fan and If I can spot these flaws without any real effort, how come Lucas can't?  After 16 years, I expected more authenticity.",4,0,1,24 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 25 reasons The Phantom Menace was lame
","1.  A number of the aliens in the movie are blatantly racist. 2.  Action begins too quickly at the beginning.  Come on, this is the first movie!  You gotta have at least a little more set up other than the words that scroll up. 3.  In 'A New Hope', Obi-Wan didn't know who R2-D2 was even though they had plenty of scenes together in 'The Phantom Menace'.  R2-D2 should have been left out of this movie.  Any droid could have been in his place. 4.  Also, in 'A New Hope', C-3PO didn't recognize Tattooine even though, according to 'The Phantom Menace', it's his home planet.  I doubt he'd forget that, after all, he's a protocol droid.  He shouldn't have been in this movie, either.  It's obvious Lucas put him in so we could see Artoo and Threepio meet. 5.  Anakin built C-3PO.  So let me get this straight:  In 'The Empire Strikes Back' we found out that Vader is Luke's father.  Then, in 'Return of the Jedi' we found out that Leia is Luke's sister.  Now, in 'The Phantom Menace' we find out that C-3PO is Luke's half-brother.  What is this, sci-fi soap opera? 6.  The odds that R2-D2 flew with both Anakin and Luke are ridiculous. Another reason Artoo should have been omitted from episode one. 7.  Too much Jar Jar Binks. 8.  Not enough Darth Maul. 9.  At the beginning, the two Jedis demonstrate that they can hold their breath for a long time.  A little later in the movie, when they go swimming, they pull out these handy-dandy 'breathalizers' for underwater breathing. I find it hard to believe the Jedi find it necessary to carry stuff like that around with them all the time if they have the ability to hold their breath so long. 10. Boss Nass does this stupid Jackie Gleason mimicry.  If he was in it as much as Jar Jar, he'd be even more annoying. 11. There's this 2-headed alien named Fode-Beed who's too 'contemporary American'.  Kind of like the genie in 'Aladdin', he just doesn't fit in because his persona is such a sign of the times. 12. In the other movies, Darth Vader appears to have an English accent (even after the helmet comes off) while in 'The Phantom Menace', young Anakin is obviously a Yankee. 13. Too much use of the word 'Yippee!' 14. People keep calling Anakin 'Ani'.  I kept waiting for him to start singing 'The sun'll come ooouuut tomorrow...' 15. In one scene, a battle droid uses binoculars.  If it's a robot, why not just make the binoculars built-in? 16. There was no set-up before the climatic space battle.  One minute, they're fighting on the planet, the next, they're fighting in space.  Even 'Empire' had a quick 30-second 'here's what we're gonna do' before the snow speeder battle.  In 'Phantom'  I didn't even know what they were trying to accomplish until they accomplished it. 17. The difference between people in alien costumes and computer animated aliens is too obvious.  When they're combined, they both look equally fake. 18. Yoda looks too different.  Why didn't they just use the same puppet? If he's 900 years old, I doubt he'd look so different between 30 years.  He looks phonier, too. 19. Certain characters were too cartoony.  Sure, they looked cool, but they looked more like they belonged in 'A Bug's Life' rather than a live action movie. 20. The whole movie was basically  one long toy/video game commercial with talented performers wasted at the mercy of special effects. 21. Anakin 'accidentally' blows up the Federation ship. 22. The whole Padme/Amidalla role reversal is confusing. 23. Anakin is an immaculate conception of the Force.  Oh, puh-leeze! 24. The notion that organic particles make up the Force cheapens the whole mysticism.  That's a 'Star Trek' move. 25. Qui-Gonn 'hangs on' after being impaled through the chest by a light saber.",4,0,1,4 June 1999
The Shining," Too bad Kubrick didn't do more horror.
","I am a huge Stephen King fan and am almost always disappointed with the films made from his novels.  'The Shining' is an extraordinary exception. Kubrick's interpretation and embellishment of the novel not only improve the tale, but make it what, in my opinion, is the scariest motion picture ever made.  Never before or since has a movie used general eerieness and fear of the unknown so stirringly (with the possible exception of the up and coming 'The Blair Witch Project' which I cannot wait to see).  'The Shining' has an escalating menace to it that begins even as the credits roll and doesn't let up until the screen fades to black at the end.  Danny's vision of the twin Grady girls in the hallway is undoubtedly one of the most chilling scenes ever filmed and Jack and Delbert's conversation in the Men's room is, to me, Kubrick's finest work as a director.  Truly haunting.",9,0,0,20 July 1999
