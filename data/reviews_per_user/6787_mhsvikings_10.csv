Raiders of the Lost Ark," If adventure has a name... it must be...
","This movie rocks!! Indiana Jones has to be a close second to James Bond as the #1 action hero ever. This movie has everything, and it's a shame they didn't make more than three. Hey Harrison, forget 'Sabrina' and 'What Lies Beneath' grab that whip and let's get crackin'! PRAY FOR INDY 4!",10,0,0,15 April 2001
The Others," This movie sucked
","I don't know what so many people saw in this movie, I thought it was very boring. There was not much going on, Nicole Kidman looked like she was simply going for a paycheck here. If you are looking for a real suspenseful movie, this isn't it. Save your money and rent something worthwhile. 1 out of 10.",1,2,7,20 November 2002
Alien," Fantastic
","This is one of the best movies of all time. You don't have to like Science Fiction or Horror and this movie will still get to you. The ensemble cast is excellent and the plot moves along perfectly. Ridley Scott has made a masterpiece of Science Fiction and Horror here, don't miss it. A must have for everyone's home video collection. 5 out of 5.",10,0,1,20 November 2002
The Godfather: Part II," A masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made
","I am completely amazed by this movie, it is about as perfect as a movie can be in my opinion. The acting is first rate, the story is compelling and the characters are unforgettable. This movie to me is better than 'The Godfather' and can stand alone as an individual feature. Also the music is some of the best in cinema history. All in all one of the cinematic landmarks in American history. I can't wait to see it on DVD!!! 11 out of 10 stars",Null,0,0,10 October 2001
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," A complete disgrace
","This movie is a complete disgrace, there is no reason at all that it should have ever been made. It's scary that this movie was rated a 10 by anyone. Every copy of this movie should be thrown into a furnace and destroyed. Completely sick, I wish it didn't exist. Less than a 0 of 10.",1,13,32,1 January 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Enjoyable Sci-Fi Sequel
","I am not a huge Matrix fan, I liked the first one and thought it was really good. I didn't think the first 'Matrix' was one of the best movies Sci-fi movies of all time, just really fun and enjoyable. I think the sequel 'Matrix Reloaded' is just as good. The beginning is a bit slow but once they get started it's action packed all the way. The effects are really good and there is a ton of fun martial arts action. I think if you are a 'Matrix' super-fan you may be a bit disappointed, but if you are a Sci-Fi/Action fan go see it, it's good. It also makes you want to see the final movie, 'Matrix Revolutions'. 8/10.",8,0,0,19 May 2003
Blade Runner," What are all you people looking at?
","This has got to be one of the the most overrated movies of all time. There are a few good scenes in this movie, but that is about it. The best part of this movie by far is Rutger Hauer but he doesn't have enough to do. Ridley Scott is an awesome director, but this story is not very good and there is precious little action. If you want to see good Ridley Scott rent 'Alien' or check out the best action movie from 1982 'The Wrath of Khan'. 1 out of 5.",1,16,54,20 November 2002
Signs," Left the theater very unsatisfied
","This movie had a chance to be really great, but unfortunately it wasn't. There were a few interesting plot twists similar to 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' but this time they rang hollow. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if aliens are taking over the damn planet, I want to see some damn aliens. This movie tries to be an update on 'The Night of the Living Dead' but unfortunately Mel Gibson is not good enough of an actor to pull it off and Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get enough to do. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one and rent the much, MUCH better 'Unbreakable'. 2 out of 5.",1,1,2,20 November 2002
X2: X-Men United," Ehhhhh.....
","X2 is a pretty disappointing comic book movie. I didn't really care for the first X-Men movie when I first saw it either, I was hoping for something more out of the comics so maybe this one will grow on me too. That being said, this movie looks like it was made in a hurry, like they didn't have enough time to make it. A lot of the plot lines are really quickly put together and are not explained hardly at all. Also, where are the main characters? You only see Cyclops for a total of about five minutes in the movie. He's the leader of the group! I think they have strayed too far away from the comics and this movie is off track not knowing where it wants to go. Hopefully they will just leave this franchise as is, or give it to someone else to try and push it in another direction. Also, the music for this movie is terrible. Where is Michael Kamen? He made great music for X-men 1, why the change? Bummer, hopefully The Hulk will be good and put comic movies back on track. 6/10",7,0,0,19 May 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Indy and Bond? How can you beat it?
","Sean Connery and Harrison Ford make one of the best adventure duos ever on film. This movie is a blast from when Indy gets his trademark scar on his face... all the way through. Also, the pirate at the beginning was great too, it was awesome to see who Indy patterned himself after a little bit. Bring on INDY 4, INDY 4...",10,1,1,15 April 2001
