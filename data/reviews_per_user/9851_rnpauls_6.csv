The Rock," Pretty good action movie
","I like the performances from Connery and Cage. The humorous parts are well done, if you like Cage. The bad guys have understandable motives, and the action scene in the hotel was very good",6,2,2,25 January 2020
In Bruges," Funny and serious at the same time
","The juxtaposition of comedy and tragedy is expertly done. Characters have excellent chemistry. Compelling story. A few 'no way that would actually happen' moments, but nothing too crazy.",9,1,2,25 January 2020
It Chapter Two," Stays as true to the novel as it can in such little time
","Hilarious script, the actors really nailed the delivery on all of the jokes.Not as scary as part one, more 'spooky'.I can see why they changed what they did, aside from the final battle nothing detracts from the story.I feel that a supercut of chapter one and two with the missing sideplots (basically every part involving the main characters' families was cut) would really do the story justice.",7,1,1,16 September 2019
The Wrestler," A professional wrestler comes to terms with his life in retirement
","Powerful, well written and acted. Not for the faint of heart. A great story of a man whose world has been uprooted.",8,0,0,19 January 2020
Marriage Story," A gripping film with flawless execution
","Torn between a 9 and a 10 here. Can't think of anything bad or 'wrong with' the movie, other than the character of the sister being over the top and unfunny (but that's just one scene). It's a brutal story with a lot of charm and emotion. Driver and Johansen are pretty good at what they do",9,5,7,30 December 2019
What We Do in the Shadows," Very funny
","A delightfully creative idea for a movie. And the plot is decent as well, not deep but you definitely come to care about the characters.",7,0,1,26 January 2020
