Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Fantastic action and special effects
","The action and special effects will leave you breathless.  The acting may be a little thin, but it does not affect the flow of the movie.  A great start to the new trilogy.  I cannot wait to see the movie many more times",10,0,0,20 May 1999
