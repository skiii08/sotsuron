First Man," Fly me to the moon
","What the movie does do is to give you the feeling of what it really felt like inside the space craft, where every hour was life-threatening and the outcome was always perilous. Director Damien Chazelle's emphasis on realism and Ryan Gosling's amazing performance fly us to the moon. It doesn't matter that we know how Armstrong's missions ended, you will still find yourself wondering if the crew survives. The cinematography gives you a taste of both confined spaces and the vastness of space in a very intimate way. It is a breathtaking character study that reminds us exactly why we still love to watch movies. And the truth is that 'First Man' is so amazing technically that it demands viewing on a big screen. nikisreviews.gr",8,0,1,21 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," No money but lot of honey
","This is a fine and tense low-budget thriller, skilfully directed by Dan Trachtenberg. A wonderful and welcome surprise, a visit to '10 Cloverfield Lane' is highly recommended. This claustrophobic movie keeps the viewer holding his breath for the whole running time, and it's also daring and stimulating. John Goodman, delivers a captivating performance and is responsible for most of the film's tension. If you've seen 'Cloverfield' you will love this follow-up. If you haven't, you will also love this follow-up, stand-alone thriller. There are unexpected twists, surprising turns, and you have no idea what is going to happen from scene-to-scene. What more do you want from a thriller?",8,1,3,31 March 2016
Child 44," Bad Russian accent
","This story goes back in time, in Stalin's Russia of 1945. The representation (clothes, scenery, feeling) of this era is great. Tom Rob Smith's bestseller from 2008 has been turned into a mainstream movie, with all the actors to speak English with heavy and bad Russian accent. Tom Hardy with his pretty face and muscular presence is good enough for the role of Leo, giving a solid performance, but the story in general is boring. There is no fascination and any interest in finding the killer. Actually I didn't understand what this movie wants to be. Is a thriller? A crime story? A romance? It's a little bit of everything, but unfortunately is not sufficient in any of all this.",6,5,9,14 October 2015
It," It is must to see!
","This new adaptation of Stephen King's monumental novel is one of the best that has been done in recent years based on some of his books, providing very charming characters and frightening sequences and capturing the unique qualities of King's storytelling. 'It' is a solid horror movie with great protagonists who achieve that perfect combination of vulnerability to evil and fascination for the unknown and is carefully directed by Andy Muschietti. Despite all the marketing focus on the homicidal circus freak, 'It' was never about the clown. It's about how trauma haunts a childhood and whether you're acquainted with the King novel or 90s movie, this new version will leave you breathless and probably sleepless, too.",8,3,5,1 October 2017
A Star Is Born," Great chemistry
","'A star is born' tells a story many of us already know. The movie it's a nice love story and Lady Gaga is good but Bradley Cooper is definitely the star of 'A star is born'. The film demonstrates that good stories never die. Bradley Cooper has borrowed from the 1976 Barbra Streisand version, its 1970's setting and the the rock 'n' roll feeling and it does it well. Despite its long history, Cooper manages to bring something authentic and new to this classic film story that feels fresh and vital. Undeniably, 'A Star is Born' shines due to the realistic chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. It's not a particularly great movie, but it's an enjoyable one, with so many amazing scenes that you will remember for a long time. nikisreviews.gr",8,4,8,7 October 2018
Captain Marvel," A strong female lead
","There's enough in this movie to keep both Marvel fans and newcomers engaged. 'Captain Marvel' brings a fresh air of energy to the Marvel universe and Brie Larson wins you over as she fits perfectly in this world of superheroes and also creating a strong female lead. Great visual effects and acting by Brie Larson make for an enjoyable watch that embraces a confident and smart woman character, make us believe that the future of Marvel is female. 'Captain Marvel' is a relatively good superhero blockbuster and the important thing is that it's not trying to be anything more than that. But we will still enjoy the message it sends and will inspire young girls to strive for the best versions of themselves. nikisreviews.gr",8,4,12,12 March 2019
Creed," A new generation of Rocky films
","'Creed' is a great accomplishment that works wonderfully as a part of Rocky Balboa's tale, and as the beginning of a new - I want to believe amazing - saga. Interesting storytelling, nostalgia and humor in a story we all know, and now is something more than a typical sports movie melodrama. It's not necessary to be a fan of the Rocky film's to enjoy this movie. Ryan Coogler does an excellent job as a director, especially in the boxing scenes. Sylvester Stallone, from his part,give us a wonderful, sensitive and memorable performance. Lately, Hollywood keeps bringing back sagas, but I think this time, it feels like the new generation of filmmakers can surpass the originals...",8,0,2,31 January 2016
Deadpool 2," Deadpool is back
","The film's greatest asset is Ryan Reynolds, who in 'Deadpool' finally found the role of his dreams. I prefer this Marvel movie that doesn't take itself seriously. But the truth is that the original 'Deadpool' was fresh and funny, from the opening credits to the parody of Marvel movie finales. This movie suffers the fate of so many sequels. We've seen its best ideas before.Fortunately it is an amusing movie that generates plenty of big laughs, even if the freshness of the characters and the concept are old news. It's not nearly as good as the first 'Deadpool', but it's definitely worth seeing and 100-percent a good movie. A sequel that will keep this franchise around a long time. We like that!",7,0,3,20 May 2018
The Hateful Eight," Tarantino's bloody entertainment
","Blood bath, guns, violence and bad people looking like video game characters. Yes, you are watching a Tarantino's film. 'The Hateful Eight' can be tough, but also it's very entertaining. The script is well-written, the film is well-directed, and while it is certainly not is weakest effort, it is also far from Tarantino's best. He is a master of these kinds of bloody scenes and if you are not a fan of his films, then probably you gonna hate and this one. The first half is nearly perfect, and the second half gets a little repetitive, but still far from being boring. In a few words, this movie is not for everybody but if you actually watch it, the scenes will stick with you for days because they are so... spectacularly exhausting in a entertaining way.",7,1,12,7 January 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," It's simply amazing!
","This is the Spiderman movie we've been waiting for. It's also the best Spiderman movie of the bunch. The film has the perfect mix of fun, action and poignant moments that, without being too deep, are able to generate strong empathy with the characters. With a refreshing adolescent vibe and great performances by Tom Holland and Michael Keaton, this is a very entertaining superhero movie. Finally, Marvel's cinematic take on Spidey is here and it doesn't disappoint! Given our justifiable fatigue with comic-book movies, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' fares better than we have any right to expect. Cool, fun and different from other versions. It's simply amazing.",8,1,5,29 August 2017
Suicide Squad," Wasted potential
","Beyond the interesting aesthetic, 'Suicide Squad' doesn't really have much going for it and is nothing more than a film dedicated to Batman and Superman's enemies in which they compare their abilities to see who's the best of all. Thanks to some interesting characters, this is a fun film to watch, but not as much fun as it should have been. It's actually disappointing to see all that potential wasted. But despite some major flaws, this film has good performances from Will Smith and Margot Robbie and a few solid action scenes. 'Suicide Squad' had the potential to be an awesome superhero summer blockbuster but unfortunately everything is so flat.",5,0,0,19 August 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Wonderful dark comedy
","A story of desperation and revenge as darkly funny as it is tragically bleak, 'Three Billboards' pushing characters far beyond their traditional archetypes. The movie is one of the angriest films in recent memory and a wonderful dark comedy. It has moments of hilarious comedy and sincere tenderness, along with acts of nearly unwatchable violence. Despite Martin McDonagh's magnificently rich story filled with complexities and twisting turns and the well written dialogues, it's the strength of the performances from Frances McDormand (whose expressive eyes show every thought and capture the depths of her pain), Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell that keeps 'Three Billboards' up. A great movie!",9,4,8,21 January 2018
Justice League," Mediocre super heroes
","Everyone involved in making 'Justice League,' and everyone who will eventually see it, deserved something better than this. This movie is a pointless and expensive CGI that even Gadot's Wonder Woman luminescent star power, can rescue. Given the generic state of the plot and how uninteresting the characters are, 'Justice League' wasn't worth the trouble. For me this movie is the most mediocre, boring and pointless A-list superhero film going back through the nearly 40 years of modern superhero films. The problem is that it had the potential to be great, epic and exciting but is one big incoherent and loud mess that, unfortunately, has failed to deliver an unforgettable cinematic experience that the fans have been waiting to see.",4,4,14,26 November 2017
The Revenant," Crude but beautiful
","'The Revenant' is an adventure for revenge that is violent and crude but also so beautiful. Iñarritu invites the audience to let themselves be shaken and taken on a journey for survival, in one of the most spectacularly and beautifully filmed movies of recent years, with a breathtaking cinematography and scenery. Leonardo DiCaprio giving us, once again, a great performance and every time I watch his movies, I understand why I am one of his fans since way before 'Titanic'. The jokes about him never getting an Oscar, I think will stop this February. This movie has a really powerful story and although a bit overlong, is nonetheless a stunning achievement, and one of 2015's best movies.",8,4,7,22 January 2016
The Conjuring 2," Clever enough to scare us
","'The Conjuring 2' is an excellent example of what more sequels should aspire to be. It is a perfectly executed haunting movie from James Wan that dives deep below the surface to explore themes of vision, belief and faith. The family drama is still right at the center and is quite effective, and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent to their roles. The film doesn't give anything new at the horror movie genre, but its set pieces are often impressive, even if sometimes rely a bit on jump scares. The truth is that 'The Conjuring 2' has enough suspense and story to have appeal for all kinds of horror fans and is a film clever enough to scare us. nikisreviews.com",7,73,125,9 June 2016
Jackie," Inspiring Jackie
","Natalie Portman is brilliant and perfect as the fragile, ferocious Jackie and she gives one of her best performances. it's one of the strongest historical dramas of the year about how a nation looked to a single person for how to react to the murder of its leader. 'Jackie' is a fascinating, solid, visually stunning and intelligent film, directed by Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larraín that have done a terrific job presenting a complex character, who struggled at times to be the person others wanted her to be. I believe viewers who were alive and witnessed it will find it inspiring and those who were not, will find it interesting.",8,2,5,26 January 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Epic
","'Avengers: Endgame' is a satisfying, expertly made sequel in the franchise and combines with 'Infinity War' to create the MCU's best, most compelling storytelling. I think that this movie raises the bar so high that there may well never be a superhero movie to match it as it stands out as one of the most detailed, satisfying conclusions to a chapter in a long-running franchise. All the necessary heroes get the right amount of screen time and there is a great blend of grief and humor. 'Avengers: Endgame' is a beautifully-constructed piece of popcorn cinema and anyone who has given their time to this world will find it to be a rewarding and effective payoff. The word epic is the right one for this movie. The end. nikisreviews.gr",9,2,7,4 May 2019
The Favourite," A charmingly quirky film
","Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are both brilliantly witty and Colman's performance is nothing less but sublime. The three leads are able to hold a fascinating performance that is difficult to achieve. Yorgos Lanthimos retains a pessimistic view of human nature but all goes down with a touch of British glam, as he pushes the idea of the capricious queen through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. With its brilliant and dramatic script, the sharp dialogues, the great performances, the wonderful production design contributions and a beautiful cinematography, may be for more open-minded audiences, but it's such a charmingly quirky film and is my front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar. nikisreviews.gr",9,80,144,2 February 2019
Foxcatcher," Great performance of Steve Carell
","To be honest when I start viewing this film I didn't like it. I found it very boring. But the performance of Steve Carell kept me imprisoned. Like someone held my hands and I couldn't press the paused button. If you are not interested about wrestling (like me) don't worry, this film is about it and is not about it. Especially is about human behavior about the thin line between good and bad, logic and craziness, pain and happiness. This is a true story and all true stories are powerful in way. I end up loving this film and think about it for days. This means for me that it is a good film, with an excellent cast and a great leading performance.",9,1,1,1 July 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Too much of everything
","Though surprisingly rich, the film's storyline remains incomplete. Feels more like several movies squished together. 'Avengers: Infinity War' isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be. A massive spectacle full of fun character moments and impressive action sequences. It is an entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions. Also it is too long, too dark and too confusing but the humor and all star cast helps you endure the overrunning length. On the whole, 'Infinity War' is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that puts all the good guys against the ultimate big bad for a better universe.",5,26,84,29 April 2018
Room," A room of hope
","This is a drama that holds from its two protagonist. Brie Larson is amazing and very much deserving of the Oscar this year, and Jacob Tremblay's performance as her son Jack, is stunning. Despite its grim subject matter about the complexity of the relationship between a mother and her child that being kept captive, 'Room' never wallows in darkness, but instead stares defiantly into the light and the hope. It is an emotionally powerful story and an honest film that is great through its simplicity. The script from Emma Donoghue is truly spectacular. Never again a fictional story could feel so much like a true story...",8,0,5,5 February 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Pirates of the boring
","Johnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic Jack Sparrow in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.' A cartoon like Depp and a boring plot sends this fifth 'Pirates' to the bottom. It has a few thrilling action sequences, but it's often loud and dumb and most unfortunately, lacks the wit and fun that made the first Pirates of the Caribbean so entertaining. Oscar winners Geoffrey Rush and Javier Bardem do their best but they can't save this ship from drawing. It's fine for a bit, but then you realize that you've seen all of these things before, and they aren't getting any fresher. If there was ever a point of time where this franchise would permanently end, now is the right moment.",4,62,112,25 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Apocalypse? Yes but...
","Following the 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', director Bryan Singer returns with 'X-MEN: APOCALYPSE'. It's not a bad movie but without the fun, the special effect and action of its predecessors. The too many characters are the film's main problem and I think this movie is made for the fans of the franchise. Unfortunately Bryan Singer proves that he no longer has any interesting X-Men stories to tell and maybe he must stop here. In few words, some of our favorite characters are wasted in this X-Men franchise. No surprises here, just a seen-it- before feeling. It is the weakest of Singer's recent trilogy, but not without its engaging moments.",5,8,20,19 May 2016
Midsommar," A good horror film
","'Midsommar' mostly takes place in Sweden, but at its core is a particularly American sense of horror film. It is a movie about suicide, mercy killings, insanity, graphic nudity, religious hysteria, and the kind of grotesque imagery that exists for no other reason than shock value. While doesn't hit the highs of Ari Aster's previous film, it is still a good one. 'Midsommar' is a dark horror (though shot in bright sunlight), full of disturbing images that will follow you home and possibly inhabit your nightmares. The film highlights all that there is to be afraid of in broad daylight and the director pushes the limits of the medium in almost every way, and the results are stunning. A must-see horror film.",8,1,7,23 August 2019
La La Land," La La Love
","To be honest I am not a musical fan, but tell that to my... tapping toes while watching the enchantment of 'La La Land', one of the year's best films. It is a clever movie full of color, brightness, rhythm and emotion. When it comes to talented filmmakers, there is no better example of one than Damien Chazelle. I was blown away in 2014 with 'Whiplash', and it shares so many similarities with 'La La Land'. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are the perfect pair to sing and play in 'La La Land'. Now that your chance to see this standout film is finally here, don't miss out because it's simply impossible not to completely fall in love with it.",9,4,8,23 December 2016
Snowden," Mainstream polish
","Director Oliver Stone, makes an interesting and a fascinating film despite feeling a little too safe at times. He takes the story and gives it a mainstream polish, bringing the issue home in a way that is understandable and urgent, even if his hero ends up seeming almost too good to be true. But it is a film that, in dramatic terms, doesn't quite work very well and it is for sure, not the big return of the famous director that many wanted. It is films like this that make me question whether or not I ended up loving it or hating it, but in general is a well-made movie that presents Snowden as a romantic and old fashioned hero.",7,0,4,3 November 2016
Don't Breathe," Very entertaining horror
","'Don't Breathe' is an amazing and very entertaining horror film. A home invasion story that is artfully terrifying, atmospheric and claustrophobic. There are enough surprises and scares to keep everyone uncomfortable, and that's a very good thing. The movie is a nerve- racking thriller that doesn't stop coming at you until its final gasps. The director shows with this film his capacity of keeping up the excitement and suspense. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of the seat biting your nails, this is the one. The truth is that 'Don't Breathe' gives a new breath to this season's horror movies and if you like the horror genre, this is for you. Oh, and... expect a sequel.",8,1,4,6 October 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Grace and beauty
","Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' is a re-telling of the studio's animated classic which refashions the classic characters from the tale for a contemporary audience, staying true to the original music while updating the score with several new songs. There's an emotional authenticity in director Bill Condon's live-action film that helps you rediscover Disney's beloved 1991 animated movie that is also performed with exquisite timing and grace by the outstanding cast. But the problem here, I think, is weirdly simple. This Beauty as well- designed, entertaining and romantic it is, it made me want to revisit the original.",7,7,24,16 March 2017
The Shape of Water," Deep and beautiful as the water of its title
","'The Shape of Water' is director Guillermo del Toro's finest film, a lovely, empathetic tribute to Old Hollywood, monster movies, outsiders and love that could only come from the mind of the visionary filmmaker and takes elements from 'Beauty and the Beast'. Del Toro creates a beautifully imagined world and characters, shot in blue and green hues, with touches of humour and social commentary. Sally Hawkins's performance is career-defining. With her eyes, mouth and physicality, she finds a level of emotional greatness. Her character Elisa may not speak, but you are never in doubt about what she is feeling. Like the water of its title, the film is deep, mysterious and beautiful. Definitely a must - see!",9,45,86,18 February 2018
The Disaster Artist," Funny and touching
","Funny and surprisingly touching, perfectly balances eccentricity, humor and respect, that works whether you've seen the source material or not. 'The Disaster Artist' is a sweet, emotionally engaging tribute to friendship, the movies and the importance of dreams. James Franco has not just made a really sharp, funny movie about movie making. With his brother Dave Franco brought the same creative energy to their project that motivated Tommy Wiseau in his own endeavor. The difference is, they have talent. The story of Greg Sestero and Tommy Wiseau is quite special, and I don't regret experiencing it through this excellent film, even if I still cannot believe this was a real movie made by a real person.",9,1,3,28 January 2018
American Made," Tom Cruise at his best!
","'American made'offers nothing new to stand out as anything other than an above-average blockbuster for the end of summer. But is an entertaining, funny and a thoroughly engaging movie, with tense action and wonderful use of music, if for nothing else, is worth seeing for Tom Cruise alone who is at his best. This film allows him to have some fun and is exactly the sort of film should spend the rest of his career making. The only problem is, American Made's Barry Seal was a real person. And real people aren't celluloid gods. Doug Liman makes an entertaining drama, part political satire, part conspiracy thriller, that is unfortunately forgettable.",6,3,8,7 September 2017
Burlesque," The first role of Cher since 1999.
","If you want to see a movie that brings out the mood and after the end leaves a strong desire to dance, then Burlesque, is the ideal choice.The beautiful girls, the costumes that leave no many in imagination, the nice choreographies, the uplifting music and the sexy atmosphere is unique characteristics of this musical, who certainly not bet at the script, which is irrelevant and banal, but at the debut of Christina Aguilera. Without being impressive and without being disappointing the famous singer, responds to a large extent at the demands of the role and of course a big help is her amazing voice. In contrast Cher is weak and is saved by the presence of Stanley Tucci, who even if repeats, always wins the spectators. The songs, while not affecting the aesthetics, they are all, irrelevant. Can for example the song lyrics, at «Nine» to be moderate, but by leaving the Cinema we humming 'Be Italian'. Here, unfortunately we have neither a memorable melody. Burlesque certainly not remembered for long -for men of course, quite the opposite will happen-but we had fun, although the whole show now seems somewhat obsolete.",5,1,3,13 February 2011
Joker," A captivating Joaquin Phoenix
","A dark, terrifying, brilliant, deeply disturbing and unforgettable movie with gorgeous visuals. The cinematography is bold and the performance from Joaquin Phoenix is truly captivating as Joker. I feel like Joaquin should get an Oscar nomination out of this, if not the win. The psychological journey of Arthur Fleck is interesting -especially for Criminology students- as Fleck's descent into madness and self-discovery as a villain is aggressive in its unpleasantness. The 'Hangover' director Todd Phillips won the challenge of making 'Joker' and it works not only because it's completely different to the average comic book movie, but also because it's an impeccably acted and directed drama. nikisreviews.gr",9,1,1,13 October 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," English charm
","This film adaptation of a popular novel may be a mouthful of a title, yet the film is made with heart and soul and its very entertaining. It is a sweet, well-shot and well-acted nostalgic post-war drama. Lily James does well as she can with her rather unlikely character, the supporting cast are solid and the script is good as well. Fans of old-fashioned romances need look no further. The thoroughly delightful cast, the handsome period design make also a good enough movie but the film is directed by Mike Newell, who made one of the greatest romantic movies, 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' so we expected even more. The result is a film that, while perfectly enjoyable with its English charm, becomes a nostalgic and superficial as the title suggests it is going to be.",8,30,39,5 August 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," Back to the old Hollywood
","'Hail Caesar!' it's a fun movie and also embraces old Hollywood. It's about putting in everything we know about Classic Hollywood in a single, hilarious film. It's not one of the best Coen brothers film, and is somewhat confusing, but funny. The Coens are just goofing around with this one well-made movie filled with amusingly stylized performances by famous actors that make that movie worth seeing. Despite how many problems I had with the film's inconsistent narrative, the directors still manage to make the overall experience quite entertaining. It's a different film from what we often see and worth our time.",7,1,3,18 February 2016
Finding Dory," Let's swim
","While not as visually dazzling as its predecessor, 'Finding Dory' is still colorful and it's got terrific performances from a strong voice cast. The script, while predictable, makes a truly touching film in its exploration of identity and family. It is entertaining and beautifully animated, with some amusing set-pieces that will thrill children and the truth is that Dory's story will not leave a dry eye in the cinema. It is another Pixar mega success, and maybe it's not as good as 'Finding Nemo' but is amazing for viewers of all ages. In few words it is a solid animation film, with impressive visuals, emotion and lots of excitement. nikisreviews.com",8,1,8,1 September 2016
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman is a wonder!
","'Wonder Woman' is a superhero movie that fulfills the heroic and mythic demands of that genre and also embraces issues of female power and the need to turn from hate to love, war to peace. It is a movie with a good romantic rapport by Gadot and Pine, a solid secondary cast and a dramatic idea contained in Allan Heinberg's script. Patty Jenkins rises above the pressure and brings a solid, interesting and humorous story to life. As Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot is perfect and ideal for this role. The only bad thing in this movie is that there are too many villains, none of them dramatically strong enough to be much of a threat, and the most interesting characters get killed off too soon. But in short, Wonder Woman is a wonder.",8,6,14,17 June 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Epic and loud
","I think it's the best comic book movie I have ever seen. It kept me entertained for two and a half hours, which is not nothing. Ben Affleck is great as the Batman (I pleasantly surprised by him) and Jesse Eisenberg is amazing as Lex. It is a classic battle between two heroes from the comics world. There are lots to process and think about, but overall 'Batman V Superman' is an excellent, epic movie and Zack Snyder didn't disappoint me. He made a loud, violent and fun film. Fans all over the world have waited a long time to see these two icons on the screen together, and 'Batman v Superman' is as big and also a treat for the eyes, as this momentous occasion deserves.",8,5,12,24 March 2016
Jojo Rabbit," A better world
","Taika Waititi's film (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar) is tender and cruel, bold, clever and surreal and keeps its ambitions under control. It is a satire about the Second World War. This is followed by a lonely boy from Germany whose views of the world around him change when he discovers that his mother hides a young girl of Jewish descent in their home. His fantastic friend on this journey of discovery is... Adolf Hitler.'Jojo Rabbit' ruthlessly and brutally mocks Hitler and the Nazis, but at the same time treats the issue with respect and seriousness while maintaining a difficult balance. It's a gamble as many could go wrong, yet the film is fun, instructive and accessible to the younger and strangely beautiful. A reminder that love can dominate even in the most difficult situations.As I watched it bring to mind Benini's masterpiece, 'La vita e bella' but it doesn't reach that level. However, Taika Waititi, with a fresh look, delivers a distinctive and well-intentioned film that keeps you alert until ... the next 'Thor' and basically features Griffin Davis and Tomasin McKenzie, two amazingly expressive young actors and Scarlett Johansson who never disappoints us - her nomination for an Academy Award also proves that. Sam Rokwell and Rebel Wilson give the comic touch to the film.At a time that racism is showing up strongly in many parts of the world, 'Jojo Rabbit' may be just the movie we need right now. We will laugh, we will be moved, we will not forget the past but we will certainly feel a little better for humanity.",9,1,3,28 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A rebirth in galactic entertainment.
","To be honest I am not the biggest fan of Star Wars films, but with 'The Force Awakens' J.J. Abrams made one the best movies of the year by building a respectful and entertaining film. Sci-fi adventure at its best, nostalgia, dazzling special effects and lots of good humor. And of course with J.J.Abrams, comes a load of money on the box office, because always his projects are a treat for eyes. This movie is a rebirth in exciting galactic entertainment and the most important, stays true to the original series, for the elders to remember, while updating it for a new generation who is ready to meet Star Wars. Definitely a must see film.",8,1,16,20 December 2015
Life," Horror in space
","'Life' is a horror film in space without great surprises, but very entertaining. The movie tells the story of the six-member crew of the International Space Station that is on the cutting edge of one of the most important discoveries in human history: the first evidence of extraterrestrial life on Mars. Those who have seen Alien will have a pretty good idea what's coming, at least to a point. The film has good digital effects, real suspense mix with horror, an interesting twist and also A-list stars. The truth is that 'Life' will not go down in history as the best film of the genre, but it's a B movie product with a good budget, which disguises itself well as a blockbuster.",6,2,6,21 April 2017
Green Book," Great performances
","It's a handsomely made and watchable picture and there is a real warmth in Ali and Mortensen's great performances. I am not sure if deserved a nomination for Best Film but it's two actors undoubtedly deserved it. The magic of screen chemistry is once again showcased as Ali and Mortensen bring out the best in each other and their respective characters. It is a film with a solid script and a must see this year. It has a warm, congenially progressive vibe and a wonderfully street line of humor. It is both a joyous and sorrowful film, capturing the sense of an unlikely friendship, and the sadness from watching the effects of deeply ingrained racism. 'Green Book' has a message that perhaps seems obvious, but is necessary taking into account the time in which we live. nikisreviews.gr",9,1,3,26 February 2019
Spectre," Entertaining James Bond
","For my limited experience with James Bond movies, I think, I got what I wanted from 'Spectre', which means, a lot of fun. The film opens with an unforgetting and amazing sequence, unfortunately, after that, the movie is not so good as I hope it will be - 'Skyfall' is still my favorite - but is an entertaining one. I don't really mind the extended flat periods and the clisse, because Daniel Craig, Lea Seydoux as a seductive Bond girl, and Christoph Waltz, who was born to play a Bond villain, are great. Overall, 'Spectre' doesn't add anything new to the franchise, and at the same time, doesn't keep the classic spy movie feeling. The choice is yours!",7,3,8,16 November 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Inspirational Mel
","This movie is the extraordinary true story of Desmond Doss who, in Okinawa during the bloodiest battle of WWII, saved 75 men without firing or carrying a gun. 'Hacksaw Ridge', the first movie my beloved Mel Gibson has directed in a decade, is as much patriotic, as you can get.When it comes to directing war films, Mel Gibson has proved himself as the best of the best over the years. From 'Braveheart' to 'Apocalypto', this man has created tons of entertainment for audiences to enjoy. This movie is a story you probably didn't know, and will be glad you did. The battle scenes in 'Hacksaw Ridge' are among the most violent captured on film. In general it is a good movie with solid acting, directing, and cinematography, heartwarming, inspirational, and engaging from start to finish. The story was motivating and I couldn't believe just how much of it was factual. I hope, but won't hold my breath that this gets the attention it deserves at the Oscars of 2017.",9,6,13,11 November 2016
Sully," Inspiring film
","Tom Hanks stars in this portrait of heroic airline pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, re-enacting his incredible successful emergency landing of an Airbus A320 full of passengers on the Hudson River. I love Clint Eastwood's direction and this movie is not an exception. He created a film that is vital, intense, thoughtful and emotional. Hanks does an admirable job of showing Sully's humiliating stress while his reputation was being challenged, with the first-rate support of a cast that includes Laura Linney as his wife, and Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn. 'Sully' it is an admiring recreation of the quietly powerful true story that happened in Hudson and an inspiring film that touches your heart.",9,2,4,9 September 2016
