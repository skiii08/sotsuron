Requiem for a Dream," the most incredible movie I've seen in a long time
","I love deep movies. I am one of those bleeding hearts that just sucks up the intensity and movement that can change your life and expand your mind in ways you didn't think were possible. Let me tell you, very few movies move--most attempts at depth are superficial and riddled with all sorts of holes and errors and don't seem accurate or helpful (like Star Wars for instance)Let me tell you, this movie moved me more than any movie has in a long time.We all have our dreams, and we all have the substitutes for those dreams that we go after thinking that somehow we are getting somewhere. These personal addictions, whatever they are, are the death of us. I have never seen a movie depict this as strongly as Requiem for a Dream. The brilliance of this movie is that it can happen to everyone, anyone, young or old, successful or not. It is a contemplation on the drive that human beings have but how most of us would rather choose the easy way than to fight for real change and a real better world. In a culture that is saturated with drugs, quick fixes, shortcuts, and get rich quick schemes there is no movie more relevant.This movie is disturbing and rightfully so. It is gruesome and it is sexual and it is full of drugs and horrible sequences. Everyone needs to watch it. Honestly it doesn't matter if you're offended by these things. We all need to face this type of tragedy. We all need to understand and really feel this message--how the world is continuing to rot from the inside out. We talk about so many problems in this world but rarely does a movie bring it us to the core. This movie should change lives. You will feel different after this movie.",10,0,1,5 April 2009
