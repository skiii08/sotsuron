The Monuments Men," Great story, but too slow
","At 118 minutes this could have, and should have, been pared down to 90 minutes. The editing was not the best in that there were too many spots where the story seemed to be mired in melancholy over itself. We get it - Great art was stolen and it is the foundation of modern society! I understand that the men charged with retrieving the priceless works were not full-on soldiers, but I am sure there was more drama that could have been explored instead of making an attempt at a 'statement piece.' I appreciate the story for its historical worthiness, but it was too slow and had far too many dead spots in it. If the goal was to make the story last the entire 118 minutes, then why not work more on the epilogue? 20 minutes of a recap on where a piece of art was rescued from and where it lives today would have been extremely informative and added more of a connection to the history of these events. Seeing artwork in a museum and understanding the rescue from destruction that took place in order for us to see it is something that makes the events more tangible and real for those who can only read about these events.",6,0,0,8 September 2014
