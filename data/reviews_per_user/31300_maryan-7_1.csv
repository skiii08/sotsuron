Marie Antoinette," waste of money to watch at a theater
","we went to watch this, really expecting some decent entertainment and fun. the music is chosen well but the story gets really boring as the movie lurks on and on and even if you have developed feelings of sympathy towards the main character, in the last 20 minutes of the movie you really just want to see the credits and get it over with.i have failed to make out a climax in this movie and i personally thought putting a pair of baby blue chuck Taylor's in the scene showing her shoe closet ( i don't really know why i would need an obvious connection to our wasteful lives in the year 2006) was a bit uncalled for.i'm sure there was a lot of great intentions involved in the making of this movie. and i can see that it's quite a task for a director... but whatever she was trying to do, Coppola failed miserably at entertaining me. as most of us know the story of Marie Antoinette makes for a great story, unfortunately the movie doesn't.",4,9,17,23 October 2006
