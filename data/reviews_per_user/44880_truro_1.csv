Mission: Impossible III," One of THE best summer blockbusters ever
","When I read/see really negative reviews of this film it just really hits home about what peoples' expectations are these days of films (in general) and 'summer blockbusters'in particular. Or are people honestly that bothered by Tom Cruise (the person - who ironically hardly any of us know)to just write off a fantastic (yes, fantastic!) action/thriller? Really - what difference does it make? Lets get one thing straight - this is a big summer blockbuster with all that that entails - and you either like that or you don't. If you do, MI3 will blow you away. This film is up there with Raiders and T2; once MI3 gets going it simply doesn't let go. The action sequences are astounding (but you really need to view this film with a decent sound set up). I agree - there are a couple of cheesy lines/scenes and not sure about Cruises' 'resurection' scene (!) but these are minor quibbles in a film with this much suspense and excitement. Ironically when I got home from seeing this the original MI was on television and it really showed you what a dry run that film was compared to this...positively lifeless by comparison. If you viewed this and honestly thought this was a bad 'summer blockbuster' then can I suggest you've just outgrown this kind of movie? Nothing wrong with that but if you haven't seen MI3 and you do like this kind of film make no mistake; MI3 kicks serious blockbuster ass.",9,1,3,8 May 2006
