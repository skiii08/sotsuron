Kill Bill: Vol. 2," somewhat disappointing...
","I didn't enjoy this film anywhere near as much as the first one, but I would consider it rude to not review it at least a little bit. It is essentially one big film, but this part of it can't help being seen as a somewhat anti-climatic second half of an England match against France that we were sure to win, as in somewhat of a disappointment. Still, it is fairly bloody, has some kick-ass fights and some even better dialogue, though is much less quotable than its predecessor. There are however long drawn out scenes that don't seem to have a great deal of significance, and could have easily been cut out to make one 3 hour long film (Matrix anyone?). Everyone says it is ruined by too much deep conversation, but I'd say it was the montage that did it for me.",Null,0,1,14 December 2004
Dawn of the Dead," loved every bloodsplattered second
","drool! such a good movie! grr, i don't want to give any of it away, but i can hardly keep myself from spurting all its zombie goodness. i am yet to see the original, so i don't know how good the remake is in comparison. but as far as i'm concerned it was bloody awesome.not your typical slow poking brain munching zombies, also not your typical american teens showing gratuitous amounts of flesh and making lots of sarcastic comments, which has been apparent in most of today's horror movies. and there was lots of gore. loads of it, and it was all fantastic! from crowbars to chainsaws, the lot! soundtrack kicked ass too. the characters were normal everyday folk, without being annoying stereotypes, and the comedy was present, but without being irritating pip and merry (lotr) style 'comic' relief.jodiejo likey, recommendy, and want to see the original-y",8,0,0,20 March 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," orgasm-inducing brilliance - one of my all time favourites
","Excuse me while I have multiple orgasms at the mere thought of this example of sheer stylistic genius. When I saw the trailer, I didn't think I'd like the film much - not sure why, it just looked boring, and the genre didn't really appeal to me at the time. I thought at the time that it was the particular film going experience (first date) was why I enjoyed the film so much in the cinema. That was until I saw it on DVD and was reunited with its greatness. Infinitely entertaining, it does not stop pleasuring the viewer in an almost sexual way. Kill Bill has blood, entrails and limbs spraying left right and centre, some of the best lines ever to grace my ears, an odd (yet strangely fitting) soundtrack, and even the costumes are cool! There is also a breathtakingly beautiful scene in a snowy garden, a disgusting suggestion of what happens to women in comas, and a cliffhanger ending that still makes me gasp every time I see it. Brimming with homages, but also plenty of originality makes this one of my all time favourites.",10,1,2,14 December 2004
