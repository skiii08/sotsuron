The Blair Witch Project," Don't Waste Your Money on This Trash
","Quite possibly the most overrated, over-hyped trash I've ever seen.People like to think it's good because it makes them feel intelligent and perceptive when they say 'You don't need to see anything for something to be scary.' They then go on about how anyone who doesn't like TBWD only likes 'excessive gore and over the top blood'.Something similar happened when the majority of people liked Inception, because it made them feel smart. When in actuality, 75% of those fans wouldn't be able to explain even basic concepts explored in the movie.The truth is, you can't make a movie where nothing happens, and claim it's good solely for the reason that nothing happened. There simply are no scary scenes, unless you are scared by voices in the woods and an old house. That's really what this movie boils down to.On top of that, the characters are incredibly unlikeable, resorting to self-sabotage, screaming, and fighting when they should have simply put their minds together.And finally, the ending is one of the worst endings in movie history, reminiscent of the much more recent 'The Devil Inside' where we see nothing, learn nothing, and basically the movie feels terribly unfinished.",Null,1,2,8 February 2012
