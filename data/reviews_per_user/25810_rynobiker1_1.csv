Walk the Line," Absolutely Incredible
","Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherpspoon gave the most amazingly convincing performances. While watching the movie I totally lost myself in the story and forgot I was even watching a movie. When the credits started rolling I was depressed that the movie was over.First, I would like to let everyone know that before I watched this movie I virtually knew nothing about Johhny Cash except that he was an old time country singer and he wore black a lot. This movie made me feel like I know Johnny myself. I have gained such a new respect for Johnny Cash....and June Carter.....I will just say that I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world but I think June Carter exemplifies everything that I look for in a woman. I know that's bad but...what can I say. I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that I am also in love with Reese Witherspoon. Maybe.Either way, their performance together makes you actually feel like you were in their lives. I would recommend watching this movie over and over again and let me tell you...JOHNNY CASH IS THE MAN!!",10,5,9,9 December 2005
