The New World," Where did they get this story?
","The actors were outstanding. The scenery was beautiful..the story, false and misleading. As history goes, they completely change it. It would have been much more enjoyable if they kept the story accurate. Pocahantos doesn't marry John Smith? She died in Virgina and in this story its England. I was disappointed. If you can overlook the falseness, you might enjoy it.All the actors played good characters, but the eastern band of Indians didn't live in tee pees nor did they use feathers in rituals. But most people don't know that anyway.The longer I watched this movie, the more I didn't like it.Luckily we rented this movie instead of paying a movie fee. If you have children that watch this, at least tell them it is not accurate.",5,0,3,1 June 2006
