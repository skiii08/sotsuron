The Equalizer," Outlook
","A lot like the Bourne Idendity's.It will have you on the edge of your seat, Denzel as always is captivating as an actor and it is a entertaining film for adults.Not too often I watch a movie that is believable enough to keep me intrigued and entertaining enough to keep my eyes on the TV.I gave it a 9 but its as close to as a 10 as you get. Great movieTheir is 1 fight scene in a club that is outrageous! Denzel really nails the role I would love to see the director and/or prodducers come out with another movie like this.Good movie Adults can enjoy",9,2,6,25 December 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Original, Funny, Action Packed.
","Let me start with, I have no prior experience or knowledge of the comics. This movie was the first time i have had ever even heard of Guardians of the Galaxy...However, the producers and writers did a great job of giving each character strong personalities and really developed each character well. You can relate to each character and you feel as if you are part of their team. The movie was funny, action packed and original. I do not give high rankings often, especially with today's movies, most of them are very similar and very Hollywood. This movie was quite original and i liked the style.",9,1,9,3 August 2014
