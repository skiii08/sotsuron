Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Dream
","I didn't enjoy watching this film. Darren Aronofskys direction is so horrific and tragic, and Ellen Burstyn's portrayal of Sara in particular is equally so. The film chronicles the lives of four addicts with shared experiences of addiction and RFAD captures that in its most brutal form, resulting in a film so inherently unwatchable it carries the most emotional resonance if only watched once.However, my previous comments regarding the horrific nature of the direction and acting performances are not criticisms at all. The direction is purposefully designed to be horrific and unsettling; these moments are captured with such brutal honesty and Sara's accelerated descent into insanity in particular is so uncomfortable to watch that this film can be considered to be one of the true masterpieces of the 21st Century, and it can also be considered to be Arenofsky's magnum opus. I cannot criticise this film in any way whatsoever, and I wouldn't even try to look for criticisms.",10,0,0,9 June 2020

","There is a lot that this film has going for it, and at first glance a 5 may seem a little harsh. Leonardo DiCaprio is as captivating as ever, and Baz Luhrmann has succeeded in producing an allusion to the 1920's that is undeniably aesthetically pleasing. However, this film warrants its low rating on two significant fronts.The first of these fronts is that this film could've been an aural as well as visual masterpiece, but Baz Luhrmann's one dimensional insistence on specific aural themes throughout his filmmaking led me into overlooking any subtlety this film could've have had throughout the plot. Any emotionally significant moment in the film is accompanied by the dulcet tones of Lana Del Rey, resulting in any subtleties that any deft filmmaker would have kept as just that becoming so blindingly obvious it begins to hurt.The second front is Tobey Maguire as a tortured soul. Maguire doesn't have to be so wooden, and indeed has proven in the past that he is an actor capable of starting in some emotionally resonant films. However, there is nothing emotionally resonant or even close to resembling tortured in this film. What could've offered us so much delivered so little.",5,1,1,9 June 2020
