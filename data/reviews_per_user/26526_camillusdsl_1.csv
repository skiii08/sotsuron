Changeling," Good solid movie.
","It would be hard to live up to the hype that has surrounded this film, but thanks to the excellent job done by Clint Eastwood as Director we get a solid movie that doesn't fall into the all-too-easy trap of being overly sentimental. Angelina Jolie delivers a refreshing performance which proves she does not need action or glamour to carry a starring role. It would be very easy for any woman playing such an emotional part to slip into hysterical over-acting but instead she delivers a beautifully understated study of a mother living through the worst nightmare any parent can imagine. Add a supporting cast of top-shelf talent, and a good period atmosphere, to what is an incredible true story and we get a must-see movie.",9,6,9,10 February 2009
