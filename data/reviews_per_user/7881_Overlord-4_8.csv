Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just another pointless show
","Oh wow, the trade federation has problems, now let me think, is there any reason to start a war with a worthless planet called Naboo (dumb name). I mean, the empire has better things to do like explore the galaxy and find something new to do. The emotional acting was so hopelessly implemented, and I don't know why there are no battleships, only these tine wenee little fighters. That space station was so big and fired so many lasers, I expected the rebellion to be rebelling against itself based on command, and it launched a countless amount of Droid Fighters, it launched and absoloute armada, and 1 little fighter manages to get thru, thats ridiculously impossible. All I saw was green and red lights flying around, my friends were amazed but I was thinking i've seen better, in future their are knights? the force is so stupid, they could have used the force till everyone was dead! but noooo. no big ships, real failure there, no big guns, no rocket launchers or laser machine gun, just puny little pistols, hopeless... i've seen old shows kick this movie, Alien was an absoloute hit, much better than Star Wars, First Contact was heaps good, anything could do better than Star Wars, even a child's imagination.",1,1,3,26 October 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Trek's much better
","I saw the Phantom Menace, it was good until I saw Star Trek first contact. It was the greatest sci-fi movie, or one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made! All my friends, even Star Wars freaks agree that Star Trek makes their movie graphics much better.What I hate about Phantom Menace is: 1) The entire movie only uses the same weapons, the lasers used from everything, the droids, fighters etc. The proton torpedoes which are only shot once or twice in each movie. 2) Only fighters are used, why can't they use starships. 3) There are only two Jedi Knights, they wear old rags in a futuristic movie, I'm positive they can think of something else. They use light sabres, in a futuristic movie, hand to hand weapons for war are not supposed to be used unless they are going to assasinate someone or that's the only thing left, they should use those blaster guns, more types of weapons would be better. 4) The music in the beggining makes me laugh, makes the movie less serious in the serious parts. 5) Absoloutely no story and no sitiuations. The story line is all explained in the beginning. No situations, like they should have something like a shockwave is going to come and blow us apart, meanwhile a droid fighter fleet is approaching, or their is a new race that is going to blast the empire and rebellion and they have to team up to destroy them and at the end they fight against each other. I'd like to thank IMDb for allowing me to have a chance to comment, and everyone who reads this comment.",1,0,2,3 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent!!!
","When I saw Star Wars, it was breathtaking, I loved the scenes about when Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan were fighting with droids and Darth Maul, I liked all the parts about Jar Jar Binks, he looks cute and he's really funny, Boss Vass is pretty funny when he shakes his head, Anakin is pretty cool, Darth Maul is the coolest and deadliest looking guy in the movie, he fights really well with his Light Sabre Staff, but most of all I liked the part about when the Gun-Gans were fighting the tanks and droids army.",1,0,1,27 June 1999
X-Men," Great movie, but too easy!
","Hi everyone. I reckon that X-Men was a real cool movie. I like all the characters and their special abilities. Especially Storm's. She's my favorite, I like the lighting strike she did at the train station when they were trying to find rogue. I liked Rogue and her special but, I did'nt like the way of the reaction of people she touched, festy. When Wolverine battled Mystique, that was mad! Well the last battle, I was thinking, is that it! What! Finished already! That cannot be the final battle! And boom, the movie finishes, and the good guys win without a scratch. Gee I was like, how easy was it for the good guys, more mutants, better abilities and stuff.Anyway I'd rate this movie 8.6 but since there is no 8.6, I voted 9. And a movie this rating is worth the watch. Enjoy!",8,0,0,27 July 2000
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Good but.....
","The movie was excellent, filled with traps and comedy. But I don't understand how those criminals stood the pain, they just didn't give up, how? Marv got a huge voltage shock and was ok after a little time, same with Harry. Anyway it was a funny movie.",9,0,1,17 October 1998
Tombstone," Nice movie!
","Tombstone was an excellent movie, although I missed an hour of it I didn't know what it was about or who were most of the characters. The movie was with lots of action and good music.",10,0,0,17 October 1998
The Matrix," Good Movie, but I expected more for one of the top 10!
","Sure, sure, sure, read all the other comments for the good part of the movie. I'll hit the bad point, guns were not that good, they disposed it easily, bullet smoke had stringy graphics, spiral. And the beginning is so boring, most of the action came in the last 25 minutes. One of the top 10 of the century, I think not. It does not deserve this position, sure the stunts were good, just look at the amout of fighting it had, 25 minutes? So much time was wasted on talking, Agent Smith got a lot of fighting, the big agent got 1 scene, should give more to these actors, and the other one, the thinnest of them got nothing to do!!!! Common!! That's rather slack to actors, and producers, millions of bucks for wearing glasses and no stunts. Good stuff was the stunts of Trininty and Neo, Trininty and the big agent were my favorite. Special effects of everything except bullet smoke was good, fighting was good, story was good. The whole movie was good except for the fact of the boredom viewers recieve for everything except for the last 25 mins of the show. I hope Matrix 2 turns out more action less talk.",8,0,0,24 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Am, this is a hopeless movie
","Am, this is a real hopeless movie. It's like this kiddish tale of this big bully takes the precious queen and the little man must guide his fate. Worst special effects yet I don't blame the time it was made in, the worst story, it could have told how the rebels and empire started, disagreement? politics? just couldn't get along with each other? Hopeless, the story is 2 minute essay in the beginning, in a galxy far, far away. Even when I was in year 4 I can think of better story than this hopeless show. I'd prefer other shows and movies like Star Trek or Babylon 5, Star Wars is so hopeless I like Lost In Space better.",1,5,37,26 October 2000
