Hereditary," Vacuous and Droll
","Watched this primarily because of Collette and Byrne, but I was disappointed in not only the meandering script, but their strained performances to make some sense out of it.I got the impression that these two fine actors must have realized at some point that they were in a dog of a movie and couldn't wait for shooting to end.I had to stop watching more than once out of boredom.",3,1,2,17 January 2019
