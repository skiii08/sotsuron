Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Lower your expectations. It helps!
","'We're all back together again!' Jerry Bruckheimer (Producer) tells the audience in a featurette. And it feels that the main purpose for this movie was some kind of reunion, because it was fun for them to make the first three.Gore Verbinski is not directing this anymore. And it shows. There is nothing particular memorable about this movie in style or direction. They kept the DOP from the previous movies and the movie is still beautifully shot. When I went to the cinema expecting nothing of the movie (because every story finished nicely at the end of the third movie) I was still entertained. Upon re-watching it, boredom struck. The movie's basic structure is like this: Here you have characters, they need to do these things, okay let's do these things, movie end. It's narratively speaking quite straight forward and therefore the movie doesn't feel pretentious or bloated. What does bother me is that the characters are so uninteresting and what happens during the movie is also quite uninteresting. The movie lost the grandeur of the previous entries.Hey Jerry! What did you say? 'Blackbeard is one of the most evil characters we have ever given you?' Nah, sorry to burst your bubble but the only positive thing about the Blackbeard character is that he is played by Ian McShane. McShane does everything to make the character interesting, because the script is lacking. Blackbeard is really boring and underdeveloped. The second and third movies had time to develop their villains, whereas this movie did not take it's time or tried to bother. Probably because this movie was meant to be the Johnny Depp Show! I'm not even going to mention the forced love-couple in this movie, because that was laughable. The Penelope Cruz character was a nice addition though and she was OK. Johnny himself was not that memorable. He was more on repeat of what he did in previous entries, but now he was the main focus of the movie. But, overall, the highlights of the movie were the Mermaid scene and Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. (he always looks like he's having fun with the character he plays) You can decide for yourself if that's worth your time to go see this movie. Lower your expectations. It helps!",6,1,1,31 May 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Dear Jerry, please don't make another one!
","'What we bring to the screen is great storytelling, with wonderful characters caught up in this magical fantastic world' - Jerry Bruckheimer (Producer) on this fifth installment.Sorry Jerry, NO! This movie did not have great storytelling, it had boring uninteresting characters (even the ones that were interesting in former installments were stale and washed up) and the world was anything but magical.If anything, this made me love the first three movies even more. (even the second and the third on what they were attempting to do with the epic scale and world-building storytelling)This movie was utter trash. This is coming from someone who tolerated the fourth movie (On Stranger Tides). On Stranger Tides was mediocre but it was sometimes enjoyable at least when you watched it the first time. This thing (if you can even call it a movie) was like staying too long at a dance party. The lights are already turned on, there is no music playing anymore and some really drunk people are still dancing but only because they had too much to drink. And you are in the middle of the room, looking around you and wonder: why didn't I leave sooner. This party isn't fun anymore.The main problem was the uninspiring story-line, it's contradicting script, boring characters,the cringe-worthy forced jokes were not funny and worst of all it's retconning and undermining of the lore from previous (much better) movies. Here's another quote from Jerry: 'Johnny Depp has created an iconic character. One of the best characters ever created in cinema.'Thanks Jerry. Depp indeed created an iconic character in the first movie (and kinda continued with that in the second and third movies) but his performance is best described as a washed-up former rock star with alcohol issues. You almost feel bad for Depp when you watch his performance in this movie.Dear Jerry, please don't make another one!",3,6,13,31 May 2017
Alien: Covenant," Meh....
","Meh, it was okay I guess. Prometheus was better and more consistent with it's story-line. Covenant threw the entire story-line set-up from that movie out of the window for the sake of a 20 minutes version of the first alien movie. Although the visuals were good, some of the characters were still nicely portrayed (I'm looking at you Danny McBride) but the script is out of focus and doesn't delve too deep in characters and development. So everything is kinda bland and boring. The movie also tries to be clever, but becomes highly predictable near the end.To sum it all up, you won't be completely bored when watching the movie but you won't be seeing something memorable either. Don't think about it too much afterwards. The movie get's dumber every time you logically think about it. -5,5/10-",6,1,5,31 May 2017
