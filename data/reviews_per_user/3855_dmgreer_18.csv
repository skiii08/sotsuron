Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," I hate vampire movies, but I loved this one
","One way I measure a film's success is by the feeling I have when I leave the theater. If my head is still in the framework of the movie after I leave, then I deem it to have been successful, at least on some level. After Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter it was still in my head during the drive to my friend's house, where we all met afterward and discussed it at some length, another sign of success.I usually hate vampires in movies because most of the time they're just a cheap plot prop appealing to narcissistic types. But in this movie they're a cheap plot prop to weave a tale purporting to explain everything about Abe Lincoln and the US Civil War. In some ways it reminded me of Dick, the movie about the Watergate Scandal where 'Deep Throat' turns out to be two teenage girls, and many of the veiled happenings of that scandal happen to have been caused by Betsy and Arlene, one way or another.To really appreciate Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter in that respect, it helps to know something about US history leading up to and during the Civil War. At the very least, you should look up Harriet Tubman, Jefferson Davis, and Gettysburg in Wikipedia before seeing the movie.Bekmembatov manages to pack a good deal of history, dialog, action, and story telling into this movie. The acting it mostly good, though Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance as Mary Todd Lincoln seemed uneven. Sometimes she was adequate, other times she was spitting her lines out too quickly, as do many pretty young women when playing this kind of historical role.The script veers between using fairly accurate language, to complete anachronism, like 'How'd that work out for ya?!' But you know, the story is about how Abe Lincoln was killing vampires, so yeah.On the other hand, the sets, costumes, and other artwork seemed historically accurate and some of the CGI provides a new look at that era. There's a scene of the Mississippi River at New Orleans full of paddle wheel riverboats that lingers with me.So in the end I turned out liking the vampire prop, and the bad-ass Lincoln as portrayed by Benjamin Walker.",9,9,14,24 June 2012
Happy Gilmore," Is This Supposed To Be A Comedy?
","It seems to follow some comedic formulas, but there's no humor in it. It plods along from one gimmick to another without any apparent connection. Oh look, Mr. Gilmore pulled that guy's shirt over his head and pushed him. Oh look, Mr. Gilmore is diving for his ball. Oh look, Mr. Gilmore is fighting with Bob Barker. Interesting, but hardly funny.There are even some comedic actors in this film, but they aren't funny either. Oh look, there's Joe Flaherty yelling 'Jackass!' and then going on about Red Lobster. And there's Ben Stiller's talent completely wasted - 'Man, that guy is strong.' The only redeeming feature of this film is how Mr. Gilmore addresses the ball from the tee. Still, it's interesting, but not funny. I probably won't watch the rest of this awful, boring movie.",1,4,16,13 May 2007
LÃ©on: The Professional," Love and redemption, sacrifice and forgiveness
","Mathilda's father is a drug dealer who beats her. Leon is nice to Mathilda, and honest. She decides to do him a favor, and this spares her life. When she returns with Leon's milk, she pleads with him to let her in. We don't see the door open, but we see the relief on Mathilda's face as it is bathed in the light from the opened door. So Mathilda's life was spared once because of her own act of kindness, and then again, because of Leon's act of kindness. So the whole movie goes, driven by love and redemption, sacrifice and forgiveness.This is one of the many Natalie Portman movies which shows what a bad director George Lucas is, as if we needed more examples.",10,0,1,26 February 2003
The Thing," Nonsensical monster, but movie is okay
","Multimorphic monsters from space! Bah! Space monster movie authors, please, think about what you're writing. Where does that thing get the energy to morph like that? Where does it get the food to bulk up so quickly? How come it has so many ways of eating humans, and yet it never devours them completely, or maybe it doesn't need to because it insinuates itself into the body, but then why does it keep popping out like that? Why does it have both tentacles and arms in the end, and one misshapen head in the end, but then some kind of dog body coming out of it's middle? How would something like that have lived on its home planet?Anyway, the best scene in the movie is near the end, where three guys are tied up on a bench and one of them starts morphing, then the others start yelling and trying to get away. And the overall theme of paranoia and mistrust keeps it interesting enough to be viewed about once every 10 years. I give it 4/10.",4,9,36,25 August 2002
The Shining," Not the first use of synthesizer
","Another comment said The Shining was the first movie in which a Moog synthesizer was used. Wrong! Look back nine years earlier to A Clockwork Orange. Electronic music for this movie also by Wendy Carlos, who, at the time was Walter Carlos. Don't know if this was the first either.Okay movie. Creepy, but not scary. Too drawn out, too artistic. Kubrick is my favorite director, but the story is dull.",Null,0,0,31 October 2002
Apocalypse Now," Brevity is the soul of...
","The shorter version is better. The French plantation is ridiculously, jarringly out of place, and the 'love' scene there is as gratuitous as something out of 'Pearl Harbor'. The extra Bunny scenes, the Slapstick Fighting scenes, none of these belong in this movie. Most of the added scenes have a lower artistic quality to them, like things just weren't clicking on the days they were shot.The original was completed in a hurry. For a movie with a magical quality like Apocalypse Now, maybe it was better not to have too much time to think about things. Maybe being under pressure helped them to capture a purer artistic vision.However, there were many clips added which did enhance the movie and were of high artistic quality. Even in some of the added parts which I didn't like, there were some mystically beautiful scenes. And it's true, the added parts filled out the characters, especially Captain Willard. The extra scenes of L.T. Kilgore were enjoyable.One thing that was taken out but should have been lift in - the air strike ending with Jimi Hendrix' Woodstock version of the national anthem. It tied in nicely with Kurtz' comment 'Drop the bomb, exterminate them all!' scrawled on one of his reports, and with some of Dennis Hopper's comments about The Man and His Children. A fiery ending is so much more satisfying in these circumstances.",10,0,0,30 August 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Too Hip For Its Own Good
","'Quentin Tarantino's Fourth Film', what an egomaniac. And it shows in this movie, where he's more concerned with showing us how cleverly he understands all the genres he loves to parody than he is with creating anything new and substantial. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this, having just seen it on TNT.There are some good parts here and there, like the fight with Vivica Fox. And you can't really hate a movie which lionizes the triumph of the human will over adverse circumstances. And the fight choreography is good, even though overall fight execution is only so-so.This is why I gave the movie a 4/10 instead of a 2/10. But for the most part this film sports a kind of self-conscious cheesiness I find unbearable and nearly unwatchable. And then there's that whole thing with O-Ren. I just don't find Lucy Liu believable either as a beautiful woman or as a bad-ass martial artist.",4,3,5,17 September 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Brilliant Movie, Better Book
","A Clockwork Orange is a story about the conflict between the individual and society. Alex represents the individual, our own individuality, completely self-centered, completely free, unfettered by socially constructed morality.But society wants us to work together, respect each other, live for each other's benefit. How much better society would run without the chaos of individuality, if humans were obedient worker ants. How much better if overweight people would stop eating, if smokers would quit smoking, if everyone would adopt healthy lifestyles so we could all have cheaper health insurance, for example.
***SPOILERS***In the end of the story, human individuality and human free will triumph over the strictures of society, so Alex's triumph is our triumph. Yet we are also, each of us a part of a society, and so Alex's triumph is also our defeat. Therefore our own triumph is also our own defeat, and that is why the end of the story seems conflicted.Of course, to make an effective story, Alex's behavior has to be extreme, to maximize the conflict we feel, to force us to think more deeply about the issues at hand, or maybe to force the idea of the importance of free will more deeply into our psyche.",10,0,0,3 March 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Postcards from Hogwarts
","I've read all the Harry Potter books with my daughter. They're best for ages 8 to 10. They're fun but not great. This movie is not as much fun. People who think it keeps to the book should re-read the book.There wasn't much buildup to the climactic scene. It just seemed to suddenly happen. In the book, Harry seemed to have earned the right to confront and defeat Voldemort, but in the movie, he just happens to end up in the right place at the right time, and with no particular effort, emerges victorious.This movie is like a postcard version of the book, but with less emotion than you can put into a postcard. As many others have said, it's passable if you've read the book, but only because you are then able to fill in the tension, emotion, and character development missing from the movie.Casting was okay. Radcliffe is adequate as Potter. Rupert Grint is better as Ron. Emma Watson's hair isn't right. Robbie Coltrane is superb as Hagrid. Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith - blah, blah, blah. John Hurt's excellence as Mr. Ollivander is much appreciated.I gave 'Harry Potter' a 6 out of 10.",6,0,1,11 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Ho...hum
","The acting is somewhat better this time around, but the direction is a little off at times, not as punchy as I would have liked. Sometimes I still have the feeling that there's a whole lot of exposition going on, setting things up for something to come later, but this feeling extends all the way through the end of the movie, which, by the way, I don't remember it being anything like that in the book. Speaking of which, if these movies weren't so slowly paced, maybe they could get more of the books into them!
Anyway, the movie is alright, but it isn't great, and in retrospect, I'm beginning to feel the same about the books.",7,0,0,18 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Just Okay, Not Great
","Like all the Star Wars movies, this one's okay, but definitely not great. Some critics said the movie was too serious, without the humor of the original. But I laughed out loud several times. Like when Padme says:'Oh Anakin! What will you do?!' Or when the twins are born. Padme looks to be 7 months pregnant, yet she gives birth to two, huge, 10 pound twins! Then there's the infamous Frankenstein's monster scene. Lucas meant for us to laugh at that, right? With the exception of the scenes in space, never a Star Wars strong point, the special effects are spectacular. I've always liked the mechanical devices and alien creatures of Star Wars, and this installment is the best yet for that. I hate to be so general, but there's really too much to talk about in this department, it's just a rich, rich film in this respect.It's too bad Lucas isn't really a good director. Natalie Portman is a great actress, but her talents are little used in this movie. Hayden Christensen just isn't up to the task of his character, so you have to supply your own reasons why he would do what he did. He tries so hard, but it just isn't in him.Ian McDiarmid's performance is superb. He must have had as little direction as anyone else, but he at least took his role to heart, and produced one of filmdom's great screen villains.But Yoda is by far the star of this film. For all the stiffness of most of the other actors, including Samuell L. Jackson, Yoda's performance is subtle, nuanced, rich, captivating.Jackson did do service in Windu's battle with Palpatine, however. His self-righteous anger and his willingness to kill Palpatine against the Jedi way contrasted well with Yoda's selfless determination to kill Palpatine later on.Yoda has some of the best scenes in the movie, too. Though I found many places to laugh at bad dialog, bad writing, etc., I still cheered when Yoda avoided the fate of his Jedi siblings by sensing when his guards were about to attack. And I also cheered when he slammed the two other guards against the wall. And I enjoyed Yoda's overall bad-assedness, even though sometimes it was funny to see it in such a tiny, round package.I was also happy with some of the politically 'liberal' references in movie. It pleases me to think that these might spoil enjoyment of the movie for radical right-wingers. Anyway, the movie is well worth seeing, even more than once, but it's still feels like movie that shows the potential of its story without actually fulfilling it, mainly because of poor direction, poor scripting, poor acting, and poor character development.",3,0,2,20 May 2005
Inception," Not dreamy enough
","Inception was okay, it was well produced and directed and kept my attention throughout, so that's why I give it a 7 instead of a 6.Having seen the trailer, I went into it expecting a mind bending movie with a dreamlike script, but instead it's basically a puzzle movie with lots of run-of-the-mill shoot-em-up action. You do leave the movie with a heightened sense of awareness, but not with a different viewpoint on the world.I never cared that much for any of the characters, which is unusual for me - I often end up crying or otherwise being involved, so in that respect Inception seemed rather shallow. I kept trying to generate care, waiting for the arc of the script to take me over into the next level, but that point in the script never came.Technically, the special effects are pretty good, though they're kind of a one trick pony, or maybe a two trick pony. I was expecting much more in this regard. Sure, when I'm in a dream it seems real to my mind, but there are usually some really strange aspects too, like people whose faces are unclear, or like trying to speak but not being able, or like changing geography, or really weird, crazy stuff. None of this kind of thing happens in Inception, except for the occasional alteration in gravity.The basic idea, of never being sure what's real or what's constructed in your mind, has been done before. There's nothing wrong with that, since it's impossible to come up with new ideas about the human condition. But Rod Serling wrote some more compelling 30 minute TV scripts on the subject many years ago.My review makes it sound like a bad movie, which it is not, it's good enough. I guess I'm just reacting to incredible hype of people who think it's the greatest movie ever made. It certainly does not deserve a 9.4 rating, which is what IMDb is giving it as of this writing.",7,8,15,18 July 2010
Blade Runner," Flawed by Casting Harrison Ford as Deckerd
","Harrison Ford is one of those actors whose emotions run the gamut from A to B. In a role that requires true depth of character, such as Deckerd in Blade Runner, he's way out of his league. I don't believe him as Rick Deckerd, I don't believe that his Deckerd is able to think deeply about his situation, I don't believe that he's capable of loving Rachel. He's just a damp washrag on screen, as he is in most of his roles.Rutger Hauer, on the other hand, never had a better role. His Roy Batty is thoughtful, playful, poetic, angry, loving, gentle, fierce, despondent, resigned, awed, and forgiving.Nevertheless, I love this film, for everything else in it besides Harrison Ford. Besides, Ford is SO bland he never gets in the way of my imagining what the acting would have been like if a good actor was playing Rick Deckerd.",9,0,1,3 January 2003
The Greatest Showman," A sweeping impression of an epic life
","The story telling in The Greatest Showman is terse and efficient, yet flashy and impressionistic. Days, months, years of effort are glossed over in a single transition, yet the style is satisfying, because we don't really need to see all the in between stuff, we only need to see the beginning and end, and we can fill in the rest.The editing dumps us straight into the musical style from the start, in a flash forward, whence we return closer to the beginning, to develop from the childhood characters of our protagonists. And right away there's more singing.There's really quite a lot of music, singing, and dancing in The Greatest Showman. The music is adequate, it's the kind of pop musical stuff you could write in your sleep. It's not memorable, but some of the rhythms are topnotch, and it's entertaining enough. It doesn't get in the way of the excellent and thoughtful lyrics.I love the dance choreography though, it's alternately playful and powerful, and it's enhanced with periodical special effects, such as dancers being suspended in mid air until the bass drop.Hugh Jackman is amazing to watch and listen to, and he brings huge confidence and joy to his performance. At 37, Michelle Williams is still delicate and pretty enough to play a young woman in her twenties, and the two children are charming and personable.Zendaya is super hot, and the slow motion meeting scene between her and Zac Efron reminds me of a meeting I once had with a young woman.Gayle Rankin as Queen Victoria didn't seem quite right, the queen was a bit more delicate at that age (you can find a sexy portrait of Queen Victoria online), but maybe they picked Rankin for her laugh. The rest of the supporting cast were without flaw, and returned performances that sometimes brought a tear to my eye.",8,2,5,26 December 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Best Movie Ever?
","I'm really not inclined to say 'best movie ever' about any film, so maybe I should wait until I have more time to digest this movie. But throughout this film I was overcome by the sheer craftsmanship of it. From the production, to the acting, to the directing, to the cinematography, to the casting, to the location scouting - and in how many more categories is this film excellent?Many, many times, it could have gone sappy, been overdone, been pretentious, been slipshod, but through even the most difficult scenes the quality was kept at the highest level.And the tension is excellenlty held and drawn out. Not having read the third book, I was amazed at how many truly tense and fearful moments there were in the movie, my teeth even started chattering a few times. But then, I've done some acting myself, and when I go to a movie, I strive to keep myself as far as possible from a cynical state of mind, and I focus on letting the actors on the screen affect me how they will. Speaking of that, I cried many times during this film, and would have cried more had I been alone.If not the best movie of all time, ROTK should at least win the Best Picture award, because that one goes the the producers, and the producers of LOTR deserve such an award for having the guts and the vision to do the whole thing in one shot, and to do it up right.",10,0,0,21 December 2003
A Night at the Roxbury," Many Laughs, Good Plot, Good Story Arc, Passable Acting
","I really don't understand the low rating of this movie. For me and the people I've watched it with, it was literally a laugh a minute.For the record, there is no underlying theme that the brothers are gay, some people just don't understand intense, nonsexual love between two men.Nor are Doug and Steve 'losers' as some people have said. They're just 'differently successful'. ;-)Nor is it the film's target audience 12 year old boys. It's fun for people who were of age during the 80s, and my nearly 16 year old daughter and her intellectual friends love it, though it's annoying to watch it with them because they've memorized all the lines.Some people have complained that the movie has no plot, but it does have a plot, and it even has an arc to the story line, actually multiple arcs to multiple story lines, which is why the end of the movie is so satisfying, because each of several conflicts is resolved in the last ten minutes.This is an excellent film, entertaining throughout. I gave it a 10.",10,21,36,18 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Irritating, self-important, dated, with some bright moments
","Listening to the sound of fingernails screeching on a chalkboard is soothing compared to watching this movie. From James Earl Jones' surprisingly flat and uninteresting Darth Vader to Carrie Fisher's sticky bun haired Princess Leia, the main actors in this movie deliver strictly second rate performances, except for Alec Guinness, who does his best with a script that seems to have been written by a 14 year old fantasy gamer.The special effects started a trend which has never been broken, of ignoring physics and engineering in favor of cheap thrills and easy effects so scriptwriters don't have to think about reality and can simply transfer scenes from westerns and other shoot-em ups into 'space'.The non-earthlings were the best part of this movie, creatively done, with the deservedly famous bar scene being the film's shining moment.",4,4,19,9 March 2001
Gladiator," Great F/X, mediocre movie
","Seeing the Colliseum in all its splendor is worth the price of admission all by itself, but there is little else memorable about Gladiator. The worst part is the hackneyed Hollywood sappy ending that leaves you feeling intellectually cheated. After Gladiator, I finally decided never to see another Hollywood blockbuster in the theater - why did it take me so long to learn that lesson? On an historical note, Commodus really did enjoy participating in the games, much to the embarrassment of the Roman upper class. He really was killed by a gladiator too, only, he was at home at the time and it was a wrestler named Narcissus who strangled him while the Praetorian Guard looked on.",7,0,0,12 March 2001
