Iron Man 3," hidden message
","This movie wasn't meant to follow the marvel universe storyline. It is hidden and riddled with in your face. A false mandarin is like telling you Osama Bin Ladin is not the true mastermind behind 911. The links to the mastermind points back to the white-house in the movie, so the movie is sorta telling you that. It also hints that you should research Wernher Von Braun and you will find his warnings to his assistant Carol Rosin about the false alien Invasion threat to be used as excuse to weaponize space. Let's face it, 9 out of 10 people are going to compare the Mandarin to Osama. By such simple correlation, you must be daft not to see that the movie is trying to tell you who the real 911 culprits are.",Null,0,1,30 May 2013
