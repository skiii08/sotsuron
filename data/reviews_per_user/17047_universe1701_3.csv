Blade Runner 2049," A worthy sequel.
","If your not a fan of the original, then your most likely not going to like this. That being said, I really liked this and was very faithful to the original. Its a long movie at 3 hours and the story is told at a slow pace, but is balanced by great visuals, sound and acting.",8,0,5,30 January 2018
2012," Not bad
","I found this to be Better than I expected. Special affects are really top notch and hold up even after so many years since its release.
Its a fun film just watching all the disasters taking place throughout the film, mesmerizing even, although it can be a little repetitive. Acting was convincing enough and I guess that all you really need for a film like this.
It can be a little silly at times, but its all part of the entertainment. You are not supposed to take it too seriously.
It can also be a little corny, but I found it refreshing. For the past 10 years, its been nothing but humanities worst aspects reflected on the big screen, TV shows and news. Its nice to see a little hope from time to time.",7,0,0,12 April 2020
Black Panther," Great addition to the MCU.
","A great addition to the MCU. Great acting, beautiful visuals and some intense action. First impressive thing I noticed was its rich attention to detail in world building and its characters. My only criticism, I would have like to have seen more of the Killmonger character, as I feel they didn't go far enough with him. Over-all, this is a fun and enjoyable movie with action, comedy, drama. There are some complex social political overtones mixed in, but it never feels heavy handed, and I feel that the over-all message is positive for humanity as a whole. If this type of movie isn't your cup of tea, fair enough, but if you are on the fence about watching due to pre-conceived notions about its content and message, I would recommend you give it a try, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.",8,114,239,18 February 2018
