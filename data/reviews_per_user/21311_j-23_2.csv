Blade Runner 2049," Too long for the content - 2 3/4 hours is self indulgent
","OK, nice sequel to the original, but a few disconnects in plot details. The original felt a little more street wise grittier - more film-noir in look and feel, not just high tech grimy. Too much stuff happening in desolate places - it's not StarWars. And the leads status bounces around too much for the plot line. But the take away is that the film is WAY too long for basically a single thread plot. 2 3/4 hours is too long and directorial self indulgent.",7,7,15,10 October 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," Half of a movie
","I walked out of Reloaded feeling mad about being manipulated -and not about the contents/plot 'cause any good flick SHOULD manipulate the viewer.  In this case, I feel that we are being strung out with a thin plot that really doesn't come to any tie-off, and just leaves us in the air. It's not even a cliff-hanger with building anticipation. Just a 'huh?'.I discounted reviews that I had heard or read where the comments inferred that this version didn't come up to the snaz of the original. That a tough nut to crack because the original was just that - original.  So I'm ready just to be entertained. Yeah, you're going to see lots of slow-mo action and bullet-time stuff, but that shouldn't be a surprise. And I'll even discount the 'deep' philosophical stuff. Just take it for movie plot that's not going to reveal the true reasons for life, the universe, and everything.This isn't a trilogy, it's a two part-er, and we haven't been given the complete second part -just wait and pay for closure.  Each part of a trilogy should have a distinct subplot, with its own beginning and end. Sure the second part would raise a lot of questions and would seem disjoint if the first part was not seen. But that should only be in the context of the entire ensemble. And the end of the second should give the sense of more to come. But there should be some questions from the first and second parts that are answered. Think of Lord of the Rings or (the original) Star Wars. Some major plot phase is completed and some geographical location is changed.  Yeah, in Reloaded plot is some what hanging at the end of the movie, but when you think of it, it's is more hanging in the middle.The ending and way too long credits to get to a teaser is the directors self gratification at our expense in time and money. I could see this starting a 'Bad trends in Industry' where only half a movie is shown.  'Make 'em pay twice to see one movie'. And why are WE subjected to who you paid to feed you on location (et. al.) just to get to a teaser?.Since this is only 1/2 of a movie, I believe that it only gets 5/10. It's all because of MY control.",5,0,0,24 May 2003
