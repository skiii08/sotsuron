The Lobster," If Aldous Huxley crossed Royal Tenenbaums w/ Clockwork Orange
","The whole time I was watching this, I could imagine the ghosts of Aldous Huxley and Charles Darwin were mocking me and laughing the whole time at the film itself.Granted as its like Tenenbaums, though with a much more morose yet dark humored narrative, I had to laugh at the entire situation myself as well.The movie was useful only in reminding me of the dangers of the mass conformity in terms of whats considered standard accepted behavior. In a dark way this quite literally mirrored not only the movies I mentioned in my title to an extant but, of course since I mentioned Aldous, the whole Brave New World angle. The movie was silly, way too long to not achieve what it set out to, and didn't teach me anything new. Be whom you are and let none tell you there's something missing in your life.",5,0,2,28 June 2016
A Star Is Born," A Chick Flick that sells Drama as redemption...*smfh *
","Like I couldnt already tell, but it was on hbo so I watched it. The singing was okay, but its basically just lady gaga. Big deal. Cooper wasa druggy and drunk, which is ironic because in hollywood, both the movie and music sides, getting messed up seems part of the status quo. Sam elliot made a few appearences as the older brother of coopers character, but the whole film was just dram drama drama. If the music wasnt there, this film would have nothing worthwhile. 5/10",5,2,2,9 June 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," One little movie , and suddenly people can forgive The Farce Awakens?!
","NO that weren't a typo, yall. FARCICAL!I am forced yet again to tell people the truth.The film was okay. Aside from a neat looking robot, that was kinda like the medical robot from return of the jedi in jabba's palace, without the mask, the movie was nothing new. BUT THATS WHAT Hollywood WANTS FOLKS!! They want to just keep rolling in the dough, undeservedly, and keep this dead weight ,revised mockery of a once great franchise going. The characters are practically the same as the force awakens people:There's a girl, and shes kinda the star, or is she, whatever shes mildly cute so nerds will gawk at her shallow, vaguely hidden lack of emotion. Then there's a guy whom is not one of the vastly numerous space brits traipsing about, and a slight tension between him and whats her face. Oh and then there's a robot. A ROBOT! Does nobody else see this?Tell me if it was in one of the books before Disney ruined the tales, but I don't think much of this was. Oh and the guy playing darth vader was shorter than he should have been, plus an imperial trooper fell without classic lucas films ltd trade marked bad guy death wail.Blind Asian staff master * coughs * Elektra *coughs* constantly chanting I am one with the force, the force is with me, as if the brainwashing was not so blatantly obvious. ' Come back to us star wars geeks, you're our only hope of revenue'. Fore SHADOWIING! lol says the studio pumping out these funny films. Its just so cheesy, and no macaroni. And it all began with Forest whitaker's metal plated afro wearing self. That took balls. DONE. Cant forgive it, the franchise is still garbage.

Passengers," Practically a movie about a rapey Stalker and the object of his Desire
","This was a terrible example of how modern romance tales have become about veiled manipulation and reluctant acceptance of forced circumstances.IF not for the decent effects and most of the basic sci fi elements being fairly scientific and plausible, this dumb wannabe romance flick would have been little more than a tense thriller about a guy going to any lengths to get laid. Which is pretty much was.People stuck on a space ship, and things go wrong. Ooooooo watch out Isaac Asimov, you are about to be outshone. Start rolling in your collective graves sci fi pioneers... =_=The main character is a guy whom has manipulated a woman into seeing him as not only the single object of her attention and affection, but with absolutely NO other choices for even emotional support the tale falls into the category of sociopathic, sexual predation drama. OHI BUT Wait, there's stars and its kinda romantic *spits*. This movie was like a space age version of Cloverfield Lane, except John Goodman's character was not trying to manipulate a female into making it with him. As far as we know.The Passengers predictability, coupled with cheaply placed star roles and the allusions to elitists plans to escape our dying world for another place to trash was a ceaseless thorn. Any other genre, and this movie would have been a sexual, racey thriller with deviant overtones. For those of you whom were paying attention, the stupidest thing was the fact that the main character was a full fledged engineer able to rig a device to put his preyed upon female companion back into stasis, yet he could not construct another console with the multitudes of spare parts he constantly stated were present aboard ship. He could have gone back into stasis too. He could have brushed up on so many fields of science and learned how to rig any number of tools to suit his needs. BUt there's a reason the actor playing him has the last name of Pratt( cue UK English speakers recognition of this word). Stream it if you must. If multitudes of people on sites like IMDb can only give most films a 7/10, the film is far worse than most are capable of recognizing.",6,2,9,27 December 2016
Zootopia," Allegorical fable to teach about avoiding discrimination. WITH BUNNIES!
","EXTRA EXTRA BLEEDING HEARTS will be ALL ABOUT IT!WHY?Enough of the hubbub bub, this movie was full of love; yet also daring, intrigue, humor and plenty of good old fashioned moral instruction about how to get along.After years of animated films pumped out by big companies that slyly insert adult references to sexual acts, use of substances that alter ones life, and the general milieu of what makes the world tick once 'paradise is lost' for us all after a certain age, the lesson is finally taught right, and in pretty good taste.I refer of course to the introduction of peace and harmonious coexistence between both predator...and prey. Unlike former works that now resonate in the cultural psyche to both entertain and 'learn our younguns some' ( yah thats rude to those from the Appalachians, I hope you all caught the intended irony lol) our story initially is set upon telling us of the natural divide that has always existed between hunter and hunted. Of course having the oh so familiar and almost trite example of a poor farm girl ( bunny) just DREAMING of the big city and the call of the...wild enthusiasm of life, its plain to see where the film was headed.HOWEVER...( I know, too many ellipsis and parentheses. I am eccentric, not trying to be a mean jerk =p) I was pleasantly surprised by the hidden jokes and puns, the running gags of obvious animal instead of human racial tension and assumed tendencies. Case in point, a wolf literally in faux sheep clothing or slow sloths being slow, just because they are sloths. There be meaning in them traits folks. Or even a cheetah being overly obsessed with a gazelle. Think about it and look at the fat police station call operator. Oh, but its just the big city, so its just the way of things. So nature is scapegoated here and there. But along hops a cute bunny, and then... BOOM! a put down by a sharp fanged alpha here and there or an oversized herbivore with too much muscle instead of fat ( my little guy syndrome would be off the charts if I was shorter).Onto Shakira as a pop idol . Perhaps most would not recognize her voice, but at the very least, for those whom recognize her iconic movements, the animal she voiced was quite graceful, even more than the average gazelle, which was in fact her character animal. MAGNETISM! Still little punchlines and a softer use of expressive acknowledgments of racial differences quite eased the tension at times when certain inferred American east coast vernacular and mannerisms were played out, over , and over again. Feeling eventually like an old detective noir sometimes, I cared less and less for the exaggerated implications and easily slid into the story about a wonderful, evolved animal kingdom. Though still present though, the writers could quickly erase the presence of the divides inherent almost to the point that the stories point would have been lost. But ironically, there it would be again, and I wasn't insulted or exasperated of the behalf on any one group. All so clever and in the end harmony was restored and the question of what the sparse predatory part of the city populace actually consumed went unanswered. It must have simply happened when nobody was looking. Was there a possible scenario of butchery where only the strong survive? Yes. Some animals went missing, but not because they became food, they just heard the call, in a way. But still no bloodshed. METAPH-ROAR!Luckily if animals, whether anthropomorphic or not, were good enough for all ancient peoples to use in their cautionary fables, then it is a good thing we have not lost touch with that art form. Otherwise things in a story like this would be inappropriate for sheepish children without that age old, wool pulled over the eyes, yarn spun tactic (HAH triple pun). But bravo Hollywood, fore twas an entertaining success!Just remember, all u human animals out there, there's nothing wrong with howling with the pack, just don't mock others for something that can affect anyone. 'Hakuna mata-' YAH RIGHT! I wont finish, so as not to be sued by the relentless, suited ambulance predator. Roar. CIAO ^~^",7,3,9,9 May 2016
Us," Actually not bad. Far better than get out was
","I am usually one of the first, if not THE original Lord of The Edge to point out things whether people want to hear them or not. And a lot of people didnt like this, yet it was so much better and slightly less predictable that Get Out was. That film was four out of ten, but this ' Us' film, well it was enjoyable enough that it was a 6/10 fer sure, and if I knew less about stories, film, and probability, as well as was less wise, I might give it a higher score based off of nothing but sheer ignorance of what might be coming. Thats the ironic thing about youth: their ignorance makes everything new and wondrous.
And so we have an example in this film which clearly, quite often, seems to be about MINDING YOUR DARN CHILDREN! Not only to keep them safe, but keep an eye upon them. Yet if the motvie of all of this was for some clandestine centuries old power or group to control people via unnatural or even natural cloning, where was said group? They just gave up? Quite a few things oculd have been done to add flavor to this, including not having so many random points of slapstick or off beat comedic attempts. Still, it was kinda my type of weirdd. I honestly thought it would go the route of ' when twins are bron its due to a parallel world/reality biting the dust at the moment of birth' or something like that. Oh well, still 6/10 Not bad and I bet the directors next film will be better. He can take constructive criticism, I hope. NEXT FILM OF HIS BETTER ROCK OUR SOCKS OFF! o>O lol",6,0,2,11 October 2019
About Time," A walk amongst the hourglasses, then repeat
","So then lets dive in for a quick one, shall we? A very ginger, lanky clone of martin freeman crossed with Ron from harry potter has a normal, Cornish bred lifestyle with a fairly upper middle/ low upper class family. His father is a seemingly powerful yet carefree man. His mother and sister...relegated in his eyes as simply...mother and sister. However, his love for them remains almost as strong as for his father. His want of his approval, his acceptance and guidance, fore what son couldn't say the same. Or how pleased when a son gets just what he wants. But in this case, what the son gets is a milestone of knowledge, a revelation of insight into a secret that leads to the very secret of life. Without so much as a grand fraternal initiation, a bomb is dropped upon the son, let loose by the father in the supposed joke...of time manipulation. What joys, what travels, what merry may haves and have nots, or maddening misfortunes naught had or not naught had occurred. Though from my standpoint there are many plot holes from a paradoxical minded persons point of view, many things unrealistic ( this movie in the whole, one of them) from a sci fi/ sci possiblists' experience with the genre of mind expanding, science bending ideas. Alas somehow, as if the director could bend the ether themselves, it turned out well. A pull on ones own imagination on what could or shouldn't have been done showed me that I was driven to continue the tale, that it worked to keep me watching, not with action or great mayhem, but simply with the most bizarrely calm , docile minded, understandable fellow mans point of view. And that was the point that was so miraculously well made! laughs had, a general lesson of enjoying the moment, for it is the only true constant and real test of time; no true past or future, just other nows either gone by or yet to let fly in our eye. But all in all, a wonderful film to watch indeed. Temprus Fugit...but only if you let it ^,= Pe@ce",7,0,1,19 February 2015
Ready Player One," We will have immersive entertainment beyond this in the future, but less boring.
","This has to be the worst spielberg film I have ever seen. Once I learned the dude directed this, and it was based on a book, I was suspicious as I have never read it, I would usually think I would not go fanboy over it. PLus once I see commercials for a movie or anything else, its almost guaranteed I can tell if it will be good or not. NOt whether I like it or not, whether it will be good or not. Thats just the curse of the immersive mess that is the preview sector for hollywood.
BUt this film just plain sucked. The acting was abysmal, being worse than C movies ( less than B movies, yes they exist) and nothing to really give anyone with even the slightest interest in the future, investigation into predictions made from all corners of the 'futurist' world, and nothing in the film wowed at all. This was just a waste of time, and younger folks, helk anyone that knows nothing about the subjects foretold long ago, would do better to simply read classic science fiction from the greats, and numerous anime from 20 years ago that already covered these subjects in player one much much better and thoroughly. *Smfh * Terrible film. Only worth a 3/10 since it was by spielburg. Shame.",4,0,2,1 March 2019
Suicide Squad," Seen the regular Version... But Extended is a whole no Film Experience!
","I think I made a review once before, and I may have also said this: but 11 minutes more , in the extended edition, is the difference between a low 6 and a solid 7. Just more action, fully character lines and development. And just more enjoyable. Even when I saw this in theatres, my friend and I swear it was cut down even more, to under 2 hours. But extended is the way to go. Still enjoyable, the characters are still fun, especially as an old school Dc fan, and those 11 minutes moved this film up a notch in my book. 7/10",7,2,2,13 June 2019
Suicide Squad," It was not quite at all like the comic, but totally Hollywood style
","So aside from having big willy smith in this film as deadshot, which would explain why he could not be bothered to be in independence day, jered leto portrays the joker , in what fans, since the first trailers were out lat year, have dubbed a travesty.Now in all fairness the joker is a hard character to do, and leto kinda sounded awesome playing him, and was okay to watch, for a modern, methed out gang banger version of the arch villain.Without Harley quinn occasionally being scantily clad, baring most of her two little petite cupcake cheeks, this would have been worse.Oh and captain boomerang is certainly not supposed to be the most buff one in the group, aside from killer croc, whom in actually replaced King shark as the lead meat head muscle tank in the actual comics. This was way outta hand and poorly replicated the attempts by the shadowy government liaison, Amanda Waller, to pull an M Knight Shamalayab. The premise should have sooner lead to something that made more sense, but of course Hollywood panders to the dumbest wannabe new age fan person or average jane and leaves a bad taste in ones mouth and the horror of time wasted in ones mind. Tickets now a days at your average theater cost 12.50 usd. That don't help none. So as my well read comic aficionado friends and my own self knew, this was not too good, but we gave it a shot. Don't expect Justice league to be any better, because DC or most comic companies that remain active, don't do things in ANY medium true justice any longer.

Notting Hill," More hugh grant garbage from the turn of the millennia
","The man was lucky to have some looks, because his acting was atrocious. its a drop of the hat with many people if they can even emote let alone have a personality, but the saying about it not being there for those with beauty only skin deep has almost always held true. This film was just nuts. YEs sometimes there was some decent comedy, like from the wonderful scallywag played by Rhys Ifans, but for some reason the buildings that the film revolved around t like the bookstore and the flat grants character lived in where the only blue colored ones. Was that to help people focus? This was too much like a cross between Youve Got Mail and whatever other julia roberts tripe shes made in the past. Though to be fair, erin brokovich was not half bad. Notting Hill was just one of those stereotypical crummy chick flicks. YEs it was a thing, it still is, get over it its a sub genre and highly apt description. 4.5/10",4,1,8,29 August 2019
Bird Box," No need to avert thy gaze...Buuut its not an Eye Opener
","But make no mistake, this is no piece o cake.
Tis a slice not so nice; not the worst acting, but an an endless wait.And the reward for waiting...NOt worth fir a 6/10.
Nowadays its rare to see something longer than an hour and half since the average * insert country of nationality here* can barely sit still for asit still contest, let alone keep interest in something they paid for themselves. Like a child with extreme ADHD. Yet as one that actually has ADHD, let me tell you this movie was not BAD, and I was paying attention, thus I saw nothing to truly dazzle, and predictability stalked the land like a great big, unseen, stalky thing.
Making anything good, especially a visual story like a film these days, is like the modern equivalent of the quest for the holy grail. What a wonderful aspiration to try and reach for something so grandiose, yet ones hopes are too often dashed in the tiresome, unfulfilling pursuit.
It was nice to see Sandra Bullock in something other than a crummy romcom after so many years. When suddenly she gets hard up for the sole dude that
is a little kind to her, and is too in shape, despite never seen exercising or having enough food to eat. IS this a Tyler Perry movie? Theres a demerit.
Where so many 'unseen danger lurking' or ' invisible end times scenario' movies have failed time and time again over the last 20 years in films, BIrd Box was better than the rest. Some films have based off of books, like Bird Box , some have not. Some are just about invisible electrical surges that any kid can arc to death and save the day... Spasiba comrade, yaaay >,;,<
A couple of rules to survive an impending doom scenario , at least from the hollywood point of view *ahem*:
Number One - Run/ Get a Gun
Number Two - Get out of plain view/ Just worry about You
Number Three - Get to Safety/ Have a Plan B
Number Four - Dont open the Door
Number Five - Have supplies
Number Six - No Kids or pregnant chicks
Number Seven - Loud noise = To you 'they're' headin'
Number Eight - Law Low and Stay Safe/ Get rid of those that aggravate
Number Nine - Drink water not wine/alcohol (I'm not hatin' I'm just sayin')
Number Ten - Only Friends and Kin ( Everybody else go 'way)
Yah I know that sounded corny as could be, but for all the merits that this movie had,these tropes seem to always be close to the unofficial rule set that scary movies and end game scenario sci fi always break in spades.
At least with Bird Box there was some nuance to a relative degree. Yet the time lapsing, back and forth, and poor choices of characters didnt help. And though likely a fair to realistic mirror to the historic and unfortunate stupidity of our species during a panicked crisis, where were the real types that just have plain common sense?! There was technically one, and for him a special rule:You Listen to John Mutha*#&@$%^ Malkovich when he speaks!The blind leading the blind, as the tired old saying goes, and in a movie about not looking, it really shows. Bird Box should have been named 'Land of the Blind', cause in it the 'one eyed man/people' really were king. The only survivors were crazies , aside from our pathetic protagonists. Yet even the main character, a woman that is a home body and knows not to go outside cause the world and people suck, she doesnt take her own time honored advice! WHAT?! Why the films that depend upon a single sensory organ, yet end up so easy to circumnavigate to safety? Why have these stories caught on? NO seeing in Bird Box. No noise in A Quiet Place ( though any creature with advanced hearing could have found those fools from the get go), and what almost amounted to 'No smelling the air' in The Happening, as if Death's bony behind had any flesh left to rot to forewarn of its coming.
IS there a message here? Are all the tales, regardless of the media used to bring them to us, trying to tell us to simply pay more attention? Cause this one seems to contradict that. Dont look at that touchscreen. Put down that device if its not about world affairs or an e book, or face timing with the family and friends you dont bother to see anymore. Make the effort to wake up, is I suppose the subtext in this, if one surpasses the tried christian notion of t judgement days almost thrown in our faces..
At least we had Malkovich for a while, cause none would need rules written in stone. Still rules for living are there. They are more 'What you'd call guidelines'... But i guess you would have to be a genius to simply survive and have a plan in what seemed like one of the richest places in the world, or at least the west coast of America ( name dropping about North of San Francisco, and Sausilito in California. Rich enough anyone should have a plan A through B at least). Another film that would go well with a drink, but if thats not your cup o tea...may dont give this... a LOOK-SEE. >,;,<",6,0,1,28 December 2018
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Better than the potter films, but merely a stepping stone
","I just saw the film in theater today, and it had many highs and a few notable lows.It was nice to see an expansion of the potterverse, especially into American waters ( bad pun considering the literal plot, I know :P), though at times I was exasperated with the acting.NOw in all fairness it IS very difficult to act when a person is supposed to be looking or addressing a being or creature that is made up entirely of CG elements. That being said, for the most part, the main actor ( redmayne, I think his name was) did a good job. Was he high during? Maybe. But more than anything the wizard character the actor portrayed was way too meek and soft spoken for a feature film. At times I could barely hear the main actor's words, even above his British accent. Too often he would mutter and it was so annoying and off putting that it kept sidelining the movie.But I get it, every generation tries to emulate an actor or actress or singer of the past with a new age incarnation of similar quality; this redmayne guy is like the modern Hugh Grant, whom was also an overly speechless, stuttering half wit in his early to middle years of stardom.The beasts . But it was during prohibition years, hence why I found the film lacking in any sort of lively color most of the time. It will help to revitalize the potter franchise to go hand in hand with the new books that shall no doubt be adapted to the screen, so as long as its not terribly predictable like certain franchise that have resurfaced after years of absence, I say bring it on. The film was good enough, and well deserving of a solid 6, or even a 6.5 out of 10 rating if such a thing can exist. PE@CE",6,1,4,22 December 2016
Avengers: Endgame," What a Long Strange Comic Strip Adaptation Its been
","There have been attempts for decades to emulate and transition the wonderous tales of comic books into visual, live action media. Many of the times, though iconic, things would end up too campy and unintentionally humorous, being as much a symbol of the first strides into film as examples of how NOT to do things.
But for a long time, Marvel was the underdog, even just 30 years ago, when it really was the powerhouse of the comics industry, with the best characters, and amazing adventures.
Even with the films of the late 90s and early 2000s, it was a while until the Iron Man film released in 2008, reviving Robert Downey Jr's career and giving him a much needed second shot in the spotlight of public attention. And it worked. Still the only dvd I have from any of the films ever made, and even with some other properties that did or didnt do nearly as well, there was at least the feeling that it would all lead up to that sweet, sweet juicy crossover to end all crossovers. In the realm of comic books themselves, the now classic crossing over of characters that literally existed in the same timelines and worlds, was still a big deal. Once this took place in film with he avengers movie, I just knew, upon seeing hints of Thanos, that something, someone would have to bring that world shattering, universe splitting dangerous presence to the playing field.
However, even if one compared all the stories and their film versions against the comic book counterparts, even when people say ' oh they are just kinda like the Ultimates versions of them' I was still not satisfied. Though I almost always enjoyed the characters for what they were and what the actors portraying them could bring to the MCU, there was always a longing for more. Even with a Thanos that was a bit too soft, and too talkative, and not as powerful as his comic counterpart ( the hulk too was nowhere near what the comic character could do), I still enjoyed the films.
Through it all, and the patience of these last 11+ years, Endgame finally rewarded fans with a gripping, and fairly emotional ride through one of Marvels most beloved and ground breaking stories. Plot holes and the occasional pandering and some bad writing mean little as this era closes, along with the aging final year of the '10s decade(2010s) and this great film. Though this has been my extended opinion
, I highly recommend any fan of the franchise of comics that loved other MCU film to see this one. Check it out before disney tries to sell all the films together in a $500 dollar blu ray collection set thats not even in 4K and makes the infinity gauntlet look lightweight.
I am pleased to see families and young folks going to see the things which shaped the perspectives of so many like myself all those years ago, and with the closing of the curtain on the majority of the MCU, but all of it, we pass the torch onto the next generation. May they too 'forge' ahead, and reach for the infinite.",8,2,5,29 April 2019
The Love Guru," People take Spiritualism Way too Seriously
","This was a clever and funny movie. Not only did it have the lovely Jessica Alba, but as a Mike Meyers movie, we were regaled with a hearty cast of well known performers and actors from all the place.
Learning alot about religions from throughout the world and history, and the spiritual paths that many people have chosen in life have given me an edge at the way one looks at life. And this movie gets it. Aside form the fact that it obviously pokes fun at how many people get grifted by televangelists and new age gurus the world over, it also tries to redeem the hearts of people to not lose sight of whatever might be most important to them. One does not need to follow the doctrine or life of another unless they want to risk losing themselves to obscurity and sorrow. But sometimes, because of how brainwashed and vapid modern people are, the point has to be gotten across with some quasi 'childish' or, dare I say, youthful humor. Hey look at the lil birdy humanity... thats right, smile for the camera and get over yourselves. Have a better one kiddies. And remember to laugh and live.",6,0,1,23 June 2019

Avengers: Infinity War," An Infinity Gauntlet...that lacked such endless Depth
","As a fan of comics my whole life, one must have long ago come to the understanding that adaptations fro mone form of media to another are never going to come close to capturing the nostalgia and true impact that came before.
 Though I have been pleased enough to see Marvel revitalized with the films of the last almost 20 years, to me, and no doubt countless die hard comic fans out there, the Marvel Cinematic Universe falls short of greatness, occupying a slot just below the somewhat lackluster Ultimate line of Marvel titles.
 A never impressive Hulk, a sickening to behold Thor, a HUGE lack of characters that are mainstays of Marvel comics, but have, like with the trend in comics themselves, been retconned out of films, the avengers series are okay at first, but lose value after rewatching but a few times.
Enter the most pathetic Thanos this side of a poorly written What IF issue.
( Dont get the reference? Well too bad, go read some old comics ya posers)
Thanos, voiced by Josh Brolin, sounded less booming and profoundly intimidating than the 'Mad Titan' should have. Also quickly doing away with Thanos' armor in lieu or undergarments that make it seem like he just came from the gym, brah, and way too much emphasis on Thanos being overly emotional, and not that bad a fella, I felt myself getting sick through some of the film.Alongside what seemed like a very rushed story, even for the first of a two parter, there should have been more meat to the bones of this film considering how few big league heroes were actually present. But it seems this was kinda glazed over with the multitude of second string characters introduced in the VERY recent Black Panther film ( and perhaps that was partially the intent upon its own release). 
Still the nostalgia was more palpable than all the other films combined, which was no doubt Disneys intention so as to best satiate the lust for that bygone era of comic sanctity that so many have longed for. Seeing a few of the avengers mish mashed, with different hair colors, or a bear, or lack thereof, almost added some much needed character depth, but was too obvious a ploy to be convincing of how hard times had lead to even harder ones. 
At least the jeers, tears, and reactions of people in the theater, comprised of many age groups, was sufficient enough to swing me toward a more moderate positive vote.
Infinity war had a decent amount of action, emotion, but still felt too forced.
So for nostalgias sake, I can give this no more than a 7/10. Enjoy, but Brolin will likely do better( not saying much) as Cable in the upcoming Deadpool 2...>,;,<",7,4,16,27 April 2018

Aside from the obvious twists and destinations the sequences in Quiet PLace took, there were one or two decent jump scares that were exhilerating enough to warrant at least a 5/10. Yet I swear I have seen a movie(s) too similar to this one before. C;est la vie. At least the majority of theaters didnt have fools gabbin during the flick.",3,1,1,29 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Turn away and hoist The Sails: Dead Plots Tell Poor Tales.
","Once I saw Bardem in a trailer, I knew it would be cheesier than Fondue. Most any movie can give itself away almost entirely with just a 30 second clip before release. And any veteran movie goer can gauge a stinker ahead of time. But family movie day is not to be sacrificed to personal enjoyment, so the show went on. The acting of Bardem, trying to be a scary undead ethereal pirate hunter was about as scary as Time Curry in It. I wasn't amused.The Pirates 'del Caribbe' franchise has been milking the public for almost 15 years, and there is so little to inspire since the 3rd movie ,which is where it all should have ended, that I have to take a spit upon the direction the last two films have gone.Not only are pirates one of the top lucrative old world professions that people of all ages gush over ( including ninjas and gunslingers) but with a huge library of myths to call upon encompassing magical curses, enchantments and blessing endowed by the gods themselves, I wonder why more wasn't done..There's so much tip toeing about the effect that ancient beings of power had upon the world of men, especially on the high seas, that there should be no lack of possibilities to throw in peoples faces, without seeming repetitive. Nothing in film has so failed to bring it after dangling a carrot of supernatural goodness in front of me as the Caribbean film series.Oh yes heres Depp as a drunk Jack Sparrow again, very familiar but either the man was actually drinking on set, or he really thought slurring all his words for the first hour would be enjoyable to people. He was difficult to understand and likely was actually imbibing alcohol in between scenes. Its no method anymore, this is the 5th film, its clichéd. Then there's Bardems portrayal of an endlessly suffering burning pitch of rage and smoke that was nauseating to witness. Adding his already heavy accent, his character had a mouth full of nonstop dripping black ectoplasm that made listening to him nigh impossible. Like baseball player with a chew addiction on roids with no outlet. The premise is so unoriginal by this point with two young people looking for treasure, but this time the gals gotta be the rare bookworm type, yet without glasses, antisocial tendencies and skittishness that a woman like that would have had in olden days. And the son of Turner, yet another example of someone, paired with the female lead, that have daddy issues. This franchise could have concluded years ago with the trilogy, skipping the trash that was the 4th film entirely. Even for a movie as long as it was, to fit everything into it, it was hard to take a breather and absorb things due to the speed at which things flew by. Either events were too predictable or immature in their humor without depth, or there was some familiar element from previous films to fool people into thinking the plot was thickening instead of burning itself out. With all the veiled hints at magic ties to ancient pantheons and promises of godly interventions or battles, I was far too disappointed with this movie to give it anything more than an average 5 out of 10 .",6,4,6,23 June 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," I will try to both be fair , and enlighten.
","I have seen all the films across all of the marvel franchises, grew up, collect,and still read and monitor the happenings within the realms of comics. Therefore like many, I am sure, this movie made me mad.IN THE BEGINNING (according to the comics): Egypt in En Saba Nur's time was larger than the trifling little epicenter he lorded over. Nur should have had the ability to change his own molecular structure to augment his bodies visage, outdoing mystique by almost literally becoming another person. Nur could also grow armaments out of his body and shoot energy beams. Oh and his molecular control gave him longevity... yet Nurs jumping of bodies in the film did not need to happen for quite some time after his rise to power. According to this film in 3600 B.C. Nur was not only already decrepit, but there were other mutants around him too! One that had the bestial tendencies of Wolverines type of mutants, there was also some sort of molecular disruptive/ energy projector mutant that could burn the flesh from bone, as well as a weak psychic of some sort. This is far from canon.WHEN SUDDENLY TREACHERY OCCURS! Nur is betrayed and locked within his own literal crumbling edifice, not for centuries, but thousands of years!? In the comics Nur would only sleep for a few years to a handful of centuries at most before emerging to alter mans destiny; rising in various parts of the world as a godlike figure, leading to the ancient myths of world history and its gods. Over time he did in fact nurture the growth of evolution toward the modern mutant, whilst also somewhat being steward to the earth, as were his sworn duties. Whom swore him to this? The Celestials indirectly, then directly ( I know, the comics have certainly been silly too over the ages). Yet this could have been done, but for slow witted and dull Hollywood. So there's a crap ton of normies at the Xavier institute, Scott Summers is for some reason the younger brother of Alex, whom since the first film already had his own abilities manifested, and was living with Scott, all happy go lucky. THIS. IS NOT. CANON DAG NAB IT!!! Magneto has another family by now : a daughter, specifically, whom has power and looks like Wanda ( the scarlet witch) whom DIES from an arrow....YET THE CHARACTER IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE AVENGERS/ Cap America civil war film! Oh but since the girl had a different name, the power to affect anything does not count to the studio execs I suppose...but it should have clearly been her. Promiscuous Magneto, always letting people die for your chivalry to emerge...Hollywood * shakes FIST* Then there is Pietro ( Quicksilver), one of Mag's his other children, Storm is already beyond her formative teen years, though a thief in Cairo, which she was in the books, so they got that right.. Psylocke is already Asian, not British (this did not happen in the comics till the early 90's, even though this films is in the 1980's... =_=). Hank( the Beast) somehow keeps his mutation at bay with pills, which by the 80's should have been full blown FURBALLERY already, Angel is apparently a pit fighter whom could knock out the Blob, whom is 3 times smaller than he should be and 3 times less invulnerable or strong. So more nonsensical tom foolery. IN THE END: The comic industry in general has bled me dry, not only over the years through comics, but its disappointing adaptations.On the bright side this film was by far the best of the three of these ' back to the future: future past; there and back again' Marty MC Fudged-ups. Not saying a whole lot though. Thus this gets a 6/10 at best as it was not as terrible as future past.Apocalypse was NEVER imposing, impressive or even intelligent enough to know what technology looked like, even though he used it to swap bodies! He never grew physically outside of a psychic fight with Xavier, and his control of molecules felt tried and uninspired. That this movie is almost as bad as Xmen 3,which was alluded to within THIS very same film, seems only obvious to a person that would judge this trash less than 6.5/10 at best( don't prove Apocalypse's theories of dust to dust right, you sheeple out there).After the credits, a saving grace I have been wishing for, more than a decade now:ESSEX...the name of the man behind the plan for mutant kind, once pawn and future threat to his master Apocalypse himself:MR. SINISTER!Considering how close to the source material Dead Pool, some parts of the first Avengers film and I guess some fragments of Civil War were, the X-Men movies may yet succeed in finally getting it right in a few more years. >,;,<",6,1,4,9 September 2016
Ex Machina," More Hollywood attempts to confuse the shallow masses
","Anyone in the know that has even in the slightest done research on emergent tech for the last couple years knows full well the roads we are heading down. Especially with the tech crawl being just a small part of the overall nonsense and danger of it all.Consumerism has most gassed up for whats branded as hot and new. Yet its all only slightly different from the previous model, and this kind of vapid demand for junk is exactly what was foretold decades before our modern times that leads to the advent of artificial intelligence and general bad time for us fleshies to say the least. Whether a fan of Asimovs's writings or an true fan of The Matrix, the threat of over developed technology that appears too quickly on the scene for us to control it is not only an old, played out concept, but one that is all too realistic. Even recently with vaunted know it alls like Steve Hawking denouncing the speed with which things are progressing, movies like Ex Machina keep coming out and failing to do true justice to convey the threat of advanced a.i. to most people.The movie was too focused upon developing sympathy for the artificial girl made by a wealthy ground breaker whom was just too seemingly morally reprehensible and lousy with booze. SORRY. SPOILER alert... Its been done across various genres numerous times over the decades, in a few fashions, even like this in comics and books. But its time to stop championing and glorifying the ghost in the machine with all the humanizing aspects Hollywood gives them and come back to reality. Stay away from garbage like this. Learn about it all from the late greats and do yourself a favor, film makers have more than enough cash from most of us after all these years.The movie could have been done with a simply viral short video to get the point across: If we are to survive, we need useful, sustainable, innovative and safe technology for all, not facsimiles that are pretexts to little more than stepford drones.Ban the bot =p .",5,2,7,7 January 2016
A Bug's Life," The alternative to Antz
","What we have here was a nice little film that took more of the reality and harshness of the Antz film and mix it with more vibrant color, humor children can understand, and a tale about bullies ala Seven Samurai. The last thing I said was in ode to the fact that an ant hires a small band of outsiders to help with a raiding band of tough insects hellbent upon ruling over the poor poor ants ( even though there's millions of them). But this is all lost on children. all that would get through is the bullying and the colorfullness. Thats it. 5.5/10 is generous at best. Im not saying it was abad movie...but I liked Antz better lol. CIAO!",6,0,0,27 February 2015
La La Land," OKay At Times
","And thats being fairly generous.
I like singing and dancing, and prancing and bouncing off the walls and other moving objects like any other sensible nutjob. But this movie was a bit torturous.
I wonder if it would have worked to slingshot the careers of these two actors 20 years back, though whats his face was already a well known actor, but was still transitioning from that weird moody phase of his ( was he dark haired back then or always blonde? Do I care?).
The film was enjoyable for some really good music and the ideas of people just having to put up or shut up and do what needs to be done was real talk. Growing up can be hard, everyones gotta do it though. Yet for the two characters to just rub each other the wrong way so often and the needless drama...I really have to wonder if thats because producers thought ' this is just what chicks dig' or I dont know what other reason for it all. Yes, Emma Stone has grown up well and is very funny, interesting and pretty. So along with the cool sequences that are dream like a little, the film was not a total loss.That ending though... 6/10",6,0,0,19 May 2020
Don't Breathe," As Close to A Home Invasion You Want to Get; Stupid Humanity
","From the things we ourselves do to others, and the same mess done unto us by other suckers; WE are a sorry species on any given day. So many people have only experienced things through the safety of a computer or TV screen and cannot even come close to knowing what true fear and anticipation in the heat of the moment is like. AS for me? I can tell you this film was as close to real as Hollywood is capable of.How-EVEEEEEER...that is still not saying much for a movie that almost pushed the envelope, but decided not to slap a stamp on it. We are talking about a time when other movies, like human centipede, became a trilogy ffs and people ate that crud up. Stephen Lang is usually not too shabby when he works on a project, but he is just one man; impressive at times, but he and so much of the rest of this film fell short of greatness often. It could have been better, had the sequence not taken a cheap initial thrill at inception. It captivated me at points, so palpable that I thought I was in for a very rare treat. After all a tale must be enveloping, and especially fiction must be more believable than the truth. Yet Don't Breathe was almost a true tale of desperation and loss. It should have been braver, and though not always predictable, it ruined itself from the get go, when all it had to do was stamp, seal and USPS TRACK the bloody envelope with more than a ten dollar gift card inside for XMAS.If you don't really care, and just want another film under your belt, you could do far worse than this film. Rent it cheap or however you wish, if you wish to check it out.And save the ten bucks for a better film.",6,3,8,26 December 2016
The Shape of Water," Not your Average Creature from the black Lag - Hellboy Prequel...
","SO yah, some people literally thought this would be a prequel to the hellboy series, focusing mainly on his sidekick Abe Sapien, as the similarities in biology, features and life in captivity between the two 'merfolk'. 
But its not, and Del Toro never said it was...but lets be honest, its a movie by him with a creature almost the same. HE knew what he was doing.
As if the paltry acting of the main actress was anywhere near Helen Keller-ish, it was more agonizing to see sign language when most people can barely 'say' their name using the silent skill. And yes, the gal has sex with the creature. She was so hard up, I was almost relieved she didnt try to lure the neighbors cats into some nefarious and unseemly situation. But it was pathetic non the less.
But people are guilted into sympathy because of the state of the main characters, all of whom have problems folks can relate to. And most people have way bigger problems than those within this film. The main antagonist , however, had my sympathies more than anyone else in this. He was not a terribly bad person, but his path as a soldier had molded him into... a soldier, believing he is always doing his duty, but trying to learn how to be positive. The film shows us that he could change given the chance, but then a fish creature ups and chews off his fingers. NO true sign of higher intelligence, and its not human. Cthulhu responsible? Perhaps, but I would have much preferred a film about lovecraftian eldritch gods than this. I think most would agree.
But somebody just HAS to win an oscar...every single year, no matter what, so whom cares, right? Just give directors and everyone else in Hollywood a more inflated ego over nonsense. 
If you like that Del Toro esque feel in a movie and dont mind garbage, watch this. Otherwise you could spend your time better on a deep documentary or film about real existential crisis' or issues more important to our current age. Or a real comedy thats enjoyable and worth remembering.",3,3,8,18 March 2018
It Chapter Two," NOt as good as the first of the NEw Revisions
","The remake of IT was looked forward to for a good two years at least. ANd upon seeing it, I was most glad. IT was scary, fun, and dark and adventurous. It also cam out at a time when the 1980s vibes had sickeningly reemerged for the 2010 decade like a bad joke. BUt it was a solid 8 outta 10.
The originals were not scary, at least not to me. ANd I saw them on TV and vhs when I was not even 8 years old. Some people are just tougher I suppose. BUt I always loved the work of TIm Curry, and he should have at least had a cameo in one of the remake films.
This being a review of the remade sequel, I should be saying if it was great or terrible, but it was just okay to fairly goo. I give this film a 6 out of 10 because it brought back too much former imagery and scenes from the first remake film. IT also was waaaaay too light with the forced jokes by Bill Hader, and often ruined the mood more than the original IT back in the day did.
NOt fully answering questions about the whole darn thing was another let down, and even with almost 3 hours and pushed as close to the end with a short 5 minutes of credits, the film just lacked alot.
BUt kids these days are easily scarred or intimidated, maybe many people regardless of age are. At the least IT Chapter Two provides a good amount of distraction. At most, it finally completes one of Stephen King's master works of literary and imaginative horror. Cause a lot of his other stuff nowadays aint doing so well.

","Showing a brief backstory for the titular simpleton/ heart of gold character, Dory, that so many kids seemed to like from the first film, Finding Nemo, we are given a bit of a look into what made the character tick. Thats it. One look.
In what is basically a story that became ' The tale of one nice, but problematic adult woman dating a man whose son she helped find'. Seriously, the two adult fish are dating. lol. The movie basically followed things almost exactly like the first film, and in a series that veils the fact that sometimes life is cruel and people are born with or develop problems along the way, life still just keeps chugging along. Still the film like its predecessor at least can convey to youth that being accepting one ones faults can be virtuous, so longasone tries to improve upon ones self anyways.A nice song here, and a fuzzy wittle feeling there.

Arrival," So Many Reviews, so little getting to the point.
","Look folks, the truth is this film was interesting, in that it was both new and slightly original in its plot device presentation/ usage.However to those whom have seen a CRUD ton of movies, anime, shows etc such as myself, there are no original story ideas any more. However, as old ideas get recycled, because its the message that cannot die. And a message is what this movie is about, though not what you think it was for most people. There is a twist and hidden meaning of this story. Ill let youse figure it out for yourselves, youse smart cookies, youse. ^~^If you like sci-fi, and its potential to broaden our understanding of real world possibilities, while not feeling two hours was used poorly, give this film a shot.

Mother!," Lets just have fun with a multitude of Approaches to this.
","THere have been so many reviews to this film, and unsurprisingly, they all just about touch upon the same topics: judeo Christian themes abound with no names in place in this film, everyone has a titular pseudonym. There's a Him and She, and Thief, and Neophyte, and Herald, and the main character refers to himself as ' I am I'. And sure, that angle was plain and obvious, aside from one other, tiny , teensy little thing...an unfortunate satanic aspect to this.Talk about drinking the cool aid, this film starts off with a baffling chore of restoring an old mansion that seems to not only have a growing life of its own, but reacts to harm in a way( Gaia, mother earth blah blah, environment parallels) whenever its damaged or the woman of the house, its 'mother', is stressed out. But more often than not, the ladies husband is a dual focus as a creator that has writers block, yet is writing a story, but is referred to as a poet. 'He' hides away a fantastic crystal that is a momento of a love long lost, but is loathe for others to even look upon it. But when they do, they become enamored, healed of mental woes and physical ailments for however long they were in the shards vicinity. Memory is a covetous thing after all, made all the more palpable as a symbol that can reignite lost passion.Now even when 'His' stories are read by others, the only tale we are informed about touches upon an apocalyptic scene wherein the house is restored after a world shattering devastation, and the sparse surrounding area is brought to life, while all else beyond lies in permanent states of death. A sort of 'Book of Life', in which all things are written, as if written just for each body whom reads its pages... Again, the Christian elements, such as the garden of eden is so palpable, its almost insulting. But the thing about all that god and heaven stuff, is it has an opposite in its own tales. Darker forces seem to amass upon the small, nameless home , as more supplicants arrive to see their exalted writer, literally coming out of the woodwork/ forest around the land. More and more the parallels to the rape of the land and excess are shown, but instead of some warning, cautionary tale, the story seems to only convey a type of ritualistic momentum that builds into orgy and sacrificing mode as time goes on. Everyone begins to party, a baby is born, but it is soon taken to a candle lit, dingy room, and upon an altar, its dead body is consumed ( don't be fooled into the claims this is just a metaphor for the body of Christ, though Christianity is technically a reformed cannibals anonymous group at times). The wife can take no more, she burns the house, but the husband is the only one unafraid, just simply let down. Again he may seem like god, but only so long as others obey him and allow him power over them ( devilish, non?), and all because of some manuscripts he is famous for ( satanists bibles, perhaps). He takes the dying love of his wife , which formed under the 'pressure' of her stressful life, a lump of coal is pulled from her decaying body, soon to reveal a large, pure crystal, like a diamond in the rough while all else fades away. The man puts the crystal upon a dias( much like a relic of much needed power for stability. Something a true God would not need, but a nefarious kind of being might) and all rebuilds in an instant; walls reform, all debris and bodies vanish, the day dawns as a peaceful morning gently erupts through all windows, and where the wifes body was, a body rebuilds, into the visage of a different woman, to simply be yet another pawn for the man to crutch his endless parade of self indulgence upon. A vessel to rebuild that which he needs to maintain his power, and world, his form maybe even. This bares a resemblance to some stories about conjurers and mystics that try to maintain everlasting life thorough a medium of sacrifice and some object to be the crux of their existence. Still it was not a bad film, just kind of a thrill ride, that almost seems like an actress or actors worst nightmare should the paparazzi or fans storm into their lives, though they put themselves out there as icons, as if to be worshiped.

","Well what an interesting premise: he had what I believed would be a failry in depth look at both the genius capitalist that was P.T.B. whilst also knowingly casting a glance upon his epic disregard for human dignity and fair treatment.
The movie was not completely accurate, as few things done in hollywood are, yet casting Hugh Jackman was...far too tasteless a choice for a movie that was supposedly in the works for 7 years!. It had a few cameos here and there, but nothing sterling even. The performances were not breathtaking in the least, nor believable, the acting was mild and far too feminine in its goal for my tastes. And even my mother saw the film and was of the same mind roflolmfao.

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," In a more intelligent galaxy far far FAR away, Abrams would have been outed after star trek.
","The only reason I give this anything above a 1/10 rating was simply for the fact that it was star wars to a certain point. Aside from all the hype, which crummy movies usually get when the producers need to recoup their losses on the films budget by fooling folks into spending their hard earned money to waste time, I could tell this one would be a stinker.One main reason I was more than disappointed at this travesty was the format it took to almost completely emulate new hope in its entirety. The formula was basically the same except for the wicked alterations to the canon stories in the Star Wars mythos which were supposed to be set in stone. But this movie defiled everything that was star wars, and all because abrams ( I am tired of honoring him with correct name spelling) cant focus on one film job at a time even if lucas wrote him a plan to make it work. He would still do it the abrams way...There was no connection to the numerous decades that passed between Return of The Jedi and Force Awakens and the acting was terrible. I was literally struggling to stay awake while people were ducking in and out because they too must have given up through various scenes of this steamer. I am loathe to say I did not just wait to stream even a pirated version of this movie, because I will never get my money back, nor will anyone else from all the trash merchandise and other sad 'S.W.' films yet to release. Attempting to so obviously create characters and themes that are so familiar says that the director has no faith in the brains of most people, and perhaps by the high rating of this film, he was at least right in that only.The franchise is dead to me, and as far as I am concerned, I already know how everything in the history of the tales of Luke and all the others went and I wont be swayed by modern Hollywood detritus. Disney does not care and Lucas gave up years ago because he already knew people only want bright lights and fights and no big thoughts in sight. Abrams work on the franchise makes the systematic eradication of the Jedi by Palpatine and all the wars in those far away stars look like a halo tournament. Its painfully boring to behold.",5,66,82,9 January 2016
Looper," A movie about Temporal Causality, but in a simple fashion. Sorta?
","Review # 666 Thought provoking, but easily understandable for the average Jane or...JOE.IF you continue, I just gotta say SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT! I break it down, so go no further, unless you want to hear it in its bare bones state.I have seen this film at least 3 times. Its fun and intriguing enough for just about anyone. The things that have been foretold are way more realistic in this movie than in most other 'futuristic' tales. But not very heavy on action.In terms of actually dealing with time travel, this film uses it as only the remotest plot device while focusing more on the what and how that lead to events, not the actual world shattering event itself. But instead of messing with our minds with an endless conundrum like in Predestination, which was great because it WAS about causality and an endless loop, LOOPER the film keeps it simple.Now considering that in terms of time travel, before anything there is always a time line that precedes all others, flowing in a natural rhythm and pace. In that time line little out of the ordinary happened, so this would be Timeline 0 (zero), like the initial bearer of a disease before its outbreak (a patient zero, if you will).In the year 2044 the world has no doubt changed in terms of financial powerhouses that have risen and fallen, ushering what most would have once considered only fictional Blade Runner scenario of a very Chinese influenced America. YUAN!In this age most all people are impoverished, living a vagrant life that is cheap, pointless and easily spent. The currency of the realm in this time seem to be black bills like the Chinese Yuan, which annalists in reality have been saying for decades will one day take over our own monetary system. Its likely that other catastrophes have happened, but crime simply runs rampant next to the crippling poverty rates.So 30 more odd years down the line time travel is created, but supposedly outlawed, allowing JUST powerful mob organizations to utilize its efficacy (lol). The mobsters send an unusual man named Abe back into time to begin monitoring and hiring thugs in the 2040's. These loopers assassinate undesirables sent back by the future mob in the 2070's. Abe may even be the older version of the revolver totting young dummy whom shot his own foot off. Abe eventually spares and hires (and maybe recognizes from his past in 2030's) a young child named Joe. This is the beginning of time line Alpha 1. Through some unforeseen events a boys mother is killed, possibly by one of the loopers. This boy, whom happens to be the most powerful telekinetic amongst the sparse few in the world, grows up bitter vowing to kill all vagrants, murders, and especially loopers. Thus the boy in the 2070's, all grown up, uses his powers to take over the time traveling syndicate as the eponymous Rain Maker for his knack for exploding people with his telepathy. He makes it literally RAIN...BLOOD. In essence it is this angry boy turned homicidal maniac with TK (telekinesis) that began having loopers in the past receive their severance pay by offing themselves. Its possible that with his magnificent mental prowess and abilities, he can affect a change or even undo the harm that he himself had initiated as the Rainmaker. So the main lead, Joe, in his old age is abducted, many years down the line in China and sent back in time to be killed by his younger self, which happens , leading to an endless paradox that is unbreakable, except maybe by the future TK user, Rainmaker. LOLLike in the Terminator franchise, the true meaning of the use of time travel might be far more altruistic if its to undue further harm with just a little mayhem. Like breaking a few eggs to make an omelet that might otherwise save generations of chickens. *ahem*But in the course of all this happening, something ( which the movie fails to state, maybe the protagonists friend also failing to kill his future self, but that would be too easy and still not make sense) occurs that changes the mind of the young looper, Joe, (Joseph Gordon Levitt. Really?). Maybe all the mind altering drugs and the effects of something that caused Tk in the first place began to help change the time lines. Joe, recognizing himself much much older, delays pulling the trigger of his blunderbuss, which leads to a new string of events. OR DOES IT? For arguments sake, lets call this TImeline Alpha 2.Through it all the Old and tired Joe searches desperately for the past whereabouts of Rainmaker in his younger, more vulnerable form, eventually shooting the boys mother, and leading to the very events that created the first looper age, TImeline ALpha 1, that I previously mentioned.By the end of some bland gun play and drug usage, and vaguely rabbinical neo mobsters, the younger version of Joe chooses to shoot himself, erasing his older counterpart and finally breaking the endless chain of events. MAYBE.The young boy whom was targeted now has no reason to become the future Rainmaker. So he goes off to grow up with his momma and a PHAT payload of raw bullion, after the mother strokes the hair of younger , dead Joe, whom might also have planted a bun in her oven. NOICE!Will the boy mature into a benevolent, maybe even god like champion of mankind? Or will things in some other way, not be as right...as rain? Here begins Timeline Beta 1. The film ends with a new unforeseeable future rolling out as do the credits.",7,1,1,8 July 2016

Gravity was better than this, and that movie was terrible.I am not trying to give anything away, hence why I did not choose spoiler alert, but honestly, nobody could be so dense as to not see how a crummy moving like this is going to be.

Warcraft," This is Not The Game, Obviously. You are not prepared...
","Well ACTUALLY, I suppose you are prepared. The film was highly done in cg, and not always well considering its not the 90's. Still it was nice and I was expecting to see it as I first began playing WoW ( World of Warcraft for anyone clueless).The Dwarfs looked kinda sad, and were hardly in the film AT ALL! Which sucks because they are one of my favorite fantasy races.The elves were pre Night Elf, as this is an earlier story in the mythos from a time before the Horde became an official faction, as of WoW. But hardly featured. This seems to take place more before the video games themselves even began in the mid 90's. Still a few alterations here and there, though only noticeable to a fan/ game player , the movie was not terrible.I honestly felt at times however that I was watching the Viking television show, as Travis Fimmel played Lothar. Which could be good or bad as that show kicks ass! The acting on the part of the characters, whether Cg or not, felt too effortless, and I don't mean natural talent effortless. Facial expressions were always a little too puzzled or bland. But then there were a few mentions of a locale in the game world or the sight of a murloc calling to its kin. *shrugs *At the very least it painted a quick picture of what lead to the world in the games as it has become. Leave it to Blizzard to capitalize on a franchise at the last minute, like a hoarder( not horde :P) selling food and water in a crisis AFTER people have died already. Not only will this be the FIRST in a series of films, but with the advent of the latest expansion for Wolrd of Warcraft in August, I just gotta shake my head at the brashness of the company.As if they have not already made a ridiculous amount of of the franchise as a whole, let alone all of its properties and titles.So have a drink, or smoke, or whatever and see it, fore twas a fair to decent film.There's a storm coming, nay... a blizzard, and I shudder to think of all the money being drawn out of people by the cold hearted villains of this storm in years to come.",6,0,3,4 July 2016
The Martian," MATT...DAMON (in Team America voice) a pawn for new age space interest?
","Okay so randomly a frigging BOTANIST is brought to a desolate wasteland of a planet, and then left behind and somehow survives. THIS WAS FROM A STORM THAT ALL of the other astronauts fled for fear of their very lives, and the botanist survives...WTF?!In comes the fact that of all the things not on a mission that is needed for him to survive, there are bits of wood from the one token chicano guy, in the form of a wooden cross among his affects. Nobody else had religious iconography, what the hay? Then the loner breaks up the cross to use as fuel to create water for his botany experiment. He creates water like its nothing, making something NASA would not have done, at least in the film, seem ASTOUNDINGLY simplistic, for a guy whom is supposed to just be a botanist. This is beginning to reek like Gravity did.Still it distracts from all the classic low brow Damonesque slurs and cussing that has been a mark of his in acting since Good Will Hunting. ENTER THE KAKA STORM!So after digging into whats supposed to be dead soil, burying feces, by burning the lone Mexican's wooden cross, the stranded man creates virtual mini hydrogen bombs in an oxygenated environment (*faceplams*). The far too average spaceman then points out that the astronauts were supplied with a highly radioactive substance, that after hardly any use, is just dumped onto mars underneath but a few feet of ground. So already humans turn the world into a garbage dump, but its okay because Damon uses it to warm himself while humorously listening to Hot Stuff by Donna Summer.Then pausing for comedic effect. THIS IS STUPID! Damon is literally spending most of the film on candid camera like its a reality TV show. Are we to be impressed by an actor trying so blatantly to survive upon an alien word, on a screen within a screen? Not if one has respect for themselves, let alone the art of acting. SO then the man with the one trait he claims to have utmost expertise in just happens to dig up his crop of potatoes after barely 48 days, with potatoes bigger than some fists. FORTY EIGHT DAYS?! Either nasa found the one strain of miracle grow anywhere potatoes, or they cheapened out on the healthier organics for these space cadets' mission. Thems some gmo tatter tots, WIll Hunting. Onward with the stupidity. So back on earth the mission command wonders where the leftover cadet is going to journey to, and instead of using most ANY of the sophisticated equipment to plan his course, they just run off to the cafeteria and use a ruler on a picture of craters and it just happens to do the trick. Really? Then comes the use of simple phrases to communicate over a vast distance, one lame nerd whom derides the point of trying at all like a useless emo teen star, and as we were about to be unintentionally woken up form this bullmess, the director just pulls folks back in. I can just see people in the theaters when this movie came out. Deplorable.This was all less than one hour into the film. I had wanted to quit, but kept watching, and was just bored as hell.Then there was more pointless babble and posing and fame from afar snap shots, then planning and untold amounts of cash spent to save one fool take form. Then came poor planning, unlikely execution and a lot of destruction of expensive equipment and wasting of air in an oxygen-less environment. He is then saved, comes home, time passes, the world is distracted from all its real problems blah blah. Later on Damon sits and marvels at a little sapling, reminding him of his martian poop factory for potatoes, all the while admired by the most racially mixed group of young astronauts jogging by him, which still was not that diverse at all. Now I already knew this was gross fiction, but come on, space programs are about as diverse as a teen clothing ad from the mid 90's. IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.Waste of my time by modern cinema, YET AGAIN! We already messed up one corner of the universe, we don't need another done in by:MATT...DAMON. But hey, its not like Hollywood is being used to make us interested in spending billions to launch off into fruitless missions without solving our problems here...OH WAIT. =_=",6,0,1,29 June 2016
