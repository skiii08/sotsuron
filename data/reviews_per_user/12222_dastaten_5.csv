The Incredible Hulk," A Marvel Masterpiece
","First let me quickly explain that I am a serious, major Hulk fan. When I was a kid, I watched the TV show, I had over 200 Hulk comics, a Hulk bicycle, a Hulk Stretch Armstrong, Hulk action figures, you name it, I had it. I actually believed the Hulk was real for a couple years after finding out there was no Santa. So a Hulk movie had better seriously deliver for me to accept it. And this one rocks.You may or my not consider the following spoilers. I don't give away any of the plot, but I do mention some of the cameos and other neat stuff you will see in the movie...Director Louis Leterrier is a genius and does a bang up job of catering to old school fans. Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk in the TV show, has a cameo and does the voice of the Hulk as well. Bill Bixby (Banner from the TV show) is seen on TV in an episode of 'The Courtship of Eddy's Father.' We seen Jim Wilson (Hulk's sidekick from the comics) and Jack McGee (Hulk's nemesis from the TV show) as young college students. They play the Lonely Man Theme (the end music on the TV show) during one scene. There is at least one shot that is straight out of one of the old Hulk graphic novels (fans will recognize this shot when the Hulk rages on the edge of a cliff at the lightening at thunder). There's the purple pants from the comics, the line 'don't make me angry' from the TV show, the infamous Hulk hand slap, and many more. My favorite nod though is the Hulk's final line (he only has two or three) at the very end during the fight with the Abomination. I won't give it away here, but serious fans will cheer when he says it.The directing is wonderful, the visuals are amazing, the acting is nothing phenomenal, but everyone does a great job; it's just an all around solid comic book action flick that entertains from beginning to end and flawlessly delivers for serious fans of the Hulk.If I had one complaint it would be that they messed with the origins of both the Hulk and the Abomination. But the movie does not focus on the Hulk's origin, which borrows slightly from the TV show, and the Abomination's origin is interesting enough and acceptable. Even with this flaw, I still have to give the movie a perfect 10 because the flaw was handled gracefully and it is so obvious that Louis Leterrier went above and beyond with his efforts to satisfy hardcore fans in every other aspect.If you're a fan of the Hulk or Edward Norton or Tim Roth or just action movies, this one should satisfy nicely. If you are indeed a Hulk fan, watch for all those nods to the comics and TV show. They're around every corner.",10,3,5,6 September 2009
The Equalizer," 'The Equalizer' shoots for 'great' and lands on 'good.'
","I was a fan of the old 80's 'The Equalizer,' and I knew this modern take was going to be different. So I went into it assuming it was going to be a stand-alone type and that I shouldn't hold it to the series. I was right. If you're a fan of the 80's series, don't watch this movie thinking you're going to talk a walk down memory lane. It just isn't there.That said, it's not a bad movie. It tries to be 'great,' and it lands on 'good.' The first three quarters or so are 'build up,' and the story is OK, but there really isn't much there. It's hard to rely on story when the main character and his past are shrouded the entire time. The story we do know? Well, bad Russian guys are doing bad things. That's pretty much it. Not terribly creative or deep, really.The first three quarters are slow with a bit of action inserted here and there, but it really picks up in the last quarter. Even then, it's only 'good' and the ending is somewhat anticlimactic.Don't go out of your way to see this one, but if you're out of movies to watch, it's not a bad flick. It's just not a great flick. And if you haven't seen 'Man on Fire,' watch it instead for sure. Or hell, watch it again instead of this one. You'll certainly be more satisfied.7/10",7,1,2,12 December 2014
Gravity," Great visuals, intense moments... and nothing more
","I gave Gravity a 6, mainly for the visuals. Other than that, there isn't much of anything here. Gravity is a nail-biter for sure. The problem is, that's all it is. It's 90 minutes of edge-of-your- seat moments strung together.We learn next to nothing about the only two characters in the movie, so there is no emotional investment whatsoever. I honestly didn't care much whether the characters lived or died.There's no story either. It's basically 3 real-time hours of space survival crammed into 90 minutes. And by 'space survival,' I mean floating around trying to grab onto things while watching for space debris. There's your movie.Gravity makes a mild attempt at being philosophical and falls short. And the message it tries to convey is one we've all heard before, particularly in Shawshank Redemption.No story, no character development, just 90 minutes of stressful, nail-biting moments. Yes, it's a beautiful looking movie. The visuals are amazing. But amazing visuals don't make a movie amazing.If you're a sci-fi geek or just in the mood for an intense, edge-of-your-seat movie, give Gravity a go. But if you're looking for a movie that cares about more than just visuals and intense moments, look elsewhere.",6,0,3,10 December 2013
The Mist," Plastic bugs, CGI tentacles, and a crowd of people with no common sense whatsoever.
","I've only written a couple of reviews on IMDb over the past few years, but I can't let this movie slide. I feel an obligation to warn people who appreciate good horror films to not see this movie.First of all, most of the scenes would not have worked if the characters involved had had any common sense whatsoever. For instance, they constantly walk or stand still when they should be running. This happens over and over. I lost track of how many times I yelled, 'get out of there, you idiot!' or 'why are you just standing there!?' at the TV. I don't remember the last time a movie frustrated me so badly. I guarantee this movie will tick you off about every ten minutes throughout the long, aggravating 2 hours and 5 minutes.And what will tick you off the most is the ending. The last few minutes take a disturbing and shocking turn for the sole purpose of being shocking and disturbing, completely disregarding what any normal people with any common sense would actually do. It's nothing but shock value and it will frustrate you to no end. It pretty much destroys what little chance this movie had at being at least a B rated horror flick and instead turns it into a depressing, aggravating waste of time.I'm a Stephen King fan and I've read the original 'The Mist'. It's been a while, but I remember that it was creepy and that I liked it. However, the movie adaptation is a tremendous let down.",7,8,19,25 April 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max: Fury Road is the masterpiece I'd hoped it would be
","I just finished watching, and wow...This ain't your mother's Mad Max. And anyone who says it's The Road Warrior 'rehashed' is a moron. At no point during the movie did I even feel like I was watching a Mad Max movie. This is a new beast that stands on its own. It's still a post-apocalyptic world, but with Hardy at the helm and with the new story, it feels like a brand new franchise. The action starts early, and it barely lets up for two freakin' hours. And what a lovely two hours it is.Charlize Theron is great, and really, she's the star. Hardy does a great job as Max, but he has like 20 lines in the whole movie (I might be exaggerating). But it doesn't matter - it feels right. Hardy is exactly what he's supposed to be, and he's awesome. And just because he doesn't have a ton of dialogue doesn't mean he isn't always present and kicking ass. He is.The movie is more about empowering women than anything else. And that's a good thing. It's not about greedy marauders after fuel like the previous Mad Max films, it's a human story. And it sucks you in enough for you to care.The comradery is awesome, there's a smidgen of a love story, and a bad guy switches sides and you'll love his character. The direction and cinematography are outstanding, and some scenes, including ones of destruction, are just plain gorgeous. You'll laugh, you'll wince, you'll get teary-eyed. It's f*cking epic.Simply put, 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is an action movie masterpiece, and George Miller is a genius. I don't see how anyone can be disappointed with this movie.",10,2,13,30 May 2015
