Child 44," Outstanding!!
","An absolutely brilliant, edge of seat movie from start to finish! Emotionally gripping, thought provoking and tense throughout. Tom Hardy is outstanding and thoroughly brilliant! Literally on the edge of seat watching! A must see film if ever there was one. If you only see one movie this year, this is the one to watch! This movie will leave you feeling drained, wired and emotional. Gary Oldham is brilliant. I can't stop thinking about the movie, it has left me drained. The subject is always a difficult one but it has been played in such a way that this kind of behaviour, activity is still and always be, unacceptable by society. Please go see this movie! It's a big screen must see. Then buy it on DVD when it is released...... I will be.",10,39,86,19 April 2015
