The Blair Witch Project," PEOPLE OVEREXAGERATE ABOUT EVERYTHING!!!!!!
","This movie is overhyped.Clockwork Orange was overhyped. People said that was the grossest, most violent thing ever on screen. It had NOTHING. There was NOTHING violent, maybe just ONE scene or two, and it was mild. I got so mad after watching it!Ok, this movie suffers the same fate, but triple. Quadruple, even.I'm not saying the movie was bad or anything, it was just NOT SCARY!!!! Why do people have to say this was scariest movie of all time??? There was not ONE DAMN SCARY THING IN IT. Ok, there was one piece of something red, that you don't even know what it is. Looks like flesh. But whatever.This movie is not scary.Seven was a scary movie. It wasn't that scary.. but there were a couple scenes I'll never forget. The Pedophile who was tied to his bed for years, and who was still alive. A living skeleton. That scene scared the sh*t out of me (it didn't scare me... it surprised me... people confuse 'scary' with 'surprising'. If someone sneaks up to you and yells in your ear... that's not scary. That's a 'surprise'. But people call that scary when that happens. That's so wrong.) Still though... I would lie awake at night and think about that guy. He ate his tongue to stay alive. He was a living skeleton. It disturbed me. And that was good. That's what a good movie should do.The Blair Witch Project was a walk in the park. Nothing was scary at all. Go watch, I don't know... episode #.. um.. 212 of the simpsons. Or no... um, read a random page from the LA times. Whatever. The Blair Witch Project is no scarier.Ok, the camera shaking. People say the camera shaked so much that people would VOMIT. WHAT THE HELL???? It didn't shake that much!!!! Hey I hope you guys who said that don't go sailing. You won't get seasick... you'll probably die.Also, the camera was SUPPOSED to shake around a little. These guys were hiking through the woods with packs strapped onto their backs. Packs that were almost as big as they were!!!!Also, don't complain that the movie 'looked like a home movie'. Jeesus christ, it IS a home movie!!! They used a handheld camera to film it! What do you expect? Con-Air?But there's nothing scary. You never see what is chasing the 3 people. Rocks and sticks are left around them. But those aren't scary either. Screaming and yelling and crying and fighting and shaking and trembling... that's not scary to watch either. Hell I watch that every day in my dysfunctional family!Here's where the genius is: Movies cost around 100 million dollars or so to make. Half of that just pays the movie stars.  Then, say, 200 millions dollars to advertise in your face all day. Then the movie has to sell hopefully 700 million dollars over the course of its run, to make 4 hundred million dollars. Of course, then there's the whole crew and studio that got paid their salaries, and royalties, and paying back loans, and the big guys cash out with maybe a hundred million bucks. Ok, the Blair Witch takes $30,000 to make. But for some reason, idiots are SO scared by it, it's called the scariest movie of all time, they market it on the web for almost free, and it ends up making over a hundred million bucks. It made just as much or more than a full production film. That's genius. Congratulations Heather, Mike, and Josh. You guys fooled America and cashed out. Ain't this country beautiful??",Null,0,1,6 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," So visually powerful, but...
","This movie was great! Star Wars has awesome characters, and an awesome story. Now, in our modern day, it has awesome special effects, too. (I'm not saying that the original trilogy had BAD special effects, in fact they were great for their time, but... c'mon. C'MON. ... c'mon.) In fact the movie was so visually powerful that my eyes actually became glued to the screen. Unfortunately, my eyes were then confiscated by the theatre. Seriously, though, some of the original wonder and fantasy of Star Wars was lost in the powerful effects and visuals, but I'm sure that the young people of today, for whom The Phantom Menace is their first Star Wars, will think of the original trilogy as the one lacking in the goods. I just love the whole star wars universe. I can't get enough of reading about external characters and stories, especially the Jedi, and the Jedi council. But I rate movies by sheer entertainment. Therefore, the Matrix edged out Star Wars in pure entertainment, much as I thought it would. But the most entertaining movie of all time, and therefore THE greatest movie EVER, is still Fist of the North Star (english dubbed, 1986 animated version). The greatest movies all have their niches. Hamlet (Branagh version) was extremely powerful. Matrix was extremely entertaining. Star Wars was extremely technological and great. But in sheer entertainment, none can yet topple the sheer ecstasy and joy of watching Fist of the North Star. Please read my review of it, on the imdb. thank you. star wars rules.",Null,0,1,2 June 1999
A Clockwork Orange," True Disappointment
","Now what the hell is this? For years, I hear about this movie, hushed in whispers like it was an underground illegal drug, the most violent horrible movie ever.Finally I get off my butt and actually RENT the thing, and what does it offer in 'ultraviolence' and gore? NOTHING! Oh the rape scene? It was like 5 minutes! Not even the stuff they showed Alex to brainwash him was very shocking at all. Hell no, this movie had hardly any violence! If you want to see REAL ultra violence, watch Fist of The North Star (animated). That is the greatest movie ever. So I was disappointed. But I wouldn't let that be the judge of the movie. So people blew the shock value of it all out of proportion? So what, it was still a good, entertaining movie, right?HELL NO, the thing was BORING. It was worth watching, no doubt, to see what would happen next, but still. It wasn't exciting, it wasn't suspenseful or captivating. All it had going for it was the ultraviolence and shock value, but that turned out to be all blown out of proportion.... not even. In fact I now consider all that I heard about the movie to be LIES. That's how far from the truth all the rumors about the movie are.Oh well, at least now I can say I've seen the stupid thing.",Null,1,2,24 April 1999
The Sixth Sense," Great plot twist, but holes ruin it
","WARNING -- this review MAY contain spoilers, but I've taken great care to write it very discreetly so that you shouldn't be affected by the review if you haven't yet watched the movie -- WARNINGThe plot twist in the Sixth sense makes the movie. Think of the plot twist (which is revealed at the very end) like a fine silk robe.Except it's ruined because it's full of holes.In the beginning of the movie, the psycho shoots Bruce Willis and kills himself.Then it says 'NEXT FALL', and the movie continues from there. Over a year later, where Bruce Willis meets the boy.That's first hole. Would Bruce Willis go for over a year not knowing the secret? (By, the secret, I mean what you, the viewer, would know after the plot twist is revealed, at the end of the movie.)Also, if the secret would hold true, Cole's (The boy's) mother should never have spoken with Bruce Willis.Also, all of the ghosts that the boy sees are scary. They all have their death marks on them. The 1970's teen ghost has his head blown off. The girl ghost pukes up her poisoned insides. The housewife ghost shows her slashed wrists. But the secret of the movie does not follow this same pattern with the doctor ghost. You never see any wounds on the doctor ghost. Hmm... well unless that's because he never turns his back during the whole movie?? You wouldn't see the wound on the 1970's teen ghost if he never turned around either... but I'm not sure... maybe I should watch it again?... Also, none of the other ghosts speak. They stare blankly and then walk away. Why would that ghost doctor speak then?????? It makes no sense!!!The worst part is, again, that it continues over a year later after Bruce Willis gets wounded. I mean, Bruce Willis would NOT have gone for over a year without knowing the secret. Seriously. If all the other points I listed above where little holes in my silk robe, pin holes even, then this fact is like a giant tear. The movie should've continued in the next day, or next week after he gets hit. Not 'NEXT FALL'. UHHHHhhhh.Other than that though, a great movie, which promotes post-movie conversation.",Null,0,0,6 September 1999
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Basically one of the funniest movies ever. A classic.
","Wow. Some other Monty Python movies can get tedious... but this one keeps rolling strong until the end. The ending sucks. That's why this movie is classic. It has great lines. The only movie that is funnier than this is 'Fist of the North Star'. (see my review of that.. it is the greatest movie of all time). Both movies though have lines you can quote forever.Let me compare the greatest movie of all time (Fist of the North Star, cartoon, English dubbed version), and this movie... which is almost the greatest movie. Both have EXACTLY THE SAME QUALITIES. Listen up, people:Both movies have memorable scenes you WILL NEVER forget (like the Black knight, killer rabbit, Tom, Anthrax Castle, Knights who say 'Ni!', the guards who can't follow orders, the bloody massacre in the castle for no reason, the troll guarding the bridge of death, and many other scenes)Seriously.. thinking back.. this movie is ALMOST as funny and great as fist of the north star.Both movies have lines you will always quote (like 'You must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest.... with a... herring!!!', and 'we are an autonomous collective!!!', and 'I fart in your general direction!!!')And of course both movies have characters you will never forget.That is why this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and why Fist of the North Star is THE GREATEST movie of all time.(fist of the north star has more quotable lines, infinitely funnier scenes, and unforgettable characters)But yes, so does Holy Grail... it has Memorable scenes. Quotable lines. it's also FUNNY AS ALL HELL.A true classic.People that say 'American Pie' and 'There's Something about Mary' are the funniest movies of all time have NOT seen this movie.Oh one more thing... you'll want to watch both movies OVER and OVER and OVER again.Like UHF. Spaceballs. Fist of the North Star. Monty Python and the holy grail. You can never grow tired of them. Funny how these are usually comedies.Well, that's it. That said GO AND WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!",Null,0,0,6 September 1999
