Requiem for a Dream," Left me stunned
","After I watched the movie last night, I thought to myself : 'I think i'm going to bed cause i don't feel like doing anything that's fun'What an impact this movie makes on the viewer, it's the best edited movie i've ever seen, the acting from especially Ellen Burstyn is fabulous, and the story grabs you from the first seconds to the last...I never feel sorry for people in movies, but i'm still thinking about Sarah Goldfarb, and the very sad ending for her....This is the best movie i've seen in years, and I advise every movie-fan to watch it A.S.A.P !!10 out of 10",10,1,2,31 August 2001
We Were Soldiers," Maybe the best war movie of all time
","Why you ask ?Because this one doesn't have a heroic sidestory as in Saving Private Ryan, or a romantic sidestory as in Pearl Harbor.Just WAR ! And the senselessness of it....Haven't been this depressed after seeing a movie since ''Requiem for a Dream'' and that one is in my all-time favourite list.We were soldiers is a must-see IMO",10,1,1,28 February 2002
American Psycho," One of the best movies of the last 10 years
","After I saw this movie i didn't get it...Knowing that it was based on a book, i bought the book, read it, and was blown away ! The book is also one of the best i've ever read !After reading the book, i watched the movie for the 2nd time, and this time it blew me away too !!Christian Bale IS Patrick Bateman, and I can watch this movie 100 times and still love every scene of it !One of my all-time favourites : American Psycho !!",10,0,0,20 August 2001
