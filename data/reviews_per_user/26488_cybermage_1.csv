The Ring," Scariest movie I have ever seen
","Saw the movie in a sneak preview yesterday. I haven't heard anything about it before, so I didn't know what to expect. During the first scenes I thought 'Oh, ok, yet another Scream rip-off', but, man, how was I wrong! When the credits rolled and I got up from my seat, I noticed that I was shivering. I was scared beyond belief. Ring is a must-see for horror movie aficionados.",10,0,0,1 February 2003
