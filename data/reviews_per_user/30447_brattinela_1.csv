The New World," was that it?
","I am still lucky because I didn't watch this in a movie theater. But still I paid $2 for the rental. It was too late to read all these comments about this movie. My husband and I are practically glaring at each other with a big question mark on what was going on with what we were watching. It's like we were watching the special features of deleted scenes for 2 hours, like all the good scenes were taken out of the movie (if there ever was). We thought it was as good as the trailer. I felt bad for the producers of this film. Bad choice of a director. TSK! I love the Pocahontas animation and I will just watch it again so as I will learn to like the characters again. We didn't finish the movie. There's that advantage of having it watched on your home rather than be seated in a movie theater and can't walk out in the middle of the show.",1,0,4,27 June 2006
