Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Much better then first
","I watched this movie after seeing a trailer for it. Before that I made fun of the posters and idea of Abe Lincoln killing Vampires. I avoided Buffy the Vampire Slayer for the same reasons and when I finally watched them they became one of my favorite series. All that said if you watched A L vs Zombies and think this movie will let you down as that one did, watch it. The difference between the two is night and day. Vampires has a much larger budget and is produced by Tim Burton. I guess he saw the potential and picked up the project. It was full of action, special effects where on point, and the far fetched premise was made beleiveable enough as any vampire movie can be. The actor who played AL kicked butt and the fight scenes where awesome. The entire cast was quality. I believe this is a cult classic franchise in the making and would certainly watch the next, what ever it maybe assuming Tim Burton stays involved with the project. Skip the zombies and watch the vampires.",10,7,10,29 October 2012
