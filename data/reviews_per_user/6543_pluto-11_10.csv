Ali," Excellent film! But a tad too much Hero Worship
","Let us chalk another one up for Michael Mann! His direction - combining a stunning visual style and pace - deserves high praise. Normally I am not one to sit still looking at fight scenes for too long, but the clever use of Ali's inner dialogs during the fight kept me interested. Also, as usual for Mann's films: I love the sound/music mix. Remember the sound track for `Manhunter' and `The Insider'? This is just as good if not better.Will Smith's and Jon Voight's performances (and the whole cast for that matter) were so shockingly good that one almost forgot that one was looking at actors on a screen. For a moment I thought I was watching `When we Were Kings' instead of `Ali'! I knew ever since 'Runaway Train' that Jon Voight was a major talent but Will Smith! Amazing. Amazing. I look forward to Will's next challenging script.I do believe that if `Ali' has a fault it is that the script was unbalanced: too far into the hero worship category if the film is trying to be an accurate biography. Ali is/was/always will be a great man, but he isn't quite the sainted figure that the script makes him out to be. I felt that Ali's treatment of Joe Frazier prior to the 1971 bout - painting him out to be a 'Tom' and pro-establishment - was self serving and unfair, especially since it was Frazier that gave Ali the chance to regain the title when he didn't have to. This wasn't really touched on in the script and I think it would have been to the films' advantage to show Ali's faults as well as his considerable strengths. Still, Ali has unwavering devotion to his faith, loyalty to his friends, willingness to stand up to the moral outrage of the draft during Vietnam... Come to think of it, compared to our leaders today, Ali maybe does deserve some hero worship after all.",8,0,0,17 May 2002
The 13th Warrior," Thoroughly entertaining, Well written, Well crafted piece
","I would have loved to have seen a director's cut, as I suspect that much of this story remains in the editor's room floor in the pursuit of the 90 minute film. I could be wrong, perhaps this movie *is* the intent of the film makers, but as engaging as the story is, it feels like some scenes that should be there are not there. In any case, I was enchanted by Antonio Banderas' performance - subtle but yet emotionally charged. I was pleasantly surprised to see one of my favorite actors, Omar Sharif appear (though sadly I suspect that some of his material was cut too). Also, for once Muslim characters were portrayed humanely and intelligently, unlike the usual fanatical stereotype we see so often (and the starring role too!). An interesting look at Nordic culture was also a pleasure.Even with these shortcomings I rated this film highly and recommend it without hesitation.",8,0,0,26 March 2000
Lost in Translation," More like a painting than a film
","I think the film didn't really function at the plot level so much - it functioned down in the gut. Sort of like the feeling you get when you are in an art gallery and latch onto a particular piece and you stare, stare, stare until you feel the painting rather than just look at it. I can't really think of another film experience quite like it - except perhaps snatches of a Merchant-Ivory film like 'Howard's End' or 'Room with a View' - even though both of these examples do indeed have a plot, there are certain moments in those films that set an emotional tone that is similar to what I felt when I watched 'Lost in Translation'. This is an artistic film that deserves more attention than I think it will get - but I am sure glad I saw it.Bravo.On a side note: as good a job as Bill Murray did, it would be interesting to see a version of this film with Clint Eastwood playing the lead.",Null,0,1,24 March 2004
Notting Hill," Heartwarming Break from Reality (in a good way)
","I find myself watching this when I need a pleasant break from reality - both leads are perfectly cast and work together well. Aside from a slight goof where the Julia Roberts' character remarks on how good the tuna is at a restaurant when earlier in the film it is established that she is vegetarian (this is what happens when you watch a film too many times). At any rate, a first rate little comedy.When you listen to the DVD commentary you find out that most of the exposition on the other characters (the friends) has been cut out - I wish the filmmakers would rerelease a version with this put back in (assuming it was shot and not cut from the script itself). I enjoy the other characters nearly as much as the stars and wish they had more screen time anyway - to find that at one point they *did* is frustrating and disappointing.",8,0,0,12 July 2003
American Psycho," Useless, pointless, meaningless, cruel, sick
","Again: Useless, pointless, meaningless, cruel, sick. I think that sums it up. I don't consider myself a prude, but this kind of sick stuff without any meaningful message or character development falls under the classification of 'gratuitous' in my book. I admit I haven't read the novel for which this is film is based upon, but if this is any guide I don't think I am missing anything by giving it a pass.Outside the pretentious 80's dining experiences that did give me a chuckle or too - I think I am being generous when I give it a 4 out of 10. A four because the production values were adequate, the set design was pretty good, and the costumes fit the mood and period quite well. Overall, a waste of film and the audience's time at best (unless you find the typical axe and chainsaw thing amusing).",4,2,6,15 September 2000
American Beauty," Astonishing, emotional flash-bang
","I cannot recall a film effecting me so profoundly as this one. I actually wept on the way home from the theater. I haven't seen something this original - this emotionally potent - since perhaps 'Ordinary People'. Truth! Truth!!!Recommend it? If you love film, art, drama - you must see it.",10,0,0,31 October 1999
Coyote Ugly," $45 Million for THIS?!?!?
","Just think, it cost a total of $250,000 to make 'Clerks'. How the hell did they spend $45 Million to make this glorified music video? A practically unknown cast, two or three sets, no special effects that I could see... I know, it must have been spent on that expertly crafted, economical, tension filled screenplay. Shoot, that bar set must have cost a bundle. Anyway, I guess Jerry Bruckheimer wouldn't be caught dead producing anything for less. I'm just surprised he didn't blow up anything.Anyway, it wasn't an awful film I guess. The female leads seemed to have some good chemistry and the soundtrack was OK. IMO It just seems a pity that this rather mediocre project could have been made for $5 Million without any loss to the production, and 6 more $5 million dollar indy films of merit could have been made as well.",4,1,1,23 January 2001
K-19: The Widowmaker," Bogus plot device unnecessary
","I liked the movie OK - but I would add that a thermonuclear explosion is not even remotely possible when a nuclear reactor has an excursion event (as was depicted in the movie). What would happen is a melt down followed by a thermal explosion, which would not have been mistaken as a nuclear explosion by the US and therefore would not have caused a retaliatory response. I am a trained and qualified nuclear engineer and this just would not happen in a light water reactor (Chernobyl was not a light water reactor).It is too bad that even though they went to great pains to make the submarine experience accurate (and they did) that they chose to foist this inaccuracy on the public, who already fears nuclear power beyond the point which they would if they knew the facts. Now, they have yet another reason to fear nuclear power based on inaccuracies perpetrated by this film.",4,1,2,12 December 2002
The Illusionist," Would have made a better Twilight Zone Episode
","I was very disappointed after seeing the trailer and being a big Edward Norton fan to be presented with this rather mediocre piece. What could have been a rather enjoyable film if it had stayed on this side of the illusionist/spiritualist line became rather laughable when ghosts started appearing on stage (or even off stage in the case of the boy). The fun for me in this would have been if the _illusions_ had stayed at least plausible, *illusions*! For instance, the Orange Tree. Paul Giamatti, was, as expected, flawless (it does a heart good to see an interesting looking person for a change instead of variations on Ken & Barbi). The film looked fabulous and I thought it was a nice variation on American produced period films *not* to use Britain or America but Eastern Europe for its setting. However, all in all, I think Rod Serling would have been better able to present this plot in 50 minutes on an old Twilight Zone episode.",6,2,6,12 September 2006
Any Given Sunday," Stinks
","When I saw 'Platoon', I was blown away - I thought, wow, I'll go see anything this guy puts out. 'Wall Street' was also pretty good. Then I saw 'JFK' and 'Natural Born Killers' and, well, I can pass up an Oliver Stone movie now. I finally got round to seeing this one, 'Any Given Sunday' and now I just want to avoid ol' Olly.Personally, a little bit of hand hold, jumpy, 'realistic' camera work will go a *long*, *long* way with me. It takes me out of the film and just annoys me generally. Admittedly, a sports film will have a certain amount of this - but do we have to see it off the field as well? I don't see how this makes any artistic statement, it is just exhausting. This film is non stop jumpy short cut camera and editing work which just gives me a headache. It is possible there was a good story there before it was given this sound bite short cut treatment -  though it is possible there was never a good story there. I'll never know, I'll never watch it again to try and pick it up. Was this a truly cynical attempt by Stone to appeal to our supposedly short attention span?Anyway, I'm almost totally cured of Stonecraft. Hopefully his upcoming film about Alexander the Great ('Alexander') will remind us all that the director of 'Platoon' has returned and the director of 'Natural Born Killers' and 'Any Given Sunday' has retired. I'm going to read reviews carefully before I put any money down to watch 'Alexander', but hope springs eternal. I love historical drama and this subject area hasn't been covered in film before to my certain knowledge, so I hope Mr. Stone has returned to his talented roots and makes his new film from the heart, as he did for his Vietnam movies.",4,6,11,1 August 2003
