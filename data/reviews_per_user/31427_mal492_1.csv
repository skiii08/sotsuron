First Man," Definitely not apollo13
","I left the cinema actually disappointed 
It's no gripping tale like Apollo 13 it's a dour look into the man the character that's Neil Armstrong 
Obviously a dedicated man but a man with an enigmatic outlook shaped I guess by the losses of his daughter and astronaut buddies
Some great action shots of mission take offs and some good effects as to the claustrophobic nature of the cockpits 
I'm a space nut and like I say I felt somewhat short of the Â£28 ticket cost",6,1,2,16 October 2018
