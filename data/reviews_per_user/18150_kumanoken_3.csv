Kill Bill: Vol. 2," OH, THERE'S THE PLOT!
","Let's cut right to the chase: Kill Bill Vol. 2 effin' rocks so I suggest that you stop shooing the flies away from your greasy grand-pappy, get off of your ass and storm the local multiplex right now. This flick delivers the goods in spades and you won't find a more entertaining film out at the moment. So here come the spoilers, kiddies!For those of you who may have missed the first film, the story involves the quest for vengeance by the Bride (Uma Thurman) against a group of international assassins - lead by the nefarious Bill (David Carradine) - who brutally murdered her entire wedding party yet failed to kill her knocked-up ass and ended up plunging her into a four-year coma. Upon waking, our heroine is understandably unamused by this turn of events and proceeds to get herself back into fighting shape, obtains a forged-by-a-master samurai sword that makes weapons aficionados go weak in the knees, and hands out bloody ass-whuppings like they were complementary after-dinner mints. During the course of the over-abundantly film-referenced bloodshed she dispatches two of the five scumbags who conspired to make her take the premature dirt nap (namely Viveca A. Fox and Lucy Liu) along with a small sword-wielding army of yakuza cannon fodder, and does this without much benefit from a plot - but what the hey; when you have such a surplus of bloodshed and action, to say nothing of appearances by beloved grindhouse stars from days gone by, you're bound to make all of the old-school exploitation/martial arts film junkies happy anyway. At the end of the first installment, the audience is let in on a vital piece of information that our blonde warrior doesn't have: her presumed-dead daughter is still alive.When Vol. 2 starts off, the Bride is en route to stuff her trusty sword where the sun don't shine in Bill's alcoholic redneck loser of a brother, Budd (Michael Madsen), make monocular blonde bombshell Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) deader than Steven Seagal's career, and settle Bill's evil hash once and for all. Yet in a surprising turn of events, whereas one might have been lead to believe that this half of the film would be nothing more than another, non-stop stream of beheadings, limb-removals and whatnot, Quentin Tarantino returns to form not seen since the criminally-underrated Jackie Brown and provides us with a seriously character-driven story full of fascinating looks into the heads of the remaining players. To reveal more of the plot would be as criminal as Bill himself, so I'll leave you with a few thoughts:-Uma Thurman's performance intensifies with each encounter, and the final half hour is enough to test even a badass like the Bride (who is finally called by name).-Old-school Shaw Brothers kung fu movie addicts will be happier than Liza Minelli at singles night at the Stage Door Canteen when they witness `The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei.' I herewith beg Quentin to expand on his use of the legendary character of Pai Mei in a future film since Gordon Liu completely steals this sequence NOTE: if you are unfamiliar with Liu's impressive body of work in Shaw Brothers kung fu epics of the seventies and eighties allow me to recommend Shaolin Master Killer, Shaolin Challenges Ninja and The Pole Fighters. Winners all, and not hard to find at rental stores, although you may want to look them up on the IMDB since they go by a number of titles.-Fair warning: claustrophobics beware!-The battle between the Bride and Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) is the most violent, jaw-droppingly ass-kicking throwdown I've seen in a long time and instantly joins the ranks of the best cat-fights in film history; it had an audience full of hardened New York City exploitation movie veterans jumping out of their seats, cringing from blows that you practically feel and shouting out every shocked expletive known to man.-Bill may be a murdering son of a bitch, but he has his reasons for what he did to the Bride.-Stay through the end credits for a little behind-the-scenes fun.Whereas the first Kill Bill was Tarantino shamelessly shoving his world-class film geekery down our throats and basically indulging in what amounted to a cavalcade of directorial masturbation, Vol. 2 is a lot more sure of itself and stands as a solid piece of storytelling. The fact that Miramax saw fit to halve the film is proof that there are still occasional examples of sound thinking from a major film studio; if released as a whole work, Kill Bill would have clocked in at close to four-and-a-half hours and been examined to death with a probable diagnosis as a schizophrenic piece, unsure of whether it wanted to be a mindlessly violent thrill ride or a well-written action film with a lot more surprising depth than one would expect. Few directors can make such a lengthy film work, and Tarantino sure as hell is not Kurosawa, so as two volumes it works quite well, with Vol. 1 being the full-length setup and Vol. 2 serving as the extremely satisfying payoff to the origin of a character who may go on to become one of the defining female heroes in cinema. Well done, Q.T., and though the two films may be the most blatant love letter to a favorite leading lady (and her feet) ever released, your love for Uma sure as hell ain't sappy. Let's see what you've got for us next, you crescent-moon-faced lunatic!",Null,0,1,15 April 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Ignore the critics!!!
","I just sat through the DVD of THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT and have to say that the critics can kiss my beige ass. I know that those f**kheads jumped all over Ashton Kutcher's performance - and to be fair, I ragged on him without having seen the film - , and while he's no Olivier that ain't the point. The story is what reigns here, and it comes off as an R-rated 'Twilight Zone' story. I don't love the film, but I do really like it a lot, and I urge you to give it a chance.Yeah, there's the whole skewed time travel angle of the story in which the protagonist attempts to correct some very dark crap that happened in his past (and, more importantly, the past of a couple of his friends), but what really grabbed me was the utter horror of the childhood experiences that scarred the hero and his friends; growing up in the suburbs is a frightening experience for some kids, and for a locale that parents bring children to for potential family safety they really have no clue as to what kinds of adventures their kids can have, either at home, at friend's houses or through mischief of their own device. The events that shape the pre-altered realities of the main characters are balls-out awful and I don't recommend the film to all audiences, but at least the worst bits are mostly strongly implied rather than explicitly shown; trust me, when kids are involved that's a good thing, because the crap really is that bad.So the bottom line is that you should check it out, and after you see it flip the DVD and watch the director's cut with commentary from the writer and director. If you come away from the theatrical release a little cold, the director's cut/commentary version will majorly sway you like it did me. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",Null,0,1,12 July 2004
Hellboy," FAITHFUL BUT UNINVOLVING
","Ever since I was a tiny, wee kid I have loved me some monsters. The way other kids immersed themselves in baseball statistics or worship of the Bay City Rollers I spent innumerable hours poring over mythology, folklore, horror comics and monster movies; anything, so long as it contained my beloved monsters (well, maybe not Frankenberry, Count Chocula and the now-forgotten Fruit Brute). In fact, my earliest memory of a movie is that infamous celluloid horse turd The Giant Gila Monster, and shortly after that during my fifth year I got hooked on the West coast's version of Creature Features, hosted by that friend and mentor to all of us monster kids, the late Bob Wilkins. In that magical year I was exposed to Son of Godzilla, The Killer Shrews and The Navy Versus the Night Monsters, not great cinema perhaps, but they all delivered the goods to my eagerly waiting mind. Bottom line: if a movie can hand me a healthy dose of improbable critters on the loose, I'm there. So off I went to see an advance screening of the movie adaptation of Mike Mignola's Hellboy comics, secure in the knowledge that the screen would soon be flush with fantastic beasties both opposing and defending us weak, soft humans.The rather faithful film version begins in Scotland, 1944 as those pesky Nazis and a seemingly unkillable Russian sorcerer attempt to open a portal into our dimension, through which they hope to summon Lovecraftian elder gods who will destroy the world and lead to some sort of new Eden with the bad guys in control. A group of Allied soldiers and a British expert on the paranormal thwart the summoning, but soon come to realize that something made it through the doorway before it closed. That something is a cute little red demon that is quickly named Hellboy and raised to fight on the side of the angels.Hellboy grows up to be one seriously ass-kicking BMF (played well by Ron Perlman of TV's Beauty and the Beast), surrounded by fellow paranormal heroes in the employ of the secret Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, so when the unkillable sorcerer and his seig heiling cronies show up again in the present day the Earth has champions who are at the ready, highly trained, armed to the teeth with both technology and superhuman powers, and a fearlessness that enters into territory best described as suicidal. Throw in major throwdowns with tenacious man eating demons, a crazed clockwork cyborg, an irascible talking corpse, a jealousy-fueled romantic subplot and an impending apocalypse frought with Cthulhuoid wigglies and you have a recipe for a monster fan's Nirvana at the cinema, no?No.HELLBOY brings a lot to the plate and if taken as simply a cornucopia of monsters and neat stuff to look at it succeeds in spades; in fact there are a lot of good character bits to found here as well. However, the sum total is yet another overlong origin movie that has a certain sense of detachment from both its audience and its own material. For the most part the film comes to a dead halt when monsters aren't kicking each other's asses in an orgy of special effects and that's a real stumbling block for the first installment of a potential franchise. I'm predicting a strong opening weekend, but much like THE HULK word of mouth could prove to be lethal. But then again, special effects have become such a crowd pleaser over the years that some films have been able to rake in megabucks despite having nothing else to offer the filmgoer, with the current run of misbegotten Star Wars movies as a tragic case in point.On the plus side, we get to see what an insecure guy Hellboy is when not out kicking ass as evidenced by his contentious relationship with his adoptive father (John Hurt) and his concerns about whether the sultry pyrokinetic whom he deeply loves (Selma Blair) is falling for the new kid from the FBI (Rupert Evans). And resident psychic gill man Abe Sapien (Doug Jones, voiced by Frasier's David Hyde Pierce) is a joy to behold in all of his amphibian glory, all huge black eyes and sweet, erudite voice. But hey, give me a gill man and you have a very happy viewer.So my bottom line on HELLBOY is that while not bad it's not as involving as it could have been. It's worth seeing on the big screen for the abundant eye candy, but that's about it. And at two hours and twelve minutes in length it's a bit of a long haul without a few bong hits in you.",Null,0,0,27 March 2004
