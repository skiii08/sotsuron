Blade Runner 2049," Slow moving and boring as hell
","I had watched the original Blade Runner and almost fell asleep numerous times in that movie. This movie was twice as bad. The movie was far too long and drawn out. The pacing seemed off. While watching I estimated it felt about 3 hours long. I just wanted to get out of the cinema as fast as possible. I thought after Blade Runner, Prometheus and this atrocity I would never watch another Ridley Scott film again but it turns out Blade Runner 2049 is not even directed by him. I guess he had the sense not to after reading the snorefest of a script. I think all the good writers have gone on to writing long form scripts like TV shows these days. I much prefer watching things like Stargate SG-1, 24, The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Startup, Curb Your Enthusiasm, The Last Ship, Occupied etc than the utter crap Hollywood churns out these days.",1,10,19,22 October 2017
