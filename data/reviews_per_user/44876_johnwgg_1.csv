Skyfall," Bond gone bland..
","Without giving away the plot; The opening sequence is tame. The supporting actress should have stayed on Blue Peter. All the Bond clich√©s are as predictable as panto. Who ever had the bright idea of putting a poor version of Richard Ayoade from the IT crowd in as Q should actually be shot. The one liners are very droll and again predictable. The story line is shallow and yet again, predictable. The writers (Pervis, Wade & Logan) were trying to make up for it with grandiose bold sensationalism the like of which would not be unfamiliar in the Murdock Empire. It is as if you gave Jeremy Clarkson a plasterers trowel and expected him to copy Cezanne. This incarnation of Bond has lost his suave sophicatedness and we're left with a punch and Dame Judy show.The good parts. Dame Judy is, as she is always, masterful. Daniel Craig is still the best bond in my eyes and he plays the part of a broken burnt out yet thoroughly committed, doggedly determined and loyal servant to the Crown admirably. Berenice Marlohe is a Bond girl through and through top marks 10 out of 10. She's as good as any Femke Jansen or Ursula Andress and that's saying something. However her character was sparingly used. I would have like to see her play a more central role. I think we missed out.However, in short, if was on TV on a lazy Sunday afternoon and the remote was out of reach I'd watch it again, otherwise, don't bother.",6,2,8,30 October 2012
