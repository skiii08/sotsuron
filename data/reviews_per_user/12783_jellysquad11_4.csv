Ghost," Amazingly Underrated Classic
","The movie 'Ghost', when it came out, was extremely popular, and for good reason. The story was far from what could have been a very clich√© plot. I like to think of it as 'A Christmas Carol' meets John Grisham novel. The romance in the movie was well played and very touching. Even though this movie may have some spiritual content that Christian's may not agree with, it does express the relationship between good and evil in and out of this world and touches upon spiritual warfare with demons and angels. Heaven and hell are both shown in detail, but it makes it look like if you do good things you go to heaven, and vice versa. I believe that this is not the case in my faith, that all you have to do is accept Jesus into your heart; but even so people of all religions should enjoy this movie. The suspense and action did not disappoint. The real star of this movie was Whoopi Goldberg, who stole every one of her scenes with her bold and loud presence, personality, and humor; she well deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Oda Mae Brown. She wasn't the only actor who did exceptionally well though; Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Tony Goldwyn made a fantastic ensemble. Swayze and Moore had beautiful chemistry together with the memorable pottery scene. The whole movie works as a whole and it great entertainment, one of my favorites. **8/10**",8,1,2,17 November 2012
Argo," Great Surprise
","Argo is, in my opinion, the best movie so far this year. It has great acting, especially Ben Affleck who had that strong silent type of character and played it wonderfully. John Goodman and Alan Arkin had amazing chemistry together as 'fake' Hollywood producers. The story and pacing of the movie was spot-on, I have never felt this much suspense watching people throw away and shred papers. This is definitely a movie that you will want to see and is DEFINITELY an Oscar-worthy movie for Best Picture, Best Actor and Director (Affleck) and Best Screenplay. Even though this is the first movie this year that I think deserves Best Picture, I believe it will continue to be my first choice in winning.",9,0,0,1 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 'I'm Surrounded by Dwarfs!!!'
","The Hobbit: The Unexpected Journey is Peter Jackson's answer to J.R.R Tolkien 'The Hobbit'. 'The Hobbit' was written before the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and has already been adapted into many cartoons and animation features. The Hobbit is, visually, an extremely rewarding experience; I can say that the opinions of the 48fps (frames per second) are not completely true. You can tell a difference between this and regular fps speeds in the beginning, but it is a minor distraction and remains so for only a little while. The screen ensemble gave a good performance, not great, but good while Andy Serkis gave an absolutely stunning motion capture performance for Gollum. His 5-10 minute scene was by far the best and most entertaining in the entire movie; which is amazing considering the big special effects scenes scattered throughout this move. My main quibble with this movie was the pacing and the dwarfs. This movie was almost three hours long and only covered a third of novel that was shorter than any of the LOTR novels. The reason for this is quite obvious, $$$$$!! This movie will make hundreds of millions of dollars, as will the other two Peter Jackson is currently making. The consequence of this for audiences is that the movie drags out for a prolonged amount of time, especially in the first act. My second problem was the dwarfs, there was Thorin, Balin, Dwalin, Biflur, Bofor, Bombur, Fili, Kili, Oin, Glion, Nori, Dori, Ori...shall continue? There are just TOO many characters thrown at us in this movie and the only one we can connect with is Gollum, only because most of us have already seen him in the previous LOTR trilogy. Although the ending was at a weird spot, the pacing was slow, and there were too many characters, this is a fairly satisfying popcorn flick that would be enjoyed by those who fell in love with the LOTR won't be disappointed, but they may not be overly-entertained.",Null,3,9,12 January 2013
Psycho," Everyone should see this movie!!!
","It depressed me when I accepted that I am probably the only one in my entire class who liked old, classic movies. True, it's kinda geeky, but it is still one of those things that I've always loved. In this same way I became interested in Alfred Hitchcock and his work, specifically Psycho. The first time I watched it, I absolutely loved it. The story, acting, screenplay, writing, art direction, everything was spot on and beautifully executed. I literally found no flaws with this movie. I was telling my friends about it and they didn't seem interested when I told them that this movie was made in 1960. After a few weeks, I went over to a friend's house and I made them watch it, no matter what. They think they've seen scary movies, (TCM, Friday the 13th, etc.) but when they watched Psycho, I've never seen someone so involved in a movie. They, just as I was when I first watched it, were yelling at the screen, covering their eyes, gasping every so often, and when it ended, they agreed that it was one of the best movies they have ever watched. They were completely intrigued by diversity of the movie compared to today's horror and thriller movies that they love. I asked them if they would watch more Alfred Hitchcock and they said, 'Of course!' What I'm saying is that this movie is amazing, certainly Alfred Hitchcock's best work and the greatest thriller/horror of all time, and that if anyone who is reading this and is in the 'youth of America'; give classic (old) movies a chance!! It might be something you have to get used to, it being in black and white and all, but look past that and focus on the story and characters, and I promise you it will not fail to impress.",Null,0,0,22 January 2013
