Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Dumbed down epic lacks the oomph of the original trilogy...
","This movie had cool special effects... The score by John Williams was brilliant... I loved Darth Maul... The story...ughh...it sucked...but the special effects were cool!!! I've already been threatened with stoning at my job by all the Star Wars fanatics who cherished this overblown piece of poo... I could'nt debate with them! IT WAS STAR WARS HENCE IT WAS THE GREATEST THING EVER! AND IF I DIDNT LIKE IT,I'D FIND MY EXISTANCE IN DANGER!!! What is it with this fanatism! The film was mainly a two hour commercial for its franchise! Not a film that can be enjoyed, truly, over and over again my rationalizing film folk like myself!!! Why cant they see that George Lucas has turned into the motion picture anti christ!!!He's Big Brother!!! Ignorance Is Strength!!!AGHHH!!! Wait, someones' knocking at my door... one moment, I...After much thought I have realized that the previous review was foolish because I found STAR WARS:THE PHANTOM MENACE to be the greatest Motion Picture of all time and worthy of every award and bag of coin presented it. Therefore I detract my derogatory statements of Mr. Lucas for I've realized that he is brilliant and we are all fortunate to have experienced this wonderful film and the Star Wars franchise that has newly spawned from it. I also believe Jar Jar Binks to be of pivitol importance to the fowarding of the storyline...And, the special effects are cool too.4 out of 10",4,0,1,14 July 2000
