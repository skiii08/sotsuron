Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't believe the backlash
","I expected this movie to get a lot of flack because it was really over hyped, and when the critics came out with their reviews I wasn't too shocked.  This movie was much more exciting than the previous ones and while excitement isn't the only important ingredient in a film, it's great to be on the edge of your seat for a large portion of the movie.  While the movie lacked a han solo like character, I don't feel this movie needed one. Overall I found this new installment an excellent addition to an already amazing series.  The fight scenes with Maul were the highlight of the film for me, and good performances by Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman are only two of many worthy efforts. There really is too much to say about the film's special effects, score, acting, etc... so I'll just tell everyone to go see it and experience.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
Batman Returns," What's the big problem?
","I look at all these comments and I am curious about all these posts calling this film terrible.  While it's probably not as good as number one this film is damn fine.  Visually it's great and while there are some extremely corny moments(catwoman cleaning herself, life's a bitch so am i, etc...) I think they are just an attempt by burton to add some of what he thought belonged in a comic book.  Depending on my mood I can like this film better than the first for some of it's bizarre behavior and cool look. People who say this film is terrible need to watch some police academy movies or batman and robin and learn what a bad film is.",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
Dark City," Great film for the visually stimulated
","I loved Dark City and after reading through some of the negative reviews I felt the need to defend aspects of the movie I felt were misunderstood. The most important of these is the lack of depth in characterization.  One has to realize that if you were to wake up one day and have to form a personality based on a fabrication your persona wouldn't be too deep.  I do agree that the plot is not the strongest part of the movie, but the visuals are amazing and are very immersive.  If you missed it in the theaters you missed the full effect, but video is still pretty good.",Null,0,1,16 January 1999
