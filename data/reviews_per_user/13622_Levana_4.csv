Raiders of the Lost Ark," No brains
","It's good to know I'm not the only person in America who thinks 'The Raiders of the Lost Ark' is stupid and offensive.  With its villains designed only as punching bags (they are human, none the less...), its heroine intended to be ogled and scream at the right moments, and its pseudo-religious claptrap, all the praise it's gotten says something very disturbing about large numbers of people.",2,40,102,5 February 1999
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," See it for the story
","I wish people wouldn't keep on praising this movie's effects, because, as anyone who's ever gritted their teeth at the thought of yet another summer sci-fi blockbuster knows, all the spectacular effects in the world add up to nothing without a meaningful story, individualized characters, and some wit -- all of which 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' does have, which will probably ensure that people will still be watching it when new technological advances have made its tricks as obsolete as 'King Kong''s.  One of the movie's greatest achievements is its meticulous and loving creation of an alternate world, a dream-L.A. that never existed but in some ways is better than the real thing, an homage to the imagination of old popular culture.  It also slips in some criticism of domination by big corporations (an odd thing for a movie coming out of the studio system), by contrasting, in the viewer's mind, the L.A. of the movie world with that of today, which is precisely what Cloverleaf Industries wants to create.  Indeed, the corruption associated with the building of the freeways was a real event in the 1940's, so the fantastical elements gain immediacy by not utterly straying from reality, just as the toons seem solid by interacting with humans.",8,1,1,10 February 1999
12 Monkeys," Thoughtful and ambitious, though flawed
","Though unfortunately flawed by some mediocre acting, in particular Willis' woodenness and Pitt's overacting, 'Twelve Monkeys' is a fine movie which, in addition to creating a dark and very suspenseful atmosphere, actually dares to introduce serious ideas.  It may have more ambition than it can live up to, but that's better than too little.  It's one of the only movies I know which actually considers what's involved in time travel and time paradoxes; and a much-too-rare example of genuine science fiction in film, where the designation 'science fiction' usually means monsters-from-space or shoot-em-up-with-special-effects.",7,1,1,4 February 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Action and confused thinking
","The sequel is slicker, but not noticeably smarter than the original.  At least Cameron found a co-screenwriter who writes slightly less torturing dialogue than the first one; that's a relief.  And I can't deny that the ending provides an emotional high.The bizarre mix of sentimentality and brutality is even more evident than in Part 1.  The one interesting idea is Hamilton's supposed conversion to non-violence, but this, like every other idea in the movie, is not thought through to its consequences. Indeed, there is a wholehearted enjoyment of explosive, slamming special effects which flatly contradicts this claim of turning away from violence, and makes the insistence that no humans be hurt seem, if not hypocritical, at least delusional.  Certainly this movie will not prevent its many fans from gleefully watching other action films where humans are blown apart and chopped to pieces.Probably the scariest aspect of the whole movie is that Terminator 2 is actually one of the best action blockbusters of the last couple of decades.",5,1,15,9 February 1999
