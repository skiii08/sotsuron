The Blair Witch Project," Needed professional help.
","Excellent story idea, but suffers badly from lack of variety, plot twists--cf. Alien, Psycho, et al.  Amateurishness thus shows in the script--could have used a lot of professional help. End is well done, but how plausible is it that kids scared almost out of their wits would (virtually) rush into a very scarey-looking 'haunted house' in the middle of their inescapable and haunted forest? --Needed professional help.",5,0,2,20 December 1999
The Departed," Wonderful cast, but bloated, overblown, & never-ending
","Nicholson is always worth the admission price, and other cast members do a creditable job. But in the end this is a movie that's wayyyyyyyyyy too long, weighed down by endless clich√©s of the genre (top Mafia boss is endlessly clever, a real sex machine, and full of philosophical one-liners in street patois; police management is too gullible to remain alive; when educated women meet tough guys they can't wait to leap into bed with them; etc. etc. etc.) As always with Scorsese the film is technically brilliant, but never comes alive (no play on words there) except now and then in Nicholson scenes, and quite often when Dicaprio is on camera--he does very well. Did I mention that it's formulaic and way too long?The Sopranos handled similar plotting and material ever so much better. Another proof--if needed--that 'Oscars' mean little except for their enticement value for the gullible.(I don't know what a 'spoiler' is--does that mean giving away key plot details?)",6,3,4,5 December 2012
The Wizard of Oz," The best American movie ever made.
","Combining what American film makers have always done best, musicals and fantasy, The Wizard of Oz permeates English-speaking culture.  It is revealing to speculate about whether any other movies on the IMDb 'top' list will be strong enough to be released again commercially 60 years after their original appearance, as The Wizard of Oz was last year.",10,1,3,9 November 1999
