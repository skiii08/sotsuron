The King's Speech," you can do it!
","I've seen this movie lots of times. Someone trying to get something over makes me cheer them up.The king was seriously bad at talking in front of audience in spite of he must do that. He tries to get over the stuttering. One day, he finds a doctor for that, but his ways of therapy are severe and hard, so the king comes to want to give up. But the doctor makes him keep going. And the day the king has to speech comes,,,I love this story. The methods of therapy made me a little laugh,and I wounder if it is really effective because it was doubtful way. I didn't understand why he feels such responsibility for making nice speech, but I realize how important and difficult to lead people. Finally, I cheered him up saying 'Ganbare!!' in front of TV.If you watch this, you will definitely feel you can do something you are bad at for sure.",10,0,0,12 September 2013
500 Days of Summer," go forward
","Tom, a man working in an office, feels bored for his works and daily life. He dreams to meet an attractive girl some day. One day, a girl named Summer comes his office as an assistant. Tom falls in love with her at first sight. He feels closer to her little by little and he thinks she feels the same way, but in fact,,,Before I watch this movie, I thought this was just a kind love story I've seen, but it was not an usual film about love. Tom believes love is important and relationship with Summer is serious, while Summer thinks love is just a thing to enjoy. This difference makes the story interesting. I think this kind of love story is more common than any in our daily life. A boy and girl don't always feel the same way, so they break up and find next one. These experiences are steps for you find your fianc√©.What most two interesting things for me are Summer's fashion and music. In the film, Summer wears 80's clothes. The dresses, her hair style all she wears are so cute. And the music plays important roll in the film. The music shows every Tom's feelings. Above all, the music are all good I think. I really recommend you watch this!",9,0,0,12 September 2013
Life of Pi," the way of survive
","A boy, his nickname is Pi, whose father is the owner of a zoo moves from India to Canada because managing of the zoo gets harder. His family and he board on a cargo ship with animals, but suddenly a storm hits them. Only Pi and some of the animals, such as zebra, orangutan and tiger survives on a small ship. Pi has no way except getting along well with the hungry tiger to survive. Then, the dangerous life starts.There are many scenes which Pi talks to the God as if the God knows everything what is going on. Pi is interested in three religion Hindu, Christianity. As for me, I don't believe in religion, so it was surprising that Pi depends on the God so much.I see lots of beautiful scene in this film. What made me most absorbed in was the scene which a whale comes up from the sea. The sea blue, the light, and of course the whale looked awesome. I wanted to see this with 3D one. Anyway, this is worth watching!",7,0,1,1 October 2013
Enchanted," what a real love is
","This was my first time to see this kind of Disney love story. Usually, in Disney movie, the prince and princess get together happily, but this was a little different.A princess looking for love with a prince some day suddenly comes to real world we live in accident. Then she met a man who is a single father. For him, she seems to be strange because she always believes miracles and importance to have a dream. At first, he gets upset because she causes lots of troubles. However, little by little, he comes not to leave her alone. On the other hand, she learns what a date is, what a real love is from him, and she starts to feel staying with him is much fun. But a witch appears and interrupts them.This story told me how important to stay being happy. We often think dreaming somethings apart from reality are just silly and sometimes make fun of the people who believes that. But we should believe things would be better and hopeful to be happy. Moreover, this told me even if you and your partner have difficulties, you should trust and not to be afraid to take a step forward.I recommend you watch this.",9,0,0,12 September 2013
There's Something About Mary," funny story
","This is funny and sometimes ridiculous story. A boy who is geek and ugly is in love with a most popular girl in the school. He asks her to go to prom, but unfortunately he has a strange accident then. Many years passes, but he still loves her. And he hires a private detective. However, the detective also fancy her, so they two starts trying to get her.I like Cameron Diaz. She is very cute and being a tomboy in this movie. Sometimes there are some bad expression or ridiculous scenes while watching this, but this is the American comedy love. Mary's smile and childlike personality attracts many boys I think.If you want to watch American comedy, I recommend this.",7,0,0,7 October 2013
The Social Network," difficulties
","I wanted to know how Facebook was made. Today, many people use Facebook. It's very useful and fun to have an account. When I heard this was made by a young man, I couldn't believe it. I was expecting there were problems making face book before watching this, but it was much more than my expecting.A young man Mark is a student of Harvard university and he is an expert of computer. One day, he makes a homepage and this is the start. His excellence at computer becomes business and causes lots of problems especially in relationship with people around him.This movie goes on very fast, so it was hard to catch every single thing. However, it was good to know the journey of Facebook.",7,0,1,1 October 2013
