The Devil's Advocate," Gogol would have not done better
","In the classic Russian literature you find several writers always asking themselves about the dilemma between God and the Evil, one of them was Gogol, much more idealistic than Dostoyevski. This film reminded me Gogol, from time to time Dostoyevski's 'Brothers Karamazov', and also Jos√© Saramago's 'Jesus Christ Gospel' because of its strong religious argument probably arguable according to each one'believes. It is true XX century belongs to evil, too many wars and disasters. The modernization and industrialization haven't prevented the problem instead the situation became tougher and troublesome all over. The vanity of the man goes beyond simple ambitious of moderate wealth, he/she always wants more and more, not taking into account that there are others having nothing, just surviving or living for a while. This film goes deep into these matters, and is worth to be seen by all, particularly in industrialized societies. Al Pacino was the real evil, but a reasonable one, his arguments unfortunately were not debated as I would like; Keanu Reeves played the role of an ambitious lawyer, who knows everything and wins all processes, he killed his family, his feelings and his life, while Charlize Theron was the victim of this disgrace. It is advisable to read the novel of Andrew Neiderman before seen the film. In any case, the director Taylor Hackford was able to assemble well the plot and scenes of this film full of morale.",8,1,2,7 May 2005
The Legend of Bagger Vance," An assistant of a golf player
","Among the young actors Will Smith should be considered one of the best. His skills as actor are well shown here. He was able to give the idea of the man able to guess and to advise his nervous golfer (Matt Damon). For people like me who know little about golf game, it is an opportunity to see and to understand some of the rules of the game. A sensational game is played during the second half of the film, where, obviously, the hero of the film (Rannulph Junuh played by Damon) is the winner.",7,1,3,3 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," New fights in the space
","For those who saw and liked the serials of Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, the Star War films of George Lucas have become as a resurrection of those space fights. Here there is no emperor Ming no a hero like Gordon, but it is enjoyable again. Of course, now computer and software allow you to invent several strange creatures, and these techniques were not available in the past for directors like Ford Beebe. George Lucas has been able to make several interesting and exciting films of star wars, which have a lot of imagination and may give you perhaps of an idea of how technically advanced could be the world in the coming future (100-200 years later). The present film is also as exciting as the previous ones. Here it is fantastic the ways the skywalker- child was able to shoot effectively at the facilities of the enemies. The fights with luminescent swords were also very well done. Violence is mainly against robots but not against humans.",7,0,1,16 April 2004
Ali," Part of the heavyweight boxer's biography, Muhammad Ali
","Excellent film, which deserves an OSCAR, let's hope this will happen. The film is really good because it shows several interesting things of history of USA, politics, Muslims and boxing, including corruption in it. In the film it is seen how Malcolm X was criminally murdered, the problems of Ali with the Muslim's organization, his troubles with his wives, and with USA Government, particularly when he decided not to go to Vietnam. This also includes what he said openly about the war and his feelings about racial discrimination in his country. His second wife said two interesting statements: the first one regarding the former president of Zaire, Mr Mobutu, who took plenty of money from the match between Ali and Foreman, and also about the way Don King was becoming rich. According to her, King was a man talking about the opportunities of black people but behaving as a rich white man. The shortcomings of the film were: 1. It did not show anything about the development of Ali when he was amateur and became Olympic champion in Rome 1960. 2. It failed to indicate or suggest who really prepared the murder of Malcolm X. In any case, I consider the film good in his message and plot, and worth to obtain a good prizes for it.",8,0,1,4 March 2002
Spartacus," The gladiators revolution
","There are several versions of Spartacus'life, and this drama was made based on the story written by Howard Fast seconded by the famous cinema writer Dalton Trumbo, blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, in the early 50s in Hollywood for his left wing ideas. For a film made in 1960, this is a very educative material and also very provocative for its time. The cast better cannot be, Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis together with the long-experienced and efficient British actors/actress as Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons and Peter Ustinov, simply the best. Probably someone like the Russian director/actor Serguei Bondarchuk (War and Peace, 1968) would have prepared several sequels of this film, but Stanley Kubrick and his group opted for a long film, everything in one shot. Due to its length probably Kubrick could not include some more historical facts. For example, the film starts showing Spartacus already as a slave, when he was first a shepherd in Tracia, then became a soldier of Roman army, he deserted and became slave, and later was sold to an school of gladiators. These sequences are not shown or were not prepared in the film. I do not know either whether Fast included these facts in his book. The other thing is that Spartacus moved with his army up to the Alpes then came back to the South looking for the sea, this was not shown. Crassus had three battles against Spartacus, and he was defeated by Spartacus in the first two. The film only shows the final one. Finally Spartacus body was never found after the final battle, and here you know what the end is. In any case, the material is excellent, useful for everybody to know a bit of history and how things went in despotic Rome at that time. In addition, acting of Charles Laughton as Gracchus and Laurence Olivier as Crassus were certainly the best. The rest did a very good job, but Laughton and Olivier, who were not friendly at all among themselves, excelled in this film.",8,1,3,17 May 2005
Training Day," Bad and good policemen
","Non spoiled young policeman learns how corrupted is the police of his town. Many policemen involved in drug deal and other dirty business, but doing too little to impart justice. Because of his clean and honest behavior is mistreated by his colleagues policemen, particularly his partner and supposedly to be his instructor (D. Washington), who is extremely corrupted. BY the end of the film the young guy concludes that it is time to finish with this corruption and tries to severely punish his instructor. The latter is an undesirable person in his area of living and finishes under the fire of his enemies. 'Do not do bad to others because at the end you may suffer the same', this is the message of the film.",6,0,11,2 July 2002
Erin Brockovich," Polluting water
","The film is really interesting and touching a situation created by a company without considering the problems it may bring about with its wrong productive process. When a company does what this one did, it is causing a high social cost sometimes with irreversible effects on man health and the environment. Water was contaminated by hexavalent chromium and already affected several people living closely to the factory, my question here is: how long would it take to decontaminate that water? what are the expenses necessary to solve these problems? We live today but the world of tomorrow belongs to our grandsons and granddaughters, are we to leave egoistically a polluted environment to them? The film obviously focused more on the work carried out by an intelligent woman, probably nice one because Julia Roberts was very beautiful playing this role in the film, whose name is Erin Brockovich. The insurance company where Erin works or worked should be feeling happy to have a worker like her. She was able to seriously open this case and demand the company for its deeds. My congratulations to the director Steven Soderbergh for including an important issue for today and tomorrow, i.e. pollution, in this film, and also to Julia Roberts and Albert Finney for their excellent acting.",7,1,2,1 August 2004
Unbreakable," A man with superpowers
","Good imagination, but nothing else. A man with superpower, who discovered his capacity and becomes a kind of Superman or man imparting justice in his society. Beside him there is a sick man, enable to do physically anything worth, and probably representing the evil. The latter used to guess and to study (very funny) the comics and their heros. Willis acting is the usual one, nothing extraordinary, while Jackson tries, but again the plot does not help them too much.",4,0,1,2 July 2002
Mississippi Burning," Mississippi Apartheid should be the title
","Interesting film about a real tragedy, which took place in Mississippi in 1964. Three young guys, including a black man, were killed by KKK. Two FBI came to the village, where this happened and investigated the case It was just an example of what was going on there. The best of the film is the acting of the whole group of actors and actresses led by Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe, the latter as a generous FBI detective instead of being a villain as usual. The film left no doubt that KKK is (or was) a terrorist organization with a complete lack of human feelings, only with the obsession to kill black people, to reduce its population and denigrate it any way. I heard someone in Italian TV saying that Alan Parker directs wrong films, but this one is not the case.",7,2,5,20 November 2002
Rocky V," The last Rocky film but not the worst
","The serial of Rocky films has been interesting at its beginning and boring after the second film. All films have tried to demonstrate the power of a white Italo-American boxer, generous, kind with his wife, son and friends. But this Rocky V reminded me part of the sad story of one of the most famous all-time boxers, Joe Louis, who had to come back to the ring to fight against a young and strong Rocky Marciano. At that time Louis was far to be the one who was unbeatable during the 40s, he came back because suddenly debts were coming to him, nobody knows how, and he was simply compelled to fight for his survival. Everybody of that generation in US knows that Louis was simply killed in life for giving the championship 'sensationally' to white Marciano. So nearly the same is what happened to Rocky in his end as a professional boxer, and he had to train a young and strong fighter who had no ethics and no human feelings. Unfortunately, life is like that. In this film there is also a very terrible manager, George Washington Duke, played by Richard Gant, who reminds me the person of Don King. The latter is well known because of his fight arrangements and other 'movements' in the boxing area. Therefore I saw the film arranged with some pieces of true story of another great boxer (Joe Louis) as well as the problems of dirtiness of this professional sport, which should be prohibited one day in the future for ever.",6,4,6,2 May 2003
12 Angry Men," Henry, you are right, it's magnificent
","There's no adjective to qualify this extraordinary all-times classic, which demonstrated that there is no need to spend heavy sum of money to make an useful film. The life of a young man likely to be innocent is an enormous responsibility for any jury in the world, and the plot goes around this issue. People in the jury do not necessarily think in the same way, some may favor what the supposed evidences showed in the process, others do not think too much and go behind the wave of the opinion of the majority, while others may be going deeper into this matter and not accepting all testimonies as good evidences. Furthermore, majority always tries to convince that minority who really analyzes each evidence and its truth. That's what we can see in '12 Angry Men', which was filmed in a room with the participation of only 16 actors, some of them playing outstandingly like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden and Martin Balsam among others. It is a paradox to note that such an excellent material only got Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for best director (Sidney Lumet) and actors (Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb). However, outside US the film got all the merits it deserves, as BAFTA in UK, Bodil in Denmark, Golden Bear in Berlin Festival, Blue Ribbon in Tokyo, and Silver Ribbon in Italy.",9,1,2,15 May 2005
The Notebook," To be remembered for ever
","It is a plot full of freshness, very alive, real, passionate and sentimental. An unforgettable film, with good performances of its cast and a brilliant narrative. All the time the spectator is anxious to see what will happen, the development of a relation almost lost, of a love flying between two opponents. The sincerity and the real love are the winners at the end of this novel. The film shows once again the false values of some rich, but also how those opulent people can succumb to the real love of the poor ones. Ryan Gosling was superb in the role of young Noah, his way of looking well expressed his desires and his human feelings. Rachel McAdams played also at the same level, she was young Allie, naive, beautiful and with plenty of energy for love. Experienced Joan Allen gave a nice performance as Allie's mother, while Gena Rowland and James Garner were as usual very effective and complemented very well the whole story of this film. Nick Cassavetes directed a film to be remembered for ever, a film which gives guidance of how to make good materials full of fragrance and dreams without the need to include violence in its scenes.",9,0,1,14 March 2012
The Irishman," A film with history and reflexion
","At present it was very convenient a film as such, which deals with mobsters and the murky world surrounding it (unions, politicians and others), it¬¥s the world where words as nasty, bs, rats and other vulgar words-expressions are quite common. The good thing here is that these elements always finish in prison, they mock the law but up to a limit, and usually the rats are all trapped at once. Hoffa was a powerful man but supported by other groups. With no support of the power Hoffa, union¬¥s boss, would've been nothing. That's why it is a good film for reflexion, moreover for those who claims victory early not taking into account that support can sink any time. Interesting film and plot, congrats to Martin Scorsese for bringing together a group of experienced actors, who, as usual, excelled in this film. Joe Pesci was simply outstanding, Al Pacino and De Niro also but a little bit less than the first mentioned. The make up of these actors was also extraordinary. They look young, then a bit older and finally ancient, magic make up.",8,2,7,7 February 2020
Billy Elliot," Life teaches all of us
","Various aspects of life are shown in this excellent film, on one hand, the problems of miners in Northern Ireland, many of them still fighting for their rights and many also accused of being communist, no matter if they are not. The other is the reality at home of a father miner, a 'machismo' typical of Latin American countries prevailing in that society, which is supposedly more advanced culturally and economically than Latin America. Against the vocation of children is very little what parents can do, and Billy is the prove, he insisted on and persuaded his father and even his extreme conservative brother to leave him become a ballet dancer, and he succeeded.",8,0,1,7 December 2003
Alexander," Very much like Alexander the Great
","It would be interesting to ask Oliver Stone whether the idea of making this film was inspired by the documentaries he made about Fidel (Alejandro) Castro. Personally I think that he was looking for some similarities between both and tried to establish a parallel or may be this is just a coincidence. The history of Alexander I was taught at high school was very close to the story of this film. It greatly differs from the former 'Alexander the Great' (1956) directed by Robert Rossen. Obviously, in the 50s there were so many prejudices in the society to show not a real Macho Alexander, but the fact is that this film showed the egocentric character of the Macedonian monarch, he was thirsty of conquers, he wanted his name to be remembered for ever, he wanted to be the Great, he did not care about family, that was not part of his dreams, he wanted to reign now and forever. The nature of Alexander was well reflected by Stone.However, personally I think that the selection of the cast was not the best. Angelina Jolie is quite young to play the role of Olympias, the Alexander's mother. The real age difference between Angelina and Colin Farrell (Alexander) is just one year. Probably they both can star well in a romantic film instead of playing mother and son in this film. Farrell was not either a good choice as Alexander, he did not show that strong character I assume the Macedonian had. Good performance from the old Ptolemy played by Anthony Hopkins and an acceptable Filippo (Val Kilmer).",8,1,2,28 October 2008
The Others," A different thriller
","When you see this film you may consider it a thriller as any other one, but this is a mistake when you arrive at its end. This is an original thriller which could have better plot for its two first third parts, it is too boring to see Nicole Kidman always so hysterical and less smart than her daughter, crying any time for anything. Also the idea that a ghost will not recognize itself as such and that any other ghost will have to come to aid you in identifying yourself as a ghost is a bit illogic even for those who believe in a second life after death.",5,0,1,11 August 2002
Troy," Ancient Troy war shown with special effects
","This time Wolfgang Petersen decided to touch a Greek mythology, the famous one from the poet Homer. This material has an excellent color, camera and fantastic special effects, really competing with the trilogy of 'Lord of the Ring'. It also has good acting, particularly from the experienced Peter O'Toole, who played the role of king Priam, and Eric Bana as Hector (Priam's son). Brad Pitt (Achilles) was OK but not at the same level of these two actors who may compete well for OSCAR nominations as the best supporting actor. Historically the plot of the film is not the original one. Patroclus is shown as Achilles cousin when in fact he was an Achilles good friend. Achilles knew that Patroclus wanted to fight and he gave him all his weapons to fight. In the film it is shown that Patroclus went to fight without the consent of Achilles. The film is shown only with real human heroes but no gods from the ancient Greece took part in it. The Iliad of Homer has a mixed of human beings and gods interacting all the way. The end of Paris is not shown, he rightly killed Achilles with just one arrow and not four as shown in the film, but later Paris was killed by one of the gods. Achilles was an excellent and invincible fighter but not so cruel as shown in the film. He always had huge differences with Agamemnon, and this was well reflected by the film. Little was shown regarding the love between Paris and Helen.
Although all these aspects well not well shown in the film, I consider that it is in general a good material, which may encourage young people to read more about the Iliad. Let also hope that the director, Petersen, is decided to make a new film about the Odyssey.",7,0,2,24 May 2004
The Hustler," Be cautious to really excel
","Any person may have good skills for a particular job, art or sport, and may succeed easily, but the permanent success is only achievable when you cultivate an integrated attitude to the life, probably not spending more than you are earning, being modest and living without excess. This film goes around the life of a skillful man, Eddie (Paul Newman), in billiards but with many personal shortcomings, including a highly chaotic way of life without any sustainable economic position. The interaction of Eddie with Sarah (Piper Laurie), who becomes his woman, and with his rivals in billiards and sponsor is coherently shown; including the contradictions arose from these relationships.Behind the game of billiards a mafia-like people seems to be involved. The sponsor of all good players, Bert Gordon (George C. Scott), is an unscrupulous man able to exploit any man of the world just for his own interest. Eddie became a real man after so many discussions with Sarah, who was able to understand the malicious and tricky nature of Gordon. Eddie started to understand life after lessons received from his woman and also from Gordon's behavior. The end of the film has a good morale, useful to young people.The performance of all these actors/actress in addition to Jackie Gleason, who acted as the champion Minnesota Fats, was simply excellent. The film certainly deserves to be among the best 250 in the cinema's history, so our congratulations to its director, Robert Rossen.",9,0,1,31 May 2007
L.A. Confidential," Corruption in Los Angeles
","LA Confidential is more than a drama or a thriller, it is probably a material showing the existing level of corruption in LA during the 50-60s. This time I saw the film carefully, and certainly its main actors, Spacey, Crowe and Guy Pearce did an excellent work as policemen and detectives also corrupted or each with his own ambitions. I cannot assert that everything shown there is real, but some facts may have encouraged James Ellroy to write the novel and Curtis Hanson to make such a film. The plot is a bit complicated to be told by me here, but I may assert that it is a very well done film, with all necessary ingredients. However, I must also say that although Kim Basinger acted very well, I did not find her acting worth of an OSCAR as the best supporting actress.",7,0,1,22 August 2003
Concussion," In Spanish the title is 'The truth is painful' but in the pockets of the magnates
","We always learn with good films, and this is the case. Dr Omalu (Will Smith) asserted that many animals have better protection of their head and brain than the human being, e.g. the tongue of the woodpecker extends through the back of the mouth out of the nostril, surrounding the entire skull, which becomes a kind of safety belt for that vital organ. The human being has none of that, you hit your head and you stay with the blow, which in the medium term will bring fatal consequences, many more if repeated weekly. The film is a clear evidence of the abuse of the human being in American football, sport causing several deaths for the same reason. The NFL's attitude is quite similar to that of cigarette producers in the 1990s. They denied all the damage that tobacco caused to human health. The racial aspect is again addressed in the film. Dr Omalu arrived in the US with an idea, which later changed. Good acting of Will Smith and Alec Baldwin, both demonstrated one again their versatility to play different roles.",8,0,0,28 January 2020
Hotel Rwanda," Hutu- Tutsi war in Rwanda
","Although I visited Rwanda shortly before the war I do not remember 1000 colins hotel in Kigali. Certainly there was a tragedy in this tiny African country where brothers- I do not make any differentiation between tall Tutsi minority and somewhat small Hutu majority - were fighting each other. Probably all this hate started at the time of colonialism when the Tutsi were more favored by the Belgians, and once the country got the independence, a Tutsi kingdom was established with discrimation over Hutu population, which lasted not for long. The Hutu defeated the Tutsi and came to power with a Republic that continued the discrimination this time against Tutsi. In that country was compulsory for everyone to have the ethnic indication in the identity card. The film is only touching the final phase of the war between Tutsi guerrilla who was coming from the North of the country and the Hutu extremists, who were able to kill its own president, as it is shown in the film, just because he signed in Nairobi a peace agreement. In the film one can see how Hutus were killing innocent Tutsi population, and how international community was weakly reacting to this mass assassination. Unfortunately, it did not show how many Hutu families were coming from the North to Kigali. The film finished with the victory of Tutsi, but was it the end of this war? Not at all, Hutu escaped to Goma in the neighboring Congo, and many of them died again in war established between both groups, but no in their land. So if Hollywood makes several sequels of non sense films as 'Terminator', 'Die Hard' and others, it would be wise to prepare a sequel of 'Rwanda Hotel' showing what happened after the Tutsi conquered Kigali, and how this confrontation finished, or perhaps to prepare a similar film of the tragedy in neighboring Burundi, where the same groups are still fighting. Don Cheadle acted very well but somewhat different to the role he played in the film 'Rosewood'. In 'Hotel Rwanda' he was a Hutu but married to a Tutsi lady and with several children, always looking for peace and understanding.",8,2,3,1 May 2005
Lion," Kidnapped children
","Garth Davis managed to make a film that touches a very serious situation existing in the world, especially in India, where annually it is estimated that 80 thousand children are lost or kidnapped by the existing mafias, which aimed at killing these creatures to take their organs or turn them into slaves of wealthy families or for working hard in factories that are not in sight of the population. 'Lion (2016)' touches the issue of how children are kidnapped, managed and sent to unknown destinations, where prostitutes are painted as false mothers to delinquents who may well sin of pedophiles. The best for these children is to be adopted by decent families although they will never forget where they are coming from and look forward to come back and meet their relatives. The plot of 'Lion' is very interesting, and let us know the concerns of these children once they become adult, their dreams and sufferings.",8,0,0,28 January 2018
Fargo," Money against ethic values once again
","Looking at the film based on a real story and facts, I was asking myself where the man would like to arrive in certain societies. Love for your wife and/or husband, for your children, parents, other relatives an close friends is always more valuable than any money. The main man in the film, Jerry Lundegaard, was able to organize an act of kidnapping his wife with two gangsters in order to get half a million US$ for him and another half for the gangsters. The result was fatal at all, his wife and father-in- law killed by the gangsters and he himself discovered and caught finally by the police. This Lundegaard had no ethics, no love for anyone including his son, and no brain at all. The idea of making and presenting such films is really, it probably may help some people (with brains) to think about and not to kill or burn themselves and their families for money.",7,0,0,22 August 2003
Notting Hill," An actress falls in love for a simple bookshop owner
","For refreshment this comedy is good at all. The plot is very real, nobody can say that a movie star cannot love a simple man, perhaps this may happen even better than the love between an actor and an actress. The actress (Julia Roberts) was in fact looking for new air and trying to escape from the routine of journalists, photographers, critics and others. She was tired of all this circle and wanted something different. Hugh Grant, the bookshop owner, showed her modest life, good friends and other environment much better than the one of million US dollars. Congratulations to Roger Michell for this film that anyone can see several times, it has also excellent music with songs of two Bee Gees (Barry and Robin Gibb)and Charles Aznavour, congratulations once again to Julia Roberts, who is simply at present the best actress in comedy in Hollywood. Appreciation also to the work of British actor Hugh Grant, always very efficient.",Null,5,6,20 August 2002
Nightcrawler," how to become a reptil
","There are films that go deeply into corruption issues. Poverty and the lack of decent employment possibilities lead to the human doing 'acrobatics' of all kinds to make a living. No matter how the objectives are achieved, one should be machiavellian, the end justifies the means, and that is, apparently, what the film 'Nightcrawler (2014)' shows us. However, a man survives, triumphs and it is when he loses his rational human behavior and his ambitions become exacerbated. Love does not exist, only a superficial one in order to satisfy even more his ambitions. Excellent acting of Jake Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo and a London-born director-actor Riz Ahmed. A success of director Dan Gilroy with his first film.",7,0,0,27 December 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The battle to impose the good
","The novel on which this film is based is good and the film tries to be as good as its original plot. This is a very good film, highly educational, and children and young people may learn a lot of good morale from it. An ancient ring represents the ancient ambition of power by men, and it is a matter to destroy it not letting anyone to take it again. Not all those involved in this difficult task of destroying the ring are completely convinced that this has to be done. Sometimes satanic ideas and thoughts stormed in their brains whether to leave the things as they are or to continue fighting to finally eliminate the ring. The next film should show how this task was accomplished.",8,0,0,23 March 2002
The Caine Mutiny," A different Bogart
","Usually we have seen Humphrey Bogart playing roles of criminals, smugglers and in the 40-50s as detective and tough man for making justice, but in this film you have another Bogart, totally different, an unexpected one, which shows that this man was able to play any role, that's why he was exceptionally good and perhaps one of the greatest in Hollywood.The film is a jewel because of the plot and also good performance of the rest of the cast. Veteran Fred MacMurray was excellent and Jose Ferrer superb. Add to this the also good acting of Van Johnson.The value of the film is that it shows the ethics of the people, how they behave, how some persons change according to the circumstances, mostly looking at their personal interests, instead others look for improvement. Navy and army have their rules and sometimes these are imposed following the instructions of the commander, mistakes here may cost lives and defeats. Those opposing wrong orders have no other choice than to follow them because mutiny is not an acceptable act and may bring severe punishment to those implied in it. The labyrinth of situations and behaviors is what you will admire from this film.However, reading carefully the life of the director, Edward Dmytryk, one may assert that with this film he wanted to justify his behavior during the period of the process for the so-called antiamerican activities. If you see the end of the film you may conclude that 'orders are to be followed and not to be argued', no matter if your boss is a mad man unable to give the correct orders or advice.",8,0,1,31 January 2009
Cast Away," A kind of modern Robinson Crusoe
","Tom Hanks once again performed very well his acting in this film. He certainly showed how difficult is the life for humans in areas where the so-called civilization did not yet arrive. At this point one should recall all what was taught at primary school to get fire, to feed himself, to sleep and to protect from rain and wind. He could not find any black Friday man as Crusoe did, instead he prepared a ball called Wilson as his only companion. Very strange that in that tropical island there were no mosquitoes or any other insects, at least he was not bothered by this problem, and the whale he found in the sea, was really very 'nice', funny to see this sequence. What happened to his wife, who thought he died, may also happen to many other wives of soldiers going to war. In fact, she is still in love of his first man, and she married just to forget about him, but not because she was really completely in love of the new husband.",8,7,11,5 June 2002
Cold Mountain," Civil war aftermath
","Any war brings disasters to any nation or territory. American civil war was not an exception of these calamities, and in my opinion, this is what the director Anthony Minghella wanted to emphasize in this drama starred by young Jude Law and backed by Nicole Kidman and always efficient Ren√©e Zellweger. The plot is about the love of a young couple, W.P. Inman (Law) and Ada Monroe, (N. Kidman). The first one had to go to the civil war where he was able to fight effectively and even saved the lives of some of his fellows. War was finished and he escaped from the hospital where he was recovering himself. At this point he had to overcome several serious difficulties in his way back home, he made it and found a situation of abuse by a group of gangs in his site. The couple finally decided to marry and start a new life, but the gangs once again frustrated this desire. The film is a good combination of suffering and love.",7,1,1,23 May 2004
North by Northwest," Hitchcock once again
","Cary Grant was certainly an excellent actor, he was able to lead some thrillers without loosing his acting humor, and 'North by Northwest' is an example. Interesting that the film starts with the presence of the director Hitchcock in its first scene. Then Cary Grant became for unknown reasons a man (spy) called Kaplan, he was kidnapped at the restaurant and brought to a big house where the punishment was to get him drunk with whiskey and then left driving a car in the evening. I have no intention to give the whole story of the plot, but you may guess that after these first scenes the rest was very much complicated and if you leave the screen you risk to loose the coherence of the film and not to understand all tricky reasons given by Hitchcock. Grant had a good partner in then beautiful Eva Marie Saint, and to a lesser extent from experienced James Mason. If you wish to see an interesting film, I advise you to see this one, another Hitchcock's jewel.",7,2,3,26 March 2005

Then she had to move living with his father, and starts studying at school where the attendants were mostly negros. There she felt in love with a black young man, who used to dance together with her.

","The comics have many heroes, the most famous Tarzan, Superman, Batman and Flash Gordon, the latter the only normal human because the others are people with super powers or with powerful modern means as Batman. These heroes were quite famous during the 40s and 50s, and the less popular was Spider man, a hybrid of Superman, Tarzan and Batman. This film has good special effects, helps to remember a bit of our childhood, good acting of Willem Dafoe, as usual, the villain of the film, but the plot gives nothing new if you are a fan of Superman or Batman.",7,0,0,14 September 2002
American History X," The story of a skinhead
","Economical and social problems are regularly associated in some societies, normally developed ones, to the presence of certain minorities, emigrants and people not belonging to the same ethnic prevailing in the country. It happened in Germany where nazis wanted to justify their problems with the increased richness of Jewish population,  and this film touches the problem in the context of US, when young and nearly ignorant young people start admiring Hitler's  ideology. A young very racist guy is taken to the prison after he killed two black men, who wanted to steal his car. One of the black was killed in a most violent manner. He is put in jail and there learned that he was completely wrong. The film has a lot of charge until its end, but I may ask, why such an end? There is no need for a happy end, but perhaps for something more coherent with the ideas the director seems to defend. Sorry, but the epilogue to me is bias.",8,0,1,16 December 2002
Ocean's Eleven," A remake of the film about how to rob modern casinos in Las Vegas
","This is just a film for entertainment with a whole bunch of famous (not necessarily all good) actors plus successful Julia Roberts. In the past there was a similar film starred by Sinatra, Dean Martin and other actors, this one is coming with sophisticated means for robbing the casinos, new tactics and some other modern elements, but the content is the same, i.e. the ways of robbing casinos belonging to Mr Terry Benedict acted by Andy Garcia, perhaps the best acting of this film together with the one of Brad Pitt. There is a good message at the end of the film and it is the love to his former wife put over the taken money by Mr Ocean (Clooney).  The rest is just amusement.",6,0,1,4 February 2002
Pearl Harbor," How USA entered into the 2nd World War
","Although the film showed a sentimental story of love triangle I see it more as valuable for the scenes related to the attack of Japan in Pearl Harbor and the events previous to it than for the sentimental story of those young persons. Pearl Harbor was a criminal act where the Japanese used all strategic weapons including the surprise factor. This is well shown in the film as well as the way the Japanese prepared and accomplished this aggression. Another aspects touched were that US hesitated to enter into the war while the allies like UK were already fighting against German nazis, that some experts in US were even able to guess the aggression of Pearl Harbor but not considered possible, the way president Roosevelt reacted to the aggression and the way he compelled his army to respond. From this point of view the film is highly valuable while the sentimental story is perhaps much better than the one shown in 'From here to eternity'.",7,1,2,28 December 2002
Legends of the Fall," Three brothers and one love
","Life is not linear, normally there are differences even among the closest relatives, and sometimes it may happen that what you want is also wanted by someone in your family, this is true. The parents, not purposely, may express more sympathy or predilection to one son than to another. The problem of Indians in USA, their discrimination, particularly in the past, is not new, and it is quite similar to the problems phased by black population there. So all these problems were correctly assembled by the director Edward Zwick. This is not another western or another drama, this is a good film with ingredients for thinking and analyzing the behavior of each person in its plot. Hopkins was excellent, Pitt did well too, but I think that Aidan Quinn acted better than the latter.",7,4,10,26 November 2002
Saving Private Ryan," A group of soldiers rescuing the last of Ryan Soldiers
","If someone doubts of the misery of a war, he/she should see this film. Scenes very realistic of how difficult for the allies (UK and US armies)was to get in Europe. Germans fought heavily and to the last man, they employed everything possible to contain the advancement of the enemies during the 2nd World War. The story showed the number of victims from each side, how scared many soldiers in both sides were, and also the discipline of those American soldiers who received the order to save the last Ryan. This film has high values of morale and Spielberg once again showed his class as an extraordinary director.",8,0,2,2 July 2002
The Pianist," The Story of a Jewish pianist during the II World War
","Tough, real and excellent film of the director Roman Polanski. The scenes of the film are very cruel and shows to what extent Nazis hated Jewish people and the suffering of those living in Warsaw, who were first restricted to ghetto completely fenced around, and later deported to other areas. The pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) was able to escape to this deportation owing to various Jewish persons who helped him. Finally he escaped from the workshop, where selected Jewish people were working under control of Nazis, and decided to hide himself. In this later part he got even the help from a Nazi officer who had the opportunity to appreciate the art of Szpilman playing the piano. The content is really good and historically precise. My personal appreciation to Polanski for a such film and to Brody for his excellent acting.",9,0,1,3 November 2002
Lawrence of Arabia," The hero of Arabia?
","I do not know whether the story of the film is true. Knowing the Arab people it is difficult to believe this plot, however, it is an extraordinary film about a person with his own personality, pride, willingness and intense feelings of love and hate. Peter O'Toole made his debut in this classic in an extraordinary way; his acting was excellent jointly with those of Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness and Omar Sharif. One of the best things the film revealed was the intention of French and British to occupy the whole Arab area occupied by Turkey once the first world war would have been over, and it happened in that way. Syria and Lebanon went for France while the rest remained in British possession. The film also illustrates that this whole area was Arab with several tribes without any concept of nationality, and there were no borders between the present territories of Jordan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and others. The borders were invented artificially later with the western occupation creating tiny nations, so you may guess why. Various historical and cultural ingredients make this film interesting. I must acknowledge that at certain point of the film I saw this Lawrence as a kind of Tarzan in the Arab world, but I do not know whether the story is a real one and if this Lt. Lawrence existed.",8,0,5,17 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Still trying to destroy the ring
","Here we have plenty of special effects, various battles against the evil's troops, most of them non humans and really nasty creatures, so more action and less thinking in the film. Obviously, this is part of a whole story, but if you compare this film with the first part you will agree with the fact that the first one had more content for thinking and/or meditation. One thing was clear to me and this was the message of peace given by the film and against those emperors always creating troubles, sometimes false ones, for provoking the wars. This happened during the Middle age, so let's hope that these events do not repeat at present in our planet Earth.",8,0,0,29 January 2003
Amadeus," Mozart, simply a genius
","Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was one of the most skilled composer and musician of all time. When he was only six years old he played for the Austrian Empress, later being still a child he played for the French and English royal families, and wrote his first symphonies. He had such an ear that he could remember any piece just listening once. In addition, Mozart's life was a real disorder, although his incomes were high he usually spent more than what he earned, he was also a heavy drunkard and liked to have fun with women other than his wife. I think that Mozart was a child who never matured. All these aspects of Mozart's life are well described in the film of the Czech director Milos Forman. Unfortunately the film concentrated more on Mozart's deeds in Vienna, and nothing was shown about his travel to Italy, where he wrote two operas. The unproven legend that Mozart was killed by Antonio Salieri was shown with some thoughts and ideas of the director and writer of the film. Up to date nobody can really assert that Salieri really poisoned Mozart, the only thing one may accept is that Salieri was really jealous of the extraordinary Mozart's skills, but to kill him is another story, a bit strange. The most shocking fact in the film, probably it is true, is that Mozart was buried in a common hole without any grave for him. Although with his disordered life he contributed to his poverty, such a genius just put in that hole is to me an injustice. The film has some polemic issues, but one must acknowledge that it is a sound work and an important contribution to make Mozart's life known.",8,1,2,26 January 2005
1917," '1917', another evidence of the miseries of wars
","When one hears a politician boasting of the armament that his country possesses, one claiming that he has the mother of weapons, the other the father, while some 'cockerels' of the third world are also doing nearly the same, those who do not solve food and housing and in the end they end up offering slogans with death as an inescapable promise, it is because those presidents or supposed courageous men have never been in war. The film '1917 (2019)' of British director Sam Mendes, based on the stories of a family predecessor who had the misfortune to participate in World War I, is a clear example of the number of lives lost in a war, the pains that cause in the families of the fallen ones and the economic damages that it causes. This film reflects the damage with many details, one of them is the hatred among rival soldiers, to the point of assaulting when they are doing you a favor of life or death. Dean-Charles Chapman and George MacKay, both managed to attract all the attention of the public throughout the film and their performance was such that they looked like the same soldiers on the battlefield. They managed to bring reality to the big screen. There were no foolish scenes of those vulgar war movies that show non-existent supermen in those confrontations. It is a quality film, with a real plot, well-designed fiction, and excellent photography.",9,7,12,28 January 2020
Million Dollar Baby," Is professional boxing a real sport?
","Since long time I am convinced of the need to prohibit men professional boxing, so for women it is much more obvious, and this film probably reflects much of our concern about this 'sport' managed and ruled often by gangs. I still remember the Tyson-Hollyfield match, where Tyson finished biting Hollyfield's ear, ridiculous and anti sport behavior, but Tyson after sometime started to box again. Professional boxing destroyed several valuable boxers, among them Joe Louis, Kid Gavilan and others. Often you have an invented champion like Benny Parets in the 50s, who at the end was killed in the ring in a match with Emile Griffith. Parets was never a real champion, he was just the bait for a big match with Griffith, who was much better than Parets. Here the film goes around a girl of a very humble origin, with a family nearly illiterate and a bit wild. She wanted to help their relatives working and boxing, but her family wanted all money earned by her without giving any service to her at all. She (Hilary Swank) was persistent in her intentions to become a boxer, and was good under the advice of his trainer (Clint Eastwood), and got nearly all victories in the ring except one. The film plot is interesting in general, but I am asking myself: what happened to that wild woman boxer who did not follow the rules of the fight? The film never said nothing about her final fate, probably she continued behaving herself as she was. In boxing the spectacle is much more important than the human's life, the rules are made to see bloodshed, people falling down after several punches and agonizing. There is no protection to the man, at the end if he/she dies, who cares? These constraints are well shown by the film, which could have gone deeper into this problem, but probably Eastwood preferred to show some insides of this 'game'. It is not the first film about the problem of professional boxing, but it's the first one including women. Good acting of Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, in fact both really were well awarded by their acting, Eastwood was also good but a little bit under the level of Swank and Freeman.",8,1,1,8 May 2005
Jerry Maguire," A promoter, his difficulties and achievements
","The film is not the best in acting, at least Cruise is not so nice in his performance. The plot is good and interesting, it touches some of the problems of the rich society, the difficulties to get through and the need to have someone who will popularize your person, no matter if you are not the best singer, the best sport man or scientist, the problem is to create good fame to start the game. Here, obviously the promoter plays an important role and Cruise (Maguire) tried to show what he did, how he was disappointed and how he overcame his crisis.",6,2,6,19 November 2001
For Love of the Game," Life and problems of a baseball pitcher star in the Major Leagues
","Kevin Costner is really a good fan of baseball. Acting here makes three the number of films on baseball where Costner acted, only equal to Charlie Sheen. The plot is really good, a pitcher who finds a lady and fell in love with her, but his love for baseball is often stronger than his love for the lady. The film passed while he is pitching a no hit against NY Yankees (never happened in the reality as far as I know) and at the same time he is remembering each step of his life and of his love for Jane. If you understand and love baseball you will not be disappointed to see such a film.",7,0,1,8 January 2002
The Insider," How poison is protected
","Nowadays nobody doubts that tobacco is harmful to health, but  still one finds plenty of brands of cigarettes available in the market, and many people smoking and not caring about the consequences of such a dangerous practice. The causes of such a behavior are many and this film touches one of them, proving how the companies manufacturing cigarettes try to protect their market of tobacco denying any scientific fact about the problems caused to human health. In addition, the film shows the common interests of some companies like Westinghouse, and the way CBS tried to hide a good evidence of the whole problem of tobacco market and consumption. One must acknowledge and appreciate the initiative and work of the director Michael Mann for conducting such an extraordinary film, and also good acting of Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer.",8,1,1,26 August 2003
Once Upon a Time in America," A masterpiece of mafia films
","This is not another film, this is simply a jewel very well done by its director Sergio Leone. The sequences go forth and back each time giving an idea of the lives of several boys-hooligans, who later became real gangsters. The scenarios were right ones at each time starting from early 1900 and ending at 70s of the 20th century. One must acknowledge that each detail was really taken into account for making such a film and that acting of De Niro, James Woods and several others was the best. This time De Niro is a cool-blood gangster while Woods shows himself with more temperament. De Niro also shows a kind of ethics in his behavior with regards to his colleagues, being a teenager he is the one able to kill another gangster or a policeman with a knife to revenge the murder of of his youngest colleagues and to go to jail for long time; when his best friend Max wants to accomplish a very risky robbery he calls the police to prevent him doing this non sense act, but his colleagues were not so friendly as he was, they were wolves in their business, something that Noodles (De Niro) understood late in his life. It is a long film, but once you start watching it you will not stop until its end.",9,3,7,29 December 2002
Selma," History is useful to be remembered
","Watching this film gives me the opportunity to think about the evolution of the society in USA. It is common to comment negatively about USA outside this country, but if we look carefully the film and the hard situations faced by Martin Luther King and his collaborators, you may conclude that USA has evolved a lot in five decades. This is not a praise, it is just a fact. Now USA has a black president, something that at that time nobody would have even dreamed. Fights of Luther King and his movement were productive, they may not be enough even now, the news coming of shooting black persons from time to time are still coming, but the reality is that this film is by itself a confirmation of healthy Martin Luther Kings' ideas. Personally I like to congratulate director-producers and cast of the film, and to ask them to produce more materials as this one, which may help not only Americans but those societies still trapped in discrimination.",9,0,1,26 April 2015
Eyes Wide Shut," Secrets of a wife and a husband
","One should conclude that this film was a kind of meditation from its director, Stanley Kubrick. Dialogues between Dr. William 'Bill' Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman) are extremely interesting for any couple. In a talk between both he asserted that he would not do anything with any other woman because he respects her, also because she is the mother of his daughter and he knows that she would not do either something wrong. She frankly told him that once she had an imagination of sex with another guy and that she did not do anything with him next day because the guy disappeared. This was the reason for Bill to find some new sexual emotions, probably to forget what his wife said about a sexual act that never happened and he imagined all time in his mind. One must admit that Kubrick had good imagination in the rest of the plot with some complications that brought back Bill to his family. The end of the film is also interesting when his wife concluded that the solution to all problems for both is to have more sex between them. The film has too many erotic scenes, a bit exaggerated in this aspect.",Null,0,0,3 February 2003
Some Like It Hot," An extraordinary and very funny comedy
","I do not remember how many times I have seen this comedy and each time I enjoy it. When I want to sit looking at a good film, 'Some like it hot' is a very good option. This comedy had real ingredients of the period of dry law in US, which gave a nice and reasonable plot. Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis were great, simply one of the best looking couple of the former cinema. George Raft acted in the role of gangster. I do not think that this role was difficult for Raft, someone that during the 50s was always working in nightclubs and casinos in Havana linked to the foreign and internal maffia at that time, so it was easy to him to do what he used to do in his real life. Pat O'Brien acted not as a priest as usual but as a good inspector-detective. But better than all this was the acting of Jack Lemmon and Joe E. Brown (whom we used to call 'Big mouth' or 'Bocasa' in Spanish), both gave the necessary ingredients to make this comedy one of the greatest of all time. The film is good from the beginning until the end, but certain scenes were simply the funniest, one of them when Curtis and Lemmon were having a chat with the nearly naked ladies in the train at night, the other one when Marilyn met Curtis in the yacht and Curtis showed falsely no feeling for kisses of Marilyn, but again the best came at the end when Lemmon told Brown that he was a man and Brown told him that it does not matter because nobody is perfect.",8,3,4,30 August 2003
The Untouchables," They were the best against Al Capone
","I have seen several times this film, and what I like most of it is the acting of Robert De Niro as Al Capone. De Niro here is simply the arrogant Italian mafia man, the way he talks the way he argues, he is simply the best. Acting of Sean Connery and Andy Garcia also convinced me a lot, one represented a honest policeman able to do his job day by day, and the other (Garc√≠a) was the young one who tries to demonstrate himself and everyone that he can do everything well. All these actors surpassed the acting of Costner, who was also good, but not at the level of the others mentioned. The film shows that any mafia organization to survive has to have good links with the local government and its institutions. Al Capone was able to establish these links and only when they were broken his empire started to collapse.",7,1,2,29 June 2003
A Beautiful Mind," The Story of John Forbes Nash Jr.
","Simply beautiful mind and beautiful film. My excuses to Mr. Denzel Washington, but Russell Crowe, in my modest opinion, have deserved to be the winner of 2002 OSCAR as best leading actor for this film. It was simply an extraordinary performance of Crowe. Take the film 'Gladiator' and compare to this one, and you will agree that nowadays Russell Crowe is among the best three outstanding actors of present days. He is so well as a scientist with an obsession and at the same time as a schizophrenic person. I have no words to qualify this film, my congratulations to Ron Howard and, obviously, to Crowe. This should be among the best 250 all-time films.",8,0,2,13 August 2002
Psycho," One of the best thrillers
","Hitchcock was a master of his art, and this thriller is an evidence of it. Again a good black and white film with an extraordinary plot starred by Anthony Perkins, who was perhaps the best actor in roles of mad or abnormal people in the world cinema. To this we should add the supporting roles played by then still beautiful Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam, Vera Miles and John Gavin. But again Perkins was simply excellent. We all were afraid without seeing the killer and until the end we supposed as real the existence of Norman Bates mother. A thriller is good when the end is unknown and even unsuspected by the public, and these requirements are well accomplished by Hichtcock.",8,1,2,19 April 2003
Love Actually," Love in England
","Good material for relax with a refreshing plot and a good cast of actors and actresses, among them Hugh Grant as a new Tony Blair, more critic and independent from USA; Billy Bob Thornton as the invasive US president who even wanted to steal the love of the primer Minister of UK; the always effective Liam Neeson and Emma Thompson, and many others. The plot consists of lives and behavior of various people in UK, from the head of the government to simple persons in this society and the ways each tries to celebrate Christmas. Not all is positive, a couple is also shown having a husband with false values always looking for other ladies and fun. For me the best of the film is the romance of Hugh Grant with his maid/secretary, it is funny the way they met for Christmas, and how he as Prime Minister was caught together with her.",7,0,2,4 April 2004
Ice Age," Italian animation of our pre-history
","An interesting animation about the fate of a giant tiger, a sloth, and a mammoth, who saved a baby, who was close to be killed by a group of  tigers during the ice age. The morale of the film shows that good behavior with the others may bring benefits at the end. One of the tigers in the group got an order to finally capture the baby, who was hardly saved by his mother when the tigers attacked her community. The baby was then rescued by the sloth and the mammoth, but the tiger joined them with the objective of finally taken away the baby. They went through very troublesome paths with plenty of danger, and at once the tiger was to fall down and saved by the mammoth. At the end the group of tigers tried to capture the baby but the mammoth helped incredibly by his tiger colleague was able to overcome this attack and to give the baby back to his father and the community to which he belongs.",7,0,0,5 September 2002
Joker," Joker, villain or victim of a system?
","I still remember Jack Nicholson playing the role of Joker in 'Batman (1989)', and supposed that probably the film has something to do with Batman again. Wrong, this is a different film with another approach, where Batman is absent better to say, is nearby. Joker is a clown, of the many that one could find in Times Square in New York, He made a living by making people laugh, sometimes even with his own misfortunes. The film tries to explain or justify Joker¬¥s antisocial behavior or his aversion to the high bourgeois character, Thomas Wayne, that is Bruce's father, aka Batman as an adult. It is the society that exploits and pays them with crumbs, so it is not just Arthur Fleck (Joker), there are many more discontents and those who want to exterminate everything that oppresses them. The film makes you think and reflect of the situation where this people try to survive. Joaquin Phoenyx's performance as Joker is very convincing, as he is repulsive, disgusting, hateful, everything the director and screenwriter tried to reflect with his performance",8,2,4,28 January 2020
Man on Fire," Good but excessive violence
","The plot is relevant nowadays when gangs are operating freely in several Latin American countries, but the film contains too much violence and scenes of torture. Denzel Washington appears here as a hard man, ex- CIA agent, who knows how to kill and to get the right answers using any abusive method. Everything goes around that explosive area of Juarez-El Paso, where certainly violence occurs very often and kidnapping is a job. The film shows well how corrupted is the police, something that seems to be common in that site. At the end police, lawyers, and even the father of the little girl were all involved in kidnapping an innocent for getting a heavy ransom. The director Tony Scott, in addition to the excess of violence, used some camera movements very unpleasant to my eyes. Those persons beside me also criticized this 'innovation'. The film is worth to be seen, but it has these deficiencies.",6,1,2,29 November 2005
The Last King of Scotland," Amin Dada, the Ugandan dictator
","It is always a good entertainment to learn about history in films. In this case, the film is about the dictatorship of Amid Dada in Uganda during the 70s. I did not read the novel written by Giles Foden, on which the film is based, so it is difficult to assert that all historical events are real. However, the plot has been conformed in a way that gives an idea of the personality of this dictator and his similarities with others existing and in power at present in other countries. Demagogic, populist giving false promises; a lier to justify his misdeeds, eccentric, these are the main characteristics of several dictators in the so-called developing world, and Amin Dada is another one in the long list of these caudillos, thirsty of power to the extent that they become worse than absolute monarchs. When things start to move not in the desired direction, they become mad and discharge all mistakes on his subordinates. The film could have shown a bit more about the thoughts of the dictator, and related events that compelled him to become a criminal or to kill more than 100 000 people in Uganda. Amin Dada could not become such a killer just because he had the opposition of the supporters of Milton Obote, the president against whom he committed the coup d'etat. There must be other reasons, which are not seen along the film. For somebody not knowing a bit of the history, it would be impossible to understand the metamorphosis of Dada. The film shows nothing about his Islamic believes and practices as such. Therefore this material should be taken just as a story of what Dada was, but not a real description of the problem he and his misgovernment created in Uganda.It is necessary to acknowledge the excellent job of Forest Whitaker playing the role of Amin Dada. Physically he is similar to the dictator; and his movement and gestures were excellent. The rest of the cast did also a good job, particularly those African or Africa-origin guys who played as minions of Amin Dada, the doctor (James McAvoy) and nice Kerry Washington. The photographs of Kampala were good in general although Lake Victoria was only shown once or twice. Local music was also nice.",6,0,1,13 June 2007
The Green Mile," Adaptation of Stephen King's novel
","Prisons are miserable places in many cases, but the Green Mile could be the exception. Most of the guards on death row leading up to the execution were conscious of their mandate and behave accordingly with their prisoners. The exception was the stupid guy of Percy Wetmore (played well by Doug Hutchison), who really complicated the lives of the guards with his usual foolish approach to everything. The story should be based in many legends about power of some black people to foresee the future and to cure some health problems. This power is believed to come from gods in the case of Yoruba (Nigeria) belief, so Michael Clarke Duncan as John Coffey, wrongly accused of murdering two children, became a kind of 'god' in the prison. One of the things that shocked me was the way the electric chair was used early 20th Century. The film was able to give many details, perhaps, for convincing you that this type of execution is not justice and that prison should be more an area for rehabilitation and not only for punishing human beings.",8,0,1,18 February 2003
The Reader," Cruel and real
","Life is not a perfect line, people make mistakes and progress. Some do think they are doing the right thing when in fact everything is wrong. This is quite often in systems under dictatorships, where the people have no right to think and to express freely their opinion. Huge mass follows what the leader is saying and some try to do his/her best for the ideas delivered by the leader. This story is about that, a person who thought to be a hero when in fact she was a monster, an illiterate monster. The plot was well conceived and the film was interesting from its beginning. The acting of Kate Winslet here was much better, in my personal opinion, than in Titanic. She was cruel and real. David Kross as young Michael Berg was also excellent showing naivety together with his thirst as a youngster with enough power to satisfy his female. The evolution of the film is unexpected, and adult Michael became a cult and discreet man with hidden suffering. Stephen Daldry, the director of the film, chose an uncommon plot and an excellent cast for a film, which is a good example that there are many real stories worth to be shown in cinema, and may serve for educating the people, particularly the young one.",8,0,1,22 May 2012
Platoon," A film for promoting peace
","One of the best films ever done in Hollywood is Platoon, which I consider more a film for peace than a war one. It shows well the cruelty of this past confrontation in Vietnam, the miseries of both rivals, the lack of morale in some of the soldiers and officers, some of them coming from poor layers of the American society. The plot is very consistent and achieves what it aims. Today (December 2002) it has not lost its lessons, new generations have still a lot to learn watching this film. In addition of the excellent work of the director Oliver Stone, it is also important to acknowledge the serious work of Willen Dafoe, Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen, perhaps in his best performance. Fighting scenes were conducted very accurately, sometimes one may feel that you are inside them and risking also your life. The environment was the typical tropical one, vegetation, landscape, etc.",9,1,2,12 December 2002
Blow," A real story of Cocaine in USA
","The film is a historical evidence and a lesson for those who tried to live smoothly without trying to work cleanly. George Jung (Johnny Depp) was an intelligent man who never liked to work in a decent environment. He first started distributing and selling marihuana and then cocaine in close contact with the Colombian gangster Pablo Escobar. Although the content of the film is excellent, Ray Liotta is too young to play the role of Jung's father while it is somewhat difficult to understand the behavior of Jung's mother, she never tried to help his son, but the contrary. Penelop√É¬© Cruz does not convince anyone with her simple acting.",7,0,1,9 December 2002
Any Given Sunday," American Football championship between Dallas and Miami
","American Football is less popular than basketball outside USA, but when you see this film you feel that for the Americans this pastime is as important for them as baseball and basketball. In the past there was a mediocre film acted by Heston about the same topic. Now this new film came made by masterful Oliver Stone, so good film maker is a sign of quality. Unfortunately this film is not the case, the sequences are designed in the same way as the former Heston's film and it is difficult to follow, moreover if your understanding of this sport is limited. Al Pacino never looked to be a sportsman or a trainer in his own life, although we should admit that he acted well as the trainer of Miami. Dennis Quaid played a very modest role and Cameron Diaz tried but not succeeded. Charlton Heston again played a very modest role, an insignificant one. James Wood, always wanted in Stone's cast, did his job well although modest. However, the message of the film is good and is there, i.e. no matter if players are deadly hurt they must play until they are killed or become unable (blind or anything else) to play, money is the main issue in this professional sport, the man and his family no matter.",5,0,0,27 October 2001
The Sixth Sense," A boy who sees the phantoms

He was only 11 years old when he played the role of a boy able to see and to talk to the dead people and, obviously, to see more than any other mortal. Being able to communicate with the spirits he knew what really happened in the past. The film is very suggestive, but Bruce Willis did not put enough strength on it, his acting was normal, and far to be of the same level as Haley Joel. The film, although unreal, is suggestive and invites for (unreal?) thinking in such possibilities.",6,2,3,17 October 2002
Rear Window," A wheelchair man spies his neighbors
","This is another good thriller of Hitchcock. James Stewart, as usual, was the selection as a leading actor together with the then nice Grace Kelly, always efficient supporting actress Thelma Ritter, a solid acting of Wendell Corey, and the villain Raymond Burr, who later in his career became the famous actor of the detective Perry Mason. The best is that the thriller does not show any particular violent scenes until its end when the wheelchair journalist (Stewart) was caught in his activities by the guilty man (Burr). Notwithstanding with this, the film keeps you always awaiting for a final discovery of the supposed killer. So watching the film you have entertainment, you may see the people's life of 50s, and you enjoy with the plot of the thriller. Film-makers should see how Hitchcock did to delight everyone with a really simple plot.",7,3,5,15 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Good in its special effects
","Commenting the first part of this novel I said that it was a real message for peace, but I cannot assert the same for this final one . Although technically this film is one of the best in its special effects, it has too many battles which make it sometimes boring, battle after battle with no space to think or to relax. It also amazed me to see that the villain of this story, i.e. Christopher Lee disappeared with no explanation. I was unsuccessfully looking for him in the film, but later learned that even the same Lee is now arguing for the exclusion of his scenes from this film. Why such a exclusion? It is a real mystery. One can guest more or less the rest of the plot, the good boys winning over the evil. In fact the end of the film is like a poem, Frodo has to go to a kind of a sweet death leaving Sam sad. This scene is certainly unexpected and makes you think that death is fatal but can be welcome when good doing has taken place. In any case, my criticism here does not demerit the success of the whole serial of these three films, but the third one should have been the best and it was not.",7,5,10,27 February 2004
Heat," Fight of two character men
","An interesting thriller, it has two good ingredients, acting of excellent Italo-American actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. It is delightful to see both 'Mafia- Godfather' actors together. Here Pacino is a policeman while De Niro is a thief. The director, Michael Mann did very well when he left enough spaces for each of them in his own role to show his problems and feelings. Pacino is tough, but with good feelings, obviously always with the obsession to capture any guilty man, in this case De Niro, no matter how and when. De Niro is a criminal, but not a vulgar one, he has some literacy and is able to love a beautiful lady. The best scene of the film is the direct dialogue Pacino- De Niro had in a cafeteria and how both politely explain their intentions. The end of the film is a bit bias, nobody will try to make justice if he/she knows that police is behind you. These last scenes remind me a bit the Western films, with a duel where the good kills the bad one.",7,0,0,19 November 2002
The Thin Red Line," A Story of Guadalcanal's battle during the 2nd World War
","Good to see how the soldiers feel during difficult battles with an enemy ready to do anything to possible to get a final win. The merit of the film is that it shows different personalities during the battle, an officer very busy with his subordinates, another higher one thirsty of win, other soldiers in a near panic, others showing their solidarity to support the action. In general, the message of the film is good and although dealing with war, it is a real antiwar film. Good acting from many good actors, particularly Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson and James Caviezel.",7,0,0,3 June 2002
Gangs of New York," 19th Century gangs of New York
","A good effort of Martin Scorsese to bring us back to the reality of 19th Century in New York city, where the values were already lost at that time. Usual fights among the 'natives' with the Irish, Polish and other emigrants plus, obviously, black population were shown all over the film. This is a drama combined with action, where the butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) is the perfect villain while the young man Amsterdam (DiCaprio)is coming back to his town to revenge his father's death. Actually the plot is not complicated and it goes directly to the end all expect, but the most important aspect of the film is to see how New York was developing already at that time and how difficult was to live for all those emigrants who worked hard and may not see after their contribution. At certain point of the film it reminded me the novel 'The Jungle' of Upton Sinclair, which reveals the suffering of many emigrants in US. DiCaprio did his best but not at the same level when he starred 'Titanic' (1997) while Cameron Diaz showed that she can also work and develop herself in dramas. Day Lewis was simply excellent in his role as the villain of the film.",7,0,0,29 September 2003
Braveheart," Hero of the Scots
","It is good to see materials that enhance your culture and knowledge of history, and this is the case with this film about William Wallace, a Scotish patriot of the 13th Century who was able to unite most of his people in the fight for the independence of Scotland. The film directed and starred by Mel Gibson has too many violent scenes, one may say that this is the mode of Gibson, but historically the film goes well. It is seen when William's father is killed and also his young wife by the English soldiers, the fights uniting Scots, some of them wealthy and susceptible to betray. The battle of Falkirk is an example of betrayal by those Scots looking for their personal profits and less interested in the sovereignty of their country. This battle was practically the end of Wallace. Although he hid himself for a while he was captured, brought to London, where he was tried, convicted and executed (the history said that this happened in 1305). One of the things I am not sure is that the son of princess Isabelle (Sophie Marceau) was really a product of her relations with Wallace. In any case, the film is interesting and exciting from the beginning till its end.",8,0,1,24 January 2005
The Godfather," Life of Mafia in New York
","Probably I have seen this film 3-4 times and always enjoyed it. The merit of the film is obviously its plot, but the director Coppola did an excellent work to unite several good actors/actresses in this production. Al Pacino was starting at that time, and he did superb work as Michael, James Caan showed his abilities as Sony, Robert Duvall and Marlon Brando were excellent as usual, while Diane Keaton and Talia Shire did what was required from them. The film goes from New York to Sicily then back to New York, it certainly made the small village of Corleone very famous, many tourists coming from America may ignore the existence of Greek ruins in several parts of the island, particularly in the town Agrigento, but they do know that Corleone is there. Another admirable aspect of the film is that those actors representing Italians of Italo-Americans talk either in English, in Italian and even in Sicilian dialect. It is not my intention to describe the plot of the film here, but it shows that each of the families has an affective feeling to its relatives but is cruel at the time of punishment, no matter if it is a relative or not.",9,1,3,15 October 2004
