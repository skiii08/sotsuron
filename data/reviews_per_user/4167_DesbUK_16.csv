Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Why is the young Darth Vader an all American moppet called Ani
","First of the Star Wars prequels released in 1999 with much anticipation and a resulting chorus of disappointment.THE PHANTOM MENACE isn't an awful movie (ATTACK OF THE CLONES is much worse) - it's perfectly watchable, but cold and unemotional. George Lucas can't really write an interesting story or dialogue or create mood and tension or direct actors. Lucas's forte is visual effects. The film suffers from too many computer generated characters - including Jar Jar Binks, of whom I couldn't understand a word of what he said. And why is the young Darth Vader an all-American child moppet called 'Ani' rather than a dysfunctional delinquent?The film has three climaxes all going on simultaneously, the result being like flicking between TV channels at random. It's as noisy, destructive and uninvolving as a computer game. When the villain Darth Maul is killed, the emotional response is zero since he barely registered as a character.On a positive note, the film is spectacular and technically wonderful, especially during the Ben Hur-like race around Tatooine. I only wish those effects had been put to better use.",4,4,7,26 March 2011
The English Patient," Anthony Minghella's most famous film is worth re-watching
","The unexpected death of the English film director and screenwriter Anthony Minghella in March 2008 prompted me to re-watch his greatest triumph on DVD again. It's a curious film which has as many detractors as admirers. 'The English Patient' was released in 1996 and won nine Oscars (including Best Director for Minghella) and six British Academy Awards (including Best Adapted Screenplay for Minghella).Filmed on location in Italy and Tunisia, with a mostly British cast (Ralph Fiennes, Kristin Scott Thomas, Colin Firth, Naveen Andrews, Julian Wadham, Kevin Whatley) plus the French Juliette Binoche and the American William Dafoe - 'The English Patient' confirms Minghella as the most literary and romantic of English filmmakers - his movies are considerably distanced from any kind of reality. Often compared to David Lean, this film mixes elements of 'Brief Encounter' (adultery accompanied by classical piano concertos) and 'Lawrence of Arabia' (a passion for the desert). John Seale's camera and Stuart Craig's quite remarkable production design conjure up two remote and distant worlds. The first is the North African deserts in 1938/39, where Count Almasy (Fiennes) and the English couple Geoffrey and Katherine Clifton (Firth and Thomas) are members of the International Sand Club, a group of explorers mapping the desert. Almasy begins an ill-fated affair with Clifton's wife.In 1945, Almasy is the anonymous 'English patient', bed-ridden and disfigured by an air crash. He spends his days in an abandoned Italian monastery being cared for by a French Canadian nurse called Hana (Binoche). Also there is a morphine addicted allied spy called Carravagio (Dafoe) and two British Army bomb disposal men (Andrews and Whatley). The monastery gives a sense of an awkward end of World-War 2 meeting point of various races and nationalities: Eastern European, Canadian, Sikh and British.But this description affords Minghella's screenplay a linear clarity which isn't there. We constantly cut between the North African and Cairo of 1938/39 and the Italy of 1945. The late 30s become a place of Almasy's memories, where he retreats to in his final frail dying days. The opening and closing shots of the film are both the same - Almasy's final flight in a bi-plane containing Katherine's body. Geoffrey - grief stricken by the knowledge of his wife's betrayal - tried to kill the three of them by crashing his bi-plane. Almasy had to leave the injured Katherine a desert cave whilst he walked across the desert for help. Eventually, all he can do is give the German army the maps of the desert in exchange for a bi-plane to go and rescue Katherine. She is, of course, long dead.Best of all, Minghella brings consistently good performances from the entire cast. Twentieth Century Fox didn't want Kristin Scott Thomas for the Katherine role in The English Patient - they wanted Demi Moore. And without her, Fox withdrew from the film (it was eventually financed by Miramax). Minghella's loyalty to Scott Thomas was not only rewarded by her Oscar and BAFTA nominations, but by the fact it's impossible to imagine very many actresses conveying Katherine's luminous beauty and intelligence in the same way - it makes us understand why her husband Geoffrey (Colin Firth) would kill himself on becoming so engulfed with grief and jealousy on discovering her affair with Almasy. Is she England's most beautiful actress? There's an astonishing scene when we see her full frontal nude getting out of a bath - a thirty-something blonde just oozing sex and charm. It's hard not to feel saddened when she dies alone in the desert cave.'The English Patient' is a complex novel and Minghella's adaptation of the book is a version of it. Give the same book to, say, Ronald Harwood or Christopher Hampton, and a very different adaptation might emerge. It's hard not to still admire Minghella's screen craft as a director, even when you're bored and confused by the leaps in time. He includes a gripping set-piece of Kip attempting to defuse a bomb beneath a bridge which threatens to be detonated by rumble of on-coming Allied tanks. He handles the period atmosphere quite magnificently, the atmosphere of worn and war-torn oldness in 1945, of stillness, space and heat in the monastery and desert, something which gives these characters a chance to speak, to be heard, to emote in their own space - all without distraction. The atmosphere so engulfs you that upon emerging from the viewing you feel you're emerging back into reality.",8,4,6,1 April 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The best Le Carre adaptation since Smiley's People.
","The period of 1973/1974 is very much Britain's darkest post war days: IRA terrorism, inflation, strikes, football hooliganism, police corruption. And on top of all this the Cold War cast its dark nuclear shadow over everything. It was the age of decline and pessimism. John Le Carre's 1974 novel TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is a book very much reflective of the nation's post-war decline.Now, the novel has been turned into a major British film by Thomas Alfredson and is the best Le Carre adaptation since the BBC's SMILEY'S PEOPLE back in 1982. Central to the film's success is quite wonderful production design which evokes the era of 73/74 with remarkable precision, particularly the low-tech London HQ of the Circus (Le Carre's name for MI6)- a pre-digital world of dial telephones, shelves full of paper files, reel to reel tape recorders, cine film all housed in a large warehouse type building where the main conference room is a sound proofed portakabin.Head of the Circus is Control (John Hurt). When a mission in Budapest to uncover a Soviet mole in the Circus is blown and the agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) shot and captured, Control and his aide George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are forced into retirement. However, the months pass and Smiley is called upon by the Home Office - there really is a Mole in British Intelligence. They now know this via an AWOL Circus operative called Ricky Tarr (Tom Hardy) whose affair with Irina - the wife of a Russian agent in Istanbul - leads to him learning about the Soviet infiltration. However, as soon as he alerts London his message is intercepted, his senior murdered and Irina kidnapped and shipped to Moscow and killed.The film is very complex and key events told through a series of flashbacks. Yet it's full of 'moments' which lodge in the mind. We see something I've not seen on screen before - a British Intelligence Christmas party with all the key personnel attending. It's also full of wonderful performances such as Kathy Bates in a marvellous scene as ex- intelligence analyst Connie Sachs and Benedict Cumberbatch as Peter Guillame, Smiley's man on the inside. However, they key role of Bill Haydon (Colin Firth) is surprisingly underwritten. The end of the movie feels rushed. At the centre of it all is a commanding piece of screen acting by Gary Oldman as Smiley. He never speaks for the first 15 minutes of so of the film and it's a quiet and restrained performance. At one point he delivers a monologue to Guillame about how he once met his Russian opposite number and nemesis Karla and it holds your attention for the sheer force of acting. This is Oldman's tour-de-force confirming him as one of the great British actors of our generation.",9,0,1,4 February 2012
Notting Hill," The least interesting of the Richard Curtis/Hugh Grant trilogy.
","In its day (1999), the most successful British film ever. NOTTING HILL arrived in cinemas and on video in 1999 as the follow up to FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL: it featuring the same star (Hugh Grant), producers and screenwriter (Richard Curtis). The director this time is Roger Michell. It's the weakest of Curtis's trilogy of Hugh Grant/London comedies (the other being LOVE ACTUALLY).Grant plays William, a modest London bookseller who falls in love with Hollywood goddess Anna (Julia Roberts, really playing a version of herself) currently working in the capital. A better movie might have been made about the relationship between Grant his scruffy lodger Spike (Rhys Ifans) - a sort of contemporary odd couple since Spike steals every scene he appears in. Instead, we get a predictably clean, summertime and glossy London that is purged of any parochial references the Americans might not understand. When the film fails to interest us, it is kept alive by a good supporting cast including Gina Mckee, Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville. Best moment is a coup-de-cinema where the passage of six months is evoked by a single tracking shot of William walking through a street market whilst the climate turns from sun to rain to snow to sun and a pregnant woman at the start of the shot is a mother at the end of it. It's a quite wonderful and utterly cinematic moment in a film which is never more than acceptable from a screenplay designed to appeal and charm.",5,2,5,16 March 2011
The Killing Fields," A Cambodian Holocaust
","Whilst the war in Vietnam has produced dozens of Hollywood movies about that conflict, THE KILLING FIELDS remains the only film about the side show conflict in Cambodia and its consequences. Perhaps more unusually - and what few American viewers of this film realise - is that THE KILLING FIELDS is an entirely British production: written, produced and directed by English filmmakers with an entirely British production team on location in Thailand and funded largely in the UK and not Hollywood. The film, released 22 years ago now, won 3 Oscars and eight British Academy Awards (including Best Picture).For that reason THE KILLING FIELDS - at least visually - rarely resembles a Hollywood studio product. Chris Menges' cinematography shoots in drab colour and uses what appears to be natural light. Roland Joffe's direction is documentary-like, always realistic and never over blown; and Bruce Robinson's screenplay avoids sentimentality and cliché.The film takes place in Cambodia between 1973 and 1979 and focuses on the American journalist Syndey Schanberg (Sam Waterston) and his interpreter Dith Pran (Dr Haing S. Nor, a real life survivor of the atrocities depicted in the film). The initially scenes are slow - Schanberg and Pran finding a Cambodian village accidentally bombed by the USAAF. The centre of the film is the fall of Cambodia and Schanberg, Pran and the other Western Journalists' decision to stay behind. Pran saves their lives when they are captured by the Khmer Rouge and they subsequently hide in the French Embassy. Pran - as a Cambodian - must be handed over to the Khmer Rouge.The final third of the film accounts the Cambodian holocaust, which is pure 1984, full of purges of the past and whole hearted obedience to the Party. Pran survives a rural labour camp and flees to Thailand, eventually being reunited with Schanberg in 1979.The best sequence involves the attempts to get a photo of Pran so he can use it in a British passport and not be handed over to the Khmer Rouge (the ruse fails). The film never uses subtitles, so when long sequences are in Cambodian (such as when Pran negotiates the lives of the journalists) we are simply confused and don't know what is going on. Also, Robinson's screenplay never really develops any of the supporting characters - and Schanberg himself, despite a sincere performance from Waterston, is something of a one note grim character. The film is often slow and uninvolving when it should be tense and dramatic, and Mike Oldfield's score is simply awful.So the KILLING FIELDS is a mixed experience. But despite these flaws, it remains a superior and important movie, well-made technically, but flawed dramatically.",7,1,3,12 February 2006
The Shining," Brilliant cinematography and production design
","American exile in England Stanley Kubrick shot all of his films in England from LOLITA in 1962 to EYES WIDE SHUT in 1998. Here was a man who created New York on a Pinewood back-lot (EYES WIDE SHUT), 1970 Vietnam on the Isle of Dogs (FULL METAL JACKET), the Pentagon War Room at Shepperton Studios (DR STRANGELOVE) and prehistoric Earth and the solar system at MGM Borehamwood (2001).The Overlook Hotel exists nowhere other than on the sound stages of Elstree between 1978 and 1979, where Kubrick filmed the whole movie. It's to this remote and very large American hotel that husband and wife Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall (and son) arrive to caretake for the winter shutdown. Jack goes mad, sees ghosts and eventually tries to murder his wife and child - only to end up frozen in the snow covered outdoor maze.Whilst everyone eulogises Kubrick's fine direction, the real strengths of the film are Roy Walker's production design and John Alcott's remarkable cinematography. All of the sets are huge and empty - the corridors, the lounge, the ballroom suggesting a hotel in winter hibernation. They're all brightly lit by Alcott, forgoing the cliché that horror best works in darkness.Nicholson's overacting in the later scenes and the lack of much humanity in Kubrick's screenplay are perhaps the two flaws in a film which still stands up well 31 years after its release. Two scenes stand out: the haunting image of Nicholson striding across the ballroom floor and it's full of the ghosts of 1921; and the final chase through the eerie and beautiful snow-covered floodlit maze.David Thomson, in his Biographical Dictionary of Film, calls THE SHINING 'Kubrick's one great film'. Nowadays regarded as a classic of its kind, back in 1980 it failed to receive a single Oscar or BAFTA nomination.",8,0,1,7 April 2011
Control," Reminds me of 'This Sporting Life'
","The story of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis is closer in style to 'This Sporting Life' than '24 Hour Party People'(one of my all-time favourite films). Anton Corbijn's film recalls that English socialist realist style of the early 1960s, with it's black and white cinematography and drab North of England setting. In Lindsay Anderson's film, Frank Machin escaped the dead end of a miner's life via Rugby League. Here, Curtis escapes the tedium of being an adviser at a Labour Exchnage in the 1970s via rock music. There's nothing in the film to suggest that Curtis - who committed suicide in 1980 - was a particular interesting character let alone an interesting subject for a feature film. In his film debut, Sam Riley has the impossible task of recreating Curtis. Often he seems vacant rather than enigmatic. Yet he's a handsome presence and does all his own singing, which adds to the feeling of authenticity. The film holds our attention when his wife Debbie is at the centre of the film. She's played by Samantha Morton, who goes from sweet teenage schoolgirl to sad-eyed wife with remarkable conviction. As an actress, Morton just gets better and better with each role.",5,0,1,17 March 2008
Quantum of Solace," James Bond is Back in Action.
","'Quantum of Solace' opens oddly in the middle of a scene - a destructive high speed car chase along the Italian coast, all burning tyres, crashes and bullets. This is James Bond (Danial Craig) delivering the chief baddie Mr White to an MI6 safe house in Sienna. The problem here is that since the film does not re-cap the final scene of 'Casino Royale' (Bond tracking down Mr White to his Italian castle and shooting him in the leg), then unless you're familiar with the previous film, you'll be baffled as to what is going on.The credits are the best ever for a Bond film, and they're followed by a breathtaking and dangerous looking chase through the sewers and across the roofs - Bond chasing M's bodyguard, who, it transpires, is a double-agent. It concludes with them crashing through a glass ceiling and fighting for their guns on collapsing scaffolding.'Quantum of Solace' strips Bond of the iconography which defines the series: no Bond theme until the end, no gadgets (other than a nifty table in M's London office), no 'The name's Bond, James Bond', no Q and Moneypenny and the gunbarrell logo rather pointlessly appears at the end of the film.The film also is hindered by the dullest scheme ever by a Bond villain - a plot to control Bolivia's water supply!! Whilst the MI5 heroes of the BBC's 'Spooks' week in and week out save Britain from cyber attacks, nuclear bombs, germ warfare, it hard to care about whether Domonic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) succeeds in becoming a public utility supplier. The film's attitude to world affairs is curious too - the baddies aren't the FSB or the Iranians or any of the obvious candidates, but a SPECTRE-like crime syndicate who, in the words of Mr White, 'have people everywhere' and hold a meeting during an outdoor production of 'Tosca'.And yet, the whole film moves at such a breathless pace between Europe, Hiati and Bolivia that it's always enjoyable. Craig is a hard as nails Bond and the best 007 to date; Olga Kurylenko as tanned and gorgeous as the avenging Camille and Judi Dench has a much expanded role as a globe trotting M.But the reason people watch these films are the succession of set pieces and here they're delivered superbly: a speedboat chase: a plane chase: Bond and Camille jumping out of a plane with only one parachute between them and a climactic fight with Greene in an exploding hotel out in the desert. The chief baddie Mr White escapes and, like Blofeld back in the 1960s, will no doubt re-surface in the next adventure. The producers have constantly re-invented Bond throughout the decades to keep the films fresh and interesting. On the evidence the series has a lot of life left in it.",8,2,7,14 December 2008
The Pianist," Good, but not Great.
","'The Pianist' is a very much a European film of the Holocaust: shot on location in Poland by a Polish director, French producers from a screenplay by an English writer, the film uses American (Adrian Brody), German (Thomas Kretchsmann) and English (Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emelia Fox)actors in the principal roles. These polyglot productions productions rarely work, yet 'The Pianist' is a rare exception. However, it never achieve the levels of cinematic tour de force that 'Schindler's List'did. Polanski's direction is restrained and often rather plain.'The Pianist' of the title is Szpilsman (Brody), a middle class Polish Jew who plays concert music on Polish radio before the German invasion. The film is told through Szpilsman's eyes as his family are moved from their home into the Warsaw ghetto, then are deported to certain death at a concentration camp. Through the last minute actions of a friend - one of the Jewish police - Szpilsman is yanked from the row of people being herded onto the train and flees back into the Ghetto.Later, he escapes the ghetto and lives, variously, in empty flats and an abandoned hospital, becoming a bearded, rather bizarre and solitary figure - like the last man alive in a post-holocaust world.The budget restraints are evident in the film. The uprising in the Warswaw ghetto is seen entirely through the window of Szpilsman's flat and is represented by a handful of Germans firing at buildings and what looks like a few CGI shots of the burning ghetto. This is perhaps one of the flaws of Polanski's direction - it has no moment equally to the stunning clearing of the Cracow ghetto scene in 'Schindler's List'.On the other hand, Brody is excellent in a demanding role as the increasingly isolated Szpilsman. Much of his role in the second half of the movie is wordless, and in one scene, he actually conveys an emotional release by miming playing the piano (later, he does it for real in the prescene of a sympathetic German officer - it is the first time in years he has played for real). There's no false 'watch-me' mannerisms of the method school here, and no sentimentality - so Brody's character seems all the more believable.The other strength is Ronald Harwood's screenplay. Harwood underplays the Nazi barbarism - there are a few random executions and Szpilsman Senior is beaten up for walking on a pavement - to good effect. He also conveys the idea that music remains a civilizing influence even when around it looks like the world is ending. It keeps Szpilsman human when everything suggests he should be dehumanized by his experiences.",7,2,4,6 February 2006
Black Hawk Down," A very American war story directed by an Englishman
","I've been watching this movie and its accompanying extras on DVD this week for the first time and I thought is ironic that this very American war story should be directed and produced by an Englishman (Ridley Scott) and have a large number of British actors cast as the American servicemen (Ewan McGregor, Jasson Issacs, Hugh Dancy, Euan Bremner, Orlando Bloom.) I suppose it's the equivalent of Steven Spielberg directing a film about the Battle of Goose Green during the Falklands War and casting Americans as members of the Parachute Regiment.Scott's movie is quite brave in that it has no major stars and no central character (unlike, say Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or Mel Gibson in WHEN WE WERE SOLDIERS). It's also largely free of the clichés of the genre: no soaring John Williams score accompanying shots of the flag fluttering in the sunlight; no scenes of the families back home. Instead its all about the logistics and the absolute horror of battle. This is the best combat footage since ZULU way back in 1964, a film which it resembles. In Scott's commentary description words, it is 'Anti-War but pro-military'.",8,147,184,19 March 2005
Pride & Prejudice," A Regency Rom Com.
","PRIDE AND PREJUCIE is a lovely English movie that is immaculately written,shot and acted. It takes Jane Austen's 18th century novel and turns it into a Regency Rom Com for a 21st Century audience. The plot revolves around the Bennett household in the late 18th century English countryside. Women had no role in that society then other than as wives and mothers. So the Bennet girls need husbands -particularly the headstrong and independent Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly). The story charts her relationship with Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFaddyen), who seems initially humourless and unapproachable - but also very rich. The film opens on sunrise and twittering blackbirds in the English countryside and from then on the English countryside has never been this beautiful since FAR FROM THE MADDENING CROWD (It was shot entirely on location at various stately homes and houses in Kent, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, with no studio work)The other standout are the performances, which are uniformly good. Even the small roles - check out the way Tom Hollander makes the most of every moment as Reverend Collins. But at the centre is Kiera Knightly, who illuminates the screen like no other actress since Gwyneth Paltrow first appeared in EMMA, a decade ago.The cinematography, art direction and costumes are exquisite. Best of all, Joe Wright's direction feels confidently cinematic (look at the use of a Steadcam shot capturing moments at the ball). The film is lighter and more cinematic than Ang Lee's soporific 1995 SENSE AND SENSIBILITY (which got by on good acting and a charming script).",8,2,4,18 February 2006
A Clockwork Orange," A very British grimness
","A CLOCKWORK ORANGE was made by Stanley Kubrick in England during1970/71. It debuted in the USA in December 1971 and in Britain the following month. After over a year on release, it was eventually withdrawn from UK distribution by Kubrick and was never re-issued or shown on TV or released on video.Not until March 2000 did A CLOCKWORK ORANGE reappear on British screens (following Kubrick's death), released from it's cinematic exile and glowing in bright colours as good as it had been in 1971. However, the film's futuristic vision nowadays resembles an alternative version of the 1970s (something British viewers of a certain age will recognise). It's a very British grimness with it's drab flats, ugly prisons and concrete housing estates.The film's depiction of sex and violence seems restrained compared to those other two notorious British films of 1971 - THE DEVILS and GET CARTER. In fact, there is only one on screen death and that's committed by Malcolm Macdowell as Alex wearing a large rubber nose, a bowler hat, a white boiler suit and a cod piece (his murder weapon is a giant penis sculpture).The look and sound of this film never diminish, with its claustrophobic interiors and a startling use of music: listen to Purcell's Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary over the titles or Rossini's Thieving Magpie used to accompany a night of gang fights and joy riding. The film is set in a London terrorised by hooligans like the surprisingly articulate Alex and his idiot droogs. The opening half hour comprises of the beating up of a tramp, a gang fight, a joy ride, a burglary and a rape. When Alex later gets his comeuppance for murder, the route out of prison is a new form of aversion therapy advocated by the Home Secretary (Anthony Sharp, every inch the suave upper class 1970s Tory). With his eyes prized open Alex is forced to watch endless sex and violence on screen, having being injected so that he feels nauseous and near to death whenever the impulse to sex and violence kicks in. In the end, his 'cure' is a reversion to a helpless state which means on the outside he becomes a victim of the various people he has wronged.But the films concludes with Alex being readjusted back to his normal state, a moment brilliantly realised with Beethoven's Ninth on the soundtrack and a fantasy of Alex having sex in public: 'I was cured alright' he says. Cue Gene Kelly's 'Singing in the Rain'.Today, the other thing which will distress a viewer is Patrick Magee's very bad acting but you'll be exhilarated on so many levels. It's a film far from everyone's taste and I'm not altogether how seriously we're meant to take it.",8,0,1,21 March 2011
The Queen," The Best British Film of 2006
","The most acclaimed British film of 2006 - it won the British Academy Award for Best Film and the Academy Award for Best Actress - The Queen is quite remarkable in that it is only the second time the living monarch has been portrayed on screen and the first time a serving Prime Minister has been portrayed in a feature film (discounting comic cameos from Margaret Thatcher in 'For Your Eyes Only' and 'Water'). Essentially, a modern day 'Mrs Brown' (another film about how the Royal Family coped with a Royal death and how the Prime Minister helped the Queen overcome public unpopularity), it provides compelling account of the week Princess Diana died in September 1997. The Royal Family stay put in Balmoral, cut off and remote and treating the death as a purely private family matter (the Queen initially refuses Charles use of the Royal flight to fly to Paris in the early hours of the Sunday morning of Diana's death). Meanwhile, in London, Prime Minister Tony Blair (a totally convincing Michael Sheen) is in the thick of public grief and instantly sees that the Queen's aloofness is damaging the monarchy. Peter Morgan's screenplay throws up revelations: the phrase 'people's princess' was Alastair Campbell's, scribbled down on hearing of Diana's death; the TV broadcast made by the Queen on the day before Diana's funeral was Tony Blair's idea; and, according to Morgan, Prince Charles was very much on Blair's side.I loved everything about this film, especially's Mirren's performance that is neither caricature or impersonation. Mirren gets under the skin of a difficult role - someone everyone knows as a public person yet know little about in terms of the private person. Alex Jennings makes a sympathetic Prince Charles.Stephen Frears' spot-on direction never hits a false note. The film should be essential viewing on each anniversary of Diana's death.",10,0,1,10 March 2009
Casino Royale," Not a Family-Friendly Bond
","CASINO ROYALE is everywhere in the UK at the moment, from Lottery Scratchcards to BBC4 to it's premiere on the front page of up and downmarket newspapers. And every critic appears to be raving about the film. CASINO ROYALE - which is the first Bond film in 4 years - pulls off the trick of appealing both to fans of the films, Ian Fleming purists and non-Bond audiences.But this isn't so much the return of James Bond but his relaunch and reinvention. Though the director, writers and production team are all veterans of the series, CASINO ROYALE doesn't really remind you of the previous 20 films. The opening pre-credits adventure is abandoned in favour of a brief prologue in Prague showing Bond confronting (and killing) an MI6 traitor, cross-cut with him beating up and killing another anonymous villain in a bathroom. There's no real reason for it all to be shot in black and white, is there?So, instead of a pre-credits adventure we get a post-credits chase in Madagasscar  Bond pursuing a free-jumping bomb-maker on foot, up cranes and ending with a shoot out in an embassy. It's as dangerous looking as it is thrilling to watch. And, in general, the action sequences are breathtaking edge of the seat stuff. This isn't a family friendly Bond though  it's the only film in which 007 almost dies (he has a cardiac arrest after being poisoned during the poker game) and the torture sequence of a naked Bond being beat on the testicles with a knotted rope rules the movie out getting any Christmas afternoon/Bank Holiday Monday showings on ITV. Other liberties are taken  no Q or Miss Moneypenny and no Bond theme until the closing credits. This is Bond's first mission. The first half of the movie is the invention of the writers, with Bond moving from Africa to London to the Bahamas and Miami, chasing terrorists. The second half of the movie reverts to Ian Fleming's 1953 novel: paired with treasury agent Vesper Lynd, Bond must ruin the terrorist financier Le Chiffe over the poker table at an Eastern European casino.Daniel Craig is agile and physical in the role of the novice 00 agent  he gets cut, scarred and bleeds. It's a tribute to his impressive performance that I couldn't imagine Pierce Brosnan in the role. Rather cleverly, he doesn't get to deliver the line 'The name's Bond, James Bond' (which was Connery, Lazenby and Dalton's first line in their debut Bond films) until the very end of the film. Cue Monty Norman's classic theme and the hope we don't have to wait another 4 years for Bond 22.",8,0,2,18 November 2006
Atonement," The Best British Film of 2007
","Winner of the 2007 BAFTA and Golden Globe for Best Film, 'Atonement' has an opening 45 minutes which recalls the 'The Go-Between' - a hot English summer and lust between the lower and upper classes. Robbie (James McAvoy) is the gardener and Cecilia (Kiera Knightley) is the daughter of the household. A grabbed moment of lust in the library is witnessed by Cecilia's 13-year old sister Briony (Saorise Ronan) and, when another young girl is molested, Briony falsely accuses Robbie. At this point the film becomes an essay on the beastliness of the English upper classes - particularly Benedict Cumberbatch's total cad - and there is a sadness that prevails throughout the story of Robbie and Cecilia's ruined lives. Robbie goes to prison and is released in 1940 to fight with the British Expeditory Force in France. He and Cecilia have one more meeting over tea.In lesser hands, the story could have been clunky and dated - but Joe Wright has a young, cinematic eye and he's helped by one of the best adaptors of difficult material in the business (Christopher Hampton). There's a terrific sequence set on the beach at Dunkirk, with the stranded British army waiting for evacuation that's a triumph of Steadicam operation, music score and Sarah Greenwood's production design, which suggests an army defeated and disorganised - there's everything from an abandoned boat to a funfair on the beach. The sequence - all a single tracking shot following Robbie - is astonishingly moving.Back in London, Briony (now 18 and played by Romola Garari) becomes a nurse and is haunted by her dishonesty. And herein is the film's only flaw: the penultimate scene of Briony visiting Robbie and Cecilia and seeking a chance to make amends for what she's done. It turns out to be the invention of the adult Briony (Vanessa Redgrave), a chapter in her final novel. The real Robbie and Cecilia had died in 1940 and this is the only way she could she could gain atonement for what she's done. But it's an implausible ending that sabotages the finale - like a 'It was all dream' revelation or a false flashback.Nevertheless, a sterling film, impeccably acted by every member of the cast and one that demands and rewards more than one viewing.",9,4,6,17 March 2008
V for Vendetta," England Prevails
","'V for Vendetta' is set a near future London which, in appearance, is not so different from today - except this is a brutal totalitarian dictatorship where the secret police break down doors in the middle of the night, put black bags over their suspects' heads and then drag them off - never to be seen again.This society is ruled over by the grim ageing face of High Chancellor Strutter (John Hurt), who is only ever seen on giant TV screens. The nemesis of this regime is an anonymous terrorist called V (Hugo Weaving), who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and begins the film by blowing up the Old Bailey, then declares he will do the same to Parliament on November 5th. Unwittingly involved with him are the TV PA Evy (Natalie Portman) - who V saves from being raped by two police thugs - and pursuing him is the downbeat but decent police inspector Finch (Stephen Rea).The movie has its origins as an Alan Moore graphic novel, but it also recalls those other dystopian classics like 1984, BRAZIL and FATHERLAND, especially the latter with Finch uncovering a dark secret hidden by the state - the germ warfare attack which lead to Strutter's rise was engineered by Strutter's party and that V was the only survivor of the same biological experiments. As well as being scary and creepy, satirical elements feature prominently. I like Roger Allam's manic right-wing TV pundit who ends his nightly rants with the blessing 'England prevails'. Also Stephen Fry as a gay chat show host who satirises Strutter in a Benny Hill-type sketch and subsequently disappears after a visit by the secret police.Amidst the bleakness, there is hope. V turns Strutter's own Police Chief (a nasty Tim Piggot Smith) against the Chancellor, followed by a mass public uprising on November 5th with the citizens of London descending on Parliament wearing Guy Fawkes masks. V dies, but Evy places his body in a tube train loaded with explosives and sends it hurtling towards Parliament.If 1984 was a projection of 1940s fears, then V FOR VENDETTA is a projection onto an imagined future of early 21st century fears about the erosion of civil liberties. Curiously - like CHILDREN OF MEN - in this future England has survived but the United States has ceased to exist (it's now the world's biggest leper colony).",Null,2,4,26 March 2011
