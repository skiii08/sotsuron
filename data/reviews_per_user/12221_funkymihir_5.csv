Source Code," Wow!!! Better than Inception and loved it
","This hurtling high-concept thriller confirms director Duncan Jones (Moon) as the great white hope of cinematic sci-fi. After blacking out in Afghanistan, a U.S. fighter pilot (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakes inside the body of another man on a Chicago commuter train, and eight minutes later, when a terrorist bomb rips the train apart, he awakes again to find himself in a sort of control pod, communicating by monitor with a crisp national security officer (Vera Farmiga). What's happened is that the feds have recovered the brain of one of the bombing victims, which retains its last eight minutes of sense memory, and are sending the pilot back into those eight minutes again and again to track down the bomber. None of this makes any sense if you think about it, but the idea is so much fun that thinking about it may be your last impulse. With Michelle Monaghan and Jeffrey Wright.",9,0,1,21 June 2011
Batman Begins," terrific!!!!!!!!!!!
","first i watched it on the hall in noida then it fulfilled my expectations i thought what a film,excellent!!!!! . good work by the actors. this film shows the deeper side of batman and how was he created. lot of action and twists. may be the best batman film ever, just grab a DVD from the nearest store and watch it with your family, friends or alone. u will like it a lot and if you are a dc comic fan you will just love it. it's better than superman returns and better than any dc comics movie so just watch it and love it. some people may not like who just hates films which have violence or action in them but if you like action movies watch it even somebody who likes action movies but does not have a knowledge about batman will also like it . But of course now the dark knight is much better than this movie, both of the movies are pretty great. Chris Nolan rocks",8,1,2,13 January 2008
Kick-Ass," Kick ass=total fun+total action
","WOW!!!!!!!!!!! SAW IT on the DVD and it was blitzkrieg. The first scenes were a little boring but after kick-ass gets his ass-kicked it gets a whole lot better. hit-girl is great and so is Nicholas Cage as Big Daddy. Aaron Johnson was great in nowhere boy and loved him even here specially at last scene where he blasts D'amico through the window and the best scene was when hit girl comes and kills the bad guys when they are about to burn kick ass and big daddy. Even red mist was very funny, his acting was good and his last line of the film 'Wait,until they get a load of me' was a great touch. and his new orange costume looked great. now i am eagerly waiting for the next part balls to the walls. hope it is better than the first one and really hope that hit-girl teaches kick ass some kung fu so he does not get his ass kicked all the time.",8,2,5,25 June 2010
The Dark Knight," u gotta be a fool to miss it
","so what do you guys think, huh! that all batman movies will be crappy like batman forever but chris Nolan proved that batman is back and will compete with the spider man movies after batman begins. but he took the whole batman movie to the next level through this movie. the thing is that it has a plot and not like other superhero stories where the plot is weak and only action is the main base. heath ledger is the best and even Christian bale is rocking. of course we can't forget Aaron Eckhart for his role as Harvey dent and his one liner'you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain'. i suggest u guys please watch it because it is one of the greatest superhero movies ever. enjoy it thoroughly",9,2,5,7 February 2010
Fast Five," Wow!!!! So much better than the other films, justin lin really stepped it up a notch
","It's been 10 years since The Fast and the Furious power-slid into theaters trailed by mixed reviews but an overwhelmingly positive reaction from fans. Future installments, especially 2 Fast 2 Furious​ and Tokyo Drift​, were panned by critics but (in spite of mostly nonsensical plots and sub-par acting) the films continued to bring in big bucks for Universal -- delivering the same over-the-top action sequences grounded in illegal street-racing culture that fans had come to expect. Now, director Justin Lin is once again stepping behind the wheel of another Fast and Furious film (side note: he directed Tokyo Drift as well as Fast & Furious) with Fast Five. The film not only stars the fan-favorite pairing of Dominic Toretto​ (Vin Diesel​) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker​), but also brings back a number of familiar faces from prior installments – as well as introducing hell-hath-no-fury DSS agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) into the mix. However, saddled with so many personalities in one film, does Fast Five still deliver high-octane action and an engaging story? Fans of prior installments will be pleased to hear that Fast Five is probably the biggest and most over-the-top film in The Fast and Furious franchise. It's not likely to win over many audience members who didn't see any of the earlier films but, for anyone who likes muscle cars, beautiful women, and heist films, Fast Five delivers plenty of pulse-pounding moments.",Null,0,1,23 August 2011
