Airlift," Uplifts Indian cinema standard
","Director Mr. Raja Krishna Menon work is superb. You feel yourself in to the screen. Story is inspired by real incident. It is OK. Screenplay makes its interesting by adding so many good and balanced plot, like introducing Kuwaiti girl and its culmination, one scene of secretary with his father, telling him about pain of migration, which triggers him to take the matters personally, track of irritating George etc. Credit goes to screenplay writers Ritesh Shah, Suresh Nair, Director himself and Rahul Nangia . Dialogues by Ritesh Shah, are real and impactful. Transformation of characters are very good, like a hardcore businessman to an extra emotional human being of main character. Productions design by Mustafa Staionwala needs to be applauded. Film looks so real and then great work by Director of photography, Priya Seth, to capture it perfectly. It could have been brutal but makers kept it very balanced. One scene where lead actor scuffles with Iraqi soldiers is a note above but its culmination again makes it worth clapping. Performance wise Akhshay Kumar is fantabulous. He is just amazing in every scene, especially in emotional ones. Nimraut Kaur as Amrita is OK. She had a good scene but it was just OK performance by her. Inaamul Haq as Iraqi Major Khalaf Bin Zayd, is first rate. He had gone deep into character that its hard to believe that he is an Indian. His balanced greed in eyes and accent make his character believable. Kumud Mishra as secretary Sanjeev Kohli is impressive. Purab Kohli as Abraham makes his presence felt. Ajay Arya Singh as Akshay kumar first driver is fine in his brief role. Feryana Wazheir as Kuwaiti girl, Tasneem looks innocent as the requirement of character. There was least scope for music but when it comes gives the much needed relief and boosts the pace. Credit goes to music directors Ankit Tiwari and Amaan Malik.",7,37,68,21 January 2016
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," An extra ordinary journey of an ordinary person
","Director Mr. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra deserves a standing ovation for selecting and justifying this biopic of Milkha Singh. This type of movie can inspire a generation. Director was so indulged in the film that rather making a film he was just living it. His approach towards every scene is very balanced. Movie length is 3.20 hours but you won't regret for spending this much of time. Even, you enter in film with biased opinion to hate it, slowly movie opens it arms to embrace you and eventually you have to fall in love with it. Screenplay and dialogues by Prasoon Joshi is too good. He has given minute details of the characters very well. When, Milkha Singh prior coaches come to convince him to go to Pakistan, that time he was a rich person, his servant comes with the tea tray but he prefers to make tea by himself and he knows well that how much sugar his coaches prefer. This scene reflects his modesty, honesty and respect without speaking a word. There are so many scenes of this caliber. Dialogues are very balanced, sweet and inspiring. Few of them are ' Unche Udne Wale Parindon Ko Chhote Chhote Darakhton Se Dil Nahi Lagana Chahiye......Main Aapki insult nahi kar raha hun ji, Bas Khud Se Lad Raha Hun...Wahan KI hawa Mein Mere Apno Ke Khoon Mile Hue Hain, main unme sans nahi le paunga'. There was least scope for humor but it is blended with right intensity at right place. Performance wise Farhan Akhter is mesmerizing. This is not acting; it is simply transforming yourself in to the character. Simply awesome. The boy who played, young Milka Singh is amazing. He looks so innocent and fierce. Sonam Kapoor looks adorable. Divya Datta is mind blowing. She can make your eyes moist so many times, with her expression only, without speaking words. Pawan Malhotra as his first coach is very good. Prakash Raji is fine. Music by Sankar Ehsan Loy is completely blended with mood of film. It gives proper pace to film when it requires. This type of films make me proud to be part of this industry. Hats off to complete team of this film.",9,11,19,12 July 2013
Life of Pi," Magnificent version of Discovery channel's popular series 'I shouldn't be alive'
","Watched 'LIFE OF PI' Movie is good. Story is based on a novel by Yann Martel with same name and is unique. Screenplay by David Magee is very good, dialogues are fine and they support movie very well. Screenplay has the typical essence of Hollywood. Everything has been plotted very well. First they shown the hurdle then use it afterward. Very realistic approach. Tiger is after all a tiger. Less of emotions and more of violence. Even they justify it in climax in very touching way. Credit must go to the director Mr. Ang Lee. There is good message beneath the entertainment that never ever lose hope. They touch the religion based God issue in very light but sensible way. VFX is seamless. It is hard to differentiate between the real scene and VFX. Now with the help of VFX it is possible to show the impossible. Performance wise the young PI, played by Suraj Sharma is very good. Irrfan Khan and Tabu are fine. Adil Hussain as PI father is also good. After all watch at least once.",7,3,11,23 November 2012
Dangal," Ultimate triumph
","Director Mr. Nitesh Tiwari work is so brilliant that after few minutes, you just forget that you are watching film. You simply start witnessing the journey of Phogat's family. Makers are so confident that they have even given credit for story idea to Divya Rao, which reflects their honesty. She is not in writing team but gets her due credit. There are four writers, Director himself, Piyush Gupta, Shreyas Jain and Nikhil Mehrotra and their work is fantastic. Screenplay is seamless and very balanced with much needed freshness. Film starts with glimpse of Mahavir Singh Phogat's passion for wrestling, while watching and challenging another district level arrogant winner, while commentary comes over on them which is fresh. When that person gets defeated he says 'Tumne district level pehlawan ko haraya hai' Then Mahavir Singh replies ' Tension mat le, tum national level champion se hare ho'. Words may be a bit different but meaning was same. Which gives strong idea that what level of dialogues you are going to listen and they have maintained the graph. Dialogues just nourish your senses, inducing correct emotions. A simple scene where protagonist massages feet of his sleeping daughter, clearly reflects that he is just not a ruthless coach but a caring father too. Girls curse their father in front of their friend who is getting married, then that girl emotional words about her feeling towards their caring father is very cute, emotional and enough to make girls realize that what they are taking for granted. Best part of this film is it's continues ascending graph in every aspect. First half is cute, funny with subtle dose of emotions. Second half takes this graph to the horizon. Full of emotions, either it is of defeat, victory or relations. Another major plus point is the way they have shown wrestling. I dint know a bit of it but I enjoyed all wrestling matches like it was my favorite game and that is major chunk of film. Hats off to the team behind wresting choreography .Though you have basic idea of film happenings but still they kept you engrossed by presentation. Climax comes with a very strong message that one can train you but only you have to implement the techniques, which makes you true winner and enriches self confident. Performance makes you thunderstruck. Words can not justify or compliment, Amir Khan's performance as Mahavir Singh Phogat. Zaira Waseem as younger Geeta is brilliant. She is so good that when Fatima Sana Sheikh takes over as grown up Geeta, you miss younger one but soon Fatima proves that she has taken the graph far ahead. Same happens with younger Babita played by Suhani Bhatnagar and grown up by Sanya Malhotra. Skashi Tanwar as wife of Mahavir Singh is very good. Girish Kulkarni , who had played coach is superb, you do hate his character but love his performance. Actor, who played younger cousin of Geeta and even grown up one, both actors are cute and endearing. Kudos to casting director Mukesh Chhabra and team. Music by Pritam and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya, are integral part of this film. Without any formulated track you just enjoy every song and your eyes get mois in one too.",10,86,131,22 December 2016
M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story," He has been impressing on field, now his story impresses on screen
","Director Mr. Neeraj Pandey work is very good. He chose the up to date way of narrating this story by designing continuous shots taking rather that choosing conventional and beaten way of long, mid and close . This new style was much needed for this sports drama film. This way you get the correct feel of on screen happenings but in starting half an hour camera work doesn't support director's vision well. It gets blurred while panning and soft while moving but after that it is almost good. Story is based on M.S.Dhoni real life so nothing to say about it. Screenplay by Director himself and Arun Jha is very good. They have never gone overboard or tried to dramatize the scenes unnecessary. There are so many cute and crisp scenes, like Dhoni talking on disconnected telephone and even this scene has a good culmination ahead. Another major plus point of this film is its unusual but sweet love scenes, like the intro of Priyanka, Dhoni first love interest, then intro of Sakshi, both scenes are too good. Sakshi talking to her roommate is also appropriate and cute, establishing and taking forward her character when Dhoni says that I knew you wouldn't come alone to meet me. This film has very strong emotional quotient too and after long time rain in emotional scenes didn't irritate me. Dialogues are very good. The way Khadagpur railway officer Mr. Ganguly, a very fine actor, describes aspects of life to Dhoni as reference of cricket is outstanding. Editing needs to be especially mentioned. Editor Mr Shree Narayan Singh has delivered a fine and seamless work. The way of blending the real footage and reel one is just amazing. Without showing all the stalwarts on screen you never feel that they are not present. All shots are so quick. Credit goes to Director too for his vision. Without taking any names in some disputed angle they ably make you understand everything. This film is full of performance surprises. Credit goes to casting director Vicky Sadana. Sushant Singh Rajput is mind blowing. You have to pay extra attention that he is not real Dhoni. He has not done this by imitating but adding fine dimension to his character so you think that if real one would be in this situation. He would have reacted in same way. Disha Patani as Priyanka is very endearing and acts well too. Kiara Advani as Sakshi is very good. She shines in an emotional scene. There are lots of great actors too. Anupam Kher (Father), Mother (good actress), Bhumika Chawla( Sister), Rajesh Sharma (Sports teacher Banerjee), Kumud Mishra (Coal mines officer), all are pitch perfect. Actors in role of his friends are also very good, like Kranti Prakash Jha as Santosh, Chittu shows his caliber in the scene when he conveys the sad news to Dhoni over phone. Actor who played Sardar ji is also perfect. Music by Amaal Mallik, goes well with film but lyrically all tracks are heavy. Manoj Muntanshir's lyric Like Mukhda 'Mal De Suraj Ke Munh Par Malai, Burbak Badal Par Kar De Chadhai', I liked it but Antra becomes preachy. I missed some simple lyrical melodious tracks, which scope was in film.",8,17,31,30 September 2016
Sultan," This movie has some moments
","As director Mr. Ali Abbas Zafar work is good. As a writer his story is good, screenplay is routine and dialogues are average. First half is very slow and lengthy. Love scenes are just routine. Sultan rising as a top wrestler from a common guy, does not looks very exciting in first half, even world wresting championship match looks very hurried. Film starts taking grip in second half especially after Sultan first Pro Tech free style fight. Choreography of all these matches are core strength of movie, especially first and second match. The reason behind husband wife rift should have been established well then emotional quotient will be of high order. It looks something missing in it. A girl, whose dream was just to win medal in international match, then she shifts her dreams happily towards his husband after getting pregnant but when an incident happened just mainly due to medical complexity but she totally accuses his husband for this because he was not with her when he was out of India and fighting word championship. He even wins gold medal. In climax fight the way glimpses of Sultan comes in front of him as if he is fighting with his ego and negativity which leads to victory is good. Performance wise Salman Khan as Sultan is very good even in few emotional scenes. Anushka Sharma is good. Actor who played, Govind, Sultan's friend is impressive. He is balanced throughout his performance. Randeep Hooda is fine. Amit Sadh as Aakash is OK. Music by Vishal-Shekhar and lyrics by Irshad Kamil, are good. 'Jag Ghoomya Tere Jaisa Na Koi' is very melodious while 'Baby Ko Bass Pasand Hai' is peppy one.",6,19,41,6 July 2016
Happy New Year," Premature Happy New Year wish
","The major drawback of this film is its length. 3 Hours is too much when you don't have any super brilliant script. This type of product comes when Director is over obsessed with product. There were lots of scopes to trim it but they didn't prefer. When, You have to glorify the star rather than the character such type of things happen. Comedy punches are OK types. Story is old. Screenplay is routine. Dialogues by Mayur Puri, are good at places. You frequently get derailed that what is the main plot of this movie. How they culminated the climax, that is too kiddies. If you want to make a brainless comedy then how can you choose a heist as a main plot? It should be sensible but this is the least thing in this movie. There were lots of questions which are unanswered, like If one buy a security system from someone else then why should he keep the same password, which is one of main struggle in climax. Is it too difficult to distinguish the difference between real brick wall and a replica, for a Police!!? How can you call the son of a business tycoon via landline or intercom? There is only one answer to all question that they has taken the audience for granted. Performance wise Shah Rukh Khan is fine. Deepika Padukone is exceptionally good and stands out among all actors. Boman Irani and Abhishek Bachchan are good. Music by Vishal Shekhar is OK type. 'Manwa Lage' is melodious.",5,14,35,24 October 2014
