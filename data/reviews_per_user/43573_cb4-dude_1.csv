Resident Evil: Afterlife," Hot Chicks, Big guns, Explosions... Do you really need to say more?
","In the last couple of weeks, I re-watched the series of these movies. If you rated any below an 8, then shooting, explosions, and blowing the heads of the Undead is really not your type of movie. Just stick to 50 first dates and you will be fine.I am pretty sure these movies are guy movies. I am not sure a woman could like these to the same extent, and if you are a woman and do, CALL ME!!! HA HA.Of course they don't have a masterpiece of a story line, of course they stretch reality. THAT IS WHAT A GOOD ACTION MOVIE DOES!!! HELLO!! It is 97 minutes of entertainment. That's it. You don't get lost thinking about the plot or nuances in the plot. You sit back and watch this attractive leading lady avoid getting chomped on by flesh hungry mutants. Come on people, they aren't shooting for an Oscar here. If you want that, find something else to watch that is probably dull, boring, and quite pretentious.So grab a beer, a bag of chips and turn up that damn surround sound for a hell of an entertaining movie!!",8,2,6,29 January 2011
