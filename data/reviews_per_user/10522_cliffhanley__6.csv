Walk the Line," lust, guilt and body language over dialogue
","James Mangold is a rarity in American 'studio' cinema: he is not interested in sticking to one category or genre; the director of 'Girl, Interrupted' might not be expected to voluntarily make the biography of a pop star. The Johnny Cash story, though, is well-stocked with the stuff of Gothic legend and that ole dichotomy of lust and guilt that has informed the work of the blues and western greats from Charlie Patton through Robert Johnson and Hank Williams toJohnny Cash. Mangold is pretty adept at exploring the dark undercurrents whatever his subject. The wide screen was made for the kind of shots cameraman Phedon Papamichael sets up here - there really is a camera language which is not quite the same as that used in medium-width frames, and he is especially fluent. The Memphis of the 'fifties, fat big automobiles and the air heavily moist with music, is lovingly recreated, and the vignettes of rock 'n' roll taking shape will make most of us who were born after 1950 feel an aching regret at not having been older, just as today's young rock bands keep trying to redo the 'sixties they never knew. Joaquin Phoenix has joined the top league on the strength of his performance, going from playful and innocent to bloody dangerous, and he has a better voice than Cash, actually - and we should not be surprised to see Reese Witherspoon's first album out soon. She can cut the mustard. One major problem with this film for non-American audiences is the dialogue. There are many long scenes consisting of nothing but talk, or even half-whispering, where we can't help wondering, 'What on Earth are they talking about?' Sometimes, only sometimes, we can guess from watching the subsequent action. There have been letters in the press from British cinema-goers, begging for subtitles in US films, but only notably since 'Walk the Line' came out, although it is by no means the first film to meet with incomprehension away from home. Bound to boost DVD sales! CLIFF HANLEY",6,0,1,5 March 2006
Once," Like the best songs
","The story of this little film, made on a budget of fifty quid, apparently, (most of the crew were doing it as a favour) is the stuff of film itself. One of the few prints made was playing at little cinemas round Ireland as a double bill with the two stars in performance, who then sold as many CDs as possible at each gig. This was 'big time'; until, at least, the film was shown at the Dublin Film Festival, and one of the Sundance Festival committee members happened to wander in while on holiday, saw it, fell for it, and took it home to Sundance, where it won a big gong. In a step further away from 'real life', the lead's band found themselves opening for Bob Dylan. I can imagine it: 'Uh, hi. This is Bob' 'Bob who?'Glen Hansard, front man of The Frames for 17 years and 'the guitarist' in The Commitments was approached by Carney after a Frames gig in Dublin in 2005, with an idea about building a story around some songs. And in fact, the film remains true to that idea: a few times, the guy, instead of speaking to the girl, picks up his battered guitar and croons, or yells, an 'impromptu' verse. So in a way, it's as much a traditional musical as an Elvis vehicle. None of the gloss of Hollywood production in this, though, and everyone was playing a version of themselves with only the most rudimentary idea of a script, or a good deal of improvising. That can have its drawbacks: the two central characters are so natural that they sometimes seem to forget to include the camera when talking, so much of their dialogue is lost, especially in the street scenes.The Guy is working in his father's hoover repair shop and busking on the side, while nursing a broken heart after his girl ran off to London. The Girl is a Czech immigrant with a little girl, a mother to support and a fighting spirit. They are obviously wrong for each other, but their little orbits keep colliding, and they make beautiful music. Literally. Others play their parts - fellow musicians, the bank manager, but it's a tale of loving and longing which never really finishes. Just like the best songs. CLIFF HANLEY",6,4,7,13 October 2007
The White Ribbon," A beguiling 'trojan horse' full of deep unease
","The White Ribbon is the latest from that master of creepy unease, Michael Haneke. But where Funny Games and Hidden were very much set in the urban present, this takes place in a vanished world, an Austrian farming village just before World War One.The village is dominated by three men, the unlovable Baron, the despicable doctor and the convincingly monstrous village minister. They are surrounded by a web of apathy, malice, brutality and envy. As the Baron's wife said! But in the midst of all this innocence blossoms, as the narrator, the young schoolteacher, falls in love with the even younger nanny in the big house.It's been shot in colour and printed in near monochrome, making each shot as worthy of framing as in any film-noir, and it benefits from the richness and subtlety of texture you'll only get with colour. Added to that is the sheer intensity of the story telling, beyond Ingmar Bergman at his least stagey. There are hardly any extras; half of the characters get to be fully dimensional, and there is never any sense of acting. In this sternly protestant village they are all trying to keep their emotions buried but we, the fly on the wall, get to see the subtle signals in their faces.The village is galvanised by a series of mysterious accidents and crimes, and these dramatic incidents link the whole thing together, but it's the fascination the camera has in these people that will hold your attention. It loves them all, the utterly vile as much as the sweet and tender. The White Ribbon is bookended by the longest fade-in and fade-out ever, and it felt just right at the end as we had been buried so deep in this other world.",Null,2,7,14 November 2009
Control," Signalling a Kitchen-Sink revival?
","Anton Corbijn polished his craft as a stills photographer, and this film's greatest strength lies in its visual quality. Nearly all of it works as a series of animated stills. It certainly could not have done so well in colour: the director's experience shooting in mono for the music press (the 'inkies'), including of course the real-life Joy Division, and his professed admiration for early Ken Loach films, especially 'Kes', comes through clearly.Michael Winterbottom has already covered a little part of the Ian Curtis story in '24 Hour Party People', including his suicide when 23. Matt Greenhalgh has said he was sorry to have missed the opportunity to write the script for it. As he is a Manchester guy he was the director's and producer Orian William's popular choice to write the screenplay for this one. The curious link here is that Craig Parkinson, who plays impresario Tony Wilson, the central figure in 'Party People', looks more like his impersonator Steve Coogan than the man himself, who, although he died before this film was finished, co-produced it with Curtis' widow Deborah. Toby Kebbell, truly unrecognisable from 'Dead Man's Shoes', puts so much meat into his portrayal of the band's manager, incidentally, that it's possible to re-imagine the whole saga being told from his point-of view, as some kind of very black comedy.Much is made of the extraordinary contrast between musicians' day-jobs and rock 'n' roll stage personas: Curtis worked, neatly brushed and keen, in an employment exchange until the sun went down and he made his dreams of Gothic, sci-fi and beat poet imagery come alive on stage. Sam Riley has been touted as a 'non-actor' (another nod to Loach) but he handles the Jekyll and Hyde task very well. The gig scenes are convincingly handled, (something Antonioni, for instance, made such a mush of in 'Blow-Up') although a brief appearance by John Cooper Clarke the 'punk poet', playing his much younger self, just about blows everything else off the stage. Curtis got married young, to a local girl (Samantha Morton in yet another sublime disguise) but fell for Annik (Alexandra Maria Lara), a skinny and dangerous Other Woman from Belgium. It was being torn between these two beauties that inspired his most famous song, and combined with epilepsy and chronic stage fright that contributed to his suicide.Before he became epileptic himself, he witnessed a job-seeker he was interviewing, suddenly having a major seizure. It's shown mostly from his point-of-view. It's an important event to include - he wrote 'She's Lost Control' about it - although misunderstanding about epilepsy is so widespread that it's feasible to expect some of the audience to go home thinking he 'caught' it.The overbearing feeling of this film is of a Kitchen-Sink revival, albeit widescreen, and that's not just because of the monochrome. Just to top that, the final scene, as Ian Curtis leaves by way of the crematorium, of oil black smoke rising up to fill the sky, may be a reference to the milieu where the original concentration camp joy division had to work as sex slaves; although it has strong similarities with Charles Foster Kane's big finale.",6,3,4,8 October 2007
The Lives of Others," Save your own soul?
","Buried in the nicotine-stained depths of the German Democratic Republic, where the Stasi has a secret agent to snoop on every 50 citizens, a golden couple manage to keep up the appearance of success in the theatre; Georg (Koch) as a playwright, Christa-maria (Gedeck) as a charismatic and beautiful actress. He, though, has had to alter his writings to keep the Party off his back and keep in business, and she has to give herself regularly to a repulsive culture 'boss'. At the same time, Donnersmarck makes the link with the machinations of the system as we see first, Stasi spies at the theatre, then star interrogator Captain Wiesler (Muhe) mercilessly extract the wrong information from a prisoner at great length before lecturing young party workers on his good work. The story's, and Wiesler's, snapping point comes when the truly nasty Colonel Grubitz (Tukur) verbally tortures a student in the office canteen after hearing his joke about Erich Honecker, East German premier. The tiny seed of doubt is planted in the mind of this perfect automaton. It's, on the face of it, a complex thriller, and the camera-work and overall feel would be well suited to black and white, so 'noir' is it. All the performances are excellent, from the villainous party leaders to the confused neighbour, but it's really Ulrich Muhe's film. The transfiguration from unfeeling loner to all-out mensch is physical. He starts out looking gaunt like a Giacometti 'walker' and ends as a lonesome teddy bear. It's a tragic story on many levels, but there is that strand of redemption. It's possible to save your own soul. CLIFF HANLEY",9,5,8,21 June 2007
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A classic tragedy without time or borders
","The critics who dismiss Ken Loach as a mere polemicist tend to be the ones who violently disagree with his socio-political standpoint, and he would have good reason to feel worried if The Sun or The Daily Mail hailed the release of a Loach film with a barrage of glowing encomiums. The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a companion to Land and Freedom, the study of the Spanish people's fight against powerful and totalitarian rulers, just as that struggle splits into civil war. It is specifically about British imperialism in Ireland, but it could be set in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Palestine or of course Iraq. In the same way The Navigators depicted privatisation from the point of view of the railway workers, The Wind keeps to the level of the 'common people' - those who have to fight just to survive, and by default become soldiers. By concentrating on two brothers: young doctor Damien (Cillian Murphy) and the already-committed fighter Teddy (Padraic Delaney), Loach, by making it personal makes it even more universal. One brother, having irrevocably given himself to the struggle by killing a 'traitor' who is little more than a frightened boy, cannot give it up as to do so would be to admit that that horrible and tragic sacrifice was pointless, as it could only be justified if it led to the creation of a free republic; the other brother equally fixed in his route, but through his military experience enters the empirical world of political compromise. It leads to classic tragedy. Although the story is built on a strongly historical scaffold, the complexities of family life and a turbulent society give it great depth and emotional pull. There are no two-dimensioned goodies or baddies. The simple farmers simultaneously kill and find ways to justify their killing; the Black and Tans, certainly depicted as brutal, are angry, desperate, frightened too. Many would have been fresh from the trenches of the Great War, where they were trained to hate and kill and would be bent on revenge on the enemy; any enemy. There is another strand here, another story: these men, fighting for the 'English' empire, were protestants, many from Glasgow, to where they returned and propagated blind hatred of all 'papes', and that poison thrives today among their grandchildren. The many conflicting interests, cruelties, hopes, mistakes, inevitabilities for the Irish have also rooted in society, while they flower in melancholy and romantic bitterness on the surface. You can gauge the health of any state by looking for its critics. Loach happens to be a great film-maker but for his regular doses of the medicine we need he deserves his Palme d'Or, and we should be grateful to the French for that recognition.",9,14,33,26 June 2006
