Hereditary," Victim of the hype machine
","It's an OK atmospheric horror movie, but like many other viewers, I expected a lot more based on the hype it generated. There are some good ideas in it and the cast is fantastic, especially Toni Collette, who gives an amazing performance, but unfortunately it's dragging on too long. Although there's some suspense buildup here and there, 1/3 of the scenes in the movie could have been easily cut without losing anything important. By the end you get used to the fact that the buildups often go nowhere, leaving you disappointed scene after scene.",6,0,1,27 August 2018
Deadpool 2," Why the hate?
","Lots of 1 point reviews here. People get so dramatic over movies these days... 'Oh my god the worst 2 hours of my life!' It most definitely wasn't. OK, it's probably not on the same level as the first Deadpool movie, but it's still enjoyable. Deadpool is more annoying this time for sure, and there's a rapid fire of hit and miss jokes. Maybe less would be more, but at least you can tell that a lot more effort was put into this movie than into other recent comedies. As for the plot, I wasn't really into it, but the characters' personalities still made the movie enjoyable for me. If this is the worst thing you've seen, consider yourself very lucky.",8,1,4,17 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," JJ, you hack
","Wow, what a mess... but a fitting ending to this botched trilogy. Well done, JJ and Rian Johnson, you made the prequel trilogy look masterpieces compared to this garbage. These guys... While Rian has vision, it's not true to Star Wars, and JJ is just a hack without any vision whatsoever so he just copies and pastes everything from earlier movies. I'm so tired of seeing the same ideas, visuals and scenes over and over again. Oh, and Disney, how on Earth is it possible that there wasn't a definitive arc for the trilogy? I'm just baffled by this level of incompetence.Plenty of reviewers pointed out all the inconsistencies before me. It's perfectly clear that the filmmakers have no idea or don't care about Star Wars, it seems as if they haven't even watched the previous movies. But as filmmakers they could have at least made a movie that followed the rules of filmmaking. Let the scenes breathe a little bit for Christ's sake, add some conversations or something! It's like watching a music video that was cut together randomly. You blink for a millisecond and the cast is in a totally different location without any transition. I bet Disney was scrambling like crazy to finish this thing in time.They are going to teach this trilogy in film school, and not for the reasons Disney would hope.Kathleen Kennedy is out, but unfortunately it's too late to undo what happened to the most beloved movie franchise. It's ruined forever.",5,4,9,15 March 2020
The Shining," Not a fan
","I decided to give The Shining a go after not particularly enjoying Kubrick's other works, A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Odyssey, hoping this one would finally resonate with me.Unfortunately it did not, but now I know what I don't like most about these movies: it's the terrible pacing. Despite having all the time in the world, Kubrick is simply incapable of escalating the tension gradually. I felt the same thing during A Space Odyssey where nothing happened for hours and then the computer went crazy in a span of 5 minutes. Here, Jack Torrance who is obviously supposed to go crazy gradually during their stay seems to be mad right from the start, so the director basically skips the interesting part. This also means that he can't really take the character any further and even Jack Nicholson's cartoonish overacting gets boring after a while, and you're just waiting for the never-ending chase scene to be over so you can move on to other things.Another thing that struck me is the soundtrack, which is more like sound torture here. Soundtracks are supposed to blend in and compliment the visuals, but in The Shining sound lives its own life, it's overused and overpowering everything, making the movie very annoying to listen to. I get that it's probably intentional, probably another Kubrick thing, but there were very few movies where instead of being immersed I started thinking about how bad the soundtrack was, and this was one of them.The visuals are fantastic though, there are some really iconic scenes and images in The Shining, this is basically the only thing that kept me watching until the end.",5,7,9,30 January 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," You must be a die hard Marvel fan to appreciate this
","I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I did enjoy some of their movies and like some of their characters. Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long. With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense.It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.",3,5,9,6 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Major disappointment
","I'm starting to think Pulp Fiction is the exception, not the rule when it comes to Tarantino. It was a happy accident. The 'genius' director this time managed to make a movie in which nothing happens, and I don't mean nothing interesting to me, I mean nothing. At all.We see nothing but nice postcards from 60's Hollywood for about 2 and a half hours, Tarantino makes sure we see all the little details on 60's product packaging, we hear authentic radio broadcasts, and at the beginning you think all these little details are so you get immersed in the atmosphere and the ball will get rolling eventually, but the joke's on you, it never does.After 2 and a half hours of massive boredom and frustration, after seeing all the 60's food cans from all angles, there's a 5 minute random gruesome scene at the very end just for the heck of it, and the movie is finally over. There's no escalation or anything so it's weird, but at least it's mildly interesting.Tarantino also feels too self-confident with his directing style, overusing some editing techniques that don't belong to a slow movie like this at all, he uses flashbacks that ultimately make no sense because they don't give you any additional information, and not to mention camera angles that get very old and annoying very quickly, like when the protagonists are in a car.As for the acting, I can't really say anything about it. Since there's no story at all, there's not a lot to act. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio pull off a slight accent, that's it. Am I supposed to be impressed by this?What a waste of time.",3,4,9,25 November 2019
Mission: Impossible II," Didn't age well
","Who's watching this in 2018? Well, I did, out of curiosity, after hearing about the new movie coming out. Boy, John Woo's over the top directing didn't age well, the action scenes are sometimes so ridiculous and outright dumb that you feel you're watching a B movie. I often burst out laughing during the fight scenes. Story-wise they do everything to make a simple plot look extremely convoluted, but it doesn't become any more intriguing. Don't even get me started on the female lead that doesn't really do anything, but apparently John Woo loved her looks so much that half of the movie is just scenes where they point the camera at her doing nothing. It's so bad, you have to see it.",4,2,4,30 August 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Moving subject
","Although this movie is set during WW2, its message is universal, and there are a lot of parallels with the current political climate as well: the blind faith in 'strong', corrupt leaders and their stupid ideals, the indoctrination of kids with propaganda, the rage and hate towards certain groups of people and cultures due to sheer ignorance, cognitive dissonance, and so on. It's a cautionary tale about how you shouldn't allow yourself to be a pawn in this game, because in the end reality always comes crashing in, and it's never pleasant.Although it has its flaws, Jojo Rabbit is a pretty good effort from Taika Waititi. The writing is spot on. It's funny and very moving at times. Don't expect it to be a full-on comedy though, like those reviewers who gave it 1 star because they didn't laugh enough. Talking about ignorance...",8,2,5,14 February 2020
