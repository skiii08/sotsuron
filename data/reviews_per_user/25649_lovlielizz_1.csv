Mission: Impossible III," Complete lack of tension
","Whilst MI 1 & II are a distant memory, what made them, and indeed any good action film good, is tension. Something which this film completely lacked. The love interest wasn't convincing, there was nothing that really set their relationship up to be so very special, and there was never really a decent element of danger. Plus, the whole 'rabbits foot' thing. Do we care about something we don't know about? Only marginally, because it 'could' be catastrophic, but then again, there wasn't enough evidence for it to be convincingly so.Laugh out loud funny when the 'We're Americans, we go in and do what we do best - infrastructure, democracy blah blah blah...' bit came out. I mean, puh-lease... did the writers actually watch the news in the past few years? America, and England for that matter, aren't exactly lighting liberty and democracy across the east these days...",5,1,2,8 May 2006
