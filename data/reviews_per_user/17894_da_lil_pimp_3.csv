Hereditary," MUST SEE Horror Masterpiece
","Hereditary is nothing for typical/klische horror
movie fans.This movie is something you've never seen before and for me one of the top 5 horror movies i've seen in my whole life, and i'm saying this as a very critical horror fan.Absolutely brilliant performances mixed with a spine chilling storyline. The filming is great and the atmosphere that this movie creates is untouchable.This flick will leave you shocked and its a must see, if you're ready for it.Ari Aster is the master of horror/theiller of nowadays",10,0,0,15 March 2020
Midsommar," Don't be fooled by unexperienced audience
","Ari Aster did great on his 2. release. Midsommar is for elite audience and shouldn't be watched by the typical horror audience. The people giving this movie a 3,4 etc. just don't get the movie. Its a movie about grief relationships filtered through a spine chilling horror plot without building tension with cheap jump scares and dumb stuff (like most horror movies did over the last years). Nobody ever did a movie like this & in that way. The performances are absolutely astonishing, the picture & the atmosphere fit perfectly together and all the easter eggs, representing metaphors are absolutely genius. People just dont want to see new things and be open minded, so thats the reason the movie has an overall of 7.1 (which is extremely low for such a movie).Applause goes out to Ari Aster for creating one of the best horror/thriller movies of the last years.",9,6,15,23 April 2020
