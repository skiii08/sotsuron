Hereditary," Boring, the director has good ideas but poor execution
","This movie would've been better if it had been made by Blumhouse or any other Hollywood director.... Most people mistake dullness with 'artistry'... The director of this Ari M. has good ideas but doesn't know how to make a good pace/rythm...in other words, he is boring, I never thought I'd say this but this movie could've benefited from any Hollywood horror directors",2,1,1,29 June 2020
Inside Out," Just a remake of a Japanese movie
","This is just a remake of a Japanese movie called 'Poison Berry in my Brain' which is an adaptation of a Comic by Setona Mizushiro release 2 YEARS ago!!!, They both contain exactly the same amount of 'personalities' (5) making decisions in the brain, arranged in the same kind of room with the same table in the center!!! Pixar has had a rough last 2 years, with their movies under-performing at the Box-Office and with the critics... but can Pixar at least acknowledge what its based on?The Manga, or comic the Japanese movie is based on came out on 2013, it's really hard for us to believe that it wasn't read by someone in Oixar, them being big fans of Japanese Anime and comics...",1,245,534,21 June 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Worst experience since 'the emoji movie'
","There there is nothing in this movie that is interesting or fun!! It's even missing the long and well-structured dialogues like inglourious basterds at the beginning, or in the scene at the bar at the basement.... no, this movie doesn't have anything remotely cool like that! and even if at the end he tries to rewrite history...its all for nothing",2,1,2,15 September 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not as good as the first one... more formulaic and derivative
","The movie is good until the middle, the beginning is good and the fight between Iron-Man and Hulk is almost worth the price of admission, the comedy is awesome, but then there are some problems... it feels like a collection of action sketches not very cohesive and in different places in the world, it doesn't feel like a solid movie, and then...the ending is exactly the same as the first Avengers!!!,substitute New York for Slovakia and the Chitauri for Ultron's minions and is the same !!! it feels tired and repetitive and absolutely nobody clapped at the end of the movie on Opening Night!!!! and Loki is not even there, even the 'Captain America the Winter Soldier' was far better!!!",4,10,22,1 May 2015
Midsommar," 'Wicker Man' with Nick Cage was better
","This movie would've been better if it had been made by Blumhouse or any other Hollywood director.... Most people mistake dullness with 'artistry'... The director of this movie has good ideas but doesn't know how to make a good pace/rythm...in other words, he is boring, I never thought I'd say this but this movie could've benefited from Hollywood, to make it faster, with more explanations, and less dullness",3,7,9,29 June 2020
It Chapter Two," Powerful demon gets beaten by.... Being offended?
","So you are a powerful demon god that can transform into anything and get into people's minds....but the six people that can kill you, you just want to scare them?? he could have killed the protagonists in the first half an hour and yet he chooses not to and at the end even though you're powerful... you're very sensitive and get offended and die??",5,0,5,15 September 2019
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," OK, but the opening is short
","I've never read the books so I'm not going to blast the movie because the book says the cape should be 'red' and instead is 'green' and therefore the entire movie is horrible.... No, I'm not that kind of guy... but I have a big problem about this: SPOILERS AHEAD: After the great build up of Smaug the Dragon on 'The Desolation of Smaug' the damn dragon dies in the first 4 minutes!!! did they run out of budget for the destruction of Lake-town? even the fire looks cheap... and Smaug is taken out like some stray dog... I was hoping to see incredible sights of Smaug flying around the town and a lot of destruction... instead...well, let's just say that I had to get out to the restroom, I would have miss the entire sequence.... WTF??",6,1,7,16 December 2014
Wonder Woman," not as good as everyone thinks
","There was a lot of buzz about this movie and it being a symbol for feminism... being directed by a women... however, the action scenes are few and far apart, the one at 'no men's land' is OK but the last one is a mess... and also, being directed by a women was supposed to be the strong point... how come she can't direct a funny/romantic scene like when they're on the boat... and the love scene on the french town feels very cold and uninteresting!!, if it wasn't for all the hoopla I would give this 2 stars...",6,4,12,7 August 2017
Jojo Rabbit," Almost as good as 'Life is beautiful'
","If you don't like this movie, you're a monster, this is perfectly balanced and even when the laughs died at the middle of the movie, it's still poignant and powerful! this is one of the best movies so far and Scarlett Johannsen should be nominated for an Oscar!!!",10,5,18,31 October 2019
