The Equalizer," Beautiful, Done Right Movie
","This, was the best action I've seen in a long time. Let me explain: The story is, Denzel is a retired man from an obviously highly trained organization, trying to normally live his life, and gets influenced by a sad prostitute that wants to sing. So, he goes on a rampage killing people to get her wish. That may sound like a trope, but no other movie does it better. Yes, it wasn't the best movie ever, but no movie gets everything right.You think the clichés made it terrible? Well many movies would have a hard time making content to put in if they avoided all the clichés you think make movies worse. I loved this simple good guy doing the right think movie, and Denzel is definitely better than Arnold at this kinda movie.",8,1,3,17 August 2016
