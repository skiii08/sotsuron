Black Swan," Visually stunning, great acting, thin plot & motivations
","As a whole, I think Black Swan is worth seeing because it does deliver some really good acting performances and an interesting work which cannot be easily classified into a single genre. But, in my opinion, it does not warrant some of the reviews as the most amazing thing ever or even in 2010. Basically, these premises are simple: the ingénue who must go through internal hell to perform her role, the possessive stage mother from hell, the pr**ck choreographer who manipulates the players and wants to be Svengali, the rival who threatens to steal it all away. All of these forces are backdrops to the drama playing out in Nina's mind. Arguably little of anything that is seen in the final third of the film is real. The good: The film is a visual treat. Aside from the obvious black/white contrast, the use of pink/red and green is also very interesting. Each frame is perfectly filmed so that colors, textures, reflections all play a role. All of this play's into Nina's black/white world where everyone is there to study her every move and even every part of her body is invaded by her prying mother, the manipulative choreographer etc. Aronofsky does a good job at avoiding the pat stereotypes: Lily is never a direct rival to Nina except when Nina starts to self-destruct, Thomas is never the seductor he would like to be. This is NOT All About Eve. It is a visualization of the very difficult process and artist goes through and embodies all of the fears and nightmares that performers have. The film brings out some great performances by Portman, Kunis and Hershey and Ryder. The bad: The motivations in the film are completely not credible. We are to believe Nina has been in a professional ballet company for several years. Yet she comes off as a psychotic Marsha Brady afraid about the school play. She would have had experience being on stage, probably has lost/gained numerous other major roles. As part of an ENSEMBLE company, different people would play leads at different times. There is not just ONE big star. So we have Nina going completely insane over this role which she would not have been given anyway. And the Black/White swan thing? Um, you could have 2 dancers play the 2 swans. It's been done. But she goes completely off her rocker and then at the end claims, 'It was perfect.' Well, it really wasn't. If she did fall in the first part, the performance was not perfect. Most of all, being a performer means doing a great performance night after night and also showing up at parties for the business end of it, but she supposedly killed herself, so in this way too, she was not perfect and failed. Aronofsky really goes overboard with all of the special effects. She's nuts and crazy, we get it. No need for her to pull her finger off 5 times or bleed out of various orifices or see herself in the mirror. Every hackneyed CGI horror movie trick is tried. And that famous lesbian scene? It wouldn't be that that would generate a huge buzz and drive up box office, right? There are other ridiculous plot points, like the 2nd is named the day before the big show? Nina's the big star, does all her make-up, supposedly murders someone, and hops onto stage with 1 minute to spare? Or she's sick on opening night, but no one bothers to call her and find out what is going on? There is zero emphasis on the other characters in the ballet. Worst of all, we see very little actual dancing in the movie. We see bits and pieces of things, but never a whole piece. We never see her in a rehearsal to be the black swan. Not a very good homage to ballet. My biggest complaint is that you leave the theater not particularly satisfied: either it is about the unbalanced woman who kills herself over a role or it is all an allegory about the artistic process and the 'death' of a woman's vulnerability and innocence. So you walk away seeing something visually stunning but don't take away much more. There is really no big lesson on the human condition, just the tragic story of a tormented girl who failed under pressure.",5,0,0,30 March 2011
Knives Out," Kind of overrated to me
","I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don't get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the 'murder' was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying 'Random, you're back AGAIN' or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the 'slayer' law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn't there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a 'commentary' on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. Lots of kooky things happened. But I think this is better for a late-nite Netflix watch.I certainly don't see it as being 'best of the year.'",6,851,1443,30 November 2019
Midnight in Paris," Good film with some flaws
","The Good: One of the most approachable Woody Allen films in years. It paints a lovely portrait of Paris, a real character in the film. It presents a nice message about the need to live in our own real time and make the life we want for ourselves. Owen Wilson is charming and pleasant in his role. The concept of reaching out and touching a group of legendary people from the past is fun and Bates and others give very intriguing performances as the literary/cultural figures in the time periods visited. Allen also spares us most of the clichÃ©s from a 'time travel' film - the choice at the end whether to stay or not, the friends discovering the time portal, the race against time etc. No, this is a piece about the mood and ambiance of a different age, the time travel bit is more a flight of fancy and/or fantasyThe bad: What Allen saves in clichÃ©s on the time travel theme we gives back in terms of the characterizations of the other present-day characters. The fiancÃ©e, her parents, her friends all have next to zero redeeming qualities. They are extremely unpleasant to be around, making Wilson the only likable person in the present day by default. You hope from the onset that he will break it off with this woman, her family and friends, so there is little tension there.Not that much happens in the film. Yes, it's intriguing to meet Getrude Stein, Hemingway, Picasso but really they just say some clever things and that's the extent of it. Wilson is immediately and warmly welcomed into this tight-knit clique of 1920's artists and writers, apparently there is no need for money, he is invited in everywhere he goes. The film also fails to show any of the realities of the 1920's or the Belle Epoque, so Wilson comes to the conclusion it's better to live in his own time not by seeing the other time is not so great but because he sees Cotillard fawning over the Belle Epoque instead of the 1920's. Had that not happened, Owen would have probably gladly agreed to stay there, again with no immediate need for money, a place to stay etc.The movie is like a Parisian pastry, which is fun to eat but then later you wonder if it was worth all of the calories. It was a very sweet homage to Paris, some intriguing portraits of larger than life people but the final message in the end, the characters in the present-day were a little thin.",6,3,5,10 July 2011
Man of Steel," Meh! Another film which uses CGI instead of plot
","Saw this movie on a plane. It started out well. We get the basic point: They wanted a grittier and more flawed Superman. Now cutesy scenes like in the Christopher Reeves Superman films where Clark Kent would save Lois Lane as she fell down a waterfall. The start of the movie was great. They really try to avoid the pat scenes of Superman we have engraved in our minds. But then, things go terribly wrong. There is nothing but constant, relentless CGI. The character and story development are minimal. Yes, we want a grittier Superman but this is so far removed that you could put Will Smith in the film fighting these evil doers and it would make no difference. There is way, way, way too much backstory. Yes, they didn't want geeky Clark Kent running around so instead they hit you again and again with the theme: He wants to use his power but he can't because people won't understand, blah blah blah. Then we have the fact that everything happens directly to the folks Superman/Clark is supposed to be involved with - Bam, Lois meets Chris Meloni, bam they are at center. Bam, over with Martha Kent, bam attack at Daily Planet. It's the kind of 'coincidence' central to ridiculous action movies. The Russell Crowe role as Jor El is beyond cheesy. Yes, he is supposed to be a spiritual adviser to Kal El but he appears and even tells Lois where to fire her gun. Then he engages in this long and ridiculous conversation with General Zod. Then, Jor El and Zod make countless bombastic speeches about the future of our people blah blah blah. You will feel bored instead of inspired. The central conceipt of the film is bizarre too. Zod wants the Kryptonians to move to earth but they can't with the same atmosphere - apparently. Not sure if Jor El wants this or not. Much of Metropolis is ground to dust, apparently with many thousands of casualties. Also, apparently, Daily Planet Building - but no biggie - Superman just puts on his glasses and settles in at the Daily Planet moments after the conflict and all is peachy. Let's not and say we did.",3,3,6,13 November 2013
The White Ribbon," A haunting, thought-provoking masterpiece
","This is the kind of movie which haunts you and keeps you thinking long after it is over. If you are looking for a clear-cut thriller where the culprit is clearly revealed at the end, this film is not for you. Like many of his films, Haneke purposely does not provide answers and instead shows that things are disjointed and the 'who' is less important than the 'why.' It is often speculated that the pastor's children are the one's who 'did it' in this movie but this is the wrong approach both in terms of overall message of the film. The film is about seething anger that comes from unjust abuse and punishment, a top-down authoritarian society and about the types of behavior which sough the seeds for more violent, totalitarian societies, be they in Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Soviet Union. So we immediately see the basic power structures in the film: the baron oppresses the workers, the parents oppress their children, men oppress women and the cycle of abuse spirals downward until even the most innocent are the victims. We see 4 'pillars' of the community – the baron, the pastor, the doctor and the teacher. The hierarchy of the community is in that order with the baron acting as overlord, the pastor there to maintain the social order and prop up the baron's power, the doctor who is educated and needed in the community, thereby commanding respect. The teacher has little power and is not taken terribly seriously by many, yet he also does not seem to be the object of such anger. Then we have the social stratum - the baron, the steward, the employees, the farm workers and then the Polish migrant workers. We have the parent/child dynamic, where any misstep of a child outside can destroy a family, so the children, particularly the pastor's children, are held to a ridiculously high standard. Finally, many of the men oppress the women. At the same time, all of those at the bottom of the ladder start to revolt and strike out at others, sometimes hurting the most innocent. Central to the film, of course, is the children. The overriding point of the film is not so much who did what specific act but rather that this is a society of constant punishment and retribution. It is almost certain that the pastor's children are at least aware of some of the heinous acts. They are themselves victims of physical and emotional abuse yet are expected to be models to the community. They can be pushed only so far until the power structure is challenged and Klara kills her father's pet canary – once again striking out at the weakest. But there is much more to the story. First, the doctor is attacked, making the 'healer' in need of healing. We have the farmer's son destroying the baron's cabbage out of anger for the way his mother died. In fact, one of the big culminations of the film is the big harvest festival where the baron can show his largesse to the workers, an event sanctioned by the pastor. But the event, coinciding with the death of a worker, seems to cement the resentment of the baron's family and the excess with which they live. This is followed by the savage beating of Sigi, the window left open at the steward's home to hurt the baby, the fire at the barn, the doctor's son wandering around in a confused state, the incident involving Sigi's flute and the severe beating of Karli. Clearly the open window and the flute incident were by the steward's children and the motive appears to be anger about being deprived things – from a new baby to Sigi who, the epitome of a spoiled brat, to a father who would kill his son for embarrassing him in the eyes of the baron. It would also seem unlikely that the pastor's kids would have caused the barn fire as Martin was tied down at the time and Klara seems accounted for. Now several points should be noted: 1) Perhaps Anni and/or the midwife would have a motive in attacking the doctor – he mistreated them both, sexually molested the daughter and perhaps others. 2) In the scene on the bridge, Martin reveals that he sees everything as being dictated by God, there is no free will. So any punishment meted out is 'God's will' 3) Note that parallel and name similarity between Klara and Karli. Diametrical opposites: she as the eldest(?) female pastor's child is held to the very highest standards in the community, she represents order and a threat to the power structure, he is utterly powerless, flouts all social paradigms, has a questionable parentage. Karla is very aware of this power structure and is willing to mete out punishment herself. 4) What are we to make about the doctor? Why did he leave town so abruptly separately without the midwife, taking 'her' child along? Was his sexual abuse going to be made public? Did the midwife have a role in her son's beating in more of this 'trickle down' rage? Did the pastor make threats? There are no easy answers and Haneke doesn't want there to be. The point is that abuse travels downward until eventually some of the abused strike back. The individual culpability is not as important as the overall mindset of the authoritarian society which preys on the ones who are weaker. It is also worth noting the backdrop of WWI. It illustrates how these personal agendas are temporarily cast aside by larger, more sweeping changes but also how a war can start for the most part over one individual – the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. So like in the film, individual behaviors can branch out and change an entire community or, in some cases, a whole society. The mindset of this generation would come into focus as its children grow up twenty years later in Hitler's Germany.",9,1,5,21 November 2010
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great acting, style, cinematography...very lacking in other areas
","I really wanted to like this more. Beautful photography! Mixing and matching genres: comedy, western, spaghetti western, thriller etc. Fun story set-ups. Great acting!But then the problems starts. I saw another review that would describe Tarantino's 'hubris' when writing this. For many die-hard Tarantino fans, everything he does is ballsy and edgy. But to me, as the minutes became hours, I felt that this was just an ensemble cast gathered to 'subvert...subervert...subvert'. Yes, he plays with genres but that has been done elsewhere, such as Westworld. Ultimately Tarantono just strings together several stories, leading up to the requisite bloodbath at the end. The Dicaprio story was interesting, the rest kind of went nowhere. Cliff does this contrived trip to the ranch to come upon Manson's minions, pokes the bear for no particular reason, even when it is clear the old man basically knows what's happening. This then leads to the randon encounter next door, where history can be rewritten to erase the Manson family's major murder spree. First, younger audiences won't get it, second what is the point of undoing this Hollywood event that sort of redefined us as a nation and how we see the modern age. Let's throw that out the window so we can have a big violent brawl! Maybe in part II the friends can travel back in time to get Hitler!Beyond this, there really is a lot of establishment anger to 60's/70's counterculture here. The 'old timey' folks who act in the traditional shows are the 'good guys' but the counter-culture 'hippies' are treated with contempt throughout the film. And then the 'good guys' change history by a random event just thrown in their laps - as Cliff conveniently runs into this girl numerous times and she happens to be Manson family. No particularly positive examples of the hippie movement, just right to the murderers who are disdained before they even commit a murder. For someone wo so likes subverting genres and expectations, why does Tarantino have such rage against a group that was 99% peaceful.So much of the film is built on contrived circumstance. The one character is called pussycat and Brad Pitt is given the easy set up: We all love p*ssy...yes we do. So, so classy.To me this was a macho film that dabbled in different genres.However, the film is redeemed somewhat by the very good acting of Dicaprio, Pitt seemed a bit incidental. Style was amazing. Sadly, it lacked the substance.",6,0,0,26 December 2019
Cold War," A bit of a disappointment to me
","I should start off by saying I am a fan of Polish cinema, have even studied it in the past. This movie was a typical Polish intellectual movie: focus on emotion, scene development and the characters' emotional journey over huge plot developments. I can't fault this film for any of that. I also loved Pawlikowski's last work, Ida, with the two principal women in this film, but found it much superior,There is a lot to like in the film. Excellent acting, gorgeous cinematography, a careful attention to sounds and scope. Pawlikowski is an expert at evoking strong emotions when you view a scene, he can make all people and items on the set work in concord to convey the overall feeling he wants. So far, so good!For me, where the film falls short is in giving these characters a real direction or, in the case of Zula, making her likable. Also, frankly, despite the very good acting, I could not feel a strong chemistry between the two leads.Beyond this: We get it - life in Post-war Poland was very hard, being freshly annexed and essentially made a Societ puppet state. Pawlikowski conveys so much meaning in the choice to add Russian folk songs to the Polish repertoire, resulting in the resignation of the conductor after a short while. Yes, the protagonist is imprisoned and Zula does basically marry someone she doesn't love to get him out of jail.But that is pretty much the end of the analysis of the massive scope of becoming part of the Soviet block, Beyond this, it is first a visit to favorite eastern block countries, then a long stay in Paris, followed by the return to Poland.But where the movie loses me is in the character of Zula and their relationship. It is established she had a hard life. She becomes part of the choir because it is prestigious, she does what she has to do. But later, she basically devolves into this pouty hussy. Instead of looking at the real difficulties of immigration, we are brought to a huge apartment and glitzy nightclubs. She pouts over the repetoire she is to sing, is rude to her partner's previous partner. She marries an Italian just to immigrate and never even gives him a second thought. We understand things are dog eat dog in an Eastern block country but she is immediately painted in such a bad light, it's hard to root for her. She gets drunk, cheats on her boyfriend, evoking a slap, and then returns to Poland, apparently leaving the love of her life behind. Could their not be 10 mintues when she is generally happy they got out? This is due to 2 things: 1) She is supposed to be this incredible free spirit and Bohemian. But why then not establish this resistance, at least to a degree, within Poland? Their she was the great little soldier, even spying on her boyfriend to the higher-up's. 2) She is to have this incredible yearning to return to Poland - despite all of her 'faults', her love for the fatherland is strong in her. But instead of exploring this in a deeper way, Zula's return to Poland is presented as a rash, impulse thing.Yes, the couple redeem themselves a bit. he gives up his life in Paris to return to Poland, gets the anticipated prison punishment and she marries a jerk so that they can be together - ultimately leading to their own suicide pact, as living in their native country has become impossible. But, sadly, all of this is presented as a couple unable to decide what is what and what the reality is until it is too late. Instead of an intelligent discussion of why being in Poland means so much to them, it ultimately boils down to, 'Oopsie, we really screwed up.'Finally, and this is just speculation - When Ida won the Oscar a few years ago, the Polish rightwing was outraged - How can this film smear the image of Poland? I'll leave it to others to discuss the veracity of some of the claims presented in the film. The point is, legislation was discussed to demand only positive portrayals of Poland in film, TV and other media. This film seems like something that would please the right-wing government: Most of what was bad is the fault of the Soviets. And we have this flighty, flawed couple who, despite their faults, make it back home to Poland out of love for country and/or each other. Perfectly pleasing for the rightwing audience. Not saying that most of this was not true but this film greatly lacks the moral ambiguities and personal contradictions found in Ida.",6,11,17,5 February 2019
Joker," Somewhere between Masterpiece and Oscarbait
","I was reluctant to watch this. I really am not into the typical superhero movie with tons of fight scenes and special effects, but I ultimately rented it on Amazon because so many people raved about it. So let's go step by step:Joaquin Phoenix: Gives the performance of his career. The physicality, the desperation of the character, his instability, his erratic nature, his fraility. I find the descend into madness to be very compelling and like Natalie Portman in Black Swan, I think this portrayal is the strong aspect in what would have been a so-so film.People harshly judge this film as simplifying issues such as class, a lack of civility in society, alienation of the underpriledged etc. True, if this movie were a straight-out analysis of what was going on in New York City in the early 1980's, Reaganism etc., it would fail. Yes, NYC was in a pretty dark place in the early 1980's. Crime was up, discontentment was high, people felt alienated and angry. But here we see everything through the lens of a seriously deranged individual who is an unreliable narrator. For him, the world is increasingly dark and the instances of abuse only multiply. He does not have the sophistication of being political or even being able to fully articulate his rage for being mocked and for being overlooked as a member of society and he very accidentally becomes a folk hero as his acts happened to coincide with a period in which the population was greatly angered and enraged. It is not even truly clear how much of this adulation is real or even, indeed, how many of the acts in this film really are real.The film does play a theme reflected in other works, also in the film Parasite, this class rage and the desire to strike back at real and perceived oppressors. The increasingly hostile environment of the city adds to Arthur's malaise and contributes to his total breakdown.Many Batman franchise fans will not like this. Where is Batman? I think the point of this film is that this villain is very far from the criminal mastermind that Joker was in other versions, this guy can barely get up and function, let alone run a major criminal enterprise. He is pityable, sad, pathetic. ironically it is one of the enraged protesters, not Arthur, who killed Thomas Wayne and thereby created Batman, if this too even happened. Yes, they did a new take on the comic version but I feel it had some valuable points to make.Was the film Oscar-baity? Yes. The quirky anti-hero, many scenes created for shock value. A pretty thin plot. Another plot device of 'How much of this was only in his mind.' Having said this, I really enjoyed it but have no real desire to see it again. I think Phoenix as a lot on Joker but the film without him would be mediocre.",7,0,3,19 January 2020
