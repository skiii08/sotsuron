The Avengers," what the Hell.... Best OMG Marvel Adaptation ever
","I'm coming out straight up to say this is he most freaking amazing comic movie adaptation I have ever seen....Best movie of 2012, best marvel adaptation ever.I have to say, what he freaking ....... Fuzz!!!!! I can't believe I've just seen a movie as great as this from Hollywood. Where could it ever go wrong? From cast ensemble, to Character arc to character development, to story, to OMG spectacular kick-ass action... -pause to catch my breath- my mind is still spiraling from what I have just seen. This is a movie I want to watch this next minute if I have he chance!! My only downside to this movie though is not seeing it in time.. oops ha that is no downer to he movie itself. It made me laugh, get tear eyed, marvel in wonder at pure awesomeness, jump out of my seat, tremble in fear, its just great. Sorry I can't find he words still. As large as he hype to this movie is, it still didn't do justice to how awesome this movie is. gosh!!!Great job Joss Whedon. He really is a passionate comic book writer who does justice to this ensemble, shuffling up things to boiling point between characters and I can't even start to describe his major villain whose actor gives an Oscar worthy performance.Never had a bad-ass bad guy that kept me awestruck this much since he matrix. Tom Hiddlestone does justice to this character in a way that truly signifies a real god of mischief. Scheming and plotting with thoughts and plans coming at split second intervals, Tom Hiddlestone still gives his character that dynamism of a brainiac with deep inner pain that you'd think could boil over at any moment.Mind blowing movie for a super hero generation. If u are a comic book fan, you would drool over this movie and I'm not just saying. If you are not even, there's no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie still. It just couldn't go wrong.*Panting*",8,4,9,17 May 2012
Men in Black 3," Fresh Blast From The Past
","Agent J travels in time to MIB's early years in the 1960s, to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history. I saw the first trailer of this movie and I thought,'here we go again, another boring sequel' and then the second trailer came out and was good so I thought it was worth a shot. I went to the Cinema with an open mind as I also really wanted to see Will Smith on the big screen after such a long absence. Also having enjoyed the first movie a great deal, I just wanted this movie to exceed the second and that was all I asked for so my expectations were relatively low.My, was I surprised. It is no secret that the second movie is a disaster but MiB3, though not quite the first due to plot holes, still strongly holds its own. The Cinematography is beautiful and quite exceptional too as the depiction of the 1960s setting was breathtaking; and even the celebrity Cameos are a delight to see. I still wonder how they consented to appear in this picture (I won't spoil the fun and mention their names). The sequence of agent Jay falling through time is beautiful as well. Perhaps as any in Hollywood Cinema.The movie still isn't perfect due to plot holes like some references Jay makes in the past that do not coincide with the time line. In all, what makes this movie fresh and is also its heart is its well written script and its cast. Of course Will Smith returns as Agent Jay and is allowed to just be his enthusiastic, spontaneous and charismatic self that has endeared us to him over the years delivering a lot of comic wits. Tommy Lee Jones could do no wrong also as the stern and serene Agent Kay. The Jay and Kay dynamic didn't quite work well in the first ten to fifteen minutes of the movie and it still seemed like they were first time partners even though the movie time frame in the present coincides with ours which is a decade after their first meeting. All this boredom were put to rest as soon as we jump to the past to meet with the younger Agent Kay as portrayed by Josh Brolin and he is quite easily the superstar of this show. This performance is as close to perfection as any can get with his accurate impersonation of the serene but quick wit expression of Tommy Lee Jones that we have grown accustomed to over the years. His performance was so great that it made the character of a young Emma Thompson/Agent O seem a lot out of place. He made his character work so well that you could see how this 29 year old agent Kay could well transform into the present Agent we well know. And even with this impersonation, he did well to make the character his own in a lot of ways.The dynamic between Agent Jay and the younger Agent Kay really carries the movie and this could be the one out of the three with the most heart in the MiB franchise. It seemed to focus a lot on character development and this is a huge plus for the movie. Some of the humor did fall flat but a lot of it works. The supporting cast were not left out as their performances were impeccable both for drama and comedy and did I fail to mention Jermaine Clement as the Evil Boris the animal. If you were a fan of the first MiB movie, you should go and see this. If you hated or weren't quite fond of the second, you should really go and see this.",Null,0,5,31 May 2012
The Hunger Games," Good but not worth all the hype
","I didn't intend to see this movie as my taste in over-hyped blockbusters easily waned alongside my clocking my early twenties. I stumbled into the theater as a result of schedule change with the movie I wanted to see having being shifted. The hype though still succeeded in affecting my curiosity so I went to see this.I haven't read the books no. Though I have taken a word or two from past reviews knowing its a first person narrative organized in a post-Apocalyptic future, written by movie writer and Author Suzanne Collins.Though set in a post-Apocalyptic world, its not your regular post-Apocalyptic movie. You'd have had residual damaged cities, sparse population and..... maybe flesh eating zombies as they usually do. The beginning of the movie was promising I must say.There have been mention of poor characterization of the tributes with the exception of Woody Harrelson's and Elizabeth Banks' characters respectively. Then there's that of physical portrayal; Katniss and the tributes from the other districts do not seem to be going hungry- and then the exploitation of the districts, haven been a major plot point in the books is barely seen in this motion picture.In my opinion Effie Trinket was captivating. Elizabeth Banks really does justice to her. Woody Harrelson was especially brushed up as Haymitch. His lines kept me laughing at times but it was Jennifer Lawrence who stole the show even though its said she is not starved enough. The fears, inner strength and purposefulness she shows all seem very moving and quite carries the movie on its own but Josh Hutcherson's Peeta was quite flat. Though I haven't read the book, it seemed unconvincing and lacked emotional depth affecting the dynamic between him and Katniss. If he had been lost in the games, I doubt anyone would really miss him save for the fourteen year old girls with the buzz of 'guy loves girl loves guy' triangles in the air from the twilight sagas. Even Katniss' chemistry with Liam Hemsworth's character, though not in romantic terms seemed to carry a lot more weight.There may be a lot more to the entire story than shown in this movie and its a pretty average made huge budget blockbuster compared to the hype all over it. Apart from the opening scenes that portray a hungry society that seems to have lost hope, the rest of the story lacked depth. The arena battle lacked any tension. It was like watching chronicles of Narnia without the magic.I don't want to start on the stereotypical tributes of the other districts even though there was a fine attempt to minimize the on-screen violence for the sake of the much younger viewer understandably to attract a wider Audience. They seemed like they were all having fun in the jungle.For Katniss and Amandla Sternberg's character as Rue, I give this movie a 7 and I'd recommend a few bucks for it. Don't expect much. Maybe the sequel does better. Enjoy",7,0,3,2 May 2012
Man of Steel," Very good indeed
","The man of steel comes to the silver screen and I was pained I didn't get to see it as early as I would have liked. But I thought I'd still write a review about it.Its a block-buster and I didn't expect anything less. It managed to exceed my expectations a great deal even though it wasn't perfect. The actors were well cast, it had good direction and pacing but it was the visual effects that stole the show...This is one of the best visually stunning action display I have ever seen in Hollywood (yes, right there I SAID IT). Among my top five at least. In fact the only standout movie I can recall that could beat it is The Matrix. The beauty of it is that though I have seen movies before with short well constructed visuals , and others have been jam-packed and in the process would then get to be all over the place leaving the audience not knowing what to make out of the muddle, shambles and disorderliness, like TRANSFORMERS, this masterpiece had effects in excess(and I stress 'in excess' a good 1 hour,20 something minutes dedicated to action ) and still succeeded in pulling it off beautifully. I wouldn't like to spoil it but you need to see it for yourselves.The story was okay with the first third dedicated to showing the home planet's and its inhabitants' destruction though I wouldn't say no plot-holes *spoiler alert*: Why wouldn't a council try to save some of its planetary citizens with its technology but instead are able, and choose to transport criminals who could have been executed to another dimension. This being said, as a Fan I was still able to respect the minor exclusions from the original Superman material. In fact the exclusion of the panties over spandex costume was more than welcome. And I like as the story kept close to the source material. The struggle of Superman with being an outsider and minor romance story with Lois Lane. It wasn't perfect though as it still had plot-holes.The score was great. I wouldn't speak much on that. And the choice of actors. Visually, Henry Cavill is one of the best embodiments of superman ever. He reminds me of Tom Welling in the Smallville TV series who, I also think, along with Cavill are better than previous editions. A welcome inclusion as well as (as I strongly believe) a marketing accessory Bankable star is Russell Crowe. The perfect Jor el. Amy Adams and Michael Shannon were okay as Lois Lane and General Zod respectively but special mention goes to Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. Diane Lane was a breathe of fresh air as Martha too. This still reminded of Smallville's Kents.Overall a great movie. Sets up well for a sequel.",7,3,6,28 July 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A visual extravaganza
","I wasn't up for a reboot of the Spiderman franchise prior to this movie & after seeing it, it did change my opinion but only just. And I'd describe that with some pros & cons.It was a very efficient adaptation and I appreciate that about it. In addition to web-slinging, wall crawling and a Spider sense, we also get witty banter with villains and criminals alike as well as a suit upgrade. As a huge fan of the comics as a child, my biggest attractive characteristic of Spiderman is his ability to churn up amazing one-liners with super-villains even in the midst of unfavorable circumstances. In the previous movie, the attempt at this was a hit and miss and very tacky at best but Andrew Garfield seems to have done his homework with this one.All actors did a very good job. I didn't find the non-action sequences a drag & they did well to drive the movie forward. My star performer is Jamie Fox as well as Sally Field.As for the tone, Spiderman is not Batman and most certainly not the dark knight either. A brilliant teenager with spectacular superhuman abilities on the big-screen... In my opinion, its allowed to be a bit over-the-top and not quite as childish as other reviewers claim..On the other hand, the big screen effect could have been more amazing without half of the movie being included in the trailers. There was no room for surprises. Non whatsoever. Not even in the climax battle. If for anything, the end battle was anti-climatic as I've seen it in the Trailers over & over again.The worst part for me was the climax battle. It was so crammed up you could hardly figure out what's happening anywhere. It just seemed like a skits show of visual effects blitz.Better than previous installments but couldn't match Spiderman 2.",Null,1,5,2 May 2014
