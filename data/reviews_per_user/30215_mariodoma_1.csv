The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," 900 leagues deep
","This is cinematic poetry.  It is too partisan to call this movie one of the most profound features in the history of cinema, but it does carry a weight that is beyond your typical French meets accidental, beyond few nice gazes, beyond colorful stills of fashionable youth in ambivalent scenes of dramatic gentleness.The plot is simple: Two Veronicas are not twins but they happened to look very much alike, born in two different universes, to two different mothers, but they are metaphysically connected, one making all choices right, and the other not.  Given that we all look like someone else, what's the likelihood that there's someone out there on this planet of 5 billion that looks just like us?  Would we have anything in common with them, as we might with our friends?",10,3,7,30 July 2001
