Skyfall," Best Bond Ever!!!
","To start out let me say I'm not a Bond film fan. I like action movies though the Bond films never appealed to me. I found them not intelligent enough, until now... Sam Mendes is a filmmaker, not an action filmmaker, and a good one. He knows you don't need a whole film to develop a character but one good dialog scene. He knows how to film a good action scene, how to make actors give their best, how to show respect to the series without falling into their mistakes. He is a master of his class. The performances from Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench are amazing, but Ben Wishaw was my favorite character because of his well written dialog. The action was not pointless, it furthered plot and characters. The film is unable to be compared with the rest of the series because this ones is actually a good film, not an action film. Sam Mendes did what Joss Whedon did for Avengers and Chris Nolan did for Batman. He breathed life into an impossible franchise. Good job Mendes! Keep it up!",10,5,13,22 November 2012
Batman Begins," Best Film Ever! Yes, I Like It Better Than The Dark Knight!
","I don't know why this beats out The Return of the King, Titanic, The Dark Knight to me. I can't help but love this film. Nolan is amazing at Directing. This film has great pacing with it's transition from action to story to witty lines, to everything. Christian Bale became my favorite actor after this film. Liam Neeson is impossible not to like in any role. Michael Cane is the only witty actor I've ever seen play Afled, at first I was caught of guard, but now I love him as Alfred. Gary Oldman is incredible at capturing the humanity of Gordan, Cullian Murphy is surprisingly great as Scarecrow, and Katie Holmes surprised me. Overall, the best film I've ever seen.",Null,2,3,21 August 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," All I could ever ask of The Hobbit!
","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is an impossible standard of a trilogy. The Hobbit is an entertaining, heartwarming, and humorous film that nobody will recognize that views it with a critical eye. Having seen it in 48 frames per second I see why people dislike the technology. As a teenage film critic I couldn't help but notice the mistakes. The speed of the frames is jarring at first, many things that would look real look fake...then, I start seeing plates flying, start hearing the dwarfs sing, and start feeling the emotion and humor and the action starts and I'm entranced in the likability of the film. Slowly I'm not watching a movie but being transported into Middle Earth. The frame rate stops becoming annoying and starts enhancing the experience. If you treat this like a movie you won't enjoy the fun. If you try to treat it like actual events in the Lord of the Rings series you miss the point of the film. Bilbo is recalling the story from his memory, and like Gandalf says in the movie, 'All good stories deserve embellishment.' This is the way it's being told, maybe not how it happened. The editing is slower than modern films. Many complained about the pace, but every scene has a purpose in future sequels, no scene is poorly written, and I loved every single one of these characters, including the trippy Radagast. 48 frames isn't perfect yet, isn't the new standard, but a new way to watch film. If you find yourself too attached to the cinematic experience this will be different. It's not headache 3D, it gives the feeling of a live performance with awesome effects, and gives HD minus the annoyance. I love it! It turns of the film critic and brings in the story lover.This deserves a 10, it is by far the most immersive films of the year, but because it is a prequel to a superior series I cannot raise expectations too high. My advice is put your 3D glasses on, your notepad down, and enjoy a new way of viewing cinema.",9,8,17,25 December 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Best of the Transformers! Saves the Series!!!
","Okay, so this isn't The Dark Knight or Return of the King good, but as far as action films. This one is great with the action, all except for the girl the supporting roles were filed nicely by Ken Jeong, John Malkovich and Patrick Despey. The writing was the best they can do for a Transformers film. Peter Culllan is amazing as Optimus Prime again, and Shia Labeouf is great again. The 3D is the best I've seen since Avatar, it really adds to the overall experience, I am so glad I saw it in 3D. It is a long film but in a good way. It definitely was the best that they could possible make this film. 8.7 out of 10 just because of the experience.",Null,1,4,21 August 2011
