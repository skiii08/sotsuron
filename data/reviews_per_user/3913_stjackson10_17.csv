Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 5/10 (rewatch)
","I suppose as a kid watching this I excused that which I no longer can. I don't dare to imagine the task of following up the original trilogy, but it pained me to endure just how cheesy some of the writing really is. I understand in an epic like the Star Wars saga is, there must be allocation for such, but it was painfully overdone. I did remember why I loved Obi Wan and the beginning of his arc, and I was also re-angered by my wish that Maul receive the justice he deserves. I appreciate the political tension that soared over my head as a child, and knowing the full story helps me appreciate the subtleties Lucas indulged himself with as he made this trilogy. It was refreshing to watch a Star Wars trilogy that knew where it was going. All in all, a good story to jumpstart the saga, but painful execution in full.",5,1,1,7 January 2020
Darkest Hour," 8/10
","Gary freaking Oldman. That's really all that need be said of this movie. he transformation, the facial expressions, the movement: amazing. One of my favorite all time performances. It honestly made me want a cigar, which is not (??) a good thing. The whole movie managed an exquisite use of tension, and I loved the use of music, though I'd prefer it be used more. Camera-work was crisp and consistent, and I loved the settings. Oldman absolutely stole the show, though. He's in nearly every shot, and the shots he isn't in suffer. All in all, this is his movie, and it may not be the type of performance that earns best actor anymore, but the man deserves it. Incredible",8,0,0,2 January 2020
Knives Out," 9/10
","Near perfect movie. It was tremendously enjoyable to watch. The story had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation, yet the comedic relief was just that. All the actors yielded strong performances. Beautifully written, beautifully designed. Really great movie.",9,1,3,27 February 2020
The Irishman," 9/10
","This movie is three and a half hours long, and I wasn't bored once. Let the record show; that is an impressive accomplishment. As I watched this love letter to all of these people: Scorsese himself, De Niro, Pacino, Pesci, etc. I could not help but feel a twinge of nostalgia and sadness. I have heard a lot of commentary on this film, and I don't wish to repeat what I've heard, but it truly was an incredible ode to age. To see these guys get together for one last time and make a dang good film was one of the most refreshing cinematic experiences that I can remember. this isn't Minnesota Vikings Brett Favre, its Tink Desk Rakim. It was just a really masterful film. All of the age effects worked for me. the timehops were clear, and I just really enjoyed it. Marty is an incredible storyteller. The way he is in complete control of your sentiments the whole way through is masterful. He decides who you feel sorry for and who you dislike. Its his movie, and you play by his rules. Its lengths does not beckon a re-watch anytime soon, but I will cherish my viewing.",9,3,7,12 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," 5/10
","Apologies, but this would be hard to reflect on without spoiling. I went in with low expectations but was still disappointed. It absolutely captures the essence of Disney and what Disney is projected to do with entertainment henceforth. An empty, substanceless cash grab with sickening layers of fan service, I audibly snorted multiple times and the decisions made. I truly disliked the notion of Palpatine spawn. It pushed the boundaries of what we know about the force and lore but made many jumps and stretches with little explanation. Not to mention the Endgame final battle nod (see 'I am Iron Man' + 'I am all the Jedi'). It felt lazy, safe, and void of creativity. I don't presume to know how to conclude a 42 year old saga of paramount importance to so many people, but I am disappointed to say I don't think JJ Abrams does either.",5,4,9,2 January 2020
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," 7/10
","A pleasant surprise. This movie was better than expected. Some of the humor was overplayed and the themes overdone, but overall a quirky, edgy movie that I had not seen anything like prior. I'm not sure if there over-arching messages were genuine, but if they were then it's daring on the side of cheesy. Fun watch though",7,0,0,2 March 2020
City of God," 8/10
","This movie reminded me of my experience watching Beasts of No Nation. It was wonderfully made and frightfully upsetting. I felt as if I got a glimpse into a world I needed to experience but never wanted to. It is dark, it is chilling, it is hopeful, and it leaves you with more than you signed up to leave with. Not something I'm anxious to rewatch, but a masterful film.",8,0,0,26 January 2020
Aladdin," 6/10
","It was fine. I try with all my might to watch these movies for what they are, but even still I found myself thinking, 'Disney, you can do better than this' which I guess is a testament to the brand they've built for themselves. It was a one to one remake of the animated film, and I found myself wondering whether I wanted that or not. Will Smith was fine, but most of acting was not. This is low grade disney",6,1,2,23 April 2020
The Lion King," 7/10
","Seth Rogen cannot sing, but this is exactly what I wanted out of this adaptation. I loved Glover and B; I felt they had great chemistry throughout. I even loved Oliver's character, which I didn't expect. I would prefer it be lighter in some shots. At times it was too dark to enjoy, and it could have used something to progress it as an adaptation. My expectations were met, not exceeded.",7,0,2,5 January 2020
Midsommar," 7/10
","I am disturbed and won't be watching this again. It was at times overwhelming, and I had to take breaks so as to tether myself back to what's real. But isn't that what it's meant for? It looked beautiful. It was ambitious in its cinematography, its sound, and it's ideas.I don't understand a lot, but I'm fascinated by the notion of putting a struggling couple that we all could relate to at the center. What amazing avatars. Florence Pugh - Star. But a hard watch",7,1,10,10 May 2020
La La Land," 10/10
","This movie is perfect; the best movie of the decade. It is impossible to watch this film and not have an emotional response. The colors, the tone, the music all work together to result in a masterpiece of film. The commentary on expectations vs. reality on the dream Hollywood promises will come true. Mia wants to make it big acting; Sebastian wants to open his jazz club, and they both want each other. Hollywood promises that they can have all of that if they want. Can they? The timing, choreography, and charisma of the whole movie is beautiful. I cannot say enough good things about this film.",10,6,8,2 January 2020
Joker," 6/10
","Truthfully, 6/10 feels generous. Simply put, this movie is not really very good. I don't understand the point of it, which is something to be said of a 'comic book' movie. I do understand the Joaquin Phoenix craze, and it truly was an impressive, however repulsive transformation. I don't understand what this movie wants to say, nor do I think the movie quite knows. Its a consistent tone that never rises or falls and sort of sits on your chest like an uncomfortable pressure for the whole film, and it does not work to the film's advantage. I just don't get it, in short.Brian Tyree Henry is the best part of this movie.",6,2,5,13 April 2020
Parasite," 8/10
","I get it now. I understand the hype. This movie is tremendous. Its clever, intentional, and gripping throughout. Every line. Every set piece, every shot is on purpose. It works so deliberately toward its goal without being predictable. Its so absolutely tense, and crescendos in satisfactory fashion.A deep study on class and its implications in society as a whole. It asks questions like what does class hierarchy do to those who suffer from it? The story centers on people who are on the margins of society and are (forced?) to make some unseemly decisions. Who do you root for? And why?This movie WILL stand the test of time.",8,1,2,13 April 2020
Marriage Story," 10/10
","The most emotional film I have ever seen. It resonated with me in a powerful way. I felt invested in the lives of the characters, I cried thrice, and Baumbach made me feel so many things with this. I loved the music, the camera work, and Adam freaking Driver. It is difficult to maintain the same level of emotional tension throughout in movies like this, but he did it. Having a very distanced relationship with divorce, I knew little of what its like to be a part of one, but this movie felt so real and so intimately related to the ugly process. This movie is incredible and sad, and I love it.",10,5,8,2 January 2020
Saving Mr. Banks," 8/10
","In a word; charming. I know not and care not how factual the events of this story are. The way it championed for the goodness of humankind and struck a nerve deeper than was expected, this movie should be celebrated simply for the way it made you cheer for those it wanted you to. Thompson was wonderful. Giamatti was refreshing. Farrell was heartbreaking. Hanks, as dependable as ever. I felt more than I meant to, and wanted justice because Thompson beckoned it. A pleasant surprise.",8,0,0,2 January 2020
Inside Llewyn Davis," 7/10
","Oscar Isaac is the freaking man and don't you forget it. Not the best Coens by a long shot, but it was raw, funny, and sad. The music was great, and it all felt real. I enjoyed this trip.",7,0,0,10 May 2020
Goodfellas," 8/10 rewatch
","This is a great movie and there's no denying that. Is it the pinnacle of gangster cinema? Is it the icon of icons? I don't know. The performances are incredible, specifically De Niro and the actor who plays Karen. Pesci is iconic. I struggle with the tension, or seeming lack thereof at times. Visually, I'm sure it was fantastic for its day. It keeps you involved throughout, but it lacks a narrative tension that I desire to take it from 8 to 9 or 10",8,0,0,11 March 2020
