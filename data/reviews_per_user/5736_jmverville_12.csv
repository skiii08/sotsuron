Scarface," Sympathizing with the Bad Man
","This film has been endlessly parodied and quoted, and we have seen the repercussions in it in most all parts of our culture -- all for a reason... It is quite an epic, intriguing film focusing around an incredibly magnetic, motivated main character.In many ways one of the best portrayals of 'man against the world,' we sympathize with the political refugee from the beginning until the end, and begin to understand and see the world through his eyes. The genius of the film is that, in addition to being an action film, it does not seem to take on the necessity of most other action films of establishing the main character as an unquestionable hero, but rather it forces the audience to see themselves in and to sympathize with a gangster and a coke dealer. It demands of the audience to see things from another perspective, and to enter another man's world & reality, unlike your typical action film.This is one of the better epics put to film -- I would recommend this to anyone, in general, being quite a complete study of the human condition.",7,3,5,20 October 2004
The Longest Yard," Quite Mediocre
","Though this film was riddled with occasionally funny portions, I found that overall much of the humor was offensive and predictable. A lot of the material was not original and seemed as if it was rehashed, had been done before many a time.Furthermore, it seemed s if within the humor of the film they occasionally lost track of the main plot of the film. Plus, the plot was so dry and drawn out that one almost wished that they had totally thrown it out the window and ran without it. There were also rather surreal moments of corniness that jolted me, being suddenly taken into the realm of the melodramatic after laughing at some juvenile humor.Overall, the film was not well put together and not that funny for a comedy. Not a great accomplishment. I do not really recommend anyone to see this film.",4,13,26,28 May 2005
The 13th Warrior," Interesting Play On An Old Legend
","I really enjoyed this film being that it took an old legend and made an interesting, newer version of it that keeps you interested from beginning to end. As far as action films go, it is a terrific film that really speaks to the senses with beautiful fight sequences and imagery. If you enjoy a good battle scene this is definitely a good film for you, being that there is no shortage of them.The film also depicts a good sense of brotherhood amongst everyone, and sort of how people of great differences can come together in the face of opposition to accomplish things. Although the content of the story is not very profound and that I did not fight the acting particularly provocative or good, I still felt as if it was a very good action film and was definitely worth watching. If you are in the mood for medieval battle scenes, you cannot go wrong with this movie.",7,1,2,12 March 2005
12 Angry Men," Great Film Reflecting American Cultural Changes
","12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a 'stubborn, pig-headed' conservative versus 'righteous, just' progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.",7,118,222,20 October 2004
Hotel Rwanda," Good Film With a Strong Story
","Hotel Rwanda is quite a strong story due to the uniqueness of location and topic, as well as the emotionality that is penned into it. I found though, that although the story is very strong and so is Don Cheadle, the rest of the film is not all that it is cracked up to be. Many people like to focus on the good parts of this film (of which there are many), but one must not be so quick to overrate it.Don Cheadle's performance is very convincing and engaging, and as in most of Don Cheadle's roles, he is able to acquire an accent and a whole different method of acting for each role that he takes. He is truly a diverse actor that deserves much credit (and awards) for this performance. However, Nick Nolte plays an aging military man and throughout the film you cannot help but note that the Colonel is weakly portrayed and Nolte acts quite poorly. I have never seen the portrayal of such a military man being so unintentionally weak and sheepish, yet at the same time the attempt to make him seem soldierly. Either Nick Nolte's acting is bad, or Terry George doesn't know what he wants out of the Colonel.Which leads me to elaborate that the film was poorly directed. George, for whatever reason, focuses away from the action of the film (the riots and war in Kingali) to the hectic scene at the Hotel, when it is quite obvious that any viewer after hearing all these reports about warfare on the streets would like to see more than is shown. One could say George is tantalizing us with action, but I am afraid that the action seemingly doesn't exist as it should in this film. The film had endless potential to show the depravity of genocide and war in an active and engaging way, but in the end George focuses on a passive portrayal -- with which I would have had no problems by itself, but it becomes quite unsavory.Furthermore, George also throws inappropriate scenes at inappropriate times, and sometimes the vocal narratives on the radio which are meant to be threatening and scary seem to be comical due to the selection of words. Scenes that bring you in one direction (towards something riveting and compelling) often leave you unfulfilled. George also does not drive home the messages as hard as he could have, and by the end of the film, one can scarcely remember many of the messages that George wanted to drive home, being that one is quite exhausted with the puzzle of plot that George assembles.Overall, it was a good film, but certainly not without flaw. It could have been a much better film had there been a different style of directing (or, in short, a different director).",7,3,5,18 January 2005
Elf," Funny, but lacking
","The film is something quite intriguing with a very unique plotline; from the beginning it looks to be very promising and, is, in fact, promising. However, it misses a certain something that becomes more apparent throughout the film: after a while the pure immaturity of the Elf slowly begins to wear away on you until the film loses all of the original appeal that it had.
Nonetheless, the film has some delightfully entertaining and hilarious portions, though overall it leaves much to be desired. The ending drags out painfully and becomes torturingly corny, nothing that is unpredictable about it. In spite of the ups and downs that one has when watching the film, it can still be called a decent film. There was some very good exercise of comedy and admittedly it is superior to many of the films that have come out, but if you were hoping for anything more than just a slightly entertaining film, you will be disappointed. Aside from the minimal comedy to keep you interested nothing more is offered by the story.The movie should make you laugh, and the movie is worth seeing, but again, it is far less than the Christmas classic that people are claiming.",7,4,7,29 November 2003
Bridget Jones's Diary," Surprisingly Good
","When I saw previews for this film, as a man, I thought that it would not appeal to me. It was really by chance -- seeing it on while a former roommate was watching it, sitting down, expecting to leave within the next five minutes, but I ended up watching the entire thing, becoming completely incapable of pulling myself away from it. In fact, I would later feel compelled to drag somebody along with me to see the sequel that came out in the Fall of 2004 on opening night. It became very obvious that I was greatly mistaken.In an age where 'war' films like Pearl Harbor contain sappy romance stories, this was very bizarre seeing something that was a Romantic Comedy that was more of a comedy than a sappy, clich√© Romance that makes the more sound of mind wish to vomit. I find that opposed to other romantic comedies, this one really embodies a sense of a realist's look at life, and as opposed to focusing on sexy women trying to get sexy men with horrible, predictable jokes being thrown in on occasion, this is far more refreshing. Great performances by everybody involved, and a very refreshing story overall.It breaks all the stereotypes of modern comedy, lacking any crudeness or immature antics, and it breaks all the stereotypes of Romance, giving an honest portrayal of a relationship and the attitudes of normal people, often poking fun at itself. As far as major motion pictures go, this one is a tremendous surprise as far as entertainment & content go. It is the kind of film that anybody can appreciate. If I were to make a list of films that pleasantly surprised me, this would probably be at the very top. A tremendous production.",7,0,2,7 December 2004
Dark City," Poor Example of a Poor Style of Film
","As far as 'interesting,' 'intriguing,' and 'mysterious' go this film seemed to miss them all. It attempted to be mysterious by making up bizarre occurrences along the way, culminating in, essentially, nothing.It was more of a glorification of one, single, solitary human character who, for some unknown reason, was chosen by fate (seemingly) to bring down an evil system that you progressively learn more and more about throughout the course of a film. For a style of film, it is not a very good style; and for execution of this style, it is not a very good film. It is often overly dark and cold without any purpose. It is often an exercise in futility by Proyas to get the viewer to feel something. People consider it philosophical, deep, thrilling, etc. but I find it to be none of the above. Occasionally, a film that is pretty to look at, it is just one of the poorer examples of its genre: a parade of dark-looking figures in a gloomy world with the hope of humanity hinged on a man endowed with special abilities. Naturally, I do not have to tell you how the film ends for you to accurately predict it. And naturally, I do not have to hint at how overdone of a genre it is, and how disappointing it is when push comes to shove. You will find that this film is long-winded and tries to be psychological & philosophical but would only convince me that Mr. Proyas is not a very good director. Do not bother watching this film.",4,8,17,14 December 2004
Zulu," Simply an Incredible Film
","When one sees this film you know great pains were taken in the making of this masterpiece -- of all of the films that I have seen I found this one to be one of the classics that sets a standard for film. Great effort was put into the historical tale-telling. From political and social commentary to great action sequences Zulu is one of the more complete films that you will ever see, having something for everyone. I enjoyed the human aspect of different men, coming together under duress to fight bravely in the face of overwhelming odds; it shows normal men coming together and accomplishing something great in the face of opposition and all the human story that goes along with it. A must-see for anyone who enjoys action & war films.",10,68,89,20 October 2004
28 Days Later...," Worth Seeing, Not Worth Buying
","Although on initial scenes it may just be another 'end of the world' film, it has a bit more substance to it than most. It scratches the surface of the 'what if' scenario, and was done in an interesting way. It provides one with a new way of viewing Zombies, a new way of viewing the survival scenario and what inhumanity exists when humanity fights to exist (as is seen even most initially in the film, and then culminates later on).Overall, the film is nothing special, and if you have a boring Sunday afternoon it would be a decent way to spend it. The action sequences are decent and the film makes you think (but only a little). The plot twists become mundane as the film progresses, and the ending is too reminiscent of other films filmed in the same vein.Overall, a respectable film, but nothing truly thrilling or to be greatly distinguished.",7,0,1,6 November 2003
Black Hawk Down," Honest & Beautiful
","When watching Black Hawk Down, I could not help but observe how honest and beautiful the film was -- portraying, in the beginning, soldiers as how they are (often rowdy and good natured, ready to serve, wanting to serve); a portrayal that you often see, but was done especially well in this film; it takes a lot of the past depictions of war film's portrayal of soldiers and modernizes them, and turns them into something that we can relate to very well. And above this, it took some painstaking steps to remain true to its' genre of war film through incredibly realistic portrayals of the calamity that is war; there are a few scenes in the film that truly show what war is, and what war can be all about. It had moments that were shocking and quite sad, and it really makes the viewer feel and sympathize with them. And, thank God, it takes no Hollywood side-bar love stories further than they ought to be taken (as in a film called Pearl Harbor).In addition to this, the film makes a good effort to give historical background to the film and to show Somalia for what it was during this era of warlords. Although the film may not follow history to a T, it certainly follows it enough to give someone a good idea of what was happening so that we can properly understand a conflict that many of us had forgotten about, and that many of us were ill-informed about. So in addition to the very realistic portrayal of war, we see a very realistic portrayal of the event -- something honorable to the sacrifices that were made by those men.Overall, as far as war films go, this was one of my more favorite films for a very graphic depiction of war as it is, and for a film that was not overly dramatized. The truth was not stretched, no real political message was made to clog the piping of the story/film, it stayed true to its' genre, and the execution of the script was grade A (Ridley Scott directed very well). It was a very honest and beautiful film.",8,3,6,21 October 2004
Hitch," Momentarily Delightful
","This film was very much so characterized by moments -- moments in which it was quite funny, and other moments where it was very touching in its' message concerning love and relationships. However, other than these isolated moments and scenes, it was not worth watching.I felt as if Will Smith and Kevin James did terrific acting jobs, and played very well off of each other. They were a great comic duo and never did I feel that the comedy was either forced or unnatural, and in this regard, the film was impressive. However, other than many of these scenes, the film left me with much to be desired.Though Will Smith carries the film very well, the dialog was trying on my nerves -- sometimes to the point of being distracting from the movie. A lot of the dialog was so corny I could not believe that somebody could say these things aloud and keep a straight face! Furthermore, the story is a bit unbelievable and over-the-top.However, the main spirit of the film and the moments that Will Smith and Kevin James share were very well done, and overall, it was decent enough of a film to watch. I would recommend this as a good film for anyone who wants to share a romantic evening with a light mood, or to anybody who enjoys fast-paced comedy. However, this is by no means one of the better films I have seen, and I wouldn't recommend anybody to go out of their way to see it.",6,7,14,27 February 2005
