Miracle," Titans on Ice
","Great Movie -- saw the sneak preview last week.  Glad to see they made actors out of hockey players, and not the other way around.  Hockey footage is fantastic.  If you liked Remember the Titans, you'll like Miracle -- even if you know nothing about hockey!",10,0,0,4 February 2004
