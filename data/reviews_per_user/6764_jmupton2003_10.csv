National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Off we go in search of that elusive treasure - a decent script!!!
","Well that was poor Now don't get me wrong, the first National Treasure was silly but enjoyable and had at least a decent thread of a plot running through it, therefore imagine my disappointment when I put the sequel in my DVD player.Dear oh dear, an utterly astonishingly awful sequel of which all the major players should be thoroughly ashamed of even being remotely connected with, heaven only knows what the talents of Helen Mirren, Harvey Keitel and Jon Voight were doing in this dire pile of poo.Yes it is watchable but that is only because it is so bad that it is utterly laughable, indeed it has been a good few years since I enjoyed a movie because it was so utterly awful. The plot holes (a tenuous description since there was very little plot to have holes in really) were so huge you could drive a bus (or in this case a beer lorry) right through them.Feel free to sit back and laugh at the inane nonsense of it all as we flash from Washington DC to Paris, then London (cue what should have been an excellent car chase through central London that was very disappointing not to mention geographically impossible!) back to Washington DC and then a few other places by which time I was either losing the will to live or just didn't care anymore until I was asked to believe that a lake had magically been installed at the top of Mount Rushmore so that it provided access to a South American hidden city of Gold.What a load of cobblers.As the team carried on in search of the most elusive treasure of all (that would be a decent script I presume as they were desperately in need of one) there was also the horrific sight of the mysterious 'Page 47' which sadly opens the door for the inevitable Disney dash for cash that sends us on a collision course towards a second sequel.I think I will give that a miss somehow",3,7,10,10 June 2008
Alien 3," The SE Treatment Really Brings This Film TO Life at Last!
","When Alien 3 was first released, it was plagued by studio politics, idiot preview audiences who said 'there's too many bald English blokes in it' and execs who really did not know what they where doing.The end result was a film that the Director refused to have anything to do with and I cannot blame him!  The huge gaping holes in the plot where plain to see and the true spirit of the Alien franchise that had so characterised the first two instalments was lost or at least heavily diluted.Thankfully sense has prevailed and the new Special Edition puts the film as near as possible back the way it should have been.  Don't get me wrong, its still not as good as the all out Directors Edition of Aliens and it still drags a little in places but it is still a darn sight better and well worth the investment.  Once seen, you will never want to see the now dreadful original version ever again.Its just a pity that this treatment did not manage the same kind of transformation on Alien Resurrection!",Null,1,3,6 April 2004
Alien: Resurrection," I'd stick to the theatrical release if I where you!!
","Here be spoilers.Whilst Alien Resurrection was by no means as good as the first two instalments in this highly successful series, it was certainly a lot better than Alien 3 (until that is the much much better Special Edition).Where as the Special Edition treatment transformed Alien 3 from an ugly duckling into a wonderful film, the same treatment for Alien Resurrection has done the reverse.The original version (with the exception of the thankfully few scenes with the cutsey Alien Newborn hybrid) was good, the action kept moving and there was some interesting ideas here.  All right not all of them worked but at least thought went into them.However the Special Edition now adds an atrociously badly done opening title sequence that is both meaningless and has nothing to do with the story whatsoever.  It gets worse as well with some added clunky dialogue that really should have been left on the cutting room floor.The new ending on Earth with the devastated Paris (or is it Blackpool!!!) is rather poor CGI (again as per the opening sequence) and is a rip off of the closing sequence of the excellent (CGI free) similarly devastated Sydney city-scape in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.All in all I would recommend that for better viewing, avoid the Special Edition and stick to the original release, a piece of advice I reverse for the other three editions of this hugely successful series.",Null,0,0,6 April 2004
The Italian Job," Whisper this quietly  this is actually rather good!
","When it was announced that the classic 1960's Michael Caine crime caper The Italian Job was going to be remade  and set in Los Angeles  there was a cry of uproar from avid fans of the original possibly including I admit myself.True fans of the original where careful to avoid the new one and quick of the mark to knock it down often without having even seen it.I reserved judgement until the DVD landed in a bargain bin and I picked up a copy.  To my utmost horror  it was actually rather good.Indeed (sacrilege I hear you cry!) it is just a shade better than the original!  Strong performances, excellent driving and a well written and directed script all lead to probably one of the best remakes of recent times.  Having said that, calling it a remake is a bit wrong really, this is more of a sequel or homage to the original, there is indeed an Italian Job involving the theft of a safe in a daring and original raid in Venice complete with canals.It is the proceeds of this caper that cause all the problems and lead us to the scenario that forms the basis of the film, and all in all it works rather well.There are of course a few areas that don't work, one or two sequences seem a bit slow and unnecessary but overall this is well put together and certainly worth watching although it may not blow everybody's bloody doors off!Just a pity about those naff new type Mini's though.",Null,0,4,29 July 2004
Resident Evil," Complete codswallop!
","Dear oh dear....An unnecessary and irritating rock soundtrack, pathetic special effects, acting straight from a timber yard, non existent plot, naff characters, the list of crimes this 'film' has committed is endless!You really couldn't care less who lives or dies in this and the apparent plot line about espionage and the theft of a virus in order to expose the great Umbrella Corporation was soon forgotten in favour of more badly scripted nonsense.The laser scene was quite nice though and the train was well done.  However it also suffered by being packed to the rafters with dubious references and in jokes to the video game of the same name which the average viewer of this rubbish would not get and wonder why on earth it was included.Bargain bin fodder only - 2/10",Null,0,0,18 March 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Nice penguin, pity about the rest of it
","It could have been so good. Bring together the two most fearsome off world life forms in movie history in a face off and then drop some poor schmucks in the meat grinder along with them.Sounds good doesn't it? What a pity therefore that five films of back story (all right, six if you must count Alien Resurrection!) were all but disregarded in favour of this dreadful mess.OK, lets get the good points out of the way first as it will be quicker. The soundtrack was a little generic but good and the penguin was cute.Now for the bad bits, I hope you are sitting comfortably as this could take a while.First the cast, some interesting choices and bringing in the original Mr Weyland in the form of the now very old looking Lance Henriksen was a good idea but the rest of the cast (with the possible exception of the aforementioned penguin of course) were forgettable, even the one or two established actors such as Colin Salmon.The characters were woefully underdeveloped but in the majority this didn't matter too much as many of them were fairly swiftly dispatched in one PG-13 style ungruesome manner or another. It is remarkable though that Mr Weyland hired the best so called experts money could buy yet most of them seemed to know about as much on their so called specialist subject as I know about nuclear physics.They weren't helped of course by a ropey script, some really atrocious dialogue and one of Hollywood's most infamous and indeed talent less directors.Then there are our two main players themselves. The Aliens did their bit but for the majority of the time they seemed to content themselves with lurking on over hanging ledges and laughing themselves silly at the Predators.The Predators provided the aforementioned amusement by being lumbering and inept beyond belief, the fact that they also appeared to have overdosed on coffee, doughnuts and pies adding to the unintentional comedy.If this was a stand alone alien life forms having a punch up story (i.e. the Alien and Predator films did not exist) then this would just about worked but it isn't so it doesn't, and quite badly at that! The one thing that marked out the original Alien films apart from their overall attention to detail, excellent lighting, photography, cast choices etc was that after watching one of these, you would look around you in the dark, a little nervous as to whether an Alien was lurking just over your shoulder waiting to pounce, they were that good.This family friendly padded rubbish had none of this gritty tension and even those parts of the 'plot' that were all but lifted verbatim from the original Alien and Predator films were so badly used, filmed and directed that even the most die hard fans of the two series could do nothing more than shake their head slowly in sheer disgust.The really bad news is that this stinking turkey is to get a sequel - WHY? Has the cinema going public not suffered enough from this one. One predicts the murky world of straight to video may be the sequel's (better than deserved) fate.... I hope! Strictly a film for the bargain bin only, and then only if you cannot find your Alien ultimate box set or Predator DVD's.",3,1,3,4 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Mind Numbingly Awful..
","Mind Numbingly Awful..If I was an eleven year old watching this film, I would have walked out of the cinema citing this as an insult to my intelligence. Don't believe the hype about Harry Potter as it is little more than a large cash cow that the studio execs signed up to drain as many children (and their parents) as possible of their cash.The story is atrociously bad, the acting not much better and the special effects pretty bad. The whole plot is utterly ridiculous and packaged together in a film so dreadfully written that it should never have made it into print let alone onto celluloid.It is extremely rare that a film, even a really bad unwatchable one makes me want to switch off before the end but I had to turn over after just ten minutes as I could not stand this utter codswallop any longer.And yet the popularity of this series seems never ending as sad people dress up their kids in badly imitated costumes from the films so they can queue up outside bookshops in the middle of the night to purchase the latest instalment. I appreciate that Star Wars makes fans queue around the block (Ok maybe not the tiresome prequel trilogy) but at least that has some redeeming features to it that do not insult the intelligence.Avoid this badly written claptrap at all costs!",Null,2,4,30 August 2006
War of the Worlds," Nice Special Effects  Pity About The Rest of It..
","Nice Special Effects  Pity About The Rest of It..This attempt by Steven Spielberg to bring us a 21st Century interpretation of the classic H.G. Wells was certainly a brave project so what did we get? In the end we had a very well made film but with some notable low points that just did not seem to gel properly. The special effects were impressive as was the photography and direction whilst for the most part, the cast did their bit.However we can only speculate as to how good this film really could have been were it not for a number of major failings.Characters  There was not really a single memorable character amongst the cast, with the exception of Cruise's battling divorced father (and even he had a number of faults), their was an awful lot of cardboard cut outs, cannon fodder and plot device carriers with no depth or even names for the most part.The Kids  Any movie with clichéd 'irritating yet cute' characters grates with me. Once again instead of a couple of ordinary reasonably intelligent children, we got the delinquent teenager with the attitude problem and the irritating little girl with the health issues (allergic to peanut butter, back problems and claustrophobic). If this is representative of the majority of the youth of today then quick frankly its time to pull the plug on the entire human race! The Nutter  Tim Robbins is a great if underused character actor but his role in this as the nutter in the cellar was utterly pointless and should have been jettisoned at the first script review.The Plot Holes  You could see the car being repaired just in time plot line coming a mile off. Meanwhile there was no apparent explanation of how on earth the teenage delinquent son managed to escape certain death to appear once more at the end although yet again I suspected this was what was going to happen.The Alien Defeat  Yes I am fully aware that the way the alien's just roll over and die in mid battle because of bugs in the air is indeed in the original story but it still smacks of a lack of imagination Star Trek style end of episode reset switch that brings the story to a juddering halt.The Sound Track  What has happened to John Williams of late? There was a time when the musical genius could do no wrong but yet his recent work, notably the totally out of character (in comparison with the rest of the series) soundtrack for Star Wars Episode III plus this have been very weak and lacking the classic punch and glory of his earlier workWith a bit better script, some attention to the obvious weaknesses and maybe even some different casting, this could have been excellent but as it is, it is watchable but disappointingly average.",4,1,1,30 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," What a disappointment.
","From the very beginning with its inexplicable space battle through numerous plot twists that didn't seem to mean anything to the seemingly rushed conclusion, this long awaited final episode in the legendary Star Wars saga was just a tad disappointing.I had hoped that the progression that had seen the awfully lame Phantom Menace lead to the much improved Attack Of The Clones would continue and in terms of special effects and production quality it did.However what should have been the best of the new trilogy was let down by clunky acting, poor dialogue and plot holes you could drive a Star Destroyer through.Padme was reduced to little more than a plot device bit part and what happened to John Williams' soundtrack? There we are in the middle of a major fight in the control room of Count Dooku's ship and bizarrely no thumping soundtrack like the Star Wars music we know and love, it was like a key character of the story was missing and this made some scenes seem very flat and empty.The main problem for the film was that it had about two and a half hours to fit in a list of things that needed doing so that it led (badly) into Episode IV. They had to bring the audience up to date on what had happened since Clones, dispense with the Jedi by whatever means necessary and turn the Chancellor into the Emperor (a wonderful performance by Ian McDiarmid who was clearly enjoying himself immensely. Watch out for the funny looks he gives R2D2 during the crash landing sequence!!) Also they had to convert Anakin into a nutter almost overnight and get him measured up for the most famous suit in cinema history all whilst throwing a very long (too long in my opinion) final light sabre duel whilst dodging a lot of lava in the most implausible sequence in the history of the entire Star Wars saga! It may grow on me but I think I'll stick to the proper original theatrical release of episodes IV V and VI thank you very much!",7,2,4,8 December 2005
Prometheus," So near and yet so far
","To summarise the much anticipated Prometheus:Fantastic visual effects Amazing attention to detail Lots of nice little nods to the 'Alien' universe Wonderful soundtrackPity therefore about the non-sensical storyline and lousy script then as this made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I like a challenging story that actually makes you think but the only thing that this - and lets be honest here â€“ utter mess made me think was 'what the hell is going on?' and that was before we even got to the last third of the film where things really fell apart.For me this was one of my most anticipated films in years, a brilliantly created build up of trailers and other publicity sold this film (as it should of course) and almost tempted me to go and see a film at the cinema for the first time in twenty years.Oh boy am I glad I resisted that temptation as when I put the DVD in my player I was gob-smacked at how disjointed and completely muddled up the storyline was. Whilst it was lovely to spot the nods to previous 'Alien' films that were nicely incorporated throughout and I was delighted to see that the same visual look had been continued, it did little to hide the fact that from a story telling point of view, this film is a turkey.I so wanted this to be brilliant and in all bar the story (and some of the rather wooden acting) it was. Therefore for me I have to say this was a very nicely done missed opportunity that should have been so much better.",4,2,5,20 October 2012
