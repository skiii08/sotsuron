Miracle," The truth behind building a team
","'Miracle' tells the story of the 1980 US Olympic Hockey team that beat the USSR at the Lake Placid games. The film gives a great account about how to put together a winning team and what their win in 1980 did for the United States.Kurt Russell, the only really well known actor in the cast, is Herb Brooks, the coach who threw out the old plans for playing Olympic hockey, and molded a young team into winners.The focus is on Brooks and his work during the short 7 months before the games.It is by far the best role for Russell since 'Backdraft'.Most Hollywood films of historical subjects get watered down, affected by too much 'dramatic license', or tries to appeal to the modern movie demographic (read 12 year old males). 'Miracle' does none of that.Having actually watched the team play in 1980 on television, the events during those games were portrayed factually. Even the clothing and other cultural items of the times were done factually. Herb Brooks and the other members of the team served as consultants so the authenticity of the story was maintained.Being a Disney film, it was able to use video and audio from the ABC network coverage of the 1980 games including the play by play of Al Michaels. It was a hoot to see the old video clip of Michaels and his perm during the intro to the big Soviet game.As for the hockey, be prepared to sit through most of the film before the action gets going. The main focus is how the team was put together and molded into a team, besides most us know how the game ends. The hockey action is real and intense just as should be. The producers cast people current and former hockey players.One quibble I have with the film is that it really didn't go into the ground swell of support the team got by the time they got to the medal round. 79 million people watched the game versus the Soviets on television and when the US team won, the nation went nuts. And that was even with the game being on tape delay - held for prime time viewing and the results had leaked out by then.Another quibble is the filmmakers spent a lot of effort on the sound for the hockey scenes (according to the DVD extras) yet the crowd noise in the Soviet game at the Olympics sounds off. On TV the place was rocking by the end which made the event even more intense. That is missing from the film.Even with the quibbles, I do believe that 'Miracle' will become a classic sports movie much like 'Hoosiers' has become. The underdog taking on an impossible task and winning, will always be a great feel good story.",10,0,0,8 February 2004
The Hunger Games," A Young Adult Film That Is Actually Good
","I was concerned before seeing The Hunger Games movie if I would actually enjoy it since the film isn't for me. I was worried too, not having read the books, and hearing about the plot, if young people should be seeing a film with violence as a primary plot device. Luckily I was wrong on all accounts. The Hunger Games is a young adult film that was actually good and the violence wasn't as graphic as I feared. I recommend it.I hadn't read any of the books in the trilogy but knew enough about the plot that I was concerned the violence would be on par to the trashy horror movies seen recently like the 'Final Destination' series. The film used all kids of tricks to get the sense of the violence without actually seeing buckets of blood or guts. That's good for those with kids in the age range this film is targeted.The other themes that I think aren't seen much in young adult films these days like self-sufficiency, altruism, poverty, starvation, and fascism, are some things we should explore, warts and all, although I'm not quite sure if younger people will understand those on first watch. I do think those ideas will seep into their heads and come back when they are much older. This is a film that lends itself to discussion between parents and children afterward.Jennifer Lawrence who played the main character Katniss Everdeen, has been on my radar since she was on the Bill Engvall Show on TBS (2007-2009). I also enjoyed her performance in Winter's Bone in 2010 which got her an Oscar nomination. She has a very expressive face and her bright blue eyes give her a gravitas that most young actresses have to grow into over time.The rest of the cast was great. I really liked Stanley Tucci's Caesar Flickerman (the TEETH!) and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna (that guy starts at Cool). The only person I thought seemed out of place was Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy. I think it was his wig. It seemed too fake.Being an old guy I was disappointed there wasn't a lot of actual game play. The game didn't start until half way through the film and then not a lot happens action wise. IMHO. I wanted to see more game play from Katniss. She is portrayed as very smart with natural survival skills and except for the scheme to destroy the supplies of the professional tributes, she didn't do a lot game playing. I was wondering if she would even be able to kill anyone. That was probably the point.There was a love story, well actually a triangle if Gale is included, and that is the main focus of the film. That story plays a major part of the plot and I expected it. Luckily it isn't as sappy as I thought. It seemed real and natural and not contrived.Another great part of this film is the protagonist is female and not one of those vain ones that need to be saved by a man that we tend to see in films written by men. I liked that Katniss actually saved Peeta. I think our film industry could stand more of this kind of female roles and not the usual brooding comic book buttheads.The only real problem I had with the film was the stakes weren't high enough. We know how it would end even if you hadn't read the books (it is one of a trilogy). I know they couldn't significantly change the story so I was disappointed with the ending. But overall that's a minor quibble. It would be more of a problem if it was an original story.There has been some chatter about how the Hunger Games seems to rip off the story from a Japanese film. No matter if that is true or not I just remember what my writing teacher told me years ago: all the good ideas have been written - judging a book (or film) is how that old idea is presented.In other parts the film reminded me of other films I had seen like Blade Runner, Star Wars, and even Romeo & Juliet. I think this film does a great job with the story even if we've seen it before.I recommend 'The Hunger Games'.",8,4,12,28 March 2012
The Rocker," Driving a bus through my suspension of disbelief
","So why was this movie so bad? You have Rainn Wilson with a paunch and terrible hair piece in the flashback scenes and the scenes set in the present, who played drums for a cheesy teen pop band, who were happy to have a video on 2008s version of MTV, who had a party hosted by MySpace, rode to gigs in a bus (really? A new band with no album yet), are scheduled to open for a heavy metal band (poor kids - the band not the audience), and have an out-of-left-field break up.Google the term tone deaf.There needs to be some parts of a movie that don't shatter the suspension of disbelief but every minute of this movie seem to do just that for me.The only good thing about the film was the kids playing the band.",4,1,4,24 April 2014
Superbad," Ode to the horny nerd
","It seemed like 'Superbad' stole stories from my life. If you are in high school and a nerd, sex pretty much consumes your entire being. It just seems so much fun and you want to do it, but you are a nerd so it won't happen unless you go to college or get the woman drunk.One of your friends, the loud mouth king of the nerds, has a fool proof plan. You're so convinced it will work that you plan on what it will be like and anticipate it to the nth degree. Then when your potential paramour practically puts her boobs in your hands your moral center shuts everything down. You make excuses that you like your friends too much and it is no big deal.That's why I liked this movie. It just seemed so real and so funny at the same time. There was various body fluids flowing, liberal use of all kinds of curse words, and some bits of homoeroticism. This film makes American Pie seem like Dawson's Creek.My favorite part was a small one. After a class, Evan, played by Michael Cera, and his lust goddess Becca, played by Martha MacIsaac, are talking in the hall. It is the classic awkward 'I like you but am too scared to really say it' talk. Becca throws Evan a lifeline - making it very clear that she wants him to ask her out, without saying the words, and he misses it completely.There were some bits that were over the top but it was a comedy and not a documentary.The only problem I had with the movie is that it gave away a lot of the most funny bits in the trailers and cast plugs on the talk show. One real funny bit was available in full on the official website. These clips didn't give the whole movie away but did take something away for me.",8,1,7,19 August 2007
Forrest Gump," Something for everybody
","You either like this film or you hate it. There is something for everybody. It gives a good review of the major events in history during Forrest's time. It is a classic love story between Gump and his girl Jenny. It also shows that there can be happy endings even in difficult times.I was more interested in Jenny's journey through the film but Tom Hank's performance deserved the Oscar he got. Robin Wright's performance, as Jenny, is just as good and blew me away.I challenge anybody not to be affected by the last 30 minutes.",10,1,4,12 November 2000
The Aviator," Great looking film with an only average narrative
","The Aviator is a fictionalized account of the peak years of tycoon Howard Hughes from the late 20's to late 40's.I went to see this movie because I like history and learn about historical figures in the context of the times they lived in.Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hughes, who inherited millions from his father's drill bit company and spent millions on making movies and fast airplanes. Hughes was also a ladies man having relationships with many of the women who worked in Hollywood.I didn't buy DiCaprio as Hughes early in the film. He seemed far too young and in close ups one could see his 'soul' patch that the actor likes to wear. It wasn't until after the horrific test crash when he gets Hughes' trademark pencil mustache that I started to see Hughes. DiCaprio even had the same kind of wrinkles Hughes had on his forehead when he was intense. That creeped me out.Even with the slight flaw DiCaprio showed the range of Hughes. From driven multitasking tycoon to disturbed germophobic, his acting was great.Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn, Hughes' first serious paramour. Blanchett gave an excellent performance. You could tell she spent time studying early Hepburn films and reading interviews.Kate Beckinsale plays fiery Ava Gardner. Beckinsale had Gardner to a tee going from loving to tyrant just like the real actress.John C. Reilly played Hughes business manager Noah Dietrich. Dietrich paid attention to the business side of Hughes even though the boss could care less. Reilly turns in another excellent performance.The film was beautifully shot and the time period seemed authentic. I expect that from Director Martin Scorsese but the story misses the mark.Some stories indicated that Scorsese made the film using different color processes to match the time periods in the movie. This is a gimmick only a film geek will love. The only thing I noticed was a dinner scene that had blue peas.Some people will applaud the lack of graphic sex scenes but in this case the film really didn't sell how much of a womanizer Hughes was. They showed him focusing on a woman and sweet talking her till she swooned but there was no sex scenes or even a scene where the couple wakes up the next morning. It would also add some insight to see if Hughes' germophobia affected his sex life. For a man who would freak out seeing a spot on some else's suit how would he ever get through a night of lovemaking.Then there are the scenes where Hughes, on the rebound from Hepburn, is dating a 15 year old. What?? Where did that come from?? The couple are at the local club and no one seems to notice or care. During that time people weren't open with those kind of relationships. Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin had run ins with the law over under aged lovers.The best parts of the film are when Hughes is multitasking. Talking to his aircraft designer about a design and in the next sentence ordering scenes cut from a movie he was making. Another great scene is the Senate hearing where Hughes is called to answer the charges he was a war profiteer. There are some great quotes that can apply to our current defense contracting issues. Alex Baldwin, as Juan Tripp, Hughes' airline rival, and Alan Alda as Tripp's paid Senator Brewster were equally slimy as the villains.The film is 2 hours and 45 minutes and the first half seems to focus on Hughes relationship with Hepburn. I am not sure she deserved as much focus as she got.The plane crash sequence went on far too long for what it delivered. Yes, it was needed because it was defining moment for Hughes. He lived with the health issues from the crash for the rest of his life, but the special effect shot just wasn't need to run as long as it did.One special effects shot I did love was filming the climax to the movie 'Hell's Angels'. It was obviously a computer shot but was breath taking none the less.Overall I thought Scorsese channeled Hughes the director too much. There was much that could be trimmed downed or dropped and still tell a good story. What is on the screen is fine but it just misses being a great film.6/10",6,4,7,26 January 2005
Silver Linings Playbook," Just Misses Being Oscar Worthy
","Movies about people with mental illnesses isn't my usual thing unless it is a documentary. Family dysfunction played for laughs can be entertaining. I liked Silver Lining Playbook even though the main plot wasn't my usual taste. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence did a good job. I don't think the film is worthy of the Oscar nominations it got but it was worth the money I spent on the ticket which is a good thing.Bradley Cooper plays Pat, a man who has finished a stint in a mental health facility after an 'incident' involving his wife and another man. He has previously undiagnosed Bi-polar syndrome but decides to will himself better so he can return to his wife and former life. He tries to maintain a positive attitude even to the point of delusion. Due to the terms of his release he is forced to move back in with his parents, played by Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver. Pat's mood swings result in waking up his parents to listen to random rants in the middle of the night and to then tune out when his father berates him for a trivial slight.De Niro's Pat Sr. has some issues of his own. He's a bookie with an obsession with sports superstitions while Weaver's well intentioned Dolores tries to gloss over and ignore the family issues simmering below the surface.Jennifer Lawrence plays Tiffany who tries to cope as a young widow of a police officer by sleeping with everyone she comes in contact with. She lives with her parents as well but in a renovated detached garage. Her family which includes her sister Veronica, played by Julia Stiles, have their own dysfunctional issues. Veronica is a demanding wife driving her husband Ronnie, played by John Ortiz, into fits of rage he takes out on random objects in the garage.I really liked how all are these people seemed broken in one aspect or another from irrational dependence on superstitions to using sex as a coping mechanism. I think it might have been boring if Pat and Tiffany were the only 'crazy' people in the film.The acting seemed real and natural but I did have issues with some of the funny moments. Some of the comedy fell flat to me because it was too absurd for the situation. The laugh out loud moments were few and far between for my tastes. I know it wasn't trying to be a sitcom but the pacing seemed off where I was put off guard during some of the comedic moments.Another issue I had was some plot holes. For example it seems all the main characters seemed to know each other before the time set in the film but in the beginning it seemed they didn't know each other. I got confused. Pat Jr. knows Veronica because she is his BFF Ronnie's wife but he barely knows Tiffany even though she lives in the same neighborhood. Pat walks Tiffany home from Veronica's then walks home himself? Those moments didn't make sense. Then there seems to be more with Pat's mom, Dolores, trying to get Pat and Tiffany together but it's only mentioned in passing late in the movie like maybe there was a scene or two taken out.Don't get me started on the tacked on character Danny, Pat's friend from the mental hospital, played by Chris Tucker. He either was added at the last minute or maybe his appearance in the film was cut back in editing because he seems so under used in the film for no apparent reason.However, the last 30 minutes made the film for me and washed away many of the problems. I really liked the ending and it was satisfying.I think this film got several Oscar nominations because of writer/director David O. Russell and probably because many Hollywood types see themselves in Russell's dysfunctional world. I think these kind of films don't push the envelope hard enough and I get bored with quirky 'crazy' people.I just don't find movies about people with mental illness to be entertaining. It is a fine line to walk and while I applaud Russell for the attempt, I think 'Silver Linings Playbook' falls short of the goal posts.I don't think the film is Oscar worthy but it is above average and worth the ticket price I paid.",7,1,3,18 January 2013
Ratatouille," Very Disappointed
","I had a decision to make. I had time to see one movie on Sunday. Either Ratatouille or Transformers. I was never a fan of the Transformers show when I was a kid. So I read various reviews on the two movies on non-IMDb websites to get a gist of both films. Unlike IMDb, both films were getting positive but not great reviews over all. Ratatouille had far more positive reviews than Transformers so I picked Ratatouille.Simply put, Ratatouille is just average at best. The animation was nothing spectacular. I guess the novelty of Computer animation is wearing off. It was pretty close it not the same as the old style cell animation.No matter what tricks or special effects a film uses, it doesn't mean anything unless the story is good. The story in Ratatouille was just average. It was cute in spots but tedious in other places. A lot of the supporting characters were played up only to be discarded quickly and the main villain had no setup at all. You only knew he was the bad guy because he had the standard bad guy sinister look - that was it.An animated feature film should have some truths inside it. It should touch on the real world with real emotions and Ratatouille missed it in a big way. Rats around food is just gross, even cartoon rats, especially if the animators spent months or years to get the look 'just right'. Maybe if it was dog trying to cook but a rat was just wrong.The best animated features are those that contain at least a nod to the adults in the audience who brought their children to the show. Remember in The Incredibles, the superhero family had real family issues to deal with. You could turn to an adult sitting next to you and say 'Ain't that the truth' or there could be the inclusion of jokes that kids find funny but adults really find funny because they were directed at them. Ratatouille had none of this. In fact the film wasn't that funny.Brad Bird get credit for at least taking a chance with the characters and the plot but the execution missed for me. I was very disappointed.",5,7,17,9 July 2007
Dirty Dancing," It is the time of your life
","This is the 80's version of 'Grease'. The good girl falls hard for the bad boy. Throw in some sex and rock & roll and stir with a social message subplot. What you get is a fun film with enough drama to take the sugar edge off.If you like this film you will watch it over and over until you know the lines and the songs by heart. Trust me, it happened in my house.",7,2,3,12 November 2000
Batman Begins," This film shows that good drama is much more important than the latest CGI effect
","I saw the film tonight and I was glad to finally have something to watch besides one fight after another. Batman Begins is film-making and not just a cheap advert for merchandise.All the main characters had depth and were all real. The story allows the viewer to connect emotionally to the characters. That seems to be missing from most 'blockbuster' fare.It reminded me of the first Spider-Man movie and I enjoyed that one as well.I am still a big fan of the 1989 Batman with Michael Keaton, but Christian Bale makes the role his own. When he has the suit on he is menacing yet he seems perfectly normal as Bruce Wayne.Michael Cain turns in an excellent performance as Alfred. Morgan Freeman is really one of our great actors and his role as tech geek Lucius Fox is another feather in his cap. Katie Holmes shows her growing maturity as Rachel Dawes, Bruce's childhood friend and Gotham A.D.A.This film shows that good drama is much more important than the latest CGI effect.It deserves sequel and is easily the best of the summer so far.",10,0,1,18 June 2005
Meet the Fockers," On par with the first even with a few misses
","Meet the Fockers is the sequel to the hit Meet the Parents (2000). In this film Gaylord (Greg) Focker, played by Ben Stiller, and Pam Byrnes, played by Terri Polo, worry about the first meeting of their parents before their planned marriage.Of course stuff hits the fan as uptight Jack Byrnes, played by Robert De Niro, meets Bernie Focker, played by Dustin Hoffman, and Roz Focker, played by Barbara Streisand.The Fockers are elder hippy types (free love and self esteem) who utterly love their Greg. Jack hates it. He is about being a winner on a winning team.Greg isn't happy either. His parents are themselves and they embarrass him constantly.This is a funny movie with more laughs than the first. Of course they mine the gutter for some laughs but the more mature humor is excellent.I went to see the movie because of Stiller. I find him funny as the nervous uptight guy who tries so hard to do the right thing then sees it blow up in his face. He is a lovable loser. However in Meet the Fockers, Greg seems normal and on occasion seems to fade in the background when Hoffman and Streisand are on the screen. I was a bit disappointed with Greg this go around.Robert De Niro did another good job as Jack. I was expecting him to do his mafia stuff at several points. That would have been extra funny.I was surprised with Hoffman and Streisand. Dustin is plain loopy through most of the film and he is a hoot to watch. Some other actors have said that is how he is off screen. I would love to hang out with him.Barbara Streisand just shines in her role as Roz. It reminded me of the comedies she did in the 70's like 'For Pete's Sake' and 'Main Event'.While the movie was funny and fun to watch there were some issues I had with it.I did like the moment where Jack calls Greg out on a lie he told in the first movie. For those of us who saw the first one, that was a good laugh. Where the aside to the first film missed the mark was when Greg and Pam run into the flight attendant that had Greg arrested in the first movie. Greg sort of acted like he knew her but the writers missed a great chance at a joke there. It have been that Stiller underplayed the meeting.The character of Jack Jr. - Jack's toddler grandson just wasn't needed. There was a bit where Greg is watching the tike and the trouble that comes from that but overall they should have not had the baby.The subplot with Greg's childhood Nanny was a bit on the tasteless side and didn't help the film. The speech that Greg makes at the party was painful to watch - the humor was much too dark on that one.Except for those issues I kind of hope they do a 3rd film.",9,1,3,5 January 2005
Seabiscuit," Good but should have been better
","I saw this film based on the great trailer and earlier in the year I saw the PBS documentary so I this was one movie I really waited to see.I was kind of disappointed.I sat there watching the movie and the problems were obvious. Gary Ross, the director, tried to touch all the bases but in doing so ended up with only a good movie. He had the classic Hollywood dream of a the little guy beating the odds, people who get a second chance, and how Seabiscuit was a great symbol and metaphor for the times. Those elements were there but in trying to cram the whole story into the 2 hour plus running time, Ross didn't execute it well.The photography was excellent. The racing scenes were great, but the overall film missed for me.If I were making the movie I would condense as much as possible the human character's back story. I really didn't need to see the scene of Tom Smith (Chris Cooper) catching the wild horse and sleeping under the stars at the beginning of the movie. A much better scene was when Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges) first sees Smith in Mexico. There were quite a bit of stuffing in the beginning that added nothing to the story or to the true story.The David McCullough narration at the very beginning was a nice intro but after that it took away from the flow of the film and in fact would mislead those who don't know the real true story. The black and white montages also seemed to hit one over the head about how bad the economy was. It wasn't important to have those points explained explicitly. It should have come from what was filmed and through the characters. This was suppose to be an entertainment film not a documentary.We also are mislead by the War Admiral match race. It is built up through a good portion of the film but then we learn that isn't the end as it should be. We get a large portion of the rest of the story. For a documentary that is great but for a dramatic film it was anti-climatic.Ross could have had a great film if he had picked the scenes he filmed with the tried and true dramatic arc that make films entertainment. I would have ended the film with the race against War Admiral.My 'Seabiscuit' would have started with Howard going to Mexico and meeting Smith. Then Seabiscuit is purchased and all the problems with that. Then Smith sees Red and gets him to be the jockey for the horse and the final part of the film would be the match race.",Null,0,0,28 July 2003
The Hurt Locker," Not the best of 2009
","Although I had no plans to see 'The Hurt Locker' as I tend to shy away from modern war movies especially any with Iraq as the battle front, I did see it recently after hearing buzz about it being the best film of the year. In fact one report had director James Cameron - ex-husband of the film's director Kathryn Bigelow - saying that 'The Hurt Locker' was the 'Platoon' of the Iraq war.I have to disagree. While it's a good movie especially for Bigelow, I don't think it's the best film of 2009.The reason it's good but not great is that the last third kind of drags and the character arcs aren't done very well. The acting was decent - even above average - but after seeing one bomb disposal scene you've seen them all.Unlike 'Platoon' there was little battle action. Watching the unit work was interesting but not much happened with them and a couple of scenes of extended battle action seemed out of place to be honest. There also was a jarring setting at home for one of the characters that showed up all of a sudden.The film 'Platoon' also used their scenes to comment on the political and social aspects of the Vietnam conflict through the actions and interactions of the members of the platoon. In 'The Hurt Locker' there really was none of that.There have been better Iraq war movies including the recent mini-series on HBO called - 'Generation Kill' - that had more elements in common with Platoon than this film did.As I said 'The Hurt Locker' was a good movie and interesting but not the best of 2009 and certainly not 'The Platoon of the Iraq War...' unless you think a good war movie just has brooding men and no commentary on the war itself.",7,1,4,1 March 2010
Garden State," There is so much depth in the story and characters that it gives you a lot to think about.
","Garden State is one of the best films of 2004. There are no car chases, explosions, or cgi effects. This film just has a great story and great acting. Zach Braff does an excellent job for his first directing effort and the script shows he really cared about the story.Natalie Portman plays one of the most original characters in recent filmdom as Zach's love interest, Sam. Portman's acting makes the quirky Sam so natural and believable that it seems we are watching a home movie rather than a feature film.Peter Sarsgaard, plays Zach's friend from his younger days, Mark. Although he is a grave digger, his character was just as natural and believable as Sam.Braff, as Andew Largeman, who is estranged from his family, is summoned back to New Jersey after his mother pass away. To say he has issues is an understatement. He decides to take a vacation from the medications he has been on for years so he can reconnect with his family and home. He meets Sam at a Doctor's office one day and they hit it off.Largeman's friends are still pretty much living the lives they lived when they were in high school as an early drug and sex party reveals. Andew can be seen as being out of place which would be common for someone who had been gone as long as he had been.I thought that this movie would be a rip off of Zach's character from his TV show but I'm glad I was wrong. Although 'J.D.' does come out from time to time, this is Zach's movie.Ian Holm plays Andrew's father but it seems Zach let this relationship and the confrontation that is hinted at disappear for no real reason. Jean Smart makes a great cameo as Mark's mother who still thinks she is a teenager and wants a hit off her son's bong. There is also a funny running bit involving all the various pets owned by the various people in the movie.Although a great movie, besides the unresolved son/father issue, the film also dropped the issue with Mark robbing graves. Also the pat Hollywood ending while not totally destroying what came before did seriously damage the uniqueness of this film.I still felt that watching this film was much like reading a novel. There is so much depth in the story and characters that it gives you a lot to think about.",8,0,1,29 August 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," More style than substance
","I finally had the chance to watch 2001 all the way through and I must say it was dull for most of the time. As a piece of art I guess it would be fine but to actually pay money to see it would be a stretch.I try to have an open mind when viewing films and I may have a bias because of the times we live in today, but if you can't figure out what the film is about then the filmmaker failed and this film fails.I'm not asking for the 'meaning' to be handed to me on a plate but one needs to see a basic structure in order to suggest a meaning in the viewers mind.The first part of the film with the apes, I could see the point being made. The part of the film set on the ship with HAL was another good bit of story telling. The parts in between added nothing to the plot.It really reminded me of the film 'Empire' or even '****' both by Andy Warhol where every detail is shown no matter how useless it is to the story. The part of 2001 where we follow Dr. Floyd on his trip first to the space station and then to the moon - it is almost like watching it in real time. I'm bothered by the current fashion of the music video fast cuts but did we really need to see Floyd's moon transport being lowed into the moon base after it lands? I do like Stanley Kubrick's films and he is a great director but many of his later films were more coherent than 2001. I'm glad he got better over the long run - 'Eyes Wide Shut' being the exception of course.",4,2,6,12 February 2006
Wedding Crashers," Vince Vaughn should get an Oscar for his tour de force
","'Wedding Crashers' is the funniest movie I've seen so far. The film is a Vince Vaughn tour de force. Owen Wilson is good in his laid back persona we know so well. There are cameos aplenty and the supporting characters are more than wallpaper to the Vaughn and Wilson skits.Vince and Owen play 2 divorce mediators who love to show up uninvited at weddings for the free food and to pick up single women. That premises is funny by itself. Add in Vaughn's hyperactive party animal we last saw in 'Swingers' and Wilson's suave intellectual and it takes the comedy up a notch.This film was bust-a-gut funny for adults without being gross. Only one bathroom joke here. It was so nice to finally see a comedy that was aimed at adults and not 12 year old boys. But that doesn't mean 12 year old boys were ignored - there is some good looking women topless through out the film.Rachel McAdams plays Claire, Owen's love interest. She is the most normal of the Cleary clan. Isla Fisher's, who chews up scenes just like Vaughn, plays the spoiled crazy sister Gloria Cleary. Keir O'Donnell as Todd Cleary is the disaffected artist loner of the family and Ellen Albertini Dow plays Grandma Mary Cleary, who has some inappropriate things to say about Eleanor Roosevelt and Todd.While Christopher Walken plays it pretty straight as Secretary Cleary, Jane Seymour plays against type as Kathleen Cleary a sex starved MILF. In one scene where she is coming on to Owen Wilson I thought to myself 'Dr. Quinn!!!' and her inappropriate comments to Owen during the film were shockingly funny.2nd place to Vaughn for best performance has to go to Sack Lodge, played by Bradley Cooper. Cooper walks the fine line of being an ass and being over the top. He played a misogynist environmentalist who liked to hunt. That was humorous because most would think an environmentalist to be sweet and poetic all the time. Not Cooper and that was fun to watch.The story was predictable but the comedy allowed me to ignore that. The film runs about 2 hours and while it does start to drag toward the end, the final scenes allow it to end on a high note.Vaughn and Wilson were the best when they bickered but Vaughn still had the best lines and best gags. Vince should get some awards out of his performance and with dearth of good movies this year he should not have too much trouble. I dare even suggest an Oscar. His performance reminded me of Kevin Kline in 'A Fish Called Wanda' and Kline won an Oscar.",9,1,6,23 July 2005
Prometheus," Good if you have never seen an 'Alien' film
","I finally watched Prometheus for the 2nd time the other night. It was actually my first time all the way through. The first time I stopped watching just as the cast started exploring the alien structure because I got bored. After watching the complete film from start to the end I can say that this is a decent movie if you have no prior knowledge of the 'Alien' mythology.There is a reason why director Ridley Scott tried to distance 'Prometheus' from his previous film 'Alien' because the films are completely different in tone and texture. 'Prometheus' uses tons of CGI and epic story telling while 'Alien' was murky, with practical effects, and a dose of mystery. Being a fan of the 'Alien' series of films, I was disappointed with 'Prometheus' because it was so different from the 'Alien' style. I guess the tools and costumes looked too futuristic compared to the 'Alien' films.I might be more enthusiastic with the film had it been set on a different Earth like planet like it would be a different branch of the 'Alien' story. As it is the story has basically the same beats as the original 'Alien' story (finding an alien structure, one of the crew is killed, a member of the crew is impregnated with an alien creature, the android attempts to bring back a creature and goes rogue). Some of the plot holes (Elizabeth Shaw has major surgery with no recovery time) were a bit much to ignore but really wasn't a deal breaker for me.If you have any knowledge of the 'Alien' series then 'Prometheus', in my mind, should be thought of as a reboot of the 'Alien' story with better special effects. That why I liked the film overall even with the problems I mentioned and I would like to see a sequel if it gets made.",6,1,2,9 December 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," PG-13 made this film just average
","I spent my 4th of July joining Detective John McClane for yet another bad day. Unfortunately this 4th bad day limped across the finish line.It wasn't a total disaster but the movie suits marketing this as a PG-13 film and then pretty much presenting it as PG really hurt the reason I liked the Die Hard series. They even garbled his catch phrase. UGH! I wonder if 20th Century Fox knows you can use at least one F-word in PG-13 and you can also show women topless. That would have made this film a bit better.I want McClane to be crude, mouthy, and foul mouth. In this film he is crude and that is about it.I liked Justin Long as the geek hacker. He had some great lines - even better than McClane.Mary Elizabeth Winstead's 'Lucy' was a treat. She seemed to be just like Dad which I enjoyed very much.I thought the plot and ideas behind the story were interesting and something that doesn't get discussed enough in the real world and overall the film had some good, if not real plausible, action scenes.I hope that an unrated version comes out on DVD because the PG-13 version just didn't work for me.",6,2,4,4 July 2007
Easy A," A realistic plot and some wicked funny lines make this film a pleasure
","I was interested in seeing 'Easy A' since the trailer came out and I wasn't disappointed. It's a funny movie with an excellent lead turn by Emma Stone. In fact the entire cast does a great job with what on the surface might look like yet another teen sex comedy.What sets this apart from other movies is it's downright funny. I found myself laughing hard at a lot of the dialogue like when Principal Gibbons tells Olive, 'This is public school. If I can keep the girls off the pole and the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus.' or when Mrs. Griffith said about the character Micah, 'He's not the sharpest Christian in the bible.' I also liked the realistic plot. Compared to 'Confessions of a Teenaged Drama Queen' where the main character Lola tells a bunch of lies and seems to get everything she wanted even after her lies blew up in her face, in 'Easy A' Olive loses quite a bit when her lies get out of control. By the end of the film you know she fessed up but you really don't know if she got back her reputation.I also liked how the film dealt with social media in high school and I especially liked Mr. Griffith's comments 'I don't know what your generation's fascination is with documenting your every thought... but I can assure you, they're not all diamonds. 'Roman is having an OK day, and bought a Coke Zero at the gas station. Raise the roof.' Who gives a rat's ass?' Exactly.This was a funny movie with well written characters and a realistic plot. The bonus for me was the call outs to the 1980's teen movies by John Hughes that this film tried to emulate. I think it did a good job.This will be one I add to my DVD collection.",10,4,6,22 November 2010
