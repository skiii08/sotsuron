Minority Report," Excellent, brilliant, Keeps u glued to your seat.
","This movie had a left great great impression on me. When the movie starts its just a cool stuff movie. but as the story moves you will find the real thing in it. Many people will not agree to the main theme of it, Most of my friends were never able to understand what the movie is, actually. Think about the story after you have seen the movie you will get some lesson out of it.",10,0,0,20 September 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Ultra Fast Paced movie
","I like Harry potter series VERY VERY much, but the same thing is repeated in every movie, that many many things are not included in the movie which are there in story which makes it not very likable for my those friends who has not read the story. Otherwise each and very detail present in the movie is EXCELLENT.
