Iron Man 3," Why? Just why? :(
","I can't believe what I saw tonight. I went and saw the highly anticipated Iron Man 3 directed by Shane Black. I'll start this review off by saying 'Marvel, what was going through your mind when you were making this film?' I was so disappointed by this film, it wasn't even funny. I am just in shock, by this movie. How did something so good, become something so bad?Story: The story follows Tony Stark after the events of The Avengers. Tony is having issues dealing with what he has been through, and the movie shows him dealing with these issues quite well. Unfortunately this is probably the best part about this story. Now if you're a comic book fan, you probably know of the Extremis story. If not, then this story will seem very fresh and interesting to you. Iron Man 3 has a hard time following this beloved Iron Man story, but I'm actually okay with that. I understand that movies are different from the source material and they must put their own spin of things. The movie goes along and gives some plot twist (one of which I will go into more detail down below). These twists can make the story interesting if you aren't familiar with the source material, but the movie still feels like it has a hard time deciding whether it wants to be funny or be full of action. For me this story was horribly disappointing. There was so much that could have been done with the source material that they just decided not to do, but that isn't where I have an issue with this film.Acting: Again Robert Downey Jr. does a fantastic job playing Tony Stark. He really brings life into the character, and he is just fit for the part. Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin was a great choice for the role, but the story prevents it from becoming memorable. Guy Pierce was actually very good in this film. He picked up the slack for the other characters who were just okay.What I have against this film: *SPOILERS* The main villain in this movie in this movie is....not the Mandarin? It's actually Guy Pierce's character. Now this wouldn't bother me, if the Mandarin actually did something in this film. But no. He is a complete joke and Iron Man fans who have read the comics will feel like they were just stabbed in the back by Marvel. I'm not even a big Iron Man fan, but I knew about this story and that the Mandarin is his arch nemesis. Why then does his arch nemesis do nothing in this film?! He is supposed to have all these powers, and is pretty much a super terrorist, but nothing happens. It was so disappointing, I wanted to cry. I have never been so let down by a movie in all my life. Now I didn't have the highest expectations for this movie after seeing Iron Man 2 (which I liked, just not as much as the first one). I was looking forward to seeing what they would do with this villain and story line, and what they did was almost criminal. I really hope Marvel looks at the feedback of these reviews and sees that they messed up. They need to stick closer to the source material so stories like this aren't ruined for their #1 customers. I don't think they need to follow the source material word for word, but they shouldn't have changed it as much as they did.Conclusion: I came into this movie with some fairly high hopes. The story looked amazing, and they had a great villain, but none of this mattered in the end. I was let down by this film and by Marvel. I don't understand how they could get something like the Avengers so right and get this movie wrong. I am terribly disappointed by this movie, and I really can't recommend it to anyone who has read an Iron Man comic or knows of Iron Man stories. Marvel has a lot of apologizing to do after this. Such a sad night.",3,3,7,5 May 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A Masterful Piece of Perfection
","First off I am a huge fan of the The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series, but I'm not rating this movie high because of that, I'm rating it high because it's simply that good! The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the best movie I've seen since Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. This movie was absolutely perfect. Fantastic performances from Martin Freeman, Ian McKellen, and Richard Armitage! Yes the other dwarfs don't exactly get that much attention, but thats okay, because there are so many of them. I didn't feel as connected to the dwarfs as I did the fellowship, but I think that will change in the next two movies. I will say this, the movie is absolutely beautiful! Gorgeous landscapes, breathtaking skies, and the CGI in the film (don't know what people are complaining about) is amazing! It felt great to be back in Middle Earth again, and it's never looked so good. I also will say that I saw this movie in 48 frames per second and in 3D. The 3D aspect of it was great, I haven't seen a movie be this good in 3D since Avatar. I adjusted to the 48 frames per second right away. I don't know why people complain about this so much, I thought it looked crystal clear. I never once felt that the realism took me out of the story. This may not be the best trip to Middle Earth, but it's definitely a sight to see. I feel that this movie isn't exactly fit for kids, since there are a lot of be-headings. This is a great movie and I recommend it to everyone over the age of 13! The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an expected masterpiece and so much more!",10,2,10,16 December 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Anderson's Best Film by Far
","Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom is a funny yet weird story about love. To start it off, when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked liked a waste of time. Well...I was wrong, thankfully. A story that at first glance may seem very childish and boring, is really a hilarious adventure that will keep you laughing. I really liked this movie, and I feel its Wes Anderson's best film yet. I felt that the acting in this movie was perfect for the style and tone of the film. I will say that I think Edward Norton's acting was the best in the film. Every time he came on the screen, I couldn't help but laugh at him. The film overall was hilarious. I didn't think I was going to laugh that much when seeing this film. Anything from the oddly placed 'cuss' words (yes I put a Fantastic Mr. Fox joke in there!) to the Narrator who just seems to randomly appear in this film for no reason what so ever. Moonrise Kingdom isn't afraid to make you laugh, but at the same time, it has a classy feeling to it. This was by far my surprise movie of the summer. All in all Moonrise Kingdom is a hilarious adventure that is worth reliving. Wes Anderson's best film so far.",7,1,3,3 October 2012
