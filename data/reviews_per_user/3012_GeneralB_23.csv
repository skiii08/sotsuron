Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Simply Outstanding
","Real actors and animation have been placed together before, but never in such a vivid and entertaining way.  This movie is just a great experience; it's one of my most favorite movies.  The opening cartoon is simply hilarious, and it just gets better throughout the film.  Bob Hoskins gives a good performance as detective Eddie Valiant.  By the way, those Pacific Electric 'trolleys' are really buses.",Null,0,1,28 April 2000
Citizen Kane," What can I say?
","POSSIBLE SPOILERA lot has been said about this film, so my comments are pretty insignificant.  I saw this movie in a film class, where we watched sections of it at a time.  I was impressed, although when you get a bunch of immature students such as myself, together watching it, its inevitable that it becomes the butt of jokes, especially during the more surreal.  You can appreciate this film even more when you compare it to other films of the time.  Its use of camera angles, fade ins/outs, and shadows really stands out.  The meaning of 'Rosebud' was correctly guessed by at least a couple people in the class, and in retrospect it seems kind of obvious, so don't feel too proud of yourself if you guess it.  One things for sure, it better than Titanic!",10,0,1,12 October 1999
The Great Dictator," Memorable Comedy
","This film pokes fun at Hitler through a mixture of slapstick and satire. The film does not copy Hitler and the Nazis exactly; instead the dictator is named Hynkel, and instead of a swastika there is a double cross.  It is worth watching in part to see how contemporary artists treated Hitler back in 1940, when he was a threat, not a part of history, Charlie Chaplin gives a double performance as Hynkel and the barber, something alluded to in the beginning.  Chaplin's Hitler is funny and pathetic, not scary and imposing. It is interesting to compare this performance with the versions of Saddam Hussein presented in modern films(like say 'Hot Shots'); again a dictator is portrayed as a pathetic, comical figure with a high-pitched voice.  One of the best scenes, I think, is where Hynkel plays with a large globe.  I found it strange seeing Chaplin in a movie with sound, something I had not seen before watching this film.",Null,1,3,30 April 2001
L.A. Confidential," Pretty Darn Good
","I greatly enjoyed this film.  For one thing, its full of interesting characters played effectively by good actors such as Devito and Cromwell. Their are the three detectives; the ideal, by the book one, the cynical one, and the tough, loose cannon.  Then there is the police captain and the gossip magazine owner.  This film is also shot well.  Take for example, the way the camera follows the detective as he investigates the Night Owl Cafe. The camera work and well-written plot provide much excitement and tension. But I thought they gave away too much too early in the story.  This was perhaps not the best movie of 1997, but it was better than Titanic!",Null,0,1,17 October 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Best Dark Comedy Ever!
","This is the best dark comedy ever.  The writing and plot, particularly the juxtapositions that pop up, are outstanding and entertaining.  But the real star, the thing that shines the  brightest in this film is the performance of Peter Sellers.  He plays three people; the British liaison officer, the president, and Dr Strangelove himself.  His performances are the most important things in making this film so enjoyable, but the other elements are also fantastic.  Ironically, the most widely recognized scene does not involve Sellars:Slim Pickins bomb ride.  This film is the greatest dark comedy and the most memorable cold war movie ever made.",10,1,1,18 October 1999
Glory," Best Civil War Movie Ever
","This is an outstanding film, the best Civil War film yet.  It tells a more interesting story and discusses larger themes in much less time than the other recent Civil War film, Gettysburg.  It deals with issues about the war not seen in many films before.  This film received few Oscar nominations, which is great injustice. It helped make Denzel Washington a star, and showed that director Edward Zwick had great promise.  Unfortunately, he has yet to produce anything as good as this again.",10,0,1,12 October 1999
Armageddon," Was it a disaster movie, or was the movie a disaster?
","WARNING: Contains minor spoiler.	This movie had Buckheimer written all over it.  Its also one of those 'crisis management' films which show people in suits pacing around barking commands out.  Most of us have seen that before, just as most of us have seen Bruce Willis play a washed up guy who is suddenly given a chance to be a hero.  Ultimately, you can't really escape the conclusion that a lot of this movie was just plain stupid.  But then again, you get to see an asteroid wipe out Paris.  Too bad that one wasn't bigger. 	This film did have its good qualities.  The idea of sending a bunch of roughneck oil workers to save the world as opposed to some trained professionals made for a fun idea(although some would file it under the stupid category).  The scene where Willis is explaining their demands was pretty funny, and Steven Buschemi was an entertaining presence throughout the movie. 	Which was better, this or 'Deep Impact'(or perhaps the question should be, which was worse?)?  I think for all of its obvious faults, and despite of how stupid it could be, 'Armageddon' was, because its writers clearly realized that people go to these movies to see things blow up, not to see well crafted plots(which 'Deep Impact' didn't really provide anyway). Furthermore, I think this was a better film than 'Titanic'.  Now, you may ask why I would say such a thing.  Well, I have two words for you: LEONARDO DICAPRIO(or more specifically, the lack thereof).",Null,0,1,27 March 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Worse than the prequel, which wasn't exactly a great film itself
","MINOR SPOILERThis film, while not horrible, is not very entertaining.  The repeated carnage(when you see Hummond's nephew's team land on the island, you can't help but think 'they're loading up some dinosaur fodder') just is not scary. For example, the scene where the 'raptors' attack, when you see there tails stick up above the grass, looks more like an attack of giant earthworms. And what's with Nick Van Owen?  I mean, in one scene, he removes the bullets from a hunter's gun.  As a result, he is not able to kill a T-Rex when it attacks the camp, and several people die as a result.  And this guy is supposed to be one of the heroes?",Null,0,1,13 October 1999
Ghostbusters," Terrific Comedy
","This film is a classic.  I remember loving it as a kid and still love it today.  Its a outstanding comedy.  It includes what are probably the best performances given by Bill Murray and Harold Ramis.  Like any modern classic, its full of memorable lines('The next time someone asks if you are a god, you say YES!').  It's as much fun as it was when I first saw it.",Null,0,0,22 October 1999
Patton," The role George C. Scott was born for!
","Everything about this movie was fantastic, but Scott's performance is the most outstanding.  Not only was it the best performance of his career, but it was one of the greatest performances ever given by any actor in the history of American film.  It was simply awe inspiring.  This is probably the greatest World War II film ever, but it is much more about Patton than about the war.",Null,3,5,14 December 1999
Toy Story 2," A lot of fun!
","This movie was highly enjoyable, and included a number of jokes clearly aimed at adults. I watched with an audience that included few kids, and everyone enjoyed it.  While sequels are usually inferior to their predecessors, Pixar didn't miss a beat with this exceptional film.  Watch for the references to other movies, some are obvious, others less so.  Also watch for the man in the short film shown before Pixar's last movie, 'A Bug's Life.'",Null,3,4,26 March 2000
Victory," Quite Enjoyable
","This World War II is memorable because of its plot; a bunch of Allied prisoners agree to participate in a soccer game against the Nazis, who intended to use it as a propaganda event.  But the prisoners plan to use it to escape.  While this basic premise sounds kind of silly, I still found the film to be enjoyable and fun to watch.  Sylvester Stallone, Michael Caine, and Pele make for an interesting mix of stars.",Null,0,0,27 April 2000
Groundhog Day," Not Bad
","This was an entertaining film.  While I didn't think it was exceptional, it did provide laughs.  Bill Murray may give his usual cynical performance, but he does do it quite well.  Also, watch for director Harold Ramis(Egon from Ghostbusters) as the neurologist.",Null,0,0,22 October 1999
Titanic," Most Overrated Film in History
","I have grown quite sick of this movie and the Celiene Deon song.  If there wasn't some much said about it, I probably would have liked it more. Frankly, the dialogue and much of the plot was silly.  The way they told the story, by starting in the present, was quite interesting, and compared to other disaster films its outstanding, but best movie of all time? NO!",1,7,16,30 September 1999
The Untouchables," Pretty Good, believe it or not
","I found this film to be generally well done and I enjoyed it considerably. Kevin Costner stars as Elliot Ness, but it's Sean Connery as Malone that steals the show.  Andy Garcia as a junior cop also stands out.  Robert De Niro does a good job as Al Capone, but in my opinion William Forsythe performed the role better on the recent television series.  The TV Frank Nitty is also more impressive.  The writing for this film was also impressive, although the score seemed a bit strange and out of place.  I saw the spoof of the train station stair case scene in Naked Gun 33.333 before I saw the real thing.",Null,0,0,26 March 2000
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Pretty Darn Good
","This is quite a good film, and I highly recommend it.  It contains good acting and writing, complete with drama and humor.  A young Jack Nicholson gives a very effective performance.  Although perhaps not as well known as other award winning movies, it has been the subject of a number of parody scenes, in particular on the television show 'The Simpsons'.",Null,0,3,17 November 1999
The Mission," Good, but...
","This movie has many excellent features.  It contains wonderful camera work in breathtaking scenery, an impressive score, and generally good performances.  All these things make the film quite powerful, and it can really draw the viewer in.  But there are a number of historical inaccuracies.  This is quite important, because the film begins with the words 'This is a true story that actually took place in 1750.'  The movie's portrayal of the Indians, and their relationship to the missionaries, has been attacked by historians, among other aspects.",Null,0,2,17 November 1999
The Matrix," Great New Sci-Fi
","This movie features a great story that shows how great Sci-Fi films can be. While it is true that the plot is mainly an excuse to show neat looking visuals of people dodging bullets followed by lines like 'You are the chosen one', the story still is very engaging and bold.  The cinematography is also excellent and impressive.  While not among the greatest films ever, this is one of the best, if not the best Sci-fi film to come along in a few years.",Null,0,0,9 April 2001
Heat," Pros and Cons
","It seems that wherever this movie opens, it is accused of starting a crime wave.  That aside, it is an interesting film.  The performances by De Niro and Pacino are excellent, especially in how they relate to each other.  The scene where they are talking over a cup of coffee in particular brings a level of excitement without resorting to action.  But the movie was too long and had to many subplots to constantly maintain interest throughout the film.  Nonetheless the story was generally entertaining.",Null,0,0,14 October 1999
The Thin Red Line," Great World War II movie
","This is an excellent movie about World War II in the Pacific, but it is really about how people are effected by and change during war.  It features outstanding camera work, as well as wonderful flashback/memory scenes that are blended very effectively into the film.  One problem though is the very large number of cameos, which can be a distraction.  It is often asked which is better, this film or 'Saving Private Ryan'?  I believe that 'Saving Private Ryan' has better writing and a more coherent story, while 'The Thin Red Line' features better directing and cinematography. In any case, it is quite a good film.",Null,0,0,7 April 2000
The Great Escape," Memorable World War II movie
","This is one of the famous and well-remembered World War II movies.  It was made in the 1960s, when a number of other famous World War II movies were made.  This movie is highly entertaining, and features an excellent score. The highlight is Steve McQueen's motorcycle chase, one of the best and most famous chase sequences in movie history.",Null,1,2,7 April 2000
Contact," Extremely Overrated! Its horrible!
","WARNING: SPOILERS!(Including ending).I don't understand why some people think this movie is so great.  It stinks! Much of the movie is video or soundbytes; pictures of Brian Gumbel interviewing Foster or Jay Leno cracking jokes.  It's like the producers are screaming at us 'Look, we got all these real life media personalities and celebrities to star in our movie, and we could manipulate the president's voice to make it look like he's in on it too!'  All this is supposed to substitute for a strong plot and good writing.  And then there is the scene where Foster is before the committee to decide who gets to go meet the aliens, and McConaughey asks her if she considers herself religious, knowing quite well that she is an atheist.  Later, McConaughey confides in her that he really asked the question to get her rejected from being shot into space because he is in love with her.  Well, really, Matt, did you think there was anybody who hadn't guessed that?  I mean come on, its really obvious! 	The climax of the movie is when Foster meets the aliens face to face, but even this is disappointing.  She goes all that way, and after so much anticipation, boom, she meets an alien resembling her father.  This is what they came up with for the big moment?  The alien tells us things like 'You are capable of such beauty and such horror', the same dribble that has come out of dozens of science fiction movies and programs.  This movie is quite simply bad, overrated, and not very original.  Oh, and James Wood plays a jerk.  Like I haven't seen that before.",Null,8,16,3 November 1999
Jurassic Park," Disappointing
","This film was not as good as the book(as often seems to be the case with movies) and like many adventure movies, its plot isn't exactly strong. Nonetheless, one complaint level against this film isn't fair.  That is that some critics have argued that Spielberg made a mistake by showing the dinosaurs too early, making it less fun.  In Jaws, for comparison, the shark isn't see clearly until half way in the movie.  But the dinosaurs shown early in Jurassic Park aren't dangerous or intimidating; they aren't monsters.  They dinosaurs that do attack people, such as T-Rex, aren't seen until halfway through, while the stars of the show, the 'raptors', aren't seen clearly until the end.",5,5,14,13 October 1999
