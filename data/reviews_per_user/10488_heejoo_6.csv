Kill Bill: Vol. 2," cool and sharp, very sharp - but too long
","'And... The hat. That ffffffucking hat. How many times haven't I told you, don't wear that fffucking hat here? How many?' - 'The customers wear hats.' - 'Yeah well I'm not the boss of the customers, I'm the boss of you. And I'm tellin' you to leave that sh*t kicker hat at home!'When I saw the first Kill Bill, I said to myself this is something new. But what can you expect from a cineast like Tarantino right? However I thought the fighting scenes were too long and the dialogues could have been much better. That's what the second volume was all about: more spaghetti western, less Shaolin monkey sh*t. And this was mainly because Michael Madsen en Daryl Hannah had a huge roll in it in comparison to volume 1. Also there was lots of funny stuff in it, f.e. the dialogue in the beginning between Michael Madsen and Larry Bishop, the Pai Mai priest ... One thing bothered me in a 'gargantuan' way: the pauses between every spoken line, especially by Carradine. They were simply too long and that's why I rated this movie 7 instead of 8. Other than that great flick!",7,0,1,7 February 2007
Memento," how exhausting watching this !
","I just don't understand what it is that makes this movie so popular, especially with male viewers, I mean 8.6? Come on, what is that?! ...Leonard suffers from short-term memory loss and tracks back using notes and body parts to find the man who killed his wife. On his journey he encounters a number of people who he has to be able to assess at first sight because of his deficiency.The acting by Guy Pearce is very convincing and even appealing but the story however is most of the time way too irritating because you constantly have to backtrack yourself in order to completely understand what's going on. I like flashbacks in movies but a film that turns out to be one big flashback by itself may be a little too demanding for me. I guess this is just not my kind of entertainment ...",5,25,47,4 February 2007
Seven Years in Tibet," Seven years in Tibet took me about seven years
","Being one of those overrated movies and in my opinion the worst Brad Pitt movie I've seen so far, I'm going to take a dump right now and start thinking what to write next because I cannot remember one scene of this desert nightmare.It was that much of a disappointment I guess. No it wasn't that bad, but still not passing the shoplifter movie making exam. I remember dramedy, chasing scenes and arguing about sharing stuff but I could be wrong. The other actor David Thewlis really disappointed not to mention the rest of the cast and most of all I found this film to be so bloody boring.With four hits in a row it was probably meant to be going downhill at some point. I'm guessing Brad's energy for acting was still stuck with Se7en, Twelve Monkeys, Sleepers and The Devil's Own.",4,1,7,5 February 2007
Mississippi Burning," decent film but Oscar worthy?
","The film has been nominated in 1989 for 7 Oscars and it won the Oscar for best cinematography. It also won 13 other awards and was nominated for 10. !! I don't understand that it was nominated for best film and Die Hard, a 1988 blockbuster wasn't - now that we're talking cop hero movies. !! Anyway, the only other movie from the hand of director Alan Parker that I remember watching was 'The Life of David Gale' and to those out there who haven't seen it yet I strongly recommend not to witness this one and only Spacey nightmare because you will be sorry!Now let's focus on the good aspects. I still gave Mississippi burning a 6 because there are some powerful lines in the movie and the acting by Gene Hackman is outstanding. Frances McDormand looks really hot as usual (cfr. the major's secretary in Miller's Crossing - aaauwwwww aaauw aauw aaaaaaauuuuww babyyyyy !!!!). Another Ku Klux Klan tale seemed to me rather unoriginal at the beginning but there were some nice twists in the film which made it well worthy to be keeping track of what would happen next. I checked the movie on IMDb before I zapped to the right channel (as always) to have a look at the rating (7,5). I was so surprised by a promising cast (Willem Dafoe - Platoon, American Psycho, Brad Dourif - One flew over the cuckoos nest, Lee Ermey - Full Metal Jacket) and a whole list of 'official' appreciations. However it turned out to be not what I expected, which was obviously too much.",6,0,5,3 March 2007
Forrest Gump," tremendous acting, beautiful surrealistic story
","This movie is definitely in my top ten list. Every scene makes you want to have a taste of the next one already without even knowing what will happen in that previous one. It's surrealistic because so many great events happen to the main character his life almost turns into a modern fairy tale. It's funny because it's meaningful and honest and true. The story is inspiring and once you've seen it you won't ever forget it because it's simply a masterpiece. When I saw Forrest Gump for the first time I couldn't think of doing anything else. Because normally I get a drink, roll a cigarette or get something to eat when I watch at home, but with this one I was so fascinated it just flew me toward the end on a cloud of movie wonder and top acting. Thank you Robert Zemeckis for directing this work of art. Thank you Gary Sinise, Robin Wright Penn, Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field ... for amazing performances . Thank you Tom Hanks for being Forrest Gump and making millions of people happy and moved because this is one of the best!",10,1,4,7 January 2007
Casino," 'Be a man, don't be a f*cking pimp!'
","What can you expect when Rob Deniro, Joe Pesci, Sharon Stone, James Woods and Martin Scorsese put their heads together to make something for the viewers? Right, a masterpiece. Flawless, beautiful, bad ... brilliant is what Casino is. Las Vegas, the late Seventies, early Eighties, a place in the middle of nowhere set up only to make money for the big bosses and the fast hustlers. Just like Deniro puts it: the players don't stand a chance. Of course with lots of money comes lots of trouble ... and lots of killing. Joe Pesci is Nicky Santorro, a rough-and-ready but nevertheless smart bully with his own gang ready to hit the jackpot in Vegas by robbing from every booky he can get his hands on and stealing jewelery from the rich gamblers. Paragraphs of words that you wouldn't say in the presence of your parents come and go like little children in a candy store. It's the dialogues and the way they are thrown in your face that makes this movie so impressive, really. If you you like strong dialogues, genius and hysterical acting and are totally in for the maffia way of life on screen then you should get a hold of this one because you will be blown away, I guarantee you. Goodfellas was fantastic, but in my opinion this one is even better.",10,1,2,6 February 2007
