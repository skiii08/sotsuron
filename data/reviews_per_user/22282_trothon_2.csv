Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," My review of Borat
","I went into Borat with absolutely no expectations. Having seen one of Sacha Baron Cohen's other creations, Ali G in his feature film, I did hope that this would be better. And it was. Much better. But not the best film I've ever seen. It did crack me up in many places, every time Borat interacted with random American public, but some places were incredibly cringe-worthy. The bit that crops up every time in reviews I've seen about the film is the nudity, and I must say that it is pretty gross - the 5 or so minutes of naked wrestling made me want to shut my eyes more than when Christ was pinned to the cross in Mel Gibson's epic. I think that Baron Cohen's prominence in American cinema is going to continue - his character Borat was very cleverly created and for that he did good, I hope that he continues to create clever but funny films in the future - which Ali G In Da House was not.",9,1,7,9 November 2006
Casino Royale," Good Bond, but good enough?
","The first Bond film in 4 years didn't disappoint - Mads Mikkelsen played a great villain in Le Chiffre, Eva Green was absolutely lovely as Vesper Lynd, and even Daniel Craig pulled off a solid effort as Bond himself. But was it good enough? I haven't seen all the Bond films (only 5 in fact), but I consider the only effort I've seen of Sean Connery's, Goldfinger, to be a better film. Guaranteed, this film is only considered to be the prequel to Connery's films, and I understand the need to see Bond's grittier side before the sophistication starts to sneak in right at the end, but for me Connery is the archetypal Bond - he was suave, sophisticated and slick - I think I'll wait to Mr Craig's next outing to see if he has the ability to get to the level of Mr Connery.",9,2,4,21 November 2006
