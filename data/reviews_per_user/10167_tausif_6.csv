50 First Dates," Truly Original score...
",I would call it the romantic comedy version of memento... but truly great fun and lots of laughs...In the world of romantic comedies... someone finally made a breakthru from the usual ideas...,8,0,0,22 February 2004
Bridget Jones's Diary," I expected too much
","Well I went in thinking I was about to watch a soothing and enlightening romantic comedy like Notting Hill and Four Weddings & a Funeral. I am afraid, that yes I was disappointed.I just felt Miss Jones is too much of a 'dumb blonde' - I mean no one is this dumb in real life... but yes there were the funny moments.Bottom line: watch it - but don't expect it to be the best 'date' movie of the year.",6,0,0,3 November 2001
Batman Begins," Kicka**
","Now thats what I call a good action thriller. Fun for everyone - women, kids and of course men... Brilliant action sequences - somewhat believable gadgets... and oh yeah an awesome car chase. I think this movie has it all - but if u notice surprisingly there is a lot of similarity to Spidey... even the last scene with Katie kissing and saying something along the lines of with great power comes great divorce rates... Anyway fun for the entire family - its not a comic book its a movie with a story line and of course Gotham city - which I always wonder - is it on the east coast or west? Please watch it and savor it while watching - take your entire family or group of friends - buy the popcorn and get the best seats... best movie this yr - so far at least.",10,1,2,16 June 2005
Big Fish," Fabulous...
",Absolutely heart warming and fabulous...One of the weirdest movies - but it almost makes you cry and I have no understanding how or why this movie manages to have such an outstanding emotional effect but an amazing tale told in the uniquest way possible...Go watch it - best 2.5hrs i spent in the past few mths.,9,0,0,22 February 2004
Hitch," Good comedy - romance
",Not really a complete chic flick... give some guys ideas about how to plan better dates and better excuses for starting conv. I thought it was kinda creative in many ways.Cast was great and story line was all in all simple... yet entertaining. One of the better romantic comedies in the last few mths. If you do go to watch it... good idea to take a girlfriend or date along... u should also manage a kiss out of this movie at the end of the day...Oh and i think the food allergy scene was quite original.Definitely worth the $9.50.,8,0,0,13 February 2005
V for Vendetta," Original Score
","First movie in which you never see the lead role, but truly gorgeous screen play and OH MY LORD Natalie's beauty surpasses all expectations - how many bald hotties can you think of - makes u fall in love with her.And most of all finally an original score. Great screenplay - great action - and reflection of the present day world and its relationship to 9/11 and Iraq - don't miss this on the big screen.If there is one scene i love the most it has to be the domino scene, let me know how many of you agree with me on that. I guess the one thing I do wonder about is that although we are supposed to be in the future apparently the cops are driving rovers from the 90s. Nevertheless shouldn't miss this one - after all one good movie comes along every 1-2 yrs noweasy 10 on 10.",10,5,11,24 March 2006
