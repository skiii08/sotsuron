The Avengers," another marvel
","to start off i didn't hate the movie nor did i love it. it was just alright for me. going in to the movie i was already Skeptical of the movie due to the fact of all the superheros in one movie. i knew that one of the superheros would overshadow the rest, and in my opinion it happened. although Robert Downing Jr. was the biggest name on the cast the writers and directors just limited him on his character as iron man. i think the hulk was that superhero that overshadowed the rest. and its not the directors fault that it happened its what you get when you have all of those superheros in one film. one will get over looked while the other rises to the top. i just hope that this movie don't spark an idea to make Justice league into a movie cause that would be to much for one movie i think but other than that i like the movie but captain America could have jumped in the river cause his character is pointless.",6,2,10,25 May 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," twilight isn't a delight
","First thing i have watched every one of the movies and i never thought i would watch any more after the first one because it was so annoying that i had to get up and leave half way through the movie and it was well worth getting yelled at by my girlfriend at the time, but i rather have got punched in the face than watch another second of the first one. and after that i was like I'm not watching any of the others, but thanks to my girlfriend i was drugged to the next one and after sitting through the whole movie just to see a ending that was just so redicious with Edward asking Bella to marry her and than blank screen then credits WTF so i decided now to watch all of the rest of the remaining movies just to make fun of and criticize the films. and if you don't know where I'm going with this i'll tell you the Twlight Seris are pointless and destroyed the image of the vampires, how can you take the blood sucking creatures and change them to these loving creatures is beyond my mind because vampires are not nice period point made and end of story. the whole Twlight series gets a dreaded but well deserved F in my opinion",1,5,6,17 April 2012
The Hunger Games," Poorly made film
",in my opinion this movie was corny. that being said the movie wasn't bad but i excepted more up beat thrills not watching a girl hide the whole time. Maybe i should have read the book first but i doubt it would change my opinion on the movie. and for a movie to have a high budget the effect was pretty bad. my opinion i rate this movie bad and I'm all for book novels becoming in a movie like Harry Potter and even Twlight that in my opinion isn't very well either. but look at the movie The Girl With the Dagon Tattoo that was a good rounded movie. Im just saying i seen better films come from an high school students. i wasn't impress with this movie,4,6,7,13 April 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," A new twist
","This movie blew my mind. It put a new twist on horror movies, and my opinion might change how horror movies is made. It started off corny as hell but it eventually made sense why it started the way it did. the movie was good in almost all the parts of a good movie. It had comedy to offset the tension build of the movie to make you relax and made you think that everything was okay but then bow they get you. it was in my opinion the best horror movie i seen since 1408 or don't be afraid of the dark witch was a recent film but there hasn't been to many good horror movies lately and The Cabin in the Woods broke the no hitter. I recommend watching it, it was a good movie",8,1,8,21 April 2012
