Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The most boring movie of the last 2 (or more) years
","I'm a huge movie fan and see about 5 to 10 movies a week of which 1 or 2 in the movie theatre.Part 1 of this movie was entertaining at the most. The dialogues were nice and at same occasions excellent and the action was good, but not worth the good critics the movie has got.Now with part 2 I was even more disappointed than part 1. Once again this part was talked about of being the best movie ever made, but it was so boring that I almost fell asleep in the theatre (and that is only the first time that happened). Tarantino tries to make more of a story, but it is like 13 in a dozen. Take 10 movies at random from the videostore and changes are that 5 of them will have a similar story. The dialogues were interesting at their best. One nice thing was the music. That is one of Tarantino's strong points to select excellent music with the scenes in his movies.This was definitely the most boring movie I saw in the cinema the last 2 years.",1,21,40,26 April 2004
