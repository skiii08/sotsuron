Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Individually, these are two different movies with unique styles. Together, they form a masterpiece
","This movie is quite different from Vol. 1. It isn't as bloody and gruesome (apart from one scene that is so brilliant it would be a sin to spoil it), or as violent, but it has more plot and a lot more dialogue.The dialogue is truly the best part in this movie. You get amazing acting from Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Gordon Liu and David Carradine. And even Samuel L. Jackson has a small role, but even then he plays it amazingly. They deliver incredible dialogue written by Tarantino, as only Tarantino knows how to write. It makes you smile, and that's important.What happens in this movie is quite clear - the Bride (whose name is finally revealed in Vol. 2 in a rather awkward little scene) continues her vendetta against Bill and the remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Budd (Sidewinder) and Elle Driver (California Mountain Snake). She faces peril and excitement. And she fights in incredible fight scenes. We also meet Pai Mei, Bill's master, who also taught the Bride martial arts, and he leaves an impact.Both movies are amazing, but only together they form a true cinematic masterpiece. Tarantino struck gold with Kill Bill, just as he did with his previous movies.",10,2,4,29 January 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," 'Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.'
","The first time I watched this movie was sometime during the summer of 2003. I read about it a bit, heard about it from a friend, and decided it sounded like a nice movie, so I might as well go watch it. And at first, I came out thinking it was a nice movie, nothing more. But I had watched it again later. And again. And again. And you could say the movie grew on me, because while I admit this isn't the best film ever made, it is my favorite movie.So what makes this so great? It's fun. I can watch it many times over and over and never grow tired of it. Be it the incredible fight scenes, the captivating scenery, the rich and amusing dialogue, the interesting plot line, or the unbelievable acting, something about this movie never bores me and just has me watching it again and again. I have seen the Star Wars movies many times, and can find myself growing bored while watching them. I have seen the Indiana Jones films many times, and lately found myself beginning to grow a bit bored while watching them (they are still enormous fun, though). I have seen Pirates more than any of the previous films, and never once have I been bored with it. Too often I catch it on the TV, sit down to watch a favorite scene, and stick on for the rest of the movie. It simply never gets old, and it's just as fun to watch it the tenth time as it is to watch it the first time.Part of the reason for it is, I suppose, that the movie doesn't really rely much on its plot to progress. Sure, it has a good, solid and interesting plot: the town of Port Royal is attacked by the cursed pirate ship, the Black Pearl, captained by the vile captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), daughter of the governor of Port Royal, is kidnapped by the pirates due to a certain medallion she possesses and the name she gives the pirates as her own. Young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), the local blacksmith who has a secret love for Elizabeth, goes to rescue her and enlists to his help captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), who has his own plans regarding Will, the Black Pearl and Barbossa. It is interesting to see how the plot develops, but what really holds you are the magnificent scenes that come one after another. Whether it's the amazing sword fights (such as the early fight between Will and Jack, an extremely well-choreographed and amusing clash), the naval battles (fire all cannons, arr!) or the stellar performance by Johnny Depp, each scene is as captivating as the previous.I have mentioned all the good things in this movie (and yes, there are a lot of them), but the absolute best is the acting: Bloom and Knightley are good as Will and Elizabeth, each portraying their characters personalities extremely well, and you can believe that the two care about each other. Geoffrey Rush is extremely captivating as the villainous captain Barbossa. He manages to look, feel and sound like a true villain (even adding a little 'arr!' here and there) while still having us believe that Barbossa is a human after all, with motives and feelings. You can understand why he's doing what he's doing in the movie. And as for why he's a pirate - that's what rotten scalawags such as him do. The true star of this movie, though, is Johnny Depp. Jack Sparrow is incredible - he acts a bit drunk and a bit crazy (to the extent where you hardly see the difference when he actually is drunk!), yet he is also cunning, intelligent and thoughtful. He is also amusing to no end, dishing out funny lines one after another, while maintaining to remain serious when the time calls for it. Depp's acting in this movie is truly the best I have ever seen in my opinion, and I believe to this day that he has been robbed of his rightful Oscar.And finally, I can't help but mention, that simply the fact that this is a pirate movie makes it so fun. Pirates are fun, and I am really interested in pirates. This film may not give a historically accurate version of piracy (I don't recall undead pirates ever mentioned in history books) but it's still fun, and gives you everything you need when it comes to the romanticized view of pirates that's so dominant in today's modern culture.Jack Sparrow says at one time during the movie: 'Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.' and this is especially true of this film. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is treasure. It's a captivating, enriching experience. You'll come out with a smile on your face, and the mood for swashbuckling. Anyone who hasn't watched it yet, hurry up and do. Anyone who has, go watch it again. It's worth it. I'd give it 11 out of 10 if only I could. ARR!!",10,2,5,28 December 2005
Corpse Bride," Short and sweet
","This is an amazing movie. I had previously watched Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas and expected a similar experience: Nightmare was amazing to look at and a marvel to listen to, but in between all the singing, I found it a bit dull. This movie though, never encountered that issue.Viktor Van Dort, son of a wealthy fishmonger family, is set to marry Victoria Everglot, daughter of a poor yet high-class family. The Van Dorts hope to earn high-class, and the Everglots hope to earn money. Victor and Victoria aren't keen on the idea, but once they meet in person, it's love at first site. The shy Victor, however, completely fails at the wedding rehearsal and flees to the woods. He practices his vows there on different branches, finally putting the ring on a very hand-like one. And in fact, it is a hand! The hand of Emily, the Corpse Bride, who was killed by her new husband and swore to await her true love. Victor now finds himself married to a corpse, when he wants to get back to Victoria. Although during the movie, he begins to show more care and love for his new bride. But I won't spoil the ending.This movie has less music and more plot than Nightmare, and therefore isn't as dull as I found Nightmare to be. It goes at a perfect pace, mixing excellent music with even better voice-acting, of particular note Johnny Depp as Victor and Christoper Lee as the priest, Pastor Galswells. Even more so I must mention the quirky and witty humor in this movie, with many puns and cute jokes, and of course the amazing visuals - stop-motion animation at its best. This movie should be seen only to admire the animation.It is a bit on the short side, standing at only an hour and 15 minutes, but it doesn't hurt the film. Rather, you can enjoy this fun and light-hearted movie to its full extent before it has a chance to drag into dullness. Many a movie have been ruined by being too long.This movie is a must-see, if only to appreciate the animation. But anyone who wants some good, clean entertainment should give Tim Burton's Corpse Bride a try.",10,2,3,23 January 2006
Jarhead," I was surprised for the best
","When I went to watch this movie, I did so reluctantly. I was interested in watching it, though only a bit. Mostly I just went because my friends were going. I was expecting another war movie, a genre I grew tired of. And boy, was I in for a treat.Jarhead isn't a typical war movie. The difference, which also makes this movie transcend other movies in the genre, is the fact that there isn't much war going on. This movie doesn't focus on the horrors of war, but rather on how the soldiers look forward to the war, how much that waiting and constant training ruins their lives, and how deeply it hurts them that it was all for nothing. They spend more than 150 days in the desert for a 4-day war that ended without them engaging in combat. The main character, Swoff, lost his girlfriend while waiting in the desert. The boredom, the constant anticipation for nothing, nearly cost him his sanity. And all for what? In his own words, he didn't even fire his gun once.He will forever be a marine, whether he likes to or not. Which is also another point the movie makes - it will be a part of him forever. But I found the subject of what that waiting can do to you, and the disappointment of not doing anything after all that training and waiting and morale, to be more interesting, and more moving.This is a great movie. It's different from most war movies, and it's far better than most. In this movie, words speak louder than actions. A must-see.",9,5,9,16 January 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Style over substance, sure, but is that a bad thing?
","So what have we in this movie? A simple and rather silly plot, and lots and lots of blood. Normally this would spell disaster, but when Tarantino directs you know you can expect good things, and that's exactly what you get.This movie has a lot of style, and it's style that drives it and style that builds it. The plot revolves around The Bride (her name bleeped out in this movie), once a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, codenamed Black Mamba. But she leaves her boss and boyfriend, Bill, to marry somebody else. Bill is upset, and kills everybody who attended the wedding, and has his Squad beat the pregnant Bride into a pulp, before shooting her in the head, only a second after she informs Bill the baby is his. She wakes up four years later, bent on revenge. And from there on, the movie is about her vendetta, going through the Squad before getting to Bill. The movie opens with a battle against Vernita Green, a.k.a Copperhead, but the main 'villain' in this movie is O-Ren Ishii, codenamed Cottonmouth, and now the boss of the Yakuza. Uma Thurman as the Bride, and Lucy Liu as O-Ren are magnificent, and give strong performances, as does Sonny Chiba as the retired Japanese sword smith, Hattori Hanzo. But the true focus in this movie is not the amazing acting, but the amazing battle scene. Bloody, yet amusing. Quick and stylish. And accompanied by a magnificent soundtrack.You will enjoy watching this movie, because it is entertaining, and nothing more. But therein lies its charm. And a certain revelation at the end of the movie will make you ache to watch Vol. 2.",10,2,5,29 January 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Could have been worse
","It's pretty hard to express my opinion of this movie in words, but I'll give it my best shot.I believe that as a movie, it was good. Tom Hanks delivered a great performance (as usual), Ian McKellen was great, and the rest of the cast were good as well. The directing, by Ron Howard, was great, too. So what's the problem with this movie, then? The problem is, it's based on the Da Vinci Code. And so, the movie inherits all the weaknesses of the book (except for Dan Brown's writing). It inherits the b.s. (no better word to describe it), it inherits the poor attempts at cliffhangers every second just to keep the reader (or viewer, in this case) in suspense, and it inherits the weak ending. It hurts the movie.Still, it wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't a great one, either. However, I suppose I expected it to be a lot worse than it is, so I ended up enjoying it, flaws and all.If you liked the book, you'll like the movie. If you didn't like the book, odds are you won't like the movie either (it follows the book very closely). If you hadn't read the book yet, give this movie a shot. You might end up liking it, after all.",7,2,4,22 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A good movie, but a few bumps are pulling it down
","This was a great movie. It managed to turn a 650 pages long book into a 2 and a half hour long movie, and it does so spectacularly. It manages to avoid feeling quite as rushed as the previous movies, despite having far more content. Even viewers who haven't read the book will enjoy themselves and be able to follow, although they may feel a bit lost at some points.Now, we'll begin with the good parts in the movie: first of all, the special effects were breathtaking. The Hungarian Horntail dragon looked fearsome and realistic and made the first task a truly breathtaking spectacle and one of my favorite scenes in the movie. The acting was also a strong point: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson improved greatly, and Brendon Gleeson gave an excellent performance as Mad-eye Moody, as he managed to be as insane and scary as the book portrayed him to be. Alan Rickman stole the show, despite having an extremely short scene. But even then, his Snape is so cynical and menacing he has no competition on the screen. And finally, I have to mention this, Emma Watson looks absolutely stunning in the Yule Ball.However, the movie has its share of problems. The first and foremost is the damage done to three major characters: Dumbledore, Crouch and Voldemort. Dumbledore has turned from a wise and calm, if somewhat aloof, wizard who can display his tremendous power into an old person who is quick to anger and has trouble figuring out what's going on around him. This was definitely the most unpleasant change, because Dumbledore's character is one that should give the feeling of a fatherly figure in Harry's life, but in this movie he is merely a headmaster. Crouch was supposed to be a strict, tough man, with an entirely by-the-rules approach. In this movie, he is naught but a weird old man who seems to abide by the rules not because he believes in order above all else, but because he has no other choice. As for Voldemort, while Ralph Fiennes delivers a great performance as He Who Must Not Be Named, it is also entirely over-the-top. Voldemort is far too melodramatic - he is a ruthless, bold-blooded murderer and yet he gets so worked up over capturing his enemy? It doesn't make much sense. While this was the major problem in the movie, there were a few others: Fleur and Krum, who were Triwizard Champions, were given extremely small roles. They barely had 3 lines each, and Fleur was especially left out (Krum at least had a relationship with Hermione). Also, it would have been nice to actually see Gary Oldman. He did have a role and several lines, but all we saw was a CGI version of his face made out of ash and burning firewood. I'd have preferred to actually see him in person. Another problem was that there was a feeling of somewhat of a mess in the movie - at times it seemed as if they tried to cram in as much as they could in the 2 and a half hours and it just fell apart. A good example is Rita Skeeter who gives a magnificent performance in the first half of the movie then disappears without her plot line ever being closed. The time spent on her would have been better used to actually show the Quidditch World Cup. The final problem was the 'Do the Hippogriff' song in the Yule Ball. It was entirely unnecessary: it was a silly song that only damaged the movie, in my opinion.In short, this is a good movie. Definitely worth a watch, whether you're a hardcore Potter fan or not. It does have some issues though, that I hope will be taken care of in the next movie.",8,1,2,13 December 2005
V for Vendetta," Voilà! A vibrant visual feast, and a veritable variant to a wonderful graphic novel
","V for Vendetta is amazing. There is no other word to describe it. It's a visual feast with a gripping plot and a message. You'll be glued to your seat all through-out the movie, and you'll come out sweating with your head filled with ideas. This is easily the best movie I have seen so far this year.I had my reasons to doubt the quality of this film adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore at first. Although, I must confess, it is reading about this movie that made me interested in the graphic novel, it was simply written so brilliantly I was afraid it would be spoiled. Indeed, it wasn't an easy adaptation. The original graphic novel has very little action, and a mind-boggling amount of text, not to mention many numerous characters and subplots. There was also the matter of the Wachowski brothers. I did enjoy the first Matrix movie, but I was terribly disappointed with the sequels. To say the truth, this was a movie that was easy to screw up, and I had a feeling it would get screwed up. I was wrong, and I am oh-so-glad I was.The plot was changed for the film adaptation. The year is no longer 1998. The nuclear war was replaced with a deadly virus. But the idea behind the movie remains, even if the chain of events is different. But the film also added something I felt the graphic novel was sorely in need of: more action. I enjoyed the graphic novel immensely, but I felt it would have been more interesting with more action. And the fight scenes in this film are incredible: swift, stylish, and exciting. I did not like the changed made in Lord of the Rings. But in V, I did not mind the changes. The Wachowskis created a story of their own, based on Alan Moore's original, but different. And it works.There was, however, one change that was for the worst. In the graphic novel, V was insane, and there was no doubt about it. He wasn't simply weird, he was also unpredictable, mysterious and eccentric. V's character was brilliant in the graphic novel, and it was slimmed down in this movie. Hugo Weaving was great as V, of course, but by making the character of V more human, more sane, by making him romantically involved with Evey (who was also portrayed perfectly by Natalie Portman), he became less mysterious and less interesting. Not to mention, they made him more of a man with an idea, than an idea in itself. And that is a shame.All in all, this a spectacular piece of cinema. It's highly recommendable for anyone who enjoyed the original graphic novel, for anyone who enjoys comic book movies, and for anyone who enjoys movies in general. But if you want a different, yet more fleshed out plot, with a more interesting protagonist, pick up the V for Vendetta graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's worth it.",9,34,59,4 April 2006
