Alien 3," Alien3 misses something... but it's still enjoyable enough.
","Something about Alien3 seems... strange to me. It's an enjoyable movie still, but there is something missing.The story is still good, but not as good as the two prequels. There is a build-up, there is development and of course, there is a climax. But it just doesn't feel as... 'wow' as the last two films.The connection with Aliens, or rather the disconnection, makes this film a lot darker. The fact that all the joy you had at the end of Aliens, is crushed at the beginning of Alien3, makes this movie cruel, to me anyway.There are even more shots of the Alien then in the two prequels. Not a bad thing, but there are some points in the movie where it was a bit unnecessary. If you have watched Alien and Aliens, you'll know what I mean.The fact that the creature now is 'born' from a dog, rather than a human, paves the way for new twists. They are present in the movie, mainly how the alien moves. On four legs, instead of two. It's nice to experiment with a concept, but it wasn't really needed for this movie.I think my biggest problem with this film is the cast. Part from Sigourney, none of the characters appeal to me. They're all 'crud', to speak with Sigourney. All criminals, rapers or just plain scum. They don't need a background, but the way they act on the screen just makes you think why they are there. Basically alien food. It's no surprise that barely anyone makes it out alive.There are huge differences with the Director's (extended) version and the 'standard' cinema version. I've watched both several times and I can't say which version I liked best. I advise you to watch the director's version at least once and ponder about the many changes. It left me with more questions then answers, to be honest.In overall, Alien3 is not a bad movie, but it lacks a few things when compared to the prequels.",7,1,25,28 April 2009
The Incredible Hulk," I liked this movie, but...
","There's a huge discussion going on about which is the better Hulk movie. The 2003 movie, directed by Ang Lee or this recent one.For me, it's a hard choice.I like the 2003 movie for the (deep) storyline and story development. I like the effects and CGI slightly better in there too. Although some things are a bit over-the-top (like the Hulk jumping over a huge canyon, I know he is incredible, but come on!).This movie however, delivers entertainment on a different level. I like this movie for it's mystery (at first) and the slow uprising of one of Hulk's most stubborn enemies, the Abomination.I liked the acting. Each character plays their role well and there aren't many stupid moments in the dialog. It's all believable enough. I found the scientist, mr. Blue, quite hilarious.Amazing special effects and CGI in this movie. Although I like this version of Hulk slightly less when compared to the 2003 one. But that's just one opinion, so feel free to discard my statement.The last 30 minutes or so are filled to the brink with tough action and fighting. It really gives you a moment of 'wow'. And 'ouch' sometimes too. It's one of the most intense fights I've seen in a long time.In overall, the Incredible Hulk is an enjoyable, fun movie. But to me, it isn't as incredible as the 2003 movie.Still, 7 out of 10 stars.",7,0,1,18 June 2009
Mission: Impossible III," What a rush!
","Wow! This movie has it all! Action, drama, humor, clever dialog, traitors, scary scenes, gunfire, explosions, crafty spy actions and more! Tom Cruise once again stars in this movie. If you loved Mission Impossible I and II, then you will love part III just as much.Excellent acting, good music, well-written story, clever twists and a good pacing make this movie a very enjoyable and tense ride.Breaking into the Vatican has to be the best scene so far in the mission impossible movies.As far as I'm concerned, I'm more then ready for Mission Impossible IV.This movie gets from me a fat 9 out of 10 stars!",9,0,1,25 May 2009
Kung Fu Panda," Excellent and enjoyable ride!
","Kung-fu Panda.The title made me frown, but hey it's from Dreamworks, so I wasn't too surprised.The opening sequence is one of the best I've ever seen in an animated film. It made me laugh so hard. It spoofs just about every classic kung-fu moment in just 2 minutes!'The warrior said nothing, for his mouth was full' Simple, but effective! Then the movie starts and we see the star of the show; a fat panda named Po. Okay, maybe he's not fat but rather thick boned? Oh who am I kidding'? Anyway; he works in a noodle restaurant with his father (who is a ...duck?). He dreams of becoming a great kung-fu warrior one day like his idols, the fearsome five.From there, the movie rolls in a ridiculous scene, followed by another... and another.. AND another! The fun doesn't stop! The voices are all excellent, especially Po and Shifu are highly entertaining. The facial expressions go well with the acting too. Again, it's Dreamworks, so they know what they're doing.This movie also has a lot of action and over-the-top stunts and effects. Just like a real kung-fu film, only crazy! The final fight will truly break your funny bone, if it hasn't already earlier! You will grow attached to several characters in this movie, I can guarantee it. There's something in this film for everyone.Another Dreamworks gem. I can't wait for the sequel! I give this movie a 10 out of 10 stars!!!",10,0,1,7 May 2009
Coraline," Wonderfully animated; basically a 'modern' fairy tale...
","If you like fairy tales, you will love this movie. This film has everything: story, funny characters, entertaining dialog, good scenes, beautiful animation and a nice moral.I loved Coraline. It's a very kind, but also mysterious movie about a young girl who, by pure curiosity, travels to a parallel dimension of her house. There she meets her 'other mother' and 'other father'. Everything is fantastic and everyone seems so nice. However, after awhile it becomes clear that a dark power is trying to lure Coraline away from her real family...There's so much to tell about this movie, but I think it's best that you go watch it yourself, before I spoil too much. Coraline is truly a wonderfully animated gem. It's a movie you will watch again and again over the years, maybe as an annual tradition! 9 out of 10 stars!",9,2,4,4 January 2010
Alien: Resurrection," I'll be blunt, this sequel was unneeded...
","But that doesn't mean it's a horrible movie. It still has it's moments, but it's not as good as Alien and Aliens or even Alien3.Acting? It's okay... but could have been a lot better. I have to admit that even Sigourney didn't perform as good as she did in the first 3 films, but then again, she is now in a completely different role.The story is not excellent, nor is it horrible. It's just your standard scenario. There are tons of films who have a story development like this.The effects on the Aliens have once again improved and the creators really like to show it off. Almost every scene where Aliens lurk, they show on the screen. Sometimes full body, other times just heads or claws. This, in my opinion, is bad. The fact that CGI exists doesn't mean you have to show it every 5 minutes or so. They really over-used it and it damages the quality of the movie.A few new twists and better effects.That's basically what Alien: Resurrection adds to the series.It's a shame that this movie ended the Alien saga. I don't count AvP and AvP2 as real sequels, but rather as a new series.Watch it if you are an Alien fan and liked the first 3 movies.",6,0,1,28 April 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Lots of action, drama, humor and... Wolverine
","X-men Origins: Wolverine is an enjoyable film. There's a bit of everything in this movie. Let me start with the characters.Most of the movie is about Wolverine and Sabretooth. Makes sense, if you look at the title. How they grew up together, what kind of life they lived and how, in the end, they became two men who couldn't go through the same door ever again. Rivals till the end of time.There isn't much room for the other characters in this movie, compared to Wolverine. I was a bit disappointed that both Gambit and Deadpool didn't get as much screen time as I had hoped. The same can be said for the other well-known x-men characters like the Blob or Emma Frost. They both have a minor role in this movie. Maybe that was done on purpose, since this IS a movie about Wolverine, but a little more screen time would have been nice of course.The villain in this movie is none other then general William Stryker. If you are a X-men fan, you know him very well. Danny Huston plays a VERY good Stryker. You are really going to hate this character, if you haven't already by reading the comics, playing the games or watching the previous movies. Action. TONS of it! A lot of cool stunts and daring moves. Motorcycles, cars, helicopters, explosions, gunfire and even a tank. This movie has spread the action nicely, since there aren't very long pauses between the action scenes. So if you are a fan of action, you will love this movie.There's also a nice amount of humor in here. Hugh Jackman plays a great Wolverine once again and it paves the way for a few obvious and less obvious jokes. Gambit and the Blob add some humor as well. This movie is not as humorous as the previous 3 x-men movies, but it wasn't meant to be. This is the story about Wolverine's past, which is very dark and dramatic. So I'm glad they didn't add too much humor. It would have killed the atmosphere of the movie.I found the acting quite good, with the exception of Gambit maybe. But that's because I cling myself too much to the cartoon version of Gambit. I don't think anyone is ever gonna top that Gambit. He was okay in this film, but it could have been much better. No complaints about the lead characters though. I already mentioned William Stryker and Wolverine, but Liev Schreiber (Sabretooth) plays his character very well. You can almost feel the anger and somewhat sadistic aura whenever he shows himself on the screen. A job well done, Liev.In conclusion, I found this movie entertaining. It could have been better at some points, but it's not horribly mutilated as I first thought it would be. One last warning for fan girls of Hugh Jackman... There's like 5 minutes in the movie where he is completely naked...",8,33,53,11 May 2009
The Terminator," Great movie!
","Terminator is truly a CLASSIC movie that even now still is enjoyable enough to watch. One of the better (maybe one of the best) sci-fi thriller movies.It's hard to tell the story of Terminator in a few sentences, but here goes: a cyborg killing machine, called a Terminator, is send back in time (from a future in which mankind is almost destroyed completely by robots) to kill the mother of the rebellion leader. By doing so making sure that the robots will win in the future and not the humans. Right after the Terminator a human from the future arrives to stop the Terminator from completing it's mission.Did you get all that? Movies involved with time travel tend to get very complex and difficult, but this is not the case with Terminator. The plot is great and moves at a steady pace. This movie has a really good script and the actors work very nicely with it.They couldn't have picked a more suitable actor for the Terminator then Arnold. He plays one of his best characters in his career, in my opinion. There are so many memorable scenes and lines. In particular the one-liner: 'I'll be back'.I can highly recommend this movie for fans of Sci-Fi and/or thriller movies. It's a very entertaining and sometimes even scary movie.9 out of 10 stars!",9,0,1,2 June 2009
Alien," My favorite science-fiction film of all time
","No matter how many other science-fiction films I see, Alien will always be my absolute favorite.The acting is superb, the story is well-written and the music is very dark and suits the film well. Sometimes there is no music at all, which adds a feeling of false security to the movie.And then there is, of course, the Alien.First time I saw this movie, I was only 12 years old. Never before did a movie scare me as much as Alien did to me back then.I will never forget the chest burster scene.Or most scenes with the face hugger for that matter. Nasty things...If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't lived. It's a must-see for all science fiction fans out there. The atmosphere of 'there is SOMETHING there, but we don't know exactly where' is brought to the screen with the utmost finesse.I have seen this movie countless times; but it never gets boring.Truly, a masterpiece in science fiction film history.",10,1,3,28 April 2009
Lost in Translation," A sweet and delightful movie about two people lost in a big city.
","Lost in translation is not your average movie. I mean it doesn't really have a deep plot, loads of characters, a big bad guy and tons of effects or action.No.This is a movie about two people in Tokyo, who both have their own problems and don't know how to deal with them accordingly.This is a movie about trying to find your way of life. Trying to survive in a city you never been to. You don't speak the language, you don't know anyone and you have no idea how to spend your time.It's a very kind and innocent movie (except for one little scene). Bob and Charlotte, the leading characters, have good chemistry together. You'll either love or hate this movie. It depends on your taste.I liked the movie for it's gentle nature. The title fits the movie perfectly.Lost in Translation: 7 out of 10 stars.",7,1,2,3 September 2009
Predator," I had forgotten how raw this movie was...
","Predator.If you are at home in the sci-fi universe you have probably already watched or at least heard from this movie. Predator is considered a classic must-see in it's genre. And I agree with that.So what is this movie about? A team of special commandos are send into the jungle to rescue an ambassador from the local rebels. However, when they get to their base they find out that it was all a set-up. Apparently, a different team was send to that area before them, but they all mysteriously disappeared. Soon, the commandos find out that something in the jungle is hunting them and that it's not from this Earth...A very good cast makes this film far from boring. Arnold as the lead adds his usual share to the movie. It are the other actors that deserve more credit, if you want my honest opinion. There's good chemistry between them and it makes the film more enjoyable.The story develops at a steady pace, with the strange plot twists now and then that make Predator famous. You will see things that will make you uneasy, so don't watch this if you're under-aged or can't handle some gore. Predator ain't a movie for kids.That brings me to the real star of the movie, the Predator. At the time, I had no idea that this alien species would ever cross blades with a different, just-as-famous alien race, called the Xenomorphs (or Aliens). The predator is a true work of art. The way it moves, thinks and hunts is unique, to say the least. The effects on the creature are also VERY well done. There isn't a single moment in this movie that I found the creature unrealistic (if that makes sense, since it IS an alien species). The laugh at the end of the movie is perhaps the only thing that's a little out of place though.I'll be very interested to see how the remake (or reboot) of this movie is gonna turn out. Hopefully they won't ruin too much of the magic of the original film.Predator is a must-see for Sci-Fi fans and certainly watchable for fans of thriller/horror movies too! I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars.",8,1,2,14 May 2009
28 Weeks Later," Delivers more then the prequel
","...but that doesn't mean it's much better.28 weeks later is a sequel to 28 days later, but only in events. There are no recurring characters from the original.The UK has been declared 'infection-free' after the USA army went through it. A project is started to re-inhabit Brittain and start life anew. Yet, somehow the Rage virus finds it's way into this sacred place and the terror from before strikes again...Okay, I'm gonna be fair and say that 28 weeks was slightly more entertaining then it's prequel. There was a bit more of everything, but in my honest opinion, it didn't deliver anything really new. The rage 'zombies' are basically the same and there are no plot twists or clever things added to the story. There is one thing about a possible cure though; it makes the movie slightly interesting.But in short, just like 28 days; I believe that 28 weeks later is an enjoyable movie for the fans, but not really a movie that everyone should or has to see.6 out of 10 stars.",6,0,0,25 December 2009
The Thing," Excellent horror...
","This movie scared the heck out of me when I first saw it. Even watching it a 2nd, 3rd and 4th time years later still gave me chills now and then.I recently watched it a 5th time (I am 25 years old now) and I have to admit that it still hasn't lost it's magic.The movie plays tricks on you, in multiple ways. You don't get most details on the first viewing, but believe me, this movie gets better every time you see it.So what's the story? A group of scientists in the Antarctic stumble upon an abandoned excavation site. Something was dug up, but whatever it was, it's gone now. The only survivor they find is a dog, who was previously hunted down for no apparent reason.They take the dog back to their base and from there, the movie really starts...Things happen you don't expect. Things happen you wish you didn't see.I won't go into detail, but let me warn you by saying that this movie was (and maybe still is) considered one of the scariest movies of it's time.Acting, story, music, effects: all excellent.Highly recommended for any science fiction / horror fan.",9,1,2,28 April 2009
The Village," A very clever movie!
","The Village is a very intriguing movie. I liked the mysterious and deep plot that unraveled itself slowly as the movie progressed.It would be a shame to spoil the story here, because it's so good. I recommend that you go watch this film yourself.Next to the story; the acting, music, setting and effects were all very well done. I guess what I liked most about this movie is the overall atmosphere. It's really a very peculiar, but interesting film. Definitely a worthy watch for fans of mysterious movies.8 out of 10 stars.",8,1,2,8 October 2009
Pitch Black," Not bad, not bad at all.
","Pitch Black starts out exciting, stays mysterious almost the whole time and delivers a surprising and conclusive ending.It tells about a space ship that crashes on a planet. Three suns constantly shine down on it's surface, making it a planet of never-ending daylight. The survivors of the crash make it to a base where they find out that something's not right about this place. When a few strange murders take place, the crew starts to get suspicious. It seems that strange, hostile creatures dwell deep in the caves below the surface. They cannot survive in daylight, thankfully. But then something becomes clear that will put the whole cast in great danger...I really liked this movie. It pulled me in right at the start and I was glued to the screen the whole time.There's great acting, good characters, good effects, well-directed scenes and dialog and a nicely-paced script. There aren't any insignificant scenes.When you go watch this, take extra note of the character Riddick. He's one of the most bad-ass characters I have seen in any movie the past few months. You really start to cheer for him as you progress through the movie. Strange how that works, doesn't it? Pitch Black is a great movie. I recommend it for sci-fi/thriller fans.7 out of 10 stars.",7,3,5,28 September 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," And the story goes on...
","Terminator 3: Rise of the machines.After watching part I and II, I got excited about watching this movie. I'm glad it turned out as I expected and delivered a little more! I cannot tell the story of this movie without spoiling a few things. So if you haven't watched any terminator film, please look away.*START SPOILERS / STORY* John Connor is now a grown man and lives a lonely life. Always on the run and not living in a home. No address and no way of contacting him in any way. This has to do with the events of the second movie. Nonetheless, yet another terminator is send back in time to try and kill him AGAIN. However, this time the terminator is a female! And it seems she's not only after John this time. Once again, a 2nd character is send back in time to protect John. An old friend...*END SPOLERS / STORY* I really liked this movie. It's (in my opinion) a real cinema film though. Mainly because of the large amounts of stunts and explosions. It would be a kick to see this on a huge screen.The story moves not too fast nor too slow. It gives us more information on the Terminator storyline as a whole, as well as a few new plot twists that make this movie interesting and clever.Besides from the action and suspense, the movie also has a nice doze of humor. There's also good dialog and the acting is okay enough. Arnold once again shines as the Tuhminatoh! Sorry, couldn't resist...In conclusion, Terminator: Rise of the machines is definitely a worthy watch. I give this movie 8 out of 10 stars.",8,1,1,15 June 2009
The Orphanage," A very clever movie. Mysterious and scary at times...
","El Orfanato (the Orphanage) is a very good movie. It has been a long time since I have seen a good film in this genre. The genre ghost stories I guess.The story is somewhat difficult and complicated to bring it down to a few sentences. In short I could say it's a story about a couple and son who live in a large mansion. One day the son goes missing and the couple start searching for him. It's important to find him soon since the boy needs medication. When everything fails, they call upon a medium. Then they find out about the horrible truth of the mansion's past...The acting is definitely worth mentioning. It's solid and believable. I really liked the leading character, Laura. A very caring mother who tries everything to find her son back. It's truly heart-breaking.There are some very good, sometimes scary, scenes in this movie. Although the major part of the movie is mystery, not pure terror. Slowly yet surely you find out exactly what has happened in that mansion.And then there's the really good ending. Just go watch the movie and you'll find out in what way it is a good ending...El Orfanato (the Orphanage) is truly a worthy watch. Highly recommended for fans of ghost and/or mystery movies. 8 out of 10 stars!",8,1,2,25 August 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Terminator vs Terminator
","Terminator 2: Judgment Day is an incredible movie. From start to finish, it is a story that truly grabs you and pulls you in. Young John Connor is chased by a Terminator from the future. A second Terminator (ironically the same type that tried to kill his mother in the first movie) is also send back through time, to protect John. Reprogrammed by the older John (don't you just love time travel paradoxes?) the 'old' Terminator is a lot different then the one from the prequel. Sarah Connors is locked up in a mental institute because the authorities claim her to be... nuts. We all know she isn't, and so it is very painful and rather sad to see her being mistreated in the institute. Eventually, John and the Terminator bail her out and together, they run from their enemy, the newer and improved Terminator.Let me take the elements of the movie one by one:Story: Very moving and well-written. There's a very strong connection with the prequel and you can see the writers put a lot of effort in this movie.Music: It's the same tune that gave me chills in the prequel. It couldn't be better.Acting: Very, very good. I can't point out a bad, important character. As a matter of fact, even the less important side-characters did a good job!Effects: A-MA-ZING! And I'm not talking about the obvious mechanical movements and such. I especially loved how the liquid body of the newer Terminator was creatively used in this movie. A true work of art.A very enjoyable movie and a worthy sequel. It is a long ride (2 1/2 hour) but it's not wasted time, I can guarantee it!9 out of 10 stars!",9,1,1,8 June 2009
Aliens," Just as good as Alien, just in a different environment.
","I was psyched when me and my parents agreed to watch Aliens on a Saturday evening. I was only 14 at the time, maybe a little too young for a film like this. Then again, I watched Alien as a 12-year old, so... yeah.I didn't get all of the details on my first viewing, but it certainly gave me scares and thrills! Like the first movie, the acting, music and story is very good.It's this film that made me a fan of Sigourney Weaver. Her character truly evolves in this movie. Starting out as a traumatized victim of the creature from the first film and ending up as a hard-core, caring mother. No one would mess with her children, that's for sure! Like I mentioned in the title, the movie is just as good as Alien, but it takes place in a different environment. Not on a single spaceship in the middle of nowhere, but rather on a planet, in a complex inhabited by colonists. Well, it USED to be inhabited...You see more of the creatures in this film, compared to Alien. But that's not a bad thing. It works well and they didn't over-use it, like Alien Resurrection.I recommend getting the extended (special) version since it adds more to the story and it has a few extra scenes which add to the film as a whole. If you can't get a hold of it, watching the normal movie is still a very enjoyable experience.'Mommy said there were no monsters, but there are...'",9,1,2,28 April 2009
Independence Day," Very enjoyable movie!
","Ahh Independence Day...I remember seeing this way back in the summer that it first came out in the cinema. I was blown away! Almost literally...Aliens destroy our major cities and want to annihilate mankind! HELP! A team of unlikely citizens of Earth eventually come together and think of a plan to stop the invaders.Let me start with the acting. I really LOVED the acting in this movie. Especially Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith. Man those two have awesome chemistry together. But alone, they also delivered a great performance.Okay, so the music didn't really stick with me. Then again, it's a disaster movie. Stuff gets blown up all the time. There's not much room for any kind of music.There's a good amount of humor in this movie as well. There are a lot of funny scenes. My number one has to be when Will Smith drags an alien in a parachute behind him. Awesome dialog...The effects are good enough. I think the design of the aliens is creative. Even though you don't see them much up-close, which is a shame. Spaceship design is maybe a little too... classic? I mean they're basically flying saucers. Not saying it's a bad thing, but I personally prefer more exotic, strange designs. Just one opinion of course.For a disaster movie, it has a surprisingly long runtime. Over two hours. There's a good build-up in the story and it gives more depth to the movie when it comes to characters and background.Independence Day is a good Sci-Fi movie with a nice mix of humor, action and drama.8 out of 10 stars.",8,1,2,8 June 2009
Alien vs. Predator," Only decent for fans of Alien and/or Predator.
","I am one of those fans. So this movie was okay enough for me to watch.However, it is nowhere near the quality of any of the Alien or Predator movies. Most elements from both series are in here though: Facehuggers, chestbursters, aliens, predators and most gadgets used by predators. And of course lots and lots of gruesome deaths.A fest for fans, like I said. But even then, it doesn't deliver a solid cast or story.Maybe my expectations were too high for this movie. And I'm sure I wasn't the only one.My biggest complaint about this movie was that the fight scenes between the alien(s) and predator(s) were either too short or too dark. In overall, this movie was filmed a tad too dark, for my tastes.The fight at the end (against the queen alien), was okay enough. It's a little dumb though that the lead character (Alexa Woods) can stay alive in the antarctic environment! wearing only a t-shirt...And then there's the somewhat strange ending. Ready for a sequel, people!Which was made, sadly enough.AvP is an okay film, but it could have been a lot better.",6,0,0,1 May 2009
28 Days Later...," I heard so much about this movie, but was disappointed in the end
","Everyone around me said 28 days later is a movie you HAVE to see. And so I did, a few days ago.But to me, it wasn't really so big as I had anticipated. Before I begin, what is this movie about? Here's a small plot outline: A new type of virus spreads throughout the UK, turning people into hungry, aggressive ... zombies I guess? (I can't really compare it with something else). A few survivors do their best to escape the terror and flee together in search of a sanctuary.I have to admit that, yes, the movie has it's moments and is indeed awesome at times, but it just didn't really grab me for the full, almost, 2 hours. And by the end, my interest was sadly long gone.Maybe this ain't my type of movie though. I'm sure fans of zombie (or zombie-like) films will be entertained. 6 out of 10 stars.",6,0,2,24 December 2009
The Mist," An amazing movie; full with different characters
","I was... baffled after I was done watching this movie!The mist, which is originally a short story written by Stephen King, is a story about a small town near the mountains. At night, there is a terrible storm and there is a lot of damage. The day after, a strange mist descends down on the town, covering it completely. It soon becomes clear that inside the mist houses a terrible evil. The survivors run to safety and end up in a supermarket, where they have to fight for their lives or die trying...That sounds like your average horror movie, doesn't it? HOWEVER! Unlike most horror movies, the Mist has a lot of characters who you will either hate or love. Wonderful, believable acting makes this film more appealing.The CGI is GOOD! Really good! It was nice to see a movie with some good, scary effects.There is gore in this movie. Sometimes even gross gore. So this movie ain't for the weak of heart. (or you can just close your eyes or turn away at the most intense parts).And then there's the ending... my god... I won't spoil it, but I am just gonna say that it is one of the darkest (perhaps THE darkest) endings I have ever seen...The Mist is an amazing horror movie. Truly a worthy watch.9 out of 10 stars!",9,1,3,6 July 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," It's a movie that I can't compare with anything else I have seen in my life...
","2001: a space odyssey.For a long time, I had this movie on my computer and refrained from watching it. I'm not really sure why, because people close to me kept saying it's a great film and that I should watch it right away.And so I finally watched it yesterday.The movie is confusing, to say the least. The first 3 minutes are completely dark, with a strange sound that reappears throughout the movie.We then switch to a prehistoric planet, where apes and other animals are the (so it seems) only inhabitants. We see how they slowly, yet surely become smarter and learn some primitive techniques. Ironic enough, the scene ends when an ape kills another one using a bone. I guess the movie wants to tell us that violence is bad? But it is a sad and painful aspect of the (future) human race...The next story is about a research center (of some sorts) in outer space where a computer, called HAL, operates the whole mission. The research center is going towards Jupiter. The reason is explained in the movie, but it slips my mind as I am writing this. At some point, the computer malfunctions and things go bad.The final, and most confusing, story is basically a journey into the unknown. You could say that the 'odyssey' part of the movie applies to this last bit. For almost 15 minutes we, the viewers, are exposed to a colorful collection of lights, beams and shapes. At the end of it all, we see one man age in a single, isolated room. In the end, he returns as a fetus, as we see him float above the Earth.The black monolith, symbolizing evolution (I think), appears in all of these stories. There's probably a deep, philosophical explanation to it all, but I didn't get most of it.I'm sure this movie is an icon of it's time and yes, it is sometimes well-written and cleverly put together. However, my biggest complaint is that I wouldn't really call this a movie. Now that's not a bad thing, mind you.2001: a space odyssey is more like a string or chain of events. It's not really a movie as in having a plot, cast and connected scenes. It's a movie that really is unique to anything I have ever seen.I can understand the high rating, but I wouldn't give it an 8 or higher. I give this movie 6 out of 10 stars, only judged by a movie's point of view.If I would judge this movie as something else, it would get a higher rating. It certainly is a creative piece of art. But I don't watch a movie for art, I watch it for a movie.",6,3,5,30 June 2009
The Descent," Best creepy movie I have seen in a long time!
","I wasn't really sure what to expect when I saw the cover of the movie. I figured it would be something bloody in caves. Probably a standard horror movie with buckets of gore and a lame story.Boy was I wrong.It's NOT a standard horror movie. This film is very cleverly filmed. You'll jump on your chair at unexpected moments.So what's the story? A group of six women go explore a new cave. Stuff goes wrong and to make matters worse, the group is hunted by strange, creepy predators in the dark. There's also a rather important background story of one of the women who lost her husband in a car accident. It plays a part in this movie.To be honest, I was on the edge of my seat while watching this movie. Especially the second half. This movie really is creepy. There are a lot of good scenes and frightening moments.The acting is good too. It's not Shakespeare, but I didn't find the actors annoying. They play well as a group too. There's good dialog and some humor.Yes, there is gore. And it's quite nasty at times too. But if you are at home in horror movies, you'll be fine.I also have to mention that the creature design is very creative. The cave dwellers are really scary, mostly because you don't see them half the time and usually don't know when they will show up. Call it an 'Alien' effect. Note that the music stops and plays at certain parts. It helps building up tension.I really don't have any complaints about the movie other then that the runtime was slightly short for a movie like this. Standard horror movies are usually 90 minutes, but this film could have used some more depth (no pun intended) and runtime.Still, The Descent is most definitely a worthy watch for fans of creepy horror movies. Be sure to check this one out! 8 out of 10 stars.",8,1,2,14 December 2009
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Nostalgia feelings paired with other emotions
","Transformers, more then meets the eye. Everyone with some cartoon history remembers that line from the intro of the cartoon series. I watched it too many times as a kid, so I was eager to watch this movie.I have to say that Transformers: revenge of the fallen was an enjoyable movie. Lots of familiar faces AND voices. I love it how a lot of transformer characters (mainly Autobots) still have the original voice actor of the 80's cartoon series. It's a really nice touch.The CGI is amazing and I was blown away by it. Some say it's overused in this movie, but this IS a movie about giant, fighting, transforming robots. It would be hard to see this film without any CGI, if you ask me.The acting of the human characters was nice and I wasn't annoyed by anyone. Lots of humor in this movie as well. There's all kinds of humor in here. Ranging from dumb puns to silly gags to some sexual humor, even with the transformers.It wasn't the best movie I've seen in the past few months, but certainly enjoyable. It's a fast-paced action ride with a lot of nostalgia feelings for a transformer fan.7 out of 10 stars, transform and roll out!",7,0,2,20 July 2009
Jaws," Dunnnnn dun. Dunnnn dun. Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun...
","Man, I don't know where to start! Jaws is one of my favorite movies ever. It's also the first shark movie I saw. At the time, I was terrified of the scenes. Then again I was only 13 years old or so...Enough childhood memories, let's talk about the movie itself. It's a story about a great white shark, killing people just of the coast of a summer tourist town. The 4th of July is drawing near, and the mayor is reluctant of closing down the beach, because they need the summer tourist's cash to keep the town alive, so to speak. But is that really an option with a killer shark in the waters? The Sheriff (Brody) is insisting on closing down the beach, but no one listens to him. He then calls in an expert (Hooper) who examines the dead body of a woman and confirms that it was a shark attack. But even then, the mayor stays put and the beach remains open.The story is excellent and well-written. It moves at a steady pace and delivers everything: suspense, humor, drama, shocks, good dialog and some gore.The music! Let's not forget the AWESOME music written by John Williams. After 30+ years, the Jaws theme is still a classic tune and just about everyone knows it.Steven Spielburg handled this movie with great care. No real sharks are used in this movie, yet the way the scenes are filmed truly gives you chills. In particular, the opening scene (with poor Chrissie) is a scene that has been burned into my brain for the rest of my life.What else? ... The acting is amazing. A very solid cast and no 'dumb' dialog. You are really going to love and hate some characters.Then there's the shark. Like I said, it's not a real one, but that doesn't mean it stinks. On the contrary, Bruce (the sharks nickname apparently) prevented me from going swimming in the ocean for years! Jaws is perhaps the best shark movie in history. Using CGI nowadays to bring monster sharks and such to the screen just isn't the same as clever directing and filming.A true classic. I give Jaws 9 out of 10 stars! Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN!",9,2,5,26 May 2009
WALL·E," Beautiful and adorable; Disney and Pixar created magic again...
","Wall-E...This movie is truly amazing. Before Wall-E I hadn't seen a movie in which there was no, or almost no, dialog. And yet, using hand gestures or facial expressions, the viewer can perfectly fill in what is going on.But I am getting ahead of myself.Wall-E is the story about a small, clumsy cleaning robot that got left behind on Earth to clean up the mess we, mankind, left behind when we fled for the stars. Poor Wall-E fulfills his daily duty even after hundreds of years. Then, one day, a strange spaceship lands on Earth and deploys a searching drone, called EVE. Wall-E falls in love with the female (apparently) drone, but the feeling isn't mutual. EVE is looking for something important. Wall-E slowly tries to make contact with his mysterious visitor, and eventually succeeds. And when EVE returns with her mission completed, Wall-E follows her. A crazy adventure in space is what results from there...The computer animation art is truly beautiful. Everything looks so smooth, so detailed and so very... alive. You'll forget after awhile that 80% of the characters in this movie are robots. They seem so human! It's a bit hard to explain here.There is very good music in this film too. Very moving, powerful music that fits with the scenes nicely.Like I said, there is almost no dialog. It really adds to this movie and makes it an unique experience.Wall-E is in my honest opinion the best Disney/Pixar movie of 2009. A wonderful movie for young and old; it's a gem you will not forget anytime soon and will probably watch multiple times over the years to come.On a side note, I think it was a nice touch that Sigourney Weaver did the voice for the space ship's computer...Wall-E is definitely a must-see for everyone. Your heart will melt.10 bright stars!",10,4,7,25 December 2009
Carrie," Fantastic movie!
","Carrie is about a young, timid girl in high-school who gets bullied around and mocked every day. At home she has to deal with a very strange and quite possibly disturbed mother. Because of this she has no confidence and has nothing good to say about herself. This all changes slightly when she's invited to the prom by one of the (more) popular boys. Carrie discovers she has the power of telekinesis; the power to move or influence objects with the mind. It seems to trigger whenever she's in stress, is angry or is confused. Things are building up when one of the girls in Carrie's class is denied entry to the prom, and she blames Carrie for it...---After watching this just now, I have to say... wow. Just wow. This movie is truly amazing. The movie has a fantastic build-up and it's great to see so many elements in this story come together, for good or worse. I was on the edge of my seat for the 2nd half.The acting is perfect. Sissy Spacek as Carrie steals the show. She portraits her role as a confused, scared young woman with much power and emotion. Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother is another amazing role in this movie. None of the other characters look bad; they all play their roles just fine.Another thing I'd like to point out what's good about this movie is the music. Very fitting, strong (and also very unnerving) music that plays throughout the movie.I'd recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys dramatic stories. Carrie is a breathtaking story of sadness, hatred, confusion and a thin ray of hope...9 out of 10 stars",9,2,3,29 January 2012
The Iron Giant," Turned out better then I expected
","Story: The Iron Giant, a metal giant man from space, crashes on Earth and befriends a boy. A man from the government is trying to get evidence that the giant man exists and is determined to see it destroyed.Sounds really clichÃ© and simple, but looks can be deceiving.The Iron Giant at first seems like a story you've seen or heard of so many times before. However, what Iron Giant is different at are a few things.The animation for one thing. It's a classic cartoon style, but assisted with computers. I think it worked out great for the movie.The relation between the boy and giant slowly builds up and is fun to watch. There are some touching scenes.There's also some nice humor in here. The Iron Giant is a fun, heartwarming family film.I can recommend this title to just about everyone. It's a great movie!8 out of 10 stars.",8,1,1,27 December 2009
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," They sometimes say the sequels only get worse, but not in this case!
","I thought that Ice age was the greatest animation movie at it's time. Ice age 2: the meltdown was a great sequel and I thought that was the end of the series. But then Ice age 3: Dawn of the dinosaurs showed up!I was psyched to go see this movie! I wanted to see more of the hilarious antics of Scrat and the always clumsy Sid. However Ice age 3 delivered so much MUCH more...If you are familiar with Ice age 1 and 2, you will feel right at home when watching 3. The humor is the same, if not better. All the characters from the prequels return and we get a few new ones too!Scratte is simply awesome! She's the rival of Scrat when it comes to collecting acorns. The scenes they have together are simply hilarious. Then we have Buck, the one-eyed weasel. Another great addition to the cast. I loved his voice and facial expressions. He's just a crazy, care-free, single guy who spends his life in a jungle. The 'old' characters all do their part to make this movie even more enjoyable. You think that adding characters will make the ones already present move more to the background. Not in this movie! Manny, Sid, Diego, Ellie, Crash and Eddie all still have funny scenes and dialog. I laughed almost the whole movie, it's a real fun fest!If you can, try to watch this movie in 3-D. It's just an extra feature they used really well. Plus, when was the last time you saw a movie in 3-D!?I give Ice age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs a fat 9 out of 10 stars!",9,0,2,3 August 2009
Signs," Signs is a movie with a lot of potential, but sadly doesn't use it
","I liked Signs at times, but I also disliked it at times. It's a mysterious, atmospheric movie that really has good scenes, but it could have been a lot better.Story? Cropcircles, UFO sightings, strange pictures and eventually aliens who come to Earth. Hostile aliens...The story mainly involves a family of four living in a farm in the middle of nowhere. All four characters are played well and you'll get attached to them, or some of them at least. So the acting is quite nice.The movie's main strong point is the suspense and slowly building towards a climax. It's done very well, but past a certain point in the film, it weakens. Too bad though, because for the first half of the movie, I was on the edge of my seat.So basically Signs is a nice movie, but it could have been better at some points. It's certainly watchable, but don't expect a masterpiece.7 out of 10 stars.",7,3,5,27 July 2009
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A breath of fresh air!
","Nightmare on Elm street...If you are into horror you surely must have seen this gem already or at least heard about it.1, 2 Freddy's coming for you...The story is about Freddy Krueger. A child murderer burned alive and swore revenge on the ones who killed him. Now he stalks the children of the present while they dream, intending to slaughter them all!3, 4 Better lock your door...It's a very clever movie full of creepy scenes, good dialog and acting. I should also mention that there's a lot of creativity in this movie, especially when it comes to some dreams and deaths.5, 6 Get your crucifix One aspect I liked is how the main characters have to fight against something you eventually cannot avoid: sleep. It's a hopeless struggle. If you don't sleep for (I think) 11 days, you will die. But in this movie, if you sleep you will die anyway...7, 8 Gotta stay up late Go watch this classic if you haven't already! I give this 7 out of 10 stars.9, 10 You will never sleep again...",7,0,0,24 August 2009
Jurassic Park," A wonderful movie. Still enjoyable after so many years!
","Jurassic Park.I still remember the first time I saw this movie. It was in the cinema in the first week that it was released. Me and my friends were psyched to see it and we also left the theatre, psyched.From start to finish, this movie delivers an incredible feat.Steven Spielberg has once again created a world you'll really grow into. With it's characters, the music, atmosphere, humor, scares and of course the biggest stars: the dinosaurs.Let's start with the acting. What can I say? It's just excellent! There isn't a single character in this movie that I really hate. Okay, except for that one guy; but he gets eaten anyway! Jeff Goldblum steals the show (for me) as the skeptic chaologist??, while Sam Neil, Laura Dern and the two kids give the best portion of the film when it comes to adventure and humor. The rather small role for Samuel Jackson must be noted as well. There are a lot of familiar faces in this movie, if you pay attention.The music... It's just... time-less. If you close your eyes while listening to the score, you can almost touch the dinosaurs as they march across the vast plains of the Jurassic era. Large and majestic. Almost like an untouchable deity.You want humor? You'll get it in this movie too! There's tons of it, and no character can escape it, not even the dinosaurs themselves! And then there are scary moments. Oh yes there are... I remember my younger self shivering in the cinema at some scenes. Definitely not a movie for a young kid, despite what people might say. There are some really frightening moments. But if you are at the age of 12 or above, you will enjoy this movie a lot.My last stop is the dinosaurs. They are brought to the screen with the utmost detail. The way they move, roar, jump, run, climb, bash, slash and bite all feels real.Two sequels were made for this movie. But this classic tale will forever be locked in my heart. I treasure it deeply.Jurassic Park receives from me a solid 9 out of 10 stars.",9,3,4,4 May 2009
