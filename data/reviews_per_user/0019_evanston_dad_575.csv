The Rock," Pretty Much the Definition of Dumb Action Flick
","Another of Michael Bay's big, dumb, uber-macho action films.This has all the Bay trademarks -- the copious use of slow motion, the emphatic sound effects, the thudding plot exposition. The recent Bourne movies have proved that effective action films don't have to treat their audiences like they're retarded, but Bay apparently hasn't yet gotten that memo.And there's always something vaguely homoerotic about movies like this. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we're always watching a bunch of sweaty men playing with their big guns.Grade: C+",6,1,2,17 June 2009
Ford v Ferrari," Did Ron Howard Direct This Movie?
","Blech, did Ron Howard direct this thing, or is James Mangold just trying to trick us into thinking he did?Look, I'm not at all into cars or car racing, so maybe I'm not the target audience for this. But I'm also not into diamonds or the diamond business, and I thought 'Uncut Gems' was one of the best films of the year. I don't have to be 'into' a subject in order to enjoy a movie about it, if the movie is done well.'Ford v Ferrari' is the kind of dull, bland movie made to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award, which....guess what?.....it was. The world is full of urgent problems, so what's the last thing we need? A bro movie about a car race from 50 years ago. But if you're going to make one, try to make one more memorable than this. This is the kind of movie that makes whenever it's set look like a glossy magazine version of that particular time period. It's the kind of movie that has one woman in it, in this case The Wife, who the screenplay assures us belongs in this world of boring white men because she knows a lot about cars and can be sexually suggestive when talking about them. It's the kind of movie that lets us know who the chief rival in the big final race is by cutting to shots of him glowering at the screen literally every 15 seconds. It's full of a certain American attitude I simply can't stand, exemplified by the fact that it has to make all of the Europeans in the movie look like bungling fools. I'm not sure what the movie's point is. I think it means to set up a conflict between those men who built and raced cars because of their passion for the art of it and those who just wanted to make a buck off of it. So of course this message is packaged in the safest, shiniest, most corporate Hollywood product imaginable.Matt Damon's good ol' boy accent is unacceptable. Christian Bale is too good to be in this movie. Noah Jupe is a cute kid but he's used as a cheap narrative tactic to make us even more worried about the race scenes because we don't want to have to watch a little boy watch his dad go up in flames in real time. The best moment in the movie belongs to Tracey Letts.Grade: C",5,8,17,21 January 2020
The Blair Witch Project," One of the 10 Scariest Movies I've Ever Seen
","A deeply scary movie that shows how limited resources can work to a horror film's advantage.'The Blair Witch Project' was the first film to show how powerful the Internet could be as a marketing tool, and it's been copied less effectively ever since, most recently by 'Paranormal Activity,' which set out to manufacture a 'Blair Witch' style phenomenon. The difference is that 'Paranormal Activity' tried to manipulate its way into cult status, whereas 'Blair Witch' genuinely came out of nowhere to achieve that feat naturally.This movie chilled me to the bone and stuck with me for days afterward. I don't know if people seeing it now out of context can appreciate the effect this film had on audiences at the time of its release.Grade: A",9,2,4,30 June 2010
The King's Speech," My Fair Monarch
","It's so hard when you're seeing a movie after it's been hyped as much as 'The King's Speech' has and been nominated for 12 Academy Awards to boot not to have expectations of greatness....and be somewhat disappointed when greatness fails to materialize.That said, 'The King's Speech' is a perfectly well-made and mostly entertaining film about King George VI and his efforts to overcome a stutter that threatened to hurt his image as ruler of his kingdom. The speech of the title is the one George delivered to the British people declaring war on Germany at the outbreak of WWII. The delivery of that speech is the film's best moment; the rest of the movie is tasteful and intelligent, but not overly inspired.I could have done without the 'Ordinary People' therapy moments between George and his speech therapist (played in the film's best performance by Geoffrey Rush), in which we learn that George's problem results from a troubled childhood and the pressures placed upon him by dear old poppa. Those scenes are redundant anyway, because one scene between George and his dad (played with brief gusto by Michael Gambon) tells us all we need to know. However, I did like what the movie had to say about the emergence of radio and how it redefined public relations. After radio came along, it was no longer enough for leaders to simply be seen by their public; they had to be heard too, and they better be sure when they were heard that they sounded like leaders. At the time I saw this, I was reading David Halberstam's 'The Fifties,' which talks at length about the very same kind of transition between radio and television in the late 1940s, so I found that part of the film especially of interest.Colin Firth is quite good as George, and Helena Bonham Carter doesn't get much to do (but does what she does get to do well enough) as the Queen Mum.Grade: B+",7,2,3,17 February 2011
The Mask," One of Jim Carrey's Better Comedies
","Combining Jim Carrey with a bunch of giddy special effects seems like a redundancy, since Carrey himself IS a special effect. But that's just what this film does, with mostly entertaining results.Carrey plays a nerd who finds a mask that transforms him into a superhero when he wears it. Cue lots of intentionally cartoonish effects reminiscent of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' The film features an early role for Cameron Diaz as a love interest for Carrey.The film was Academy Award nominated for its visual effects, but it lost the award to the much subtler and more impressive effects of 'Forrest Gump.'Grade: B",7,0,0,17 March 2009
Saturday Night Fever," Look Mr. Kotter, I Can Dance!
","It would be almost impossible to believe that John Travolta received an Academy Award nomination for this movie if the Academy didn't have a long history of nominating films and performances that left us scratching our heads at what they were thinking.Actually, Travolta's not bad in this movie; if anything, he's absolutely the only reason to watch it now, because the movie itself just isn't very good. It's got groovy music, coiffed hair and 1970s disco atmosphere dripping from every frame, but it's primarily an excuse for a bunch of flashy dance numbers without the burden of stringing them together with anything resembling a real plot. It's hokey and harmless, but I can think of a thousand other movies off of the top of my head that would be more worth your time than this.Grade: C+",5,0,1,20 September 2007
The Lobster," What a Bunch of Animals
","Yorgos Lanthimos disturbed the hell out of me with 'Dogtooth,' his Academy-Award nominated film from 2010, and I still can't get that cinematic mind f**k out of my head. Now he returns with another provocation, and while certainly giving my wife and I something to chat about afterwards, doesn't make the same impact that he did with his previous film.'The Lobster' is billed as a dark comedy, and certainly the premise sounds like a bit of absurd surrealism: single people are taken into custody and sent to a hotel where they must fall in love within a certain number of days or turn into the animal of their choice. There are all sorts of rules in place within the hotel as well as punishments for breaking them. Outside of the hotel, a group of resistance fighters have created their own little society of single people, and impose as strict punishments for those caught falling in love as the hotel does for those who remain single. The whole thing is presented as a nightmarish alternate reality to the one we live in; as in the world created in 'Dogtooth,' everything is slightly off-kilter and out of step with the world as we know it, yet familiar enough to make us uncomfortable that it so closely resembles the one we live in.The biggest problem with 'The Lobster' is the inconsistency of tone. I never knew from one scene to the next if Lanthimos was striving and failing at black comedy, or whether I was supposed to be taking everything at face value. There's a lot going on in the film thematically to make it resonate strongly with the troubled times in which we live -- themes of totalitarian government, intolerance of differing lifestyles, cultural obsessions with placing people into easily identifiable categories, the absurdity of trying to manufacture love in this age of 'The Bachelor' -- but unfortunately the languid, monotonous rhythm of the movie undermines its examination of any of these topics. The actors, many of them usually very good -- like Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, Lea Seydoux, and John C. Reilly -- are directed to walk through the film in a deadpan haze. This maybe was an attempt by Lanthimos to establish an ironic distance, but it has the effect of making all of the characters, and as a result what happens to them, difficult to care about.I like challenging, provocative cinema, but not when used to obfuscate rather than enhance.Grade: B-",6,1,3,18 July 2016
Moneyball," See? Statistics Can Be Fun
","Aaron Sorkin appears to be the go-to guy for making movies that should be dull as dirt instead wildly entertaining.Last year, he made me hang on every word of the jibber jabber Internet geek speak of 'The Social Network.' This year, he takes on -- are you ready? -- predictive analytics as applied to baseball and has contributed to one of the best movies of the year.Of course, Sorkin did not do it alone. Co-written by Stephen Zaillian, directed by Bennett Miller (of 'Capote' fame) and starring a never-better Brad Pitt, 'Moneyball' is a poster child for a the kind of spare, dramatically streamlined and engrossing film that comes along all too infrequently. Telling the story of Billy Beane, general manager of the beleaguered Oakland A's baseball team, who revolutionized the way baseball players are drafted when a data whiz kid (played by Jonah Hill) makes him understand the role statistics can play in picking the best players, 'Moneyball' is probably more entertaining to people who like baseball, but a love of the sport isn't a requirement in warming to the film. It's just good, plain and simple, and anyone who likes a well-told story should find much to like here.The cast also includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the team's pig-headed coach, and Robin Wright (who popped up all over the place this year) as Pitt's ex-wife.Grade: A",9,0,2,3 February 2012
The Avengers," It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's an Iron Man, It's a Hulk....
","Every fan geek's ultimate wet dream has been realized in this action movie that brings together all of the Marvel superheros that have appeared separately in their own films. It's not a big shocker that the film is loud, bombastic and only marginally coherent. It also happens to be exciting, funny and self aware enough to know just how seriously to treat the material. The result may not be one of the best action films ever made, but it's probably one of the better ones to be released in recent years.The boys in this movie -- Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Liam Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner -- are clearly meant to own the show, but it's Scarlett Johannsson who steals it.Grade: B+",7,2,7,17 March 2013
Blade Runner 2049," Slogging Our Way Through a Dystopian Future
","I felt the same way about 'Blade Runner 2049' as I did Ridley Scott's 1982 original: it's slow, ponderous, and portentous.The dystopia has been ratcheted up a notch in this sequel set just around the corner. My office can't even figure out how to get video conferencing to work consistently, but we're supposed to have flying cars by 2049? We'd better hustle.Denis Villeneuve directs at a funereal pace to give us one long, sustained note of sci-fi gloominess. This is the kind of film in which characters don't speak lines, they recite maxims. Where scenes begin with some mad genius monologuing in an attempt to imbue what really should just be a pulpy noir with philosophical import. Every single frame of this film is calculated to make its audience feel like there's more significance than there actually is, and it's too self- consciously aware of its own effects, as if you can hear someone off-camera saying, 'ooohhh, look what our visual effects team has done here.' All of the actors have been asked to make their faces as blank as possible and speak in emotionless monotones, as if Villeneuve is daring them to have fun. All of these things were wrong with the original film as well, but instead of learning from the mistakes of the past, Villeneuve has set out to reproduce them. He's done too good a job.Grade: C-",4,2,7,6 December 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Vol. 1 Was Dessert--This Is the Main Course
","'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is the second half of one large story, and it creates a cohesive whole with the first part, but in many ways it's a completely different movie from Vol. 1. The first half was all about movement--it was almost balletic in its merging of images and music. Vol. 2 slows down, WAY down, to create a stoic, mythic conclusion. Where events in Vol. 1 rushed by in a glib montage, with blood spewing and limbs flying around the screen in a parody of film violence, everything about Vol. 2 feels heavy with consequence---there's much less violence, but what there is feels like it matters far more.Uma Thurman gave a nimble, athletic performance in Vol. 1, but really impresses here with her ability to get to the dramatic bottom of her character. Beatrix Kiddo's conflict emerges---she becomes a flesh and blood human character rather than a comic book hero seeking revenge. David Carradine, as Bill, is the second part's most significant addition, and he plays his part perfectly. And I got a kick out of Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver, who turns in a memorable cameo in the first part, but really gets a chance to strut her stuff in the second.I don't think it's a criticism of Tarantino's films to say that the first part is all style while the second part is the substance; it's like eating your dessert before the main meal. I think Tarantino would be the first to agree, and both parts exhibit all the signs of being thoughtfully and carefully assembled. One thing you're never in doubt of when dealing with Tarantino is that you're seeing the exact movie he wants you to see.But why spend time worrying about which one is better or which one succeeds more? They're both part of the same movie---one wouldn't exist without the other. And they're both remarkable.Grade: A+",10,2,4,3 February 2006
First Man," Who Knew Space Was Such a Slog?
","Seriously, is the space program really this dreary?Ok, so Damien Chazelle, the wunderkind director who wowed everyone with 'Whiplash' and 'La La Land,' didn't want to make an astronaut movie in the traditional Hollywood mode of films such as, say, 'The Right Stuff.' Fair enough. Neil Armstrong was a bit of a reluctant hero, shy of fame and press and motivated more by internal reasons (according to this film, at least) than by the glamour of the space program. Indeed, this movie seems to be saying that the glamour highlighted in other movies is largely a fiction, and that the real story is one of hard and thankless work, drudgery, stress, anxiety, loneliness, you name it. I believe that that's true. But is any of that reason to inflict such a gloomy slog of a movie on us? Was Neil Armstrong really the blank-faced automaton as portrayed by Ryan Gosling? Do we have to drain every ounce of excitement and wonder out of the story just to make it more authentic? Because even if it's not as exciting or dramatic as 'The Right Stuff' makes it look, still, space travel is pretty cool, and we should be allowed our sense of awe at seeing a man walk on the moon for the first time.And Chazelle's directorial choices are irritatingly claustrophobic throughout this film. I get that he wants us to perceive events from the perspective of the astronauts, which accounts for the tight and shaky frames and limited viewpoints, but he sticks so rigidly to his aesthetic that he makes it literally difficult to see what's going on, which just becomes aggravating after a while.The movie does have one thing going for it, which is Justin Hurwitz's wonderful score. It's the only thing about the film that comes close to being rousing, and it deserves a better movie.No wonder this one bombed.Grade: D",4,4,6,25 February 2019
Vertigo," Accomplished If Not 'Fun' Hitchcock Drama
","Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, 'Vertigo' may be tough to warm up to on a first viewing. It's an enigmatic and extremely slow-moving film, and it feels personal in ways that many of Hitchcock's other, more playful movies don't. You get the sense that Hitch is working through his personal demons on screen -- the fetishes and obsessions that played such a major role in so many of his films leading up to 'Vertigo' feel like characters in and of themselves here.James Stewart delivers a frightening performance as a man who plunges into a world of weird sexual obsession when a woman with whom he's formed a romantic attachment dies (or seems to). He finds another woman who looks amazingly like the first, and proceeds to force a complete physical makeover on her in an attempt to recreate his former love. Kim Novak plays the two women in her typical icy fashion; for once, her stilted, awkward acting works for a role and comes off as an attribute rather than a liability.In its new remastered life on DVD, 'Vertigo' looks stunning. San Francisco and its surroundings are bathed in ethereal, dream-like lighting, and Hitchcock pays more attention to art direction and the use of color than he ever had previously. Also, there's that amazing swirling Bernard Herrmann score that haunts the film, and accompanies one of the most memorable opening credits sequences ever filmed.There are still a number of other Hitchcock films I would rather watch before 'Vertigo,' and many others that I would qualify as much more fun, but I can't deny that this one certainly has an allure.Grade: A",9,7,9,12 September 2006
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Am I the Only One Who Thinks Guy Pearce Makes a Hot Woman?
","The surprise indie hit about three drag queens who go on a voyage of self discovery. Hollywood liked it so much that it basically remade it as 'To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,' with bigger names and a sanitized plot.Marketing for 'Priscilla' makes it seem like a gay romp (sorry, I couldn't resist), but it's not. It's actually a very serious and quite depressing film. These are not drag queens full of bravado and content to be who they are. These are men struggling with serious issues and to some extent using their female personas to hide. Yes, there are some disco numbers and lots of dazzling costumes, and yes, 'I Will Survive' does make its appearance, but anyone coming to the movie thinking it's going to be a riot are sure to be disappointed.It boasts three great performances from Hugo Weaving, Terence Stamp and Guy Pearce, who particularly proves to the world how hot a woman he can be.Grade: B+",6,1,5,17 March 2009
Black Swan," Move Over Queen Amidala, There's a New Swan in Town
","Film provocateur Darren Aronofsky takes the theme of artistic obsession and perfection to breathtaking extremes in 'Black Swan,' his latest movie freak out.Natalie Portman plays Nina Sayers, an accomplished but cold ballerina, whose obsession with control and perfection in her dancing jeopardizes her chances at landing the role of a dancer's lifetime, the Swan Queen in 'Swan Lake.' After she convinces the show's director (Vincent Cassel) that she can be sexual and dangerous, she gets the part of both the white and black swan, usually danced by two different people, and thus begins her nightmarish journey to lose herself enough to convincingly play the black swan. Lose herself she does, but not just artistically. 'Black Swan' is one long sustained note of mental frenzy as Nina cracks.The formal structure of 'Black Swan' mirrors Nina's mental state. The film builds up to moments of outrageous camp, but always backs off just before it allows itself to go completely over the top. I spent most of the film wishing that it would push further, until I realized that the movie was building to one of the most memorable climaxes I can recall, when Nina finally makes her full transformation into the black swan. As horrifying as these final scenes are, they're also thrilling, and the film sent me out on a high.Natalie Portman is perfect casting as a high-strung, fragile ballerina, and for most of the movie she's not asked to do much more than cry and whimper. But those last scenes, when she so effectively convinces both audiences -- the one in the film and the one watching it -- that she's got what it takes to be dangerous, put the rest of her performance in perspective and make the whole thing more impressive than it might be at first glance. She's given a lot of terrific support by Cassel, Mila Kunis as a fellow ballerina who may or may not be a rival to Nina, and especially Barbara Hershey, as Nina's stage mom from ballerina hell. Also making a couple of brief appearances as a washed up dancer is Winona Ryder, who finds some new and unsettling uses for a letter opener.'Black Swan' suggests something I've suspected for quite a while -- that frequently an artist's best work is created when he is least sane.Grade: A",8,5,12,2 January 2011
Changeling," If You Want to Ensure Your Film Won't Be a Masterpiece, Cast Either Half of Brangelina
","Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are perfectly matched, as both boast beautiful faces and a painful lack of serious acting ability.However, in an acting face off, I'd put my money on Jolie. She did much better with her 2008 Oscar-bait outing, 'Changeling,' than Pitt did with his, 'The Curiously Boring and Pointless Case of the Blank-Faced Benjamin Button.' Jolie plays Christine Collins, a single mother in 1928 Los Angeles whose son goes missing. When the corrupt police department return the wrong boy to her and she tries to raise a stink about it, they have her committed to a mental institution rather than admit their embarrassing mistake. But eventually, a grisly discovery becomes too large a story to ignore, and the LAPD is brought to task for its dirty dealings.'Changeling' is a solid accomplishment from director Clint Eastwood. It's not anywhere nearly as good as his other 2008 film, 'Gran Torino,' but it's not nearly as bad as its critical reception had led me to expect. But the film succeeds largely in spite of Jolie's performance rather than because of it. Jolie is simply not able to make sense of this character. Maybe the fault is with the casting in the first place. We have to believe that Christine Collins is timid and mousy enough to allow herself, even for a moment, to believe that the boy returned to her is in fact her son, even though she's convinced he's not. But there's not a timid bone in Jolie's body, and that part of the film never makes an ounce of sense. The Christine Collins we see humbly bowing to the whims of the police doesn't match up with the Christine Collins we see in the workplace, barking orders in her role as a manager, or the flirty, glamour puss Collins that emerges toward the film's end. Pick a character, any character.There are some quite disturbing scenes involving violence toward children (violence seems almost too mild a term for what's actually done to them), scenes that are only slightly less disturbing than the ones in which John Malkovich appears, playing a pastor who aids Collins in her fight against corruption. Malkovich, by simply appearing in a film, brings it a healthy dose of 'ick' factor, but I liked him here probably more than I ever have, just because he's one of the only characters in the movie who's not a slimeball. Jeffrey Donovan, of 'Burn Notice' fame, plays the chief of police and decides for some reason to use an Irish accent that never quite materializes completely. Amy Ryan also appears as a fellow inmate in the institution, and looks and sounds like she should be starring in a women's prison film set in 1987.However, the film itself looks good, and though it meanders a bit, it's always engaging. Because Eastwood chooses to give it an old-time Hollywood movie feeling, some of the more histrionic and heavy-handed elements go down smoother than they might otherwise. Let's face it, the man knows his way around a movie set, and he's probably incapable of making an outright bad movie. But next time, I might suggest that he check to see if Julianne Moore is available.Grade: B+",7,2,8,24 February 2009
The New World," Malick Stumbles
","It gives me no pleasure to report that the fourth film in nearly eight times as many years from that most roguish of Hollywood's rogue directors, Terrence Malick, is mostly a failure. Give the guy a break, though. When the first three movies you make are unequivocal masterpieces, you're allowed to stumble.All of the devices Malick has employed in previous films to turn what would be sweeping epics in the hands of any other director into feverish internal character studies are present here. But in 'The New World,' they curiously have the reverse effect. Instead of drawing us into the minds of his characters, Malick keeps us at a distance, and his film remains too enigmatic for us to fully appreciate.The biggest problem with this movie is its non-committal tone. According to history (though granted, there are many different accounts of the Pocahontas story), John Smith was pretty much an ass, who left Pocahontas behind because he didn't really want her---in another account, he's forced to leave America because of a severe injury. Malick turns the Smith/Pocahontas story into a star-crossed lover's tale, with Smith the smoldering hero who turns away because he wants to protect Pocahontas from a world that won't accept her. Except that once she is taken in by the colonists, she's treated just fine, which makes one wonder what the big problem was to begin with. Malick uses his usual ruminating voice overs to draw us into the minds of Smith and Pocahontas, but this time around their thoughts don't communicate anything of much importance.Malick's version of the tale feels tidied up and sanitized, lacking in any dramatic conflict. When Smith meets Pocahontas again in England after a long absence, something about their exchange brings closure for her, and she is able to forget Smith and commit herself to her husband and child---but what that something is remains a mystery, for neither the screenplay nor the performances convey it. And Pocahontas's death feels rushed through; surely Malick could have trimmed one or two meandering scenes of tree and sky earlier in the film to give it a better sense of symmetry.The performances really disappoint too, but I'm not so sure that's the fault of the actors as much as it is the writing. They're not really given robust characters to play, so no one registers all that much, not even Q'orianka Kilcher, who's supposed to be a lifeforce to which everyone is drawn.'The New World' probably warrants a second look, and I suspect I may come away admiring it more after I see it again. Malick's films aren't easy, and that's what I like about them. It's just that he's been on such firmer ground before that this movie fell way below my expectations. Immediately after leaving the theatre after seeing 'The Thin Red Line,' I knew that I had just witnessed a masterpiece in real time. Leaving the theatre after 'The New World,' I knew that I was just leaving.Grade: C",6,3,6,30 January 2006
Love and Death," Russia Beware -- Here Comes Woody Allen
","The last of Woody Allen's outright screwball comedies of the 1970s is a spoof of Russian novels and drama, with a healthy dose of Ingmar Bergman thrown in as well. The references fly almost faster than you can catch them -- no one is safe, not Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov. Watch for Allen's movie quoting other movies, like 'Doctor Zhivago,' 'The Battleship Potemkin' and 'Persona.' The film culminates with a scene in which Allen's hapless Russian schmuck teams up with the cousin with whom he is desperately but unrequitedly in love (Diane Keaton) to assassinate Napolean, though the person they're trying to kill is actually a Napolean impostor. All of this madcap, zany comedy ends with a hat tip to Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal,' of all films, as the Allen character goes dancing through a meadow with the Grim Reaper.This isn't the funniest Allen movie out there, but it's a harmless enough way to spend a quick 82 minutes.Grade: B",6,4,8,17 September 2007
Frost_Nixon," A Consummate Ron Howard Film, Which Means It's Not Remotely Artistic
","Frank Langella is getting heaps of praise for his performance as Richard Nixon in this Ron Howard film, but it's Michael Sheen, who delivers a spunky performance as David Frost, the lightweight British talk-show host, who deserves the most acclaim.The film chronicles the famous Frost/Nixon interview that occurred a few years after Nixon's resignation. Both sides went into the interview like it was a boxing match, the Nixon camp seeing a chance to exonerate the infamous political figure in the public's eye, the Frost camp seeing an opportunity to get Nixon to admit publicly that he broke the law. The showdown should have been exciting (and by all accounts was, though I was far too young at the time to know about any of it), but events in the film only reach a moderate simmer when they should boil. Both Langella and Sheen give excellent performances, and they're backed by able actors (like Oliver Platt, Sam Rockwell and Kevin Bacon), but the film remains staunchly unexciting.The film could have gone in any number of interesting directions. Frost, an Englishman, clearly doesn't understand the passion with which his American aides want retribution from the encounter with Nixon, and I was interested in the role this difference in cultural perspective played. Also, the screenplay early on mentions the impact of television on the proceedings, positing that Frost ultimately won because he knew the medium while Nixon didn't. But this is just told to us, not shown. Rather than develop either of these engaging ideas, director Ron Howard instead decides, typically, to charge straight down the middle and deliver a consummate Ron Howard film. Therefore, it's solid, professional, slick and not remotely artistic.Grade: B",7,2,6,5 January 2009
Walk the Line," Same Old, Same Old
","'Walk the Line' is a warmed over version of 'Ray,' trotted out just in time for Oscar consideration, shrewd timing since the Academy never saw a biopic it didn't like.The problem is that 'Walk the Line' is inferior to 'Ray' in just about every way, and I wasn't even a huge fan of the latter picture. If you don't know anything about Johnny Cash, or what it was about his music that makes him such a legendary figure, you won't learn it here. As played by Joaquin Phoenix in a horribly mannered performance, Cash started out his career barely able to function from one day to the next, and never really improved until the love of a good woman (enter June Carter) turned him around. Phoenix's performance is one-note, all mumbled lines and eye-rolling freak out scenes. There's absolutely nothing interesting about Cash in this version of events, and there's no explanation of what it was about him that June Carter was so drawn to. Reese Witherspoon gives the better performance, but the material she's given limits the impact she can make. Johnny and June's relationship is muddled and ambiguous. I could never tell whether they were involved or not until his final freak out scene when he clumsily gets her to agree to marry him (don't even ask me why she'd want to).The biggest tragedy of this movie is that it doesn't provide any insight into what made Cash a genius, or how the demons he was working through influenced the kind of music he wanted to make. Tepid as I thought 'Ray' was, it at least accomplished that much.I've heard some people say that the performances in 'Walk the Line' are better than the movie itself. Revise that to read Reese Witherspoon's performance is better than the movie, and I'll agree.Grade: C+",6,5,13,28 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Hilarious (and Much Needed) Assault on Decency
","Sacha Baron Cohen comes to America in the guise of Borat Sagdiyev and wreaks his own brand of Kazakhi havoc in this very very funny film.In our age of uber-political correctness, 'Borat' comes sweeping through like a brisk and refreshing wind, completely bounding over every cultural taboo we've erected around ourselves. Thus, no one is safe: Borat takes on Jews, blacks, gays, feminists, middle-Americans, religious fanatics, frat boys. The only weapon against the bumbling Borat is a sense of humour, which this movie shows most Americans painfully lack. Indeed, if there is any message to be had from 'Borat' (and I'm not sure there is much of one, beyond its fascinating cultural experiments), it's that everyone needs to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously.The image of Americans projected in this film varies from the heartwarming to the downright frightening. New Yorkers threaten Borat with physical violence when he approaches them on a subway. Feminists walk out on him when they find his views on women too much to tolerate. Folks out in the heartland commiserate with him over his hatred of gays and Jews; a gun shop owner even helps him pick out the best weapon for shooting Jewish people. A sweet Jewish couple give him a place to sleep, and bring him a homey meal (that is, before they turn into invading cockroaches). A group of manic Pentecosts help him find Jesus. An RV full of frat boys make complete asses of themselves by espousing their hopelessly ill-informed views on minorities in our country and the need to revert to slavery. The majority of people treat Borat in the condescending way of those who want to think of themselves as being culturally aware without really knowing anything at all about other cultures. These people become rude the second Borat offends their sense of propriety. On the other hand, the disenfranchised of America greet Borat with open arms, and we see a group of gays and a group of blacks interacting with him as if no cultural boundaries existed at all. The film's sweetest (and most unexpectedly so) moments come from Borat's befriending of a black prostitute.Of course, this is a carefully crafted work of fiction, and Cohen only lets his audience see what he wants them to see. I would probably react much the same as many of the people in this film if this crazy-looking and sounding man appeared out of nowhere and began to antagonize me. But the movie does make Americans look like a bunch of awfully self-important, uptight stiffs, and I've been to enough places in this country and met enough people to realize that the way events play out in this film (even if they are manipulated or staged) probably come very close to the real thing.Thank God for movies like 'Borat.' If nothing else, they remind us that our cultural boundaries only matter as much as we let them, and that all of the fears that govern political correctness are mostly ungrounded. After all, virtually every person in this film was offended at one point or another, and as far as I can tell, all of them lived to tell about it.Grade: A",8,431,566,13 November 2006
Alien 3," The Alien Itself Is One of the Least Unpleasant Things About This Movie
","David Fincher's contribution to the 'Alien' series is a completely unpleasant experience. It's grim, dour, grungy and depressing, filled with ugly characters who we don't learn anything about and therefore don't care about. As they get picked off one by one by the alien, we're moved to feel nothing more than that Fincher is automatically going through the motions. There's no thrill in this film, as there was in the first two films. There's also not a scare -- neither psychological nor visceral -- to be had. This sequel brings nothing new to the story -- after 'Aliens,' the creators of this series should have put it to rest, because there isn't much more material to mine from this particular concept.And one of the things that bothered me the most about 'Alien 3' is its inconsistency. How can Ripley be impregnated with an alien for weeks before it hatches from her, whereas every other single creature infected before her (even including the dog in this one) hatches an alien seemingly within hours? You can't change the rules on us and not expect us to rebel.Grade: C-",4,426,445,31 March 2008
The Incredible Hulk," The Jolly Green Giant Can Hold His Head Up with Pride This Time Around
","If you were hoping for a big-screen version of the Hulk that would clear the vomit taste from your mouth left by Ang Lee's debacle a few years ago, you're in luck. This new film that starts over with the Hulk's story is lean, mean and green, much like its titular troubled soul. That troubled soul, who exists under the geeky guise of Bruce Banner during his more laid back moments, is played by Edward Norton, and that's largely why this film is better. Superhero movies are a dime a dozen anymore, and they all, to a lesser or greater extent, look and sound the same. One of the only things that distinguishes one from the other is the quality of the acting, which is why this film can hold its head up with that other surprisingly good superhero film from earlier this summer, 'Iron Man'.Along with Norton, 'The Incredible Hulk' features William Hurt, as the standard slightly crazy Army general that we all love to hate, Tim Roth, as the Hulk's nemesis, The Abomination, and Liv Tyler as Betty, the love interest. Tyler and Hurt get put through the usual acting paces their roles would suggest, which means Tyler must look worried and Hurt must glower, but they look worried and glower well, respectively. And the idiosyncratic casting of Roth as the film's villain actually lends the film a bit of novelty.By the end, the movie devolves into an action film indistinguishable from any other, all deafening sound effects and been-there-done-that CGI. But everything leading up to that is slightly better than average for the genre.Grade: B+",7,2,4,1 July 2008
Antz," Who Knew Woody Allen Would Make Such a Charming Insect
","I loved 'Antz,' Dreamworks' less well received version of Pixar's 'A Bug's Life,' released the same year.It was inspired casting to make Woody Allen the lead, and it's amazing how much chemistry he and Sharon Stone have when all you can hear of them are their voices.The film's final gag is very funny. The epic story of our little ant hero seems to take him to far-flung areas of the globe, the camera zooms out for its final shot, and we realize that the whole film has taken place in about a two-foot square piece of grass.Grade: A",8,0,1,22 June 2010
Lucky Number Slevin," Where Did This Terrific Little Film Come From?
","This stylish and fiendishly entertaining puzzle movie stars Josh Hartnett, usually an actor I find it easy to dislike, giving a surprisingly good performance as Slevin, a laid-back drifter type who shows up at his friend's apartment to hang out for a few weeks and finds himself the target of two rival crime lords when he's mistaken for his friend. The plot twists and turns -- it's one of those movies where the whole point is the trick ending, but in this case (unlike so many movies of a similar ilk) the rest of the script is so well written that the ending, when it comes, actually feels like a payoff rather than a cheat.Director Paul McGuigan gives the whole film a tone to match the character of Slevin. Everything is loose and cool -- even the violent scenes (and there are some pretty graphic ones) come and go without ruffling too many feathers. Hartnett gets solid support from Bruce Willis, that king of dead-pan crime films, and Lucy Liu, who seems somewhat less comfortable in her role as a chatty his girl Friday, and who gets disappointingly little to do. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley play the crime lords. It's refreshing to see Freeman break away from his wizened sage roles, and Kingsley is strong as always, even if his accent is unidentifiable.But the ultimate star of this film is the production design. Just keep your eye on the sets and decor, that add a fun house sense of disorientation to this diamond-in-the-rough of a movie.Grade: A",8,2,5,27 November 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Like It or Not, a Film That's Impossible to Get Out of Your Head
","I can easily see how two different people could have two completely different experiences watching Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream.' On the one hand, it wouldn't be difficult to dismiss the film as an over-the-top mess. But on the other hand, it's such a confident mess that it would be as easy to label it a nightmarish masterpiece.I tend to fall somewhere in the middle, leaning a bit more toward the latter. There are problems galore to find with the film if you go digging, but it deeply disturbed and affected me nonetheless.The film introduces us to a handful of characters all deeply dependent on drugs of one kind or another, and then follows them all down a demented rabbit hole as their stories spiral out of control. The final 20 minutes or so are a harrowing montage of terrible things happening to all of them -- infected arms being amputated, girls performing sex shows for drug money, middle aged women ending up in psych wards receiving shock therapy -- and threaten to take the film too far into camp territory to recover. But the saving grace of the film is that it's meant as more of an impressionistic soliloquy on desperation and hopelessness rather than a realistic representation of drug abuse.Whatever else it is, it's a film that's virtually impossible to get out of your head.Grade: A",8,1,2,14 July 2010
Captain Phillips," Tom Hanks in Danger on the High Seas
","Tom Hanks gives an economical, terse performance in Paul Greengrass's dramatization of a true story about a cargo ship whose captain is taken hostage by a group of Somali pirates.'Captain Phillips' did not have the nail biting punch to my gut that Greengrass's excellent 'United 93' did, but that might be due to the fact that I didn't have as much invested in this story. The adjective terse applies to more than Hanks's performance -- Greengrass is an expert at cutting out any superfluous information and laser focusing his film on the events at hand. The film is refreshingly free of the usual action movie heroics; Hanks is a regular guy who has some training in how to deal with a pirate situation but who's never really been tested until one such situation actually arises. Nothing brings this point home more than the film's concluding scenes, during which Hanks, who has held up stoically through his ordeal, completely breaks down the way any of us would. This emotional punch makes what would otherwise have been a good action movie a really good one.There's something almost tragic about how misguided the pirates are in thinking that the United States would ever consider bargaining with them. Phillips the character and we the audience know that Phillips' life is expendable in a worst case scenario, and that knowledge adds an element of suspense to the already tense situation.I didn't respond as warmly to the film as so many others seem to have. I thought it was perfectly fine while watching it, some scenes were excellent, but little of it was memorable.Grade: B+",7,1,3,24 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Necessary But Inert Installment in the 'Star Wars' Series
","George Lucas, what hath thou done to 'Star Wars?' Alas, only die-hard 'Star Wars' fans will be able to enjoy this first prequel, and even they may be hard pressed to muster up an ounce of interest in this inert story about trade disputes and underhanded politics that doesn't make an ounce of sense until you've seen episodes II and III. Admittedly, 'The Phantom Menace' gets better after you've seen the rest of the series, but on its own merits it's a pretty shaky effort.Lucas proves that he has virtually no skill in directing actors, as normally good performers like Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman sink like lead weights under terrible dialogue that no one could do anything with. (And don't even get me started on Samuel L. Jackson, who looks like he would rather be doing his laundry than appearing in this film). Lucas gives his actors no help either, as 'Menace,' and indeed the entire second trilogy, may as well be animated, and more often than not an actor is stranded in a sea of computer-generated graphics with nothing to react to. This computer-generated world looks nothing like the world created in the first trilogy, and that inconsistency is one of the most distracting things about the prequels.There are things about this movie I do like, though. I like the scenes with Anakin and his mom; I like Darth Maul; and I liked the pod race scene. Everything else feels like what it is -- necessary but unengaging set up for the REAL story that doesn't pick up steam until parts II and III.Grade: B-",6,0,2,26 September 2006
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Add It to the List of Films That Make Me Glad I Never Have to Relive High School
","A solid coming of age film about a misfit high school freshman who finds his niche in a clique of alternative seniors.The version of high school portrayed in this film does not remotely resemble anything I personally experienced in high school, and the film does push the boundaries of credibility a bit in having us believe that these sophisticated martini drinkers are 17 and 18 year olds. And are there that many places in the country where high schoolers are allowed to perform live to the local movie theatre's showings of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show?' (Or at least allowed to perform it wearing that little clothing?) But I could forgive the film much because it's clearly an adult's ruminations on high school filtered through the lens of adulthood, and as we've all experienced, our memories of things do not always closely match the facts of the things we're remembering.The three young actors at the film's center -- Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) -- give very good performances, but it's Lerman in particular who's the stand out. The film wouldn't be anywhere nearly as successful as it is without him.Grade: B+",7,1,3,15 April 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," Classic Case of Doesn't Know How (or When) to End
","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is 15 minutes of big-budget Hollywood sci-fi awkwardly tacked on to 90 minutes of claustrophobic psychological thriller. The end result is a film that kept me pretty engaged for the majority of its running time, only to end by leaving me pretty disappointed and feeling like I'd been duped into sitting through nothing but an excuse to make a sequel.John Goodman gives a fantastic performance as a survivalist who may or may not be a lunatic and who's keeping a young woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) sort of held captive in his bunker for motives that may or may not be admirable. As you might have guessed, there's a whole lot of ambiguity at the center of the film. We don't know exactly what's happening or why; we don't know who can be trusted and who can't. And both the fun and the tension in the film come from seeing plot points tick into place, sometimes clarifying things for us, other times confusing us even more. But this is a movie that suffers from a severe case of 'we don't know how to end this,' and it goes off the rails in a bad way in its last 15 minutes. Goodman's character turns into a laughably hokey monster when up to that point in the movie he's been anything but, and a series of actions carried out by our heroine stretch our credibility past its breaking point. I didn't have a problem with the big reveal at the film's climax, but the movie should have ended with it instead of continuing on long past the point when the novelty of the film's twist wears off.Not a total loss by any means, but definitely leaves the taste of misfire in the viewer's mouth.Grade: B",6,1,2,22 August 2016
3:10 to Yuma," This Wild West Belongs to Christian Bale and Russell Crowe
","I went into '3:10 to Yuma' with fairly low expectations, given James Mangold's track record as a mediocre director and the fact that I'm not necessarily a fan of westerns. How pleasantly surprised I was, then, to find that this particular western is slick and supremely entertaining.'3:10 to Yuma' has all the trappings of the traditional western -- outlaws, humble ranchers, gunslingers, salty old-timers, buxom saloon barmaids -- but Russell Crowe and Christian Bale, the outlaw and humble rancher, respectively, bring a contemporary sensibility to the material that feels integrated rather than incongruous. Bale's rancher, Dan Evans, is suffering from feelings of male inadequacy as a result of being on the brink of losing his farm to debt (he's already lost a leg to the Civil War). For two hundred dollars, he joins a group of upright townies who are escorting Ben Wade, vicious bad guy (Crowe), to the train that will take him to Yuma prison. But Wade's loyal band, led by Charlie Price (Ben Foster as the film's one weak link, giving a grating performance), won't let Wade go without a fight. Through clever writing and wonderful performances by Bale and Crowe, the two men almost become allies in making sure Wade gets to the train on time. Wade is so impressed with Evans' integrity, even though he doesn't understand it, that he almost wants to see Evans succeed, even if that means he himself goes to jail. It's really a fascinating relationship, and it's that element of the film that makes it more than just a standard genre exercise.The last quarter of the film is a nailbiter; Mangold falls back on that old reliable convention that westerns practically invented, the real time show down, with clocks placed here and there keeping time for the audience, and he does it well.The film belongs to Bale and Crowe, but there's strong acting throughout by the rest of the cast, notably Gretchen Mol in a few brief scenes as Evans' wife and Peter Fonda as the requisite crusty old-timer.Grade: A",8,2,5,1 October 2007
The Sound of Music," 'Springtime for Hitler' Ain't the Only Show with Singing Nazis
","'The Sound of Music' is easy to ridicule. It's sappy, corny and sentimental to the extreme. It hopelessly simplifies horrible world events, and makes it seem like all anyone needed to do to escape the iron fist of Hitler's regime was to schlep over some hills on a bright, sunny morning and say 'hello' to Switzerland. But I'm still recommending this movie, because it is one of the most accomplished movie musicals ever made.Robert Wise knew how to make a stage musical feel cinematic on the screen, as evidenced here and by his earlier 'West Side Story.' He could open up stage musicals so that they felt right at home on screen, and he was expert at using on-location photography to enhance material rather than highlight its limitations. In 'Music,' the Austrian scenery is dazzling, and nearly becomes a character in itself. And the music sounds great, though it's not one of Rodger's & Hammerstein's best scores (it falls well below 'The King and I' and 'Carousel.') Julie Andrews is perfect in the lead role; I can't imagine anyone else playing Maria. She had a knack for toning down overly-sentimental material until it almost became believable. And Eleanor Parker is the other stand out in the cast as the hilarious Baroness Schrader. My favorite moment comes when the family has burst into song for the umpteenth time and she leans over to Max (Richard Haydn) and whispers sarcastically, 'Why didn't you tell me to bring along my harmonica?' I forgive anyone who thinks this movie is just too gag-inducing to bear, but I still get some pleasure from popping it in every now and then.Grade: A-",8,3,11,27 March 2006
Ali," Rather Boring Bio of Muhammad Ali
","Michael Mann is a very hit-and-miss director for me. His movies either blow me out of the water ('The Insider,' 'Heat'), or they leave me cold ('Miami Vice,' 'Public Enemies'). Unfortunately, 'Ali' belongs to the latter category.Mann's filmmaking is always very assured, so when his movies miss, I'm never exactly sure why. There's just something boring about 'Ali.' It tells Muhammad Ali's story, and it does so with what could be mistaken for passion, but it just felt rote and lifeless to me, and far too long.Will Smith and Jon Voight were honored with Academy Award nominations for playing Ali and Howard Cosell, respectively, but clearly I'm not the only one to be underwhelmed by the film, as it bombed with audiences and couldn't even crack 7.0 here at IMDb.Grade: B-",6,26,34,26 July 2010
The Young Victoria," Emily Blunt Shines as Queen Victoria
","Sometimes I'm glad that my grasp of English history is pathetically feeble. It makes movies like 'The Young Victoria' much more suspenseful than they might otherwise be. I of course knew that Victoria reigned for a large part of the 19th century and that she died in 1901; I also knew that she was a renowned and powerful monarch. I didn't know much about her love life, and 'The Young Victoria' filled that gap in my knowledge nicely.Emily Blunt plays Victoria with a distinctly modern edge of feminism which may feel a bit anachronistic to picky historian purists but which also works. After all, women like Victoria WERE the feminists of their time, forced into making their mark in what was largely a man's world by a man's terms. I'm convinced that Blunt is one of the most promising of today's young actors. She has tremendous presence on screen; while she's on it, you don't want to look anywhere else. That presence is somewhat wasted in this movie, because her biggest competition comes not from any other actors but from the period sets and costumes. But she gives this rather light and inconsequential film some substance by virtue of simply being in it.Rupert Friend plays Albert, the man Victoria eventually marries, while Paul Bettany plays her chief adviser and confidant, the man angling to get himself married to her for his own political gain. The cast of British regulars also includes Jim Broadbent, who gets crazier with every role he plays, Miranda Richardson, as Victoria's doormat of a mother, and, notable in a small role, Harriet Walter as Victoria's widowed aunt and the only person other than her eventual husband who gives her any advice that's worth a damn.Grade: B+",7,24,27,11 May 2010
Catch Me If You Can," Romp with an Impostor
","Steven Spielberg's account of the truly fascinating story of Frank Abagnale, Jr., an impostor and con artist who waltzed from one side of the country to the other in the 1960s, ripping off just about everyone along the way.The film's period look is a lot of fun, and though the film gets a little sluggish at times -- not a complaint I can usually level at a Spielberg film -- it remains pretty entertaining. My biggest complaint might seem like a nit-picky one, but regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski handles the film's cinematography all wrong. Kaminski takes the same approach to lighting his films no matter what the subject: washed out color, backlit interiors. This works for gritty stuff like 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Schindler's List,' but doesn't for something like this film. But whatever....Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent on Abagnale's trail and Christopher Walken gives a heartbreaking, Academy-Award nominated performance as Abagnale's washed up dad.Grade: B+",7,1,3,5 August 2010
The Hangover," Surprised By How Dull and Safe This Movie Was
","I judge the quality of a film comedy by how much it makes me laugh. I think I laughed exactly twice during the entire running time of 'The Hangover.' I was a willing subject. I wanted to like this film after hearing the endless praise others have heaped on it. I sat waiting for the jokes to land. And waited. And waited.I heard more than one person say that they never see movies, but they saw this one and loved it. That should have been my first warning that it wasn't going to be that good. It's jokes are so obvious and ordinary. There are a bunch of stock characters -- the fat schlubby guy, the nerdy uptight guy, the alpha male -- and a bevy of tired jokes built around things like breast feeding and naked guys.I guess I missed the memo that straight males are supposed to find the sight of another guy's naked ass the most hilarious thing ever.Grade: B-",6,1,2,17 February 2010
Ghost," We Liked This?
","This huge hit that came out of nowhere in 1990 looks pretty silly in retrospect.Because 'Dirty Dancing' was such a big hit, people made the mistake of thinking that Patrick Swayze could actually act and began casting him in roles that required it. His eager attempts at emoting coupled with his ridiculous coif haircut are good for a chuckle or two. Speaking of haircuts, who thought it was a good idea to make Demi Moore look like a little boy? The love scene between Swayze and Moore is both embarrassing and icky, embarrassing because they rub clay all over each other and icky because Moore looks like Pinocchio.The only person who salvages the movie is Whoopi Goldberg, playing a fake medium who ends up being a real medium after all. Goldberg's crowd-pleasing performance won her an Oscar, and if anything about the film deserved an Oscar, God knows it was her.And I never want to hear 'Unchained Melody' again....Grade: C",5,6,13,17 October 2008
Marie Antoinette," A Piece of Candy
","Those who want to learn the history of Marie Antoinette will not find it in Sofia Coppola's film.This movie raised more questions than it answered for me. I didn't know much of anything about this famous French monarch, other than that she was eventually beheaded (which is not shown in the film) and that Norma Shearer starred in a 1938 version of her story. I did a little bit of reading about Marie Antoinette after seeing Coppola's movie and decided that Coppola took much too frivolous an approach to the material. Many of the details about Marie Antoinette's life as first wife of the dauphin and then queen are present, but if you don't know her story before watching the film, they may slide right past you without notice, even some quite significant ones. Coppola doesn't provide an historical context in which to place the film's action; therefore, we understand that certain things are important without understanding why. Why, for example, do the French end up hating her and Louis XVI so much? What mistakes do they make as leaders that drives their country to such a desperate point? The film ends with the king and queen fleeing the palace of Versailles -- there's a heck of a lot of story left to tell after that event, but it's not recorded here. I suspect Coppola was trying to put us in the queen's place -- she was a young, immature girl who was thrust into a position for which she was not emotionally ready. In the film, politics bore her, and she would much rather buy clothes and gossip. The job of running a country remains a vague nuisance pushed into the background. But this point of view approach backfires. We don't learn enough about what's at stake to ever feel especially concerned about Marie Antoinette or what happens to her, and the character itself isn't vivid.So why am I ultimately recommending the film? Because it's lively, colorful and extremely well directed. It reminded me of Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon': there's no substance to the movie, but it's so meticulously detailed in its production design, and it so faithfully recreates the rituals of 18th Century France, that it's absolutely fascinating on those terms alone. I enjoyed the anachronisms Coppola brings to the film: Kirsten Dunst, playing the title role, and Jason Schwartzman, as Louis XVI, speak in a slangy American dialect that doesn't even attempt to convince us that either of them is European; in one scene, during a flashy montage showing Antoinette and her female cohorts enjoying the frivolity and excess for which she was so notorious, we get a glimpse of Converse sneakers discarded in the background; and most notably, most of the soundtrack consists of contemporary pop tunes that comment on the action, and if they frequently take the burden of telling the story away from Coppola and her actors, they're also a lot of fun.Ultimately, 'Marie Antoinette' resembles one of the many gooey, decadent candies that the queen consumes throughout the film -- completely lacking in substance, but lovely to look at and perfectly suited to satisfy a craving for something sweet.Grade: A-",7,0,1,13 March 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," THE Ultimate Adventure Movie
","The 1980s were a dark time for cinema -- they didn't give us much to remember them by, unless you have a love of stuffy British dramas. However, the 80s DID do two things very well: adult-oriented comedies and adventure movies.'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is THE ultimate adventure movie. There had never been one quite like it and I don't think there ever will be one to match it, not even its sequels. This was a case of everything working just right. Steven Spielberg is at the top of his craft when in playful mode like this; Harrison Ford, though you'd never know it from his wooden persona today, made a perfect Indiana Jones (I can't imagine anyone else playing him); Karen Allen was able to convince you that she could be a damsel in distress one minute and then take you out back and kick the crap out of you the next; and John Williams contributed one of his best and most memorable scores. The film simply races from one dazzling set piece to the next, and the joy is in seeing just how much more over the top the film can get with each passing minute.Grade: A+",10,0,1,28 December 2007
Spartacus," Good for a Hollywood Film; Ehh for a Kubrick Film
","Far, FAR better than 'Ben-Hur,' which came out the year before, 'Spartacus' still doesn't quite shake some of the same epic movie shackles that made William Wyler's film such a dismal bore. The point of this film is the sets and costumes; the studios denied Kubrick the freedom to direct this movie in his instantly recognizable style, so while it's certainly solidly enough crafted and easy to sit through, it also feels anonymous, which wouldn't be so bad if you didn't know that someone as distinctly NON-anonymous as Kubrick helmed it.Can you imagine how much better 'Spartacus' would have been if Kubrick had been able to direct it in the same style as that other piece of eye candy he created, 'Barry Lyndon?'

Stop-Loss," Another Forgettable Entry in the Iraq War Movie Mill
","Kimberly Peirce becomes one of the latest directors to try and only marginally succeed in making a compelling film about the Iraq conflict.Peirce takes on as her subject the military's stop-loss clause, essentially a back door draft by which the military can use fine print in recruits' contracts to prevent them from getting out once their time is up. Peirce obviously feels strongly about the policy, but what should be a hard-hitting drama feels instead like a rather preachy after-school special. She coaxes a nice performance out of Ryan Phillipe, as the soldier who goes AWOL when his stop-loss clause is activated, but she doesn't fare as well with the rest of the cast. The film suffers from confusing editing, that doesn't always make it clear where characters are or how events are related to one another, and the writing at times is weak as well, with character motivations not coming across as clearly as they should.I don't know what it is about the Iraq conflict that makes it so hard for filmmakers to make good movies about it. Maybe it will have to be over for a while before anyone can begin to approach it with any success.Grade: B-",6,11,15,17 November 2008
United 93," A Tough Watch, But Tremendously Well Done
","In 'United 93,' the fictionalized account of what may have taken place on board the sole hijacked commercial airliner that did not reach its target on September 11, 2001, director Paul Greengrass has given us a clenched muscle of a movie. The film runs on pure adrenaline; it's terse, lean and frank. It also happens to be extremely difficult to watch.Filmed in a bare-bones style, with few recognizable actors and very little significant dialogue, the movie offers an account first of what takes place in several air traffic control centers in different locations as the realization that planes are being flown into buildings around the country settles in, and then it confines itself exclusively to the cabin of the doomed flight itself, after the passengers have learned that they're being used for a suicide mission and fight back against the hijackers. Greengrass resists the urge to sentimentalize the events or make heroes of anyone; the resistance of the passengers is not filmed in dramatic slow motion set to a booming soundtrack. Instead, it looks confused, messy and panicked, the desperate acts of people not suited for their roles. Likewise, the scenes that take place in the air traffic control centers have the atmosphere of authentic immediacy. I was at work the morning of 9/11, and the way I learned about what was going on matched very closely the way the people in this movie learn about the events -- through snippets of overheard conversations, images on the news, and random rumours.Many people have decried this movie as being unnecessary at best and downright dishonest at worst. Some have called it a blatant piece of American propaganda. I don't get that. I admit that while I was watching it, I did wonder if I could justify a film about such a sensitive subject that doesn't really have a point of view and can't even claim to be an accurate recreation of events. But then I watched one of the special features on the DVD, a short film about the relatives of those who died on this flight. Many of the actors met with the families shortly after filming, and Greengrass held a special private screening for the relatives before the studio released the film to the general public. All of the family members felt nothing but solace and a sense of peace after watching the movie. Almost all of them expressed their gratitude to the filmmakers for making the film and telling their loved ones' stories. They seemed unable to understand why others wouldn't want a film like this to be made. One of the rationales used against this movie is that it came out too soon after the date of the tragic events depicted in it. In response to this criticism, one of the family members replies, 'It's not soon enough.' So if the families who are most closely affected by the event don't feel the need to justify the movie's existence, why should anyone else? And as for those who claim that the film is a piece of manufactured propaganda, the Internet culture now allows every Tom, Dick and Harry to publish his or her opinions in cyberspace (my own included) as uncontested fact, but how do any of these bloggers know what took place on that day? They don't. Perhaps no one but the people on board ever will. Greengrass never claimed that his film was a factual recreation, but rather that it's a suggestion of what might have happened based on available evidence. It's easy to sit at a laptop in a coffee shop and claim that the movie is crap based on a bunch of conspiracy theories floating around in the ether, but until anyone has anything better to offer, I'll stick with Greengrass's version of events Only a mere five years after 9/11, it's hard to believe that there was ever a time when Americans were so dismissive of terrorism. As this film shows, 9/11 worked because Americans really had no context for believing something of this magnitude could ever happen. Surprise was the terrorists' greatest ally. So no, I don't think it's too soon to show movies about that terrible day, or to keep thoughts of it constantly with us. The more we're prepared, the less likely it is that something this horrible will happen again.I can't say I was entertained exactly by this movie, though I was never less than completely engrossed in it. But I can certainly say that it is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.Grade: A",9,1,3,15 December 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," I Will Always Watch This Movie As a 7-Year-Old Boy
","There are some movies it's simply impossible to review with a critical eye, and 'E.T.' is one of them. Come on -- I was seven when this movie came out. I belonged an E.T. fan club, for God's sake! Let's just say that Steven Spielberg is in his element when working on movies like this, and it's only when he devotes himself to unadulterated fantasy and adventure that his penchant for over sentimentalization is bearable.I recently saw John Williams conduct music from several of his film scores at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and one of the pieces they performed was a medley set to images from the respective films, 'E.T.' among them. I'm becoming such a sap as I get older that just the theme and some shots of little Drew Barrymore in pigtails almost made me cry.Grade: A+",10,0,1,28 January 2008
It," Sucks the Scares Right Out of the Stephen King Novel
","Horror really is subjective, isn't it?'It' as a novel was terrifying, and if its popularity is any indication, people thought 'It' the movie was pretty scary too. But I found mighty little to even creep me out, let alone outright scare me in this film adaptation. I read the book long ago, so my memory might be a little hazy, but as I recall it, this film is only very liberally based on the novel, and only half of the novel at that (the end credits tell us that there is at least one sequel to come). The lack of fidelity, however, is not what I object to in the film. It's the inability of the screenwriters and director to capture on film anything that's remotely as scary as what King conjures in his book. His novel was one sustained note of creeping dread, while the film is hard sell, throwing jump scares and loud sound effects at us, and nothing in it looks like anything we haven't seen in every trailer for every horror movie made in the last 10 years. The cast of young actors is quite good, and indeed the thing I liked best about the movie was its ability to capture that painful and poignant feeling only adults are able to have about childhood because they're looking back on it as something lost. I think I might have been more interested in a movie about that with this cast and director than the one I got, not necessarily a ringing endorsement for a horror movie.The sequel clearly intends to cover the part of the book when all of the adults come back to Derry to once again confront their childhood ghoul, but I don't think I'll be in line to see it.Grade: C",6,0,2,27 March 2018
Hereditary," Give Toni Collette an Oscar Please
","Toni Collette, one of the best actresses currently in the business, is giving one of the best performances of the year in this high-strung horror movie.She plays the deeply troubled matriarch of a disintegrating family, struggling against a legacy of possibly inherited mental illness as well as her own unresolved feelings about the death of her mother and her maternal inadequacies. Things are already looking fairly bleak for this family when an unimaginable tragedy occurs, hastening the downward spiral of Collette's character. But she finds solace when she's befriended by a woman who's into spiritualism and who teaches Collette how to commune with the dead. That's when the proverbial poop really hits the fan.'Hereditary' belongs to that sub-genre of horror movies currently in vogue and that includes films like 'The Babadook,' 'The Witch,' and 'It Follows,' where the scares can all be accepted at face value or viewed as stand ins for bigger emotions and themes. In 'Hereditary,' the horror that unfolds is as much about grief and the ever-present fear mothers have that they're failing their families in some way as it is about any of the literal things happening on screen. Indeed, as the movie gets closer to its conclusion, and the filmmakers feel more obligated to explain all the mystery, the film gets less scary. No, for me the two scariest moments in the film are monologues delivered by Toni Collette, one to a grief support group in which she elaborates on the history of her family, and the other a confession she makes to a friend about her feelings about her children. Both are bone chilling, and far scarier than the more traditionally scary things that occur later in the film. The unexplored terrain of the human mind will always be more frightening to me than any supernatural oogie boogies.And shout out to Ann Dowd as the spiritualist friend, who's friendly as can be in all of her scenes but nevertheless leaves the impression of having been terrifying. She's hot on your heels, Ruth Gordon.Grade: A-",8,3,7,10 October 2018
Casablanca," It Took Me a While to come Around....
","Ah, 'Casablanca.' Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliché? That's not a criticism of the movie. If anything it's the reverse. What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness? It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release). I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the film-making techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't. At best, 'Casablanca' exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of film-making working at its slickest and most polished.But then on about the fourth viewing, it struck me. The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make, say, 'Citizen Kane' such continual fuel for film discussion. People still love 'Casablanca' for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that 'right place, right time' allure. America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release, and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures. So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord. No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so intensely poignant. And no wonder the patriotic, 'do whatever you must for the good of the cause' propaganda (for let's call it what it is), seemed so stirring (and still does).Is 'Casablanca' a great film? I won't attempt to answer that, though it's not one of my personal favorites. But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.My grade: B+",8,0,4,29 April 2005
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Dazzling Special Effects in Toon Town
","A dazzling mixture of live action and animation is this film's selling point, but it helps that it's anchored by a smart script that tips its hat to the detective noirs of the 1940s and by good performances from both its human actors (Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd) and its voice performers (Kathleen Turner is especially memorable as Jessica Rabbitt, perhaps the sexiest cartoon woman in history).Computer animation has made special effects passÃ©, but at the time of this movie's release, its effects were state of the art, making Disney's previous efforts to blend live action and animation (like 'Mary Poppins') look hopelessly antiquated.You'll have a blast spotting the cartoon celebrity cameos. It's like a Merrie Melodies version of 'Around the World in 80 Days.' Grade: A",8,0,0,28 July 2008
Minority Report," On the Lam Before There's a Lam to Be On
","In 2001, Steven Spielberg bowled me over with his sci-fi story 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence.' In 2002, he took another stab at a sci-fi story for adults, and while not as good as the previous film, it comes close.'Minority Report' is a satisfyingly nasty little piece of work about a world in which law enforcement officials can see crimes before they happen and arrest perpetrators before they've done their foul deeds. Great system, unless you happen to be one of those officials who's pinned with a crime you haven't yet committed and don't realize you have any intention of committing. That's what happens to Tom Cruise, and the movie is about his efforts to evade capture while being chased by Colin Farrell.The special effects are nifty. A highlight of the film is one in which the police send an army of little mechanized spiders into an apartment complex to spy on all of the inhabitants, and we get a birds-eye view of all the things they see. The story raises all sorts of big brother-ish questions about privacy and individual rights, questions that felt especially relevant so soon after 9/11 and Bush's homeland security initiatives.Grade: A-",8,0,1,5 August 2010
Finding Neverland," Johnny Depp Plays a Normal Human Being, For Once
","This gloopy biopic about J.M. Barrie and the events that inspired 'Peter Pan' almost made me angry at how grossly manipulative it was, and all the more angry that it managed to work on me anyway.Johnny Depp plays Barrie in one of the only roles he's played in the last many years that resembles a real living person. Kate Winslet and Freddie Highmore are both terrific as a brother and sister who befriend Barrie, much to the disapproval of a stern and uptight mother (Julie Christie).The film's final scenes, in which Winslet's character dies gracefully while Barrie unleashes a barrage of fantasy to help make her last moments on earth tolerable, are maudlin and unforgivingly sentimental --- and they managed to have me reduced to sobs.Grade: B",7,0,0,3 September 2010
Lifeboat," Hitchcock Light
","This Hitchcock film, made soon after he burst into prominence in America with films like 'Rebecca' and 'Suspicion,' is a lot of fun, but it's ultimately more of a technical experiment than it is a satisfying narrative film, much like 'Rope' would be 4 years later. The suspense here comes more from wondering how Hitchcock is going to sustain interest in a film shot entirely within the confines of a small boat rather than through any dramatic tension. Still, any Hitchcock fan should see it, and Hitch works in his trademark cameo in a particularly clever way.Tallulah Bankhead is sexy and vampy in the lead role. She has the glamour and acerbic wit of a Bette Davis, and it's a shame she didn't do more film.Grade: B",7,5,7,5 July 2005
Training Day," Hawke Is Pretty Good, But He's Fighting a Losing Battle
","A standard issue cop buddy film starts off as a promising character study, but it devolves into a stupid, preposterous action movie.This garbage was only taken seriously because Denzel Washington was in it. Had any number of other black and less respected actors starred, people would have seen it for what it was.Washington gives a nearly terrible performance, chewing the scenery so aggressively it's a wonder he wasn't sued by the art directors. Ethan Hawke fairs much better, but even he's asked to do silly things by the time the movie is over.Both men were nominated for Oscars for their performances, and Washington won Best Actor, mostly because the Academy just wanted to give him a Best Actor award and didn't much care what they gave it to him for.Grade: D",3,2,7,26 July 2010
In Bruges," A Movie That Defies Description (In a Good Way)
","Writer/director Martin McDonagh has fashioned a little gem of a crime thriller/black comedy with his film, 'In Bruges.' It's quirky and eccentric, but in a way that comes naturally and doesn't feel remotely forced. And despite the running joke about Bruges being such a boring and dull place to be, the movie makes the city itself look lovely.Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) play two hit men who hole up in the titular city awaiting orders from their boss, Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes. Both suffer a crisis of conscience -- Ray because his first hit resulted in his accidentally killing a little boy, Ken because his orders once they come are to bump off Ray, who annoys him but who he rather likes. When Ken tells Harry he refuses to kill Ray, Harry comes after the two men himself, resulting in a quite violent finale.McDonagh's background in theatre shows, especially in his writing. The screenplay to 'In Bruges' is a marvel, tightly wound and compact. It's fresh and surprising, traits that don't frequently describe movie scripts nowadays. The movie is viciously funny, but the relationship between Ray and Ken is also rather moving, and the violence (and boy is it graphic at times) is very disturbing precisely because we come to care so much about the characters it's happening to.All of the performances, but especially those of Farrell, Gleeson and Fiennes, are superb. McDonagh proves himself to be a good director of actors, and he handles his own material masterfully. He even manages to make midget humor (the stuff of movie comedy clichés) funny again.Grade: A",9,1,4,9 September 2008
Chinatown," Welcome to Chinatown (You've Been Warned)
","With 'Chinatown,' Roman Polanski did for the detective crime genre what Todd Haynes did for the Douglas Sirk melodrama in 'Far from Heaven.' Polanski created something that was partly an homage to all of those delightfully atmospheric noirs of the 1940s, but went beyond that to deconstruct some of the genre's conventions. Rather than simply making a 1974 film that imitated a film noir from the 40s, Polanski instead made a 1940s film noir infused with the cultural demons of 1974 America.The plot is byzantine and confusing, as any good crime thriller plot should be. But true to the genre, the plot doesn't matter as much as the rotten underbelly of corruption and violence that the plot exposes. No director can do atmosphere (especially rotten atmosphere) as well as Polanski, and he's at his best here. Jack Nicholson gives maybe the best performance of his career as detective Jake Gittes, a hard-boiled seen-it-all tough guy who isn't quite tough enough for the nastiness he uncovers; Faye Dunaway is the elusive and beautiful object of his obsession; and John Huston gives a frightening performance as a monster in everyday clothing. The film is magnificently shot and scored, and manages to evoke the look and style of an older time period without feeling dated.A mesmerizing and fantastic film.Grade: A+",10,2,4,9 July 2007
A Star Is Born," Gaga for Gaga?
","I suppose if you live on the moon or are one of those people who's never seen a movie from a previous decade, 'A Star Is Born' might seem like something special. But for the rest of us, who've had at least three chances to experience this story in the past, the newest version is a pedestrian retread.I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting, except that it was something more than I got given the ravenous audience response to this movie. Everyone is going gaga for Gaga, the Lady that is, and she's pretty good, but I think the praise she's getting is driven more by surprise that she might actually be able to act and less by her actual performance. Cooper is decent too, and they both do have tremendous chemistry, I'll grant them that. The first half hour or so of the film, and especially the scene where Cooper and Gaga perform together for the first time, does promise to be special, and if the whole movie had been like that I could understand the film's reception. But midway through the movie it settles into a dull routine, and the ending, which clearly thought it was going to move me to tears, made me feel nothing at all.In a culture clamoring for more stories about women, and with a female personality as out of the box as lady Gaga to work with, I don't know why this movie decided to be about a white man and his -- let's face it -- not very interesting demons. Ok, so I know why -- Bradley Cooper starred and directed. But how much more interesting the film would have been, and what a greater departure from its previous incarnations, if it had instead been about Gaga's character and her own struggles with stardom. But no -- her working class broad makes the leap to international sensation seemingly without a hitch, and any nuance her character might have had, like some initial worries about losing herself and being true to her art, are quickly ditched by the screenplay so that we can instead focus on Cooper's moping. What we're left with is a dude who's sad because his best years are behind him and a lady who's sad because's he's mean to her in a bathroom once and embarrasses her at the Grammys. Well, let her Grammy be her consolation, and remind me why I'm supposed to care about any of this.Grade: C+",6,2,9,7 November 2018
Gravity," Astonishing, Technically Brilliant and Very Moving
","I saw 'Gravity' on opening weekend, and was so overwhelmed by the visuals that I went a second time on the same weekend to absorb the rest of the film once the novelty of the visuals had worn off. I wish I had posted my comments then, because now that it's become a phenomenon, my review is just so much white noise, and to those who are determined to hate 'Gravity' because it's so popular, I'll be easy to dismiss as just one more lemming.But I did love 'Gravity.' I thought it was an absolutely beautiful movie, a story about loss, grief and rekindled hope disguised as a simple space survival story. It affected me very deeply and moved me to tears a few times, sometimes through the strength of its message, sometimes through the wonderful performance of Sandra Bullock, and at other times from the sheer visual beauty of the film. I can understand why others wouldn't be moved by the film (one of the things I love most about cinema is the subjective reactions audiences have to it), but I can't believe that anyone who purports to love movies won't at least acknowledge the sheer technical filmmaking mastery on display in this movie.Alfonso Cuaron has vaulted to the top of my list of favorite directors on the strength of this and 'Children of Men,' another of his films that slugged me with an emotional punch to the gut. He's the rare director who can make us marvel at the technical achievements he's putting up on the screen even while he's touching us deeply with an emotional connection. In that way, he's a much less maudlin and sentimental version of Steven Spielberg.I'm almost disappointed that 'Gravity' has become so popular, because it's the kind of movie I responded very personally to, and now it's going to be nominated for a bunch of Oscars and all we'll hear about between now and February of 2014 is how it doesn't deserve all of its acclaim.Grade: A+",10,9,14,29 October 2013
To Be or Not to Be," Strange But Delightful
","It's hard to recognize how utterly daring this film probably was at the time of its release. Charles Chaplin was put on a death list by Hitler for lampooning him in 'The Great Dictator' in 1940, and while Ernst Lubitsch's film isn't quite as scathing as Chaplin's, I still have to think that so openly mocking the Gestapo while the war was still raging took a lot of guts for everyone involved.This isn't necessarily a laugh out loud comedy; there are no really big laughs to be had. But it's never once less than delightful to watch, and all of the performances are terrific. Of course, the most praise must go to Jack Benny, who seems so utterly comfortable on screen, but Carole Lombard is as sexy and engaging as ever, even if she has quite a bit less to do.Very funny, very entertaining, and probably a must see from the period of war-time cinema.Grade: A",8,5,14,6 September 2005
Wind River," Enough with the Vigilante Movies
","Last year Taylor Sheridan wrote the screenplay to 'Hell or High Water,' a rural thriller that asked us to feel pity for the poor and working class folks wasting away in America's dying towns. I might have felt the pity Sheridan asked me to, had the film not been full of a bunch of hot-headed white men with guns and itchy trigger fingers, who take justice into their own hands with a macho Texan swagger that Sheridan was all too clearly proud of without a hint of irony (not to mention compunction about the current state of gun violence in America).This year, he's both written and directed 'Wind River,' another gloomy rural thriller, this one set in Wyoming. Yet again, we're given a white male who goes vigilante in order to seek vengeance on a bunch of horror show redneck goons. He has to, you see, because the only people helping him are a couple of inept Native American police officers and a white female FBI agent who's thoroughly incompetent because she's from -- GASP!! -- the city. In Sheridan's world, apparently, people who live in cities are pampered and worthless and don't know how to do pretty much anything, and it's only the tough country folk who know how to get the job done. You could cut the condescension with a knife.I don't expect artists necessarily to compromise their visions in order to contribute productively to a given cultural conversation, but it would be nice if they at least engaged in it. In our current cultural climate, with the very serious division between urban and rural populations of America that has experts talking somewhat seriously about the possibility of a new kind of civil war, a movie like 'Wind River' feels not only facile, but also rather irresponsible. With the rampant stereotypes being thrown every which way about various populations of America, and the gun problem, and the rise of militia groups with vigilante attitudes, do we really need a movie like this?Oh, and at the very end, Sheridan throws in some facts about the prevalence of Native American women who end up as missing persons, and tries to turn what has been a white boy's revenge fantasy into a public service message. Nice try.Grade: C",5,1,4,19 December 2017
Erin Brockovich," One Big Heap of Fake, But an Awfully Entertaining One
","What's up with Steven Soderbergh? How can the same director make an intelligent and complex, and decidedly non-mainstream film, like 'Traffic' and this high-gloss, populist version of 'Norma Rae' in the same year? He makes 'Sex, Lies & Videotape,' then he makes 'Ocean's Twelve,' and then he turns around and makes 'Bubble.' I don't get it. Is he attempting to stretch his versatility as a director, or is he just wildly inconsistent? 'Erin Brockovich' is outrageously ridiculous, and doesn't maintain even the barest grip on reality. It exists solely as an opportunity for Julia Roberts' devoted fans to see her tear up the screen and give anyone standing within 20 feet of her on screen a what-for, but it doesn't really ask her to act. Roberts is further indication that someone's star power is in inverse proportion to his/her talent (see Halle Berry, Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston). Roberts would be nothing as an actress (as evidenced by her recent panned Broadway debut) without the fakery of cinema. She needs good lighting, clever editing, expert hair dressers to tame that lion's mane of her's. She's at her best when a director clears everyone else out of her way and lets the camera linger on her in close-up, which is what Soderbergh does here. Compare her's to the feisty performance delivered by Sally Field in 'Norma Rae' to see just how unconvincing Roberts is.But, and this is a big 'but,' all of that aside, 'Erin Brockovich' is enormously entertaining, as these liberal fight-against-the-system movies always are. The film is helped tremendously by Albert Finney, who matches Roberts every step of the way and has a boatload of chemistry with the leading lady. If it weren't for his presence, the Julia Roberts love-fest would become overbearing.Grade: B+",7,0,2,2 June 2006

I might have liked this movie more if it wasn't in love with its own grunge aesthetic -- as it is, it's the kind of film to give fanboys wet dreams, but leaves others wondering what the fuss is about. David Fincher would revisit the serial killer genre again with about 1,000 times more success 13 years later with 'Zodiac.' Also starring Gwyneth Paltrow in an early role, and Kevin Spacey, intolerably snarky as usual as the killer.Grade: B-",6,2,5,12 May 2009
I'm Not There," Bob Dylan Film Is a Ship Without a Sail
","I felt about 'I'm Not There,' Todd Haynes' tribute to the spirit of Bob Dylan, much about the way I feel about Bob Dylan himself. I like the IDEA of Dylan more than I enjoy sitting down and actually listening to him, and that's how this movie was for me.'I'm Not There' is not a biography of Bob Dylan, and for that I'm grateful. The last thing the world needs is another film like 'Ray' or 'Walk the Line,' bland paint-by-numbers biopics. Rather, Haynes' film is more of a tribute to the many feelings Dylan songs can inspire, and the various personas Dylan the artist took on in the eyes of the public. Therefore, we get six actors playing different Dylanesque characters, or the kind of people Dylan might have written songs about, or characters meant simply to represent a distinct time and place in America. The first we meet is a young black boy named Woody Guthrie and played by Marcus Carl Franklin, who rides the rails with guitar in tow and sings songs that sound like they should be coming from someone much older. Ben Whishaw plays a poet named Arthur Rimbaud who appears to be testifying or defending himself in court for reasons we never learn. Christian Bale is Jack Rollins, an icon of the folk music craze who becomes a born-again Christian in later life; Heath Ledger is an actor who made a name for himself playing Rollins on screen and whose personal life is slowly disintegrating. Richard Gere is Billy the Kid, hiding out in the old West. And in the film's most memorable performance, Cate Blanchett plays Jude, the character most modeled on Dylan himself, who struggles with success and fame in the face of a public growing increasingly frustrated with him for not playing the part they expect.'I'm Not There' is full of ideas about art and artists, and I applaud Haynes for attempting to bring something fresh and original to the screen. But I never once connected with the film on any level. The movie never stops experimenting, so it doesn't give you much to get involved with. Everything is representative and symbolic, so none of the characters feel like living breathing people. It's far too long -- I especially felt my patience beginning to snap by the time Gere made his appearance late in the film. The movie feels like it's comprised of a hundred different strands of thought that never cohere. In some ways, this is fitting, since the film is in large part about the enigmatic nature of artists, and the general public's indifference to who an artist really is in the face of who it wants him to be. But even a film about an enigma needs something to anchor it.Grade: B",7,4,10,25 November 2007
Unbreakable," The Shyamalan Trademark Already Wearing Thin
","Everyone wanted to love wunderkind M. Night Shyamalan's follow up to his break out hit 'The Sixth Sense,' but in only his second feature, the trappings that have since gone on to utterly ruin his films and his reputation were already beginning to wear thin.Those trappings include lugubrious pacing; gray, dour production design; a tone almost silly in its degree of solemnity; and a 'twist' ending that feels forced and anticlimactic.I've caught 'Unbreakable' on T.V. once or twice since seeing it in theatres back in 2000, and while it's not a terrible movie, it's a perfect one to have in the background if you want to take a nap.Grade: B-",6,1,1,23 July 2010
As Good as It Gets," About as Good as James L. Brooks Gets, Which Isn't Bad
","Another sitcom-style comedy for adults from James L. Brooks.Like all of Brooks' films, this one is well acted and written and it's always entertaining, but it's also unchallenging and cinematically uninteresting, and always feels slightly sanitized, even when it's dealing with rough topics.Jack Nicholson plays yet another version of crazy in the kind of role that his later career has been full of. Helen Hunt was hot at the moment because of 'Mad About You,' and while it's inconceivable all these years later that she actually won an Oscar for this film, her experience in sitcom acting suits Brooks and his material well (though there's quite an ick factor in seeing her paired with someone so much older and lecherous).

Citizen Kane," A Reputation Deserved
","There's not much to say about 'Citizen Kane' that hasn't already been said. I know there are people who don't understand why this film is considered to be one of the most brilliantly made films ever produced, but I propose the reason for that is this: the film and narrative techniques on display in 'Kane' have become so integral to every film made since that they no longer seem special in Orson Welles' film when looked at from a 21st Century perspective. I encourage anyone still in doubt of this film's greatness to instead look at it from an historical perspective; just compare it to any other movie that also came out in 1941 and I think 'Kane''s uniqueness will be apparent. I don't think the film is without flaws. Welles' pacing can be slow at times, and I think the last quarter of the movie especially drags. The story itself isn't particularly interesting or even novel for its time, but one doesn't (or shouldn't) watch 'Kane' for the originality of the story. Instead, pay attention to how the story is told and who's telling it. When the film is over, ask yourself this: can you say you've been given an objective account of Kane's story? Do you really know what happened to him? This is radical stuff for 1941. Can you imagine a movie being released at that time that didn't answer the questions it raised? The motivation that puts the entire world of the film in motion remains unresolved. That doesn't happen very often in films even now, let alone then.And if none of this is reason enough to watch 'Citizen Kane,' just watch it for the stunning cinematography and compositions. Virtually every frame is a work of art in itself.And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, then just watch it for Orson Welles' mesmerizing performance in the title role. Easily one of the ten best in cinema history.And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, you're on your own.Grade: A+",10,10,16,29 April 2005
Darkest Hour," Energetic Historical Drama
","I put off seeing 'Darkest Hour' forever, and pretty much assumed I would only watch it, if I ever did, when it hit Blu-Ray a few months from now after awards hoopla had died down. I figured Joe Wright + historical English biopic + awards bait performance = snoozer. But then the film was nominated for a buttload of BAFTAs, I started to get the feeling that it would be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar (which it was), and the Oscar completist in me finally convinced me to see the damn thing.So the fact that I thought it was pretty darn good can partially be chalked up to very low expectations. But I also think this film resonated with me, and appears to be doing so with many others if box office receipts and awards attention are any indication, because I needed a movie like this right now in our dark times. I need to believe that there are leaders out there who have the best interest of the people in mind. I need to believe in a time of national pride (even if not American pride) and the ability of a country full of citizens to ban together for a cause that is much bigger than any one individual. Is the film historically accurate? Oh, probably not. Even if the facts are generally right (and I don't know whether or not they are), I imagine much has been embellished for dramatic purposes, and I know that one scene, in which Winston Churchill rides the underground and polls a group of everyday Londoners on their thoughts about fighting off Nazi Germany or giving into peace talks, was outright fabricated. But I don't care. That stupid manipulative scene worked on me even as I knew I shouldn't let it.As for the movie itself, it's slick and extremely well made, clicking along and maintaining a blistering energy. It looks glossy as a magazine, and Gary Oldman, who will most certainly win an Oscar, leaves not a bit of the pretty scenery unchewed. But he does deliver one of the better biopic performances in recent memory, because he chooses to create an actual character rather than a blustery impersonation. And in a happy accident, 'Darkest Hour' happens to be a perfect companion piece to another Best Picture nominee from this year, 'Dunkirk,' as the battle at the center of the latter film plays a major role in the plot of the former.Grade: A-",7,0,3,1 February 2018
Monster," Absolutely Extraordinary and Stunning Performance from Charlize Theron
","Charlize Theron gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in this harrowing story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who went on a killing spree and was sentenced to death for her crimes.Don't let anyone tell you that Theron's performance was only acclaimed because she allowed herself to get 'ugly' for it. The same was said of Nicole Kidman's performance in 'The Hours' from the year before. Yet when a male actor (like Robert De Niro in 'Raging Bull') undergoes a physical transformation for a performance, he's congratulated for his commitment to his role.Theron's performance is riveting and devastating, and it would have been so even without the makeup. She creates a deeply complex and fascinating character, a woman we revile even as we sympathize with her. And Christina Ricci, who got almost no attention for her performance as Wuornos' young and impressionable lover, meets Theron scene for scene.One of the most deserved Oscar wins in history.Grade: A+",10,0,2,30 August 2010
The Birth of a Nation," Yikes!
","A must see for any student of film studies, but not easy to sit through. It's long, it's antique, and by today's standards it's reprehensible in its portrayal of the KKK and blacks. But it's also the movie that virtually invented the entire vocabulary of film language. Not before Griffith's film were all the separate elements of film-making brought together to create such a cohesive whole. And the last quarter or so of the film is admittedly exciting, and Griffith shows he knows how to use editing in ways that no one before him did. So the movie is interesting from a film history standpoint, but otherwise you've been warned.Grade: A (for its importance to film history) but C (for its watchability)",6,2,5,17 November 2005
Memento," One of the Best Gimmick Movies Ever Made
","Crackerjack thriller from fanboy phenom Christopher Nolan before he had directed 'The Dark Knight' and 'Inception' and anyone knew who he was.The film's gimmick is of course what gives it its cult appeal. Guy Pearce plays a man with short-term memory loss who's trying to reconstruct the crime that resulted in the death of his wife. He has to write down anything he wants to remember within moments of its happening; he even resorts to tattoing important information on to his body so he will be able to recall it later. We only learn pieces of the story as he learns them, beginning at the end and working our way backwards. It's a gimmick that's pulled off tremendously well by the direction and writing, but no one should praise the film's concept at the sake of its immensely talented cast, led by an award-worthy Guy Pearce. He's given terrific support by Carrie-Ann Moss (of 'The Matrix') in a femme fatale role and Joe Pantoliano, playing the film's bad guy.I saw this film in Denmark. Can't even begin to think what a non-native English speaking person would make of this one.Grade: A+",10,0,2,26 July 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantino Is One Glourious Basterd
","'Inglourious Basterds' ain't your grandfather's WWII picture. And Quentin Tarantino would most definitely take that as a compliment.Tarantino has made a career out of making art out of trash, and he does so again with his latest combustible and outrageously entertaining movie. He throws a bunch of B-movie tropes, some anachronistic music and his own version of historical events into a blender to make a WWII movie for a new generation.Tarantino gives us several narrative threads to follow, and then, in a wink to his love of movies and to the delight of us cinephiles, has them converge in a Parisian movie theater during the debut of an epic Nazi propaganda film, where two separate groups have planned a mass assassination of the Third Reich's major leaders (yes, Hitler included).One of these groups is the owner of the cinema, a Jew in hiding named Shosanna (Melanie Laurent), and her lover, who plan to use heaps of nitrate film stock to burn the theater down as payback for the murder of her family by the Nazis. The other group consists of the basterds of the film's title, a dirty dozen style tribe of Nazi haters who scalp most of the Nazis they come across and whose leader is a redneck American called the Apache and played by Brad Pitt. Bridging these two narrative threads is the character of Hans Landa, played ferociously by Christoph Waltz in an Award-worthy performance, a detective working for the Reich who was responsible for the murder of Shosanna's family and wants nothing more than to wipe out the basterds.As usual, Tarantino's love of movies is apparent in every frame, but I think 'Inglourious Basterds,' to the extent that it's about anything, is about not just the adoration of an art form but also respect for its power. The use of film as propaganda is a recurring motif throughout the movie, and the climax is nothing but one sustained image of the film's power made literal.People who want to dislike this movie will have no problem doing so, as Tarantino certainly does not make movies that set out to please the masses. Groups will undoubtedly bristle at the disrespect with which Tarantino treats history, and I suppose they're entitled to do so, but I also think they'll be missing the point. Tarantino isn't out to make a historical document; he's out to make a movie and he asks us to have fun with it. I for one found it easy to oblige.Grade: A",9,2,12,11 September 2009
Amistad," Spielberg at His Bottom of the Barrel Worst
","Absolutely horrendous film from Steven Spielberg, perhaps his worst ever.Spielberg was in white guilt mode when he made this, yes, the same mode that brought us his zip-a-dee-doo-dah version of 'The Color Purple,' though that film looks like 'Lawrence of Arabia' compared to this.Spielberg works so hard to make his whites look like caricature buffoons and his blacks like righteous nobles that he ends up treating his audience like a bunch of morons who aren't able to draw any conclusions for themselves. Anthony Hopkins hams it up to the high heavens as John Quincy Adams while Matthew M. (I don't feel like looking up the correct spelling of his name) looks dazed and lost underneath his period wig. Newcomer Djimon Hounsou plays a mutinous slave who proved to movie audiences how loud he could yell, and that's been the predominant quality in every performance he's given since.This one is woeful; I challenge you to make it through.Grade: F",1,29,57,17 July 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A New Hope for the Alliance
","'Rogue One' relates the events leading up to the beginning of 'A New Hope,' explaining how the Rebel Alliance got its hands on the plans for the Death Star. In tone, it's far more somber than any of its predecessors. The characters are all beleaguered revolutionaries, and the predominant mood of the film is gritty resolve. By definition, this means that this entry is lacking the sense of whimsy and adventure that defined the original trilogy, and its biggest flaw for me was the absence of compelling and colorful characters.But on its own terms this is a worthy entry in the 'Star Wars' canon, and I think I liked it more than 'The Force Awakens.' While that film certainly had fun and adventure to spare, it was thinly written; in contrast, 'Rogue One' has a much richer and more sophisticated screenplay. The last quarter of the movie is incredibly exciting, taking the story right up to where 'A New Hope' starts, and I dare any true 'Star Wars' fan not to mist up at the very last scene.I had a lot of trouble getting past the absence of the iconic 'Star Wars' themes (John Williams did not do the music for this one). Brief strains of them occur here and there throughout the movie, and the main theme plays during the end credits, so I'm not sure why the original music couldn't have been incorporated more robustly into the entire film.Grade: A",8,3,13,29 December 2016
Coraline," If David Lynch Made Animated Films, They Would Be Like This
","I adore Henry Selick's 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and its ghoulish sense of humor, so I was prepared for more of the same in 'Coraline.' But what I didn't expect was that this film would be so delightfully disturbing and so utterly sophisticated. For anyone who wants an antidote to the typical Disney-fied children's fare available to you (and even the Pixar films aren't excluded from that description), 'Coraline' is for you.'Coraline' is like a David Lynch film for kids. Like Lynch films, it seems to exist in a universe of its own, where an entirely different set of logic applies. The imagery in the film can be quite frightening at times, but it's also quite beautiful in its own way. And the film's ultimate message -- that kids need to accept the imperfections of their parents and stop moping about an adult world they don't entirely understand -- is a very grown up one.A marvelous animated film.Grade: A",8,0,2,25 August 2009
Shakespeare in Love," Wherefore Art Thou a Best Picture Winner?
","An energetic and sprightly romance about Shakespeare and his muse.This film is more known as the film that beat (and most people feel wrongly so) 'Saving Private Ryan' for the Best Picture Oscar in 1998 than for any of its own merits. But I can see why it won. I don't think it's a great movie, but I didn't think 'Private Ryan' was either, and 'Shakespeare' certainly has more sheer storytelling chutzpah than Spielberg's film. 'Private Ryan' is the kind of movie fanboys and techo-geeks would salivate over, but 'Shakespeare' is the kind of movie storytellers would fall in love with.For what it's worth, the criminally overlooked 'The Thin Red Line' from the same year blows both of the other movies, and pretty much every other movie released that year, out of the water.Grade: B+",7,1,4,21 June 2010
This Is the End," The Pits of Hell -- or Just Another Weekend in Hollywood
","Whether or not you think 'This Is the End' is funny will depend almost completely on whether or not you think Seth Rogen and the scruffy, schlubby circle of actors he's become associated with are funny. Because this movie exists as nothing more than an excuse for these guys to roast each other, playing exaggerated versions of themselves in a movie about the end of the world -- or at least the end of L.A.I was afraid the film would feel like an inside joke that I was not in on and that it would be two hours of watching a bunch of guys who think they're cuter than we do -- kind of like a Youtube video with better production values. But that's not the case -- these guys really are pretty funny, and there's enough of an actual story to make the film more than a random assortment of one-liners.Of all of them I like Seth Rogen and Jay Baruchel the most, and they both mostly play straight man to the others. Michael Cera is hilarious in what amounts to a prolonged cameo, and Emma Watson gets a laugh as a homicidal, axe-wielding Hermione.Grade: B+",7,0,4,4 December 2013
Zootopia," Perfectly Fine But Uninspired
","A cute animated film with a great and relevant message about the harm inherent in profiling others based on pre-conceived and ill-informed beliefs. It doesn't have the visual dazzle, narrative tightness, and emotional wallop of some of the best animated films I've seen ('Wall-E,' 'Toy Story 3'), but I mostly enjoyed its more modest charms. My kids (5 and 7) liked it, but it didn't wow them, and they seemed to forget it pretty quickly after leaving the movie theater, as did I.The funniest part of the film is the segment set in a DMV run by sloths, but since this scene in its entirety was shown in trailers for the movie a year ago, its effect was dampened by having already seen it. Nothing else in the movie rises to the same comedic heights as that moment.Grade: B",7,7,18,11 April 2016

","A visually stunning and mind-bending sci-fi movie from Terry Gilliam (of Monty Python fame).Bruce Willis is a convict sent back in time to uncover more information about a lethal virus that will eventually wipe out mankind. The film has an 'into-the-funhouse' feel about it -- it's worth watching for the production design alone. It also happens to feel especially relevant right now, in a world that's obsessed with fears of diseases and epidemics (swine flu, anyone?) The cast also includes Madeleine Stowe as a love interest for Willis, and Brad Pitt, Academy Award nominated as a loony.Grade: A",9,0,1,12 May 2009
Mississippi Burning," Exposing America's Ugly Underbelly
","Oof, finally got around to viewing this Oscar-nominated Best Picture from 1988 and what a tough watch. This sweaty tale of the FBI taking on the Ku Klux Klan in Civil Rights-era Mississippi has taken on renewed relevance in today's world, given the ugly, hateful faction of Americans who our current President has encouraged to crawl out from beneath their slimy rocks. This is no liberal feel-good version of the fight against racism and bigotry, in which a call for mutual understanding wins the day. No, in this film, the only way to beat ugliness is to be yet uglier. There was a time when this movie would have left a bad taste in my mouth, but in the light of recent current events, I received a tremendous amount of cathartic satisfaction in watching Gene Hackman beat up a bunch of worthless white trash. Oh if it were only that easy.Cinematographer Peter Biziou won an Oscar for his work on this film, which was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director (Alan Parker), Best Actor (Hackman), Best Supporting Actress (Frances McDormand), Best Film Editing, and Best Sound.Grade: A",8,1,3,29 June 2017
Au Revoir les Enfants," Spare and Sensitive
","'Au revoir les enfants' is Louis Malle's spare, sensitive exploration of two youths -- one Jewish, the other not -- and their tentative friendship at a religious boys' school during the days of WWII. This is not a movie about big emotional scenes. Malle takes an almost journalistic approach, not ever using music or directorial flourishes to tell us how we should be feeling, but rather letting the fine performances and powerful subject matter speak for themselves. The boys never become necessarily close friends, but they do form a bond forged by loneliness and a mutual respect, which evolves into genuine concern as the one gradually awakens to the very real danger the other faces for being Jewish.I believe this film is largely autobiographical, and you can tell it is even if you didn't know that going in. It just has that personal touch that autobiographical films have, something you can't necessarily define but which you recognize when you see it. It put me in mind a little bit of Fellini's 'Amarcord,' though that film mixed in much more humor with its tragedy.'Au revoir les enfants' received two Academy Award nominations in 1987, one for Best Foreign Language Film and one for Best Original Screenplay. I believe it was a bit of a shocker when it lost the foreign film award to 'Babette's Feast,' as it had been perceived to be the frontrunner.Grade: A",8,0,0,22 April 2020
The Impossible," A Family Swept Away and Apart
","Naomi Watts, an actress who I adore, is responsible for getting my butt in the seat for this fictionalized drama about a vacationing family who get swept away by the Asian tsunami of 2004.The real family upon which this film is based was not British, as they are in this film, but rather Spanish, Mexican or Portugese, I forget which. The movie has as a result taken on criticism for its 'anglicanization' of a tragedy that affected more Asians than anyone else, but here becomes something that befalls privileged Western Europeans on holiday. No matter -- I think the filmmakers' hearts were in the right place, and that the family in the film are representative of everyone who was affected. After all, as characters, they're flat as cardboard cutouts, so it's easy for them to be stand-ins for anyone.The film isn't nearly as grueling and gripping as I thought it would be. We don't know these people at all, and the movie takes very little time to introduce them to us, so that when bad things do happen to them, I felt the abstract sympathy I would feel for anyone in the same situation, but no real investment in their story or its outcome. The kids aren't very good actors, so it's hard to really believe the emotions they're asked to convey. Watts gives a physically brutal performance, but isn't asked to develop much of a character, and spends most of the film's running time lying prone on a hospital bed. Ewan McGregor plays the dad, and his character makes so many bone-headed decisions that only through sheer luck don't make a bad situation even worse, that I spent more time being annoyed with him than I did caring about his plight.The visual effects are fairly impressive, and feel much more like the old school effects of yesteryear than the anonymous CGI effects of today.Grade: B",6,1,4,8 July 2013
Shaun of the Dead," They're Coming to Get You, Barbara
","I saw 'Hot Fuzz,' the other film from the same film-making team of Edgar Wright and the actor Simon Pegg, before I saw 'Shaun of the Dead' and thought overall it was a stronger movie, but 'Shaun' has much to recommend it in its own right.Where 'Hot Fuzz' parodies action buddy movies, 'Shaun of the Dead' takes as its target movies like George Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' series and its countless imitators. There's a lot of cheeky humour and grisly gore played for laughs, and the whole thing is thoroughly entertaining without ever quite feeling like a comedy classic.Grade: A-",7,0,1,14 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," YO, HO, HO and a Mixed Bag of Fun
","Midway through the third installment of Walt Disney's deliriously popular pirate franchise, a character says of Capt. Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), 'Is he making this up as he goes along?' Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series.I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, 'The Curse of the Black Pearl,' but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because 'Pirates' is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel.That sequel, 'Dead Man's Chest,' takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. 'Dead Man's Chest' makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about.So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, 'At World's End,' gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The 'Pirates' movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival 'Star Wars' for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass?The 'Pirates' trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America.

Argo," For a Movie Buff, What Is There Not to Like About This Film?
","This has been the year for terrific and terrifically suspenseful films built out of stories we already know the endings to.First, Steven Spielberg made the ratification of the amendment abolishing slavery nearly 150 years ago actually sort of exciting in 'Lincoln.' Now Ben Affleck has made a palm-sweat-inducing thriller out of the story of six hostages who were rescued out of Iran during the 1980 hostage crisis.That they were rescued through a ruse involving the fake production of a 'Star Wars' rip-off allegedly being filmed in the Iranian desert is like icing on the birthday cake for this reviewer and huge movie buff. This is the kind of story that has to be true because it's too wild for anyone to invent. Clearly, giving the reception of the film in the movie industry, it's irresistible to the film community as well. I won't be at all surprised if, lack of director nomination aside, 'Argo' is announced Best Picture when the final envelope of the evening is opened at the upcoming Academy Awards.Affleck himself stars in the movie, but it's the supporting cast, led by Alan Arkin, John Goodman and Bryan Cranston, who you'll most likely remember.And am I the only person who wishes the film 'Argo' (which is the name of the movie ostensibly being made by Affleck's fake movie crew) had actually been made?

12 Angry Men," The All-Time Great Liberal Agenda Movie
","I defy anyone to watch this movie and not be completely absorbed in the group dynamics on display. I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from 'The Grapes of Wrath.' E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.An important film and a great one.

Beauty and the Beast," Life Before and After 'Beauty and the Beast'
","To date, my favorite animated Disney film.In 1938, Walt Disney received a special Academy Award for producing 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and bringing a new standard to motion picture cartoons. Then in 1941, the Academy gave 'Fantasia' a couple of special awards as another watermark animated film. 'Beauty and the Beast' deserves to stand along side both of those films as one that changed animated films forever. For me, there are animated films before 'Beauty' and after. Not since Disney's very first animated films ('Snow White,' 'Pinnochio') had one blended music and story so masterfully. But what sets 'Beauty' apart from others is, strangely enough, the acting. The voice work is so perfectly matched with the way the characters are drawn that it's almost possible to forget you're watching two-dimensional creations.An enchanting film.Grade: A+",10,4,5,18 November 2008
The English Patient," The BIG Movie of 1996 Seems a Lot Smaller in 2009
","The movie that blew everyone away in 1996, and a rare 'arthouse' film that managed to cross over into the mainstream.I admit that I was swept up in the 'English Patient' craze along with everyone else. But I have seen parts of it more recently and have to say that it doesn't hold up well. What seemed passionate and sincere at the time seems overwrought and silly now. The love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas is the stuff of romantic melodrama, pure soap opera, but the historical backdrop of WWII makes it feel more important than it really is. On later viewings, I just wanted to tell these two overly-dramatic lovers to lighten up.The best thing about the film now is the thing that was best about it when it originally appeared, and that's Juliette Binoche, playing a weary and emotionally haunted nurse who gradually learns how to live and love again. Her performance is luminous and lovely, and I would much rather watch a movie just about her.Grade: B",7,1,6,16 June 2009
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Finally Makes It to the Screen, and Guess What? It's Pretty Darn Good!
","Oh, expectations where high, as I rabidly loved this series of books when I was a kid. How relieved I was, therefore, when I discovered that they made a pretty good movie from C.S. Lewis's debut Narnia novel.At first I was worried. A clunky and unnecessary prologue depicting the London blitz and the children's journey to their uncle's home in the country didn't help, and the children themselves seemed pretty bland. But the director and screenwriter were wise enough to keep things clipping along, and it's not long before Lucy has ventured into the wardrobe for the first time. Her first scene with the faun Mr. Tumnus set the tone, and from that moment on, I felt Lewis's story was in good hands.Little Georgie Henley is a fine little actress; I thought at first her Lucy was going to be too sweet and syrupy, a la many a child actor. But instead she was spunky, just as one would expect based on the way she's written in the book. The actor who plays Edmund is good too; he and Lucy are the most vivid of the children. Susan and Peter are a bit more bland, but that's o.k.; they're bland in the book too, and it's no surprise that their characters only make it through the first two novels before being written out entirely.Tilda Swinton gives a magnificent performance as the White Witch. There were many times when she had to have been reacting to little more than a blue screen, but she's never less than superb. Liam Neeson voices Aslan nicely, and the lion itself is one of the best special effects I've seen all year.Narnia looks just the way I imagined it when I read the books. The film makers feel no need to tinker with what is already a perfect story, and the only additions they make (like the action set piece on the frozen river) are minor and take nothing away. I liked the tone of the film as well. This was not a Disneyfied version of the story. The books, though written for kids, were dark and intense. The moral conflicts felt real, and there was always the feeling that the children were being forced to grow up too fast, to deal with adult realities before they had developed the adult emotions to go with them. An apt story for a WWII audience, and the movie wisely keeps the tone. The killing of Aslan, in particular, is quite scary and disturbing.The climactic battle scene is spectacular. It obviously owes something to Peter Jackson's recent 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, but it doesn't steal from those movies. Indeed, given the fact that those movies are so fresh in everyone's minds and so ready for comparison, it's very high praise to say that 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' holds its own against Jackson's films.Die hard fans of the books should not be disappointed, and those who haven't read them just may be able to tell why they're so loved by seeing this film.Grade: A",9,1,2,18 December 2005
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Why Should We Bother to Be Adults When We Have Kids to Do It for Us?
","'Crazy Stupid Love' is about 20 minutes of a terrific little romantic comedy starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone surrounded by another 100 minutes of borderline dreadful romantic comedy starring everybody else. Gosling and Stone just ooze charm and screen presence, and their chemistry together is so natural and infectious that I simply could not tolerate any part of the movie that shifted away from them to deal with Steve Carrell and Julianne Moore, two actors I usually like but who are stuck in a cliché, middle-aged-couple-in-midlife-crisis storyline. Add this film to the alarmingly growing list of Hollywood films in which adults have forgotten how to be adults and only remember how to be from watching and listening to their kids.'Crazy Stupid Love' is tolerable up to a point, but by the end it's simply too long and too stupid to leave any impression other than that it was a big fat dud.Grade: C",4,2,5,8 December 2011
Public Enemies," Hugely Boring
","I haven't liked all of Michael Mann's movies, but when I don't, it's usually because they're a hot mess ('Miami Vice' comes to mind) rather than because they're boring. Until now.'Public Enemies' has no real conceivable reason for existing. It tells the story of John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) but feels like a warmed-over and irrelevant rehash of every gangster movie that's come before it. It suffers from a serious case of identity crisis. It doesn't know whether it wants to be a character study of Dillinger, a love story about the girl he brings with him on the lam (Marion Cotillard) or about the specifics of the investigation leading to his eventual murder outside of a Chicago movie theatre. It ends up not really being about any of these things and gives its actors, all good ones, nothing to do. It's a giant bore of a film, and a long one at that.Much of the film reminded me of 'Bonnie and Clyde,' and made me wish I was watching that pretty much perfect movie instead of this one.Grade: C",4,1,1,23 February 2010
The Babadook," A Movie About the Greatest Horror of All
","If you can get over your initial disappointment that 'The Babadook' is not the scarefest it was built up to be, you might just find yourself enjoying a well-made and even groundbreaking -- in its own modest way -- psychological thriller.And don't get me wrong: 'The Babadook' is scary, it's just not scary in the visceral horror movie kind of way. It's scary because it's about mental illness, and anyone who's dealt with illnesses of the mind in real life knows that they are far more horrifying than any monsters or serial killers horror movies can conjure. It's impossible to watch 'The Babadook' and not experience it as a kind of gender-reversed version of 'The Shining.' But it has enough originality to stand on its own apart from Kubrick's classic. And it's that gender reversal that makes 'The Babadook' so horrifying and so unlike any other horror movie I can think of. How often are mothers the monsters, and how much scarier does it get from a child's point of view than to find your chief enemy being the one person who you take for granted will protect you at all costs.Indeed, 'The Babadook' is almost too effective at times. I'm particularly bothered by films about children in peril, and especially films that dwell on the fear of a child. 'The Babadook' is tough to watch at times for this reason, and it came close to crossing the border that separates for me a film that's disturbing in an enjoyable way and one that's not. I loved the ending of this film, and the suggestion that an emotion like grief is not something to be eradicated but rather something that needs to be attended to and nurtured for the rest of a person's life. You can keep it at bay and not let it dominate you, but the only way to do that is to acknowledge that it's there every once in a while.Grade: A-",8,3,7,19 April 2015
The Other Boleyn Girl," Where Were My Heaving Bosoms?
","I was expecting heaving bosoms and bodice rippings galore from this costume drama, but sadly, the filmmakers and actors decide to take this piece of 'historical' fiction seriously, and so 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not nearly as fun as it could have been.Either Natalie Portman, as Anne, or Scarlett Johansson, as Mary, is the 'other' girl of the title, depending on your point of view. Both are paraded before King Henry VIII (Eric Bana -- yeah right!) in an attempt to make one or the other his mistress and so establish the Boleyn family firmly in the king's favor. It's a vaguely feminist story -- the girls' uncle and father pull the strings, while their mother (Kristen Scott Thomas, underused) stands in the background looking disapproving. But first and foremost, the film is a gussied up bit of Masterpiece Theatre starring beautiful Hollywood actors.The film is entertaining, but never fully engaging. For me, this was largely due to the casting. Natalie Portman is directed to play Anne Boleyn like a scheming villainess one moment, and a nobly suffering wife the next. The performance is uneven and unconvincing, and I'm not sure if the fault lies with Portman as an actress, the way the part is written, or the way she's directed to play it. Eric Bana does not have the physical presence or spirit to play Henry VIII, though the ladies in the audience should be happy, because the only bosoms to be seen in the movie belong to him. Let's just say that if Henry VIII had looked like Eric Bana, history might have turned out differently.The only actress who I felt truly did service to her role is Scarlett Johansson. Johansson gets a bad rap from people for some reason, but every time I see her in something, I'm impressed by how much I like her. I think she's a good actress who doesn't coast on her looks (like she certainly could), and I wonder how this film would have come across if she and Portman had switched roles.Fans of elaborate costumes and production design should have fun with this movie.Grade: B+",6,0,0,7 August 2008
Us," Same Missteps as 'Get Out'
","Jordan Peele's follow up to 'Get Out' recreates both much of what worked about that earlier film and the missteps that ultimately made it less than satisfying.'Us' ratchets up the tension nicely as it introduces us to a loving family on vacation in a cabin in the woods. It then explodes into an invigorating blend of visceral horror and very funny comedy as that family is attacked by a group of doppelgangers bent on doing them harm for unknown reasons. But as the film draws to its obtuse conclusion, Peele feels the need to over explain, and the creepy mystery at the film's center instead turns into awkward and literal plot exposition. How much more satisfying everything might have been if left unexplained.Still, most of this film is wildly entertaining, and Peele is one director who makes films that feel completely plugged into our troubled times. He really does have a unique style, and both 'Get Out' and 'Us' bear the stamp of a formidable originality. It's just his storytelling that needs some work.The acting in this movie is fantastic, especially by Lupita Nyong'o, who's fierce in a double role as the mom and the mom's frightening twin. It's not an exaggeration to say that her performance is award worthy.Grade: A-",7,1,3,8 August 2019
The Danish Girl," I'm Eating a Danish, Girl
","A well-intentioned and certainly topical film that's prevented from being better than it could be by Tom Hooper's relentless commitment to being a boring director.Eddie Redmayne acts up a storm as a Danish painter who begins to experiment with impersonating a woman as a kind of game between he and his wife (Alicia Vikander) until he realizes that the game has awoken something dormant in him and he decides to live his life as a woman, complete with a physical transformation at a time when such a thing was extremely dangerous to attempt.Vikander won an Oscar for playing one of the Academy's favorite character types -- the nobly suffering wife, and in this case, the most understanding spouse in the history of civilization. Redmayne also received an Oscar nomination, as did the film's handsome production design and costumes. The acting is good enough and the material compelling enough on its own to engage its audience's interest, but it can't dust off the patina of tasteful masterpiece theatre that Hooper is determined to apply to it.Grade: B",7,0,1,13 July 2016
Elizabeth," All Hail Queen Blanchett!
","1998 was the year Hollywood made Elizabethan England sexy. 'Elizabeth' was one of two (the other being 'Shakespeare in Love') films released that year to feature the famed Virgin Queen in a prominent role, and both actresses to play her (Cate Blanchett here and Judi Dench in 'Shakespeare') received Oscar nominations (and in Dench's case the win) for their efforts.'Elizabeth' is by far the more serious of the two, but take that for whatever it's worth. This 'historical' rendering of the young Elizabeth's rise to power is full of enough heavy breathing, whispered intrigues and catty spats to fill hours of reality T.V. The film looks lovely, and director Shekar Kapur keeps things moving briskly (even if I did wish that he'd stop moving his camera around quite so much). This was the movie that made me fall in love with Blanchett, a love that has not abated to this day.Interestingly, and weirdly, Joseph Fiennes and Geoffrey Rush both appear in this film and 'Shakespeare in Love.' Between Queen Elizabeth and World War II, what would Hollywood have used for material otherwise that year? Grade: B+",7,0,0,21 June 2010
Knives Out," Rollicking Good Time
","Awards season is the only time of year I feel like theaters are full of movies for adults, when films focus on mature and serious subject matter. But I like to laugh and have fun at a movie too, and man did I do both at 'Knives Out.' Rian Johnson embraces the murder mystery genre wholesale and delivers a twisty-turner thriller that's both wildly entertaining and very funny. A superlative cast, witty screenplay, and brilliantly quirky production design are three of this movie's standout qualities. Daniel Craig, complete with Southern Gothic accent, and Ana de Armas are the leads, but they're surrounded by a cast of supporting actors performing at the top of their game. Indeed, if I have any criticism of the film, it's actually a compliment, and that's that I wish the supporting players -- like Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield, and Don Johnson (of all people) -- were in the film more.'Knives Out' is mostly just a good time, but it's also got some serious barbs to throw out at its presumably mostly liberal audience about a certain kind of liberal progressive hypocrisy that rears its ugly head when issues like immigration and economic equality take center stage.Grade: A",9,12,26,16 December 2019
Spider-Man 2," Resonates in a Post-9/11 World
","'Spider-Man 2' improves on the original, thanks to Sam Raimi's decision to take advantage of a post-9/11 need for solidarity and heroes and work it overtly into his film. It also benefits from a scene-chewing performance from Alfred Molina, as this installment's villain, Doc Oc.However, no improvements were made in the casting of the leads, with dough-faced Tobey Maguire returning as the web slinger and Kirsten Dunst as his vapid muse.This one won the Academy Award for Visual Effects and also found itself nominated for Sound Mixing and Sound Editing.Grade: A-",7,0,1,3 September 2010
The Secret in Their Eyes," Entertaining Pot Boiler
","A fairly compelling Argentinean pot boiler that weaves past and present into a part mystery thriller/part romantic drama about life's unresolved dilemmas.A former legal counselor is haunted by a brutal rape and murder case that goes unsolved -- or rather, it's solved, but the criminal isn't brought to justice because of corruption within the Argentinean legal system. Meanwhile, he's also filled with regret about a romantic relationship he failed to pursue with his boss, passions which are reignited when she comes back into his life years later as he is gathering research for a novel he plans to write about the rape/murder case.'The Secret in Their Eyes' is at its best when dealing with the criminal investigation at its center. It's on shakier ground with the romance, primarily because the two leads don't have a lot of chemistry. We're just told they're smitten with each other, but we never really feel it. Also, the film's execution at times teeters toward the painfully strained, most notably in a scene where the two protagonists are trying to bully a confession out of the man they suspect of being the rapist/murderer. I always felt the film was trying to be smarter than the material would allow, as if the film makers couldn't be content with letting it be a plot-driven thriller (which is what it's really begging to be). But despite these criticisms, it's a very good and crafty film. I'm not surprised that Hollywood decided it needed an American remake, and I'm even less surprised that the powers that be (by all accounts, as I've not seen it) botched it.'The Secret in Their Eyes' won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2009. While it was a respectable choice for that honor, the award should hands down have gone to 'The White Ribbon.' The first film may leave you with a feeling of quiet unease; the second will get into your head and stay there forever.Grade: A-",8,0,0,6 June 2019
The Irishman," 'Goodfellas' Redux
","'The Irishman' is the most 'Goodfellas'-ish movie from Martin Scorsese since 1995's 'Casino.' That's a long time for devotees to wait to see the master director return to the format he virtually invented. Is the wait worth it? Yes and no. 'The Irishman' is no 'Goodfellas,' but I'm also not sure it's trying to be, though it's almost impossible not to compare it. For the first half of the film, it's hard not to be dogged by the sense that we've seen all this before but by artists (many of them the same artists) who had more energy for it twenty and thirty years ago. But then late in the movie, we realize that this film has more on its mind than being yet another retread of a mob life epic, and it's the film's last, quiet moments that earn it a place of its own in Scorsese's canon rather than just a Scorsese rip off of Scorsese.'The Irishman' is very long, but I didn't feel its length that much. And it's the last half hour or so that gives the film it's punch, and only because of everything that's preceded it, so I wouldn't want it to be any shorter. This movie continues past the point where films like 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' end and suggests that the sometimes hellish life of being a gangster may be nothing compared to the hell of growing old. The main character, played by Robert De Niro, is a mafia 'yes' man, carrying out orders while trying hard not to think too much about them. As a result, he gives pretty much his entire allegiance to one man (played by Joe Pesci), while alienating everyone else in his life, from his family to close friends (notably Jimmy Hoffa, played by Al Pacino). What happens, then, when the man from whom you've always taken your orders is no longer around to give them? What happens when everyone else who has comprised the very small world in which you have lived has died and left you behind? What happens when you have nothing but time to reflect on the man you have been and the things you have done? What happens when the one thing that made you feel vital no longer exists? It's not hard to believe that Scorsese the filmmaker is using this film to ask himself some of the questions he asks of his characters, and that's what gives 'The Irishman' a sense of ruminative pathos and makes something richer out of what could have been a glib genre exercise.This is a pretty engrossing, always entertaining, and at times very funny film. But there is one major drawback that I had a heck of a time getting past, and I'm not sure I ever did completely. And that's the fact that everyone in this is simply too old to be playing the characters they're playing. Robert De Niro, vibrant as he may still be, is 76 years old, and, de-aging digital technology aside, he cannot pull off thirty and forty. He and Pesci, similarly de-aged, just look weird and kind of creepy for a good part of the film, and even if the technology can make De Niro look somewhat younger, he still moves like an old man, something most noticeable in a scene where he kicks the crap out of a grocery store owner. At times the movie smacks of a bunch of kind of sad old dudes who are past their prime trying to recapture the glory days of their youths, but then again, given where the movie goes, maybe that's part of the point.One thing, or rather one person, I can heap unqualified praise on is Al Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa. Pacino OWNS this movie. He hasn't been this good in a long, long time.Grade: A",8,4,9,5 December 2019
Billy Elliot," So You Think You Can Dance
","Brisk and sprightly movie about a little boy growing up in a working-class English village who wants to train for ballet, much to the displeasure of his dad.Jamie Bell gives a tremendous performance as Billy, an angry youngster who doesn't understand why he should be ashamed of something he loves, particularly since that something gives him a means of expression for his juvenile frustration and anger. The other standout is Julie Walters, spectacular as Billy's firecracker of a dance instructor. A scene in which she and Billy dance together, giving wild vent to their love of the art form, is the film's highlight.Grade: A",8,3,4,13 July 2010
127 Hours," Can Someone Lend James Franco a Hand?
","Man goes hiking. Man gets pinned in canyon by boulder. Man cuts own arm off to save himself. Man lives. End of story.That's all there is to '127 Hours,' and director/writer Danny Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoy aren't able to make it about much of anything else. James Franco plays the man, and we feel bad for him in the way a normal human being would feel bad for any other human being in a similar situation. But we certainly don't feel invested in him as a character, because the material doesn't allow Franco to create one. There are some flashbacks that give us a peek into the man's life before the accident, and it's from these that we are to absorb the film's trite moral lessons (things like you should appreciate the people you love more and shouldn't take a single day for granted). But really the whole movie is really just build-up to the money shot scene, when Franco's character saws off his arm, which is admittedly pretty hard to watch but isn't really the hook on which to hang an entire movie.Boyle typically over-directs the film to within an inch of its life. The director he most reminds me of is Joel Schumacher, which -- trust me -- is not a compliment. He clearly doesn't think we as his audience have the intelligence or attention span to stick with a story that takes place in such static settings, so keeps the film constantly jittering along in a way that distracts us from the story rather than enhancing it. The only time I enjoyed his hyperactive style was during the kick-ass opening credits sequence.Grade: B-",6,4,8,23 June 2011
Pirate Radio," Would Have Rather Watched a Movie About Pirates
","Writer/director Richard Curtis got away with an awful lot in 'Love Actually,' mostly because that film was positioned as a fairy tale from the beginning, and so the parts of it that made me want to gag on their sweetness were easy to forgive. Such is not the case with 'Pirate Radio,' his borderline terrible movie about the committed men (and woman) who brought rock and roll to the people of England back when it wasn't allowed on legit radio stations.To say that 'Pirate Radio' is unsubtle is a monumental understatement. The counter culture heroes are presented as almost god-like figures of idolatry; the English government (represented by Kenneth Branagh, having fun but saddled with a terrible role) is just shy of looking like the Nazis in 'Springtime for Hitler.' The ensemble is full of good actors (like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Bill Nighy), but they are undermined by bad material, and the ensemble doesn't gel like it did in 'Love Actually.' Curtis wants us to take his story seriously, but everything's too jokey. The end of the film, when the pirate radio boat starts to sink, is especially bad.The film's got good music, but I would have enjoyed the songs more had they not been matched so aggressively literally with the action they were meant to underscore (a character named Marianne leaves the boat, and we hear 'Goodbye, Marianne'; a character named Elenor arrives, and we hear 'Elenor.' Get the picture?) Grade: D+",4,0,1,11 November 2010
Batman Returns," Weaker Than the Original, But Still Not Bad
","Roundly considered a disappointing follow up to Tim Burton's original 'Batman,' 'Batman Returns' still has much to recommend it. Burton takes even more of a morbid funhouse approach to this film than he did the first one, and it's extremely dark in a way that I like.The biggest problem is that neither the Penguin nor Catwoman is as compelling a villain as the Joker, and the two of them combined can't muster up the same level of energy and menace that Jack Nicholson's Joker created singlehandedly. Plus, I always thought Michelle Pfeiffer was miscast as Catwoman, though I liked the origin story they give her here.Still, the film looks fantastic, as all Tim Buron movies do. The production design is a marvel.Grade: B+",7,0,3,6 January 2009
Finding Nemo," An Underwater Treasure
","'Finding Nemo' finds the Pixar animation studio back in top form after their somewhat disappointing (I thought) 'Monsters, Inc.' This group has always had a knack for finding source material that will give them full freedom in unleashing their animation imaginations (the toy-chest world of 'Toy Story,' the insect world of 'A Bug's Life,') and in 'Finding Nemo' they take us underwater and show us the beauty, wonder, and danger of the sea. There are any number of jaw-dropping set pieces in this film: a field of jellyfish, a shark attack, a mass escape from a fishing net. As usual, Disney fills its film with liberal messages about the treatment of wildlife and the environment, much welcome and needed messages in my opinion. But great animation alone cannot sell me on an animated movie--that's done with the quality of the story and characters, and 'Finding Nemo' delivers there as well. The Pixar movies are never as cloying as the traditionally animated films produced by Disney--there's always a drier, cheekier brand of humour, and you get the feeling that just as many jokes are aimed at the adult audience as at the kids. The voices are terrific, the story is quick and funny, and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing. Grade: A",9,0,1,29 April 2005
Superbad," A Tame Dirty Comedy
","Boys behaving badly is the subject of this pretty funny adolescent comedy. Three uber-geeky high school seniors are invited to a party they otherwise would never get invited to because they promise to bring the booze. Their struggles to actually get to the party comprise most of the film's action. End of story.'Superbad' is plenty naughty, but it's actually fairly tame for the genre. Even 'Porky's' from more than twenty years ago felt more adult than this movie. The film's R rating comes almost entirely from its rough language, of which there is plenty, but there's little else to offend. This comedy is in the tradition of the recent spate of 'sensitive' adult comedies like 'The 40-Year-Old-Virgin' and 'Knocked Up' in which guys learn to treat women with respect and maturity is something other than a four-letter word.I had two major complaints with 'Superbad': one is that I can't stand the actor Jonah Hill, who unfortunately gets the bulk of the movie's screen time; the other is that I'm also tiring quickly of Seth Rogan, and his and Bill Hader's antics as the most irresponsible cops in the world provide the movie with its least funny moments, and serve only as a distraction from the much funnier and actually sort of sweet story about three teenagers' coming of age.Grade: B+",7,0,3,27 December 2007
Creed," Dull, Warmed Over Sentiment in an Obvious, Paint by Numbers Film
","The most damning evidence that Hollywood dismisses films predominantly featuring minorities is not that 'Creed' was mostly overlooked at the 2015 Academy Awards but that it was one of the only examples of minority films made that year that people could dig up to make their point. If 'Creed' is the best they could do, then there really is a problem in Hollywood, but the problem isn't that the Academy doesn't nominate black artists -- it's that there aren't enough good movies made by black artists to nominate.'Creed' is one of the most pedestrian, obvious, and dull movies I've seen in a long time. Not a single thing about it deserved to be nominated for an Oscar, though ironically Sylvester Stallone, who was nominated and drew the ire of Oscars So White protesters for the Academy's gall in giving the film's sole nomination to the only white person in it, is the best thing about it. The film is so by the numbers that I only half-way paid attention to it starting at the half-way point and still called the maudlin ending from a mile away. You don't spend 2 hours shoving a 'will he or won't he live up to the legacy of his father' story down our throats unless you intend for the film to answer that question with a resounding 'yes' in its last moments.To be fair, I was never really that into the Rocky movies, so maybe I just wasn't the target audience. But I do remember the first 'Rocky' enough to know that its underdog story, while still pushing all the requisite emotional buttons, felt genuinely inspiring, while 'Creed' feels like warmed over sentiment sprinkled with a dusting of nostalgia for the Rocky series.Needless to say, not exactly a knockout.Grade: C-",3,3,6,17 May 2016
The Great Dictator," Chaplin's Plea for Peace
","I know many people prefer Charlie Chaplin when he's silent, but I have to rank this as my favorite Chaplin film, sound and all. This is one of those movies chock full of one memorable scene after another: Chaplin's hapless soldier trying to load and fire a giant gun; his goofy dictator cavorting with an inflatable beach ball designed to look like a globe of the world; his gentle barber trying to give a member of the Gestapo a shave. I've heard that Chaplin was put on Hitler's death list as a result of this film; I don't know whether that's true or not, but if he was I'm not surprised. I can't even imagine the guts it took to make a film that so obviously mocked such a scary historical figure. In a time when comedians mock our world leaders left and right, it's easy to forget that there were times (and still places today) when doing so could get you killed.Without Chaplin's impassioned plea that closes the movie, in which he steps out of character and warns his audience directly about the consequences of ignoring the gathering storm of Nazi Germany (and fascism in general), 'The Great Dictator' would be a marvelous comedy. With that plea, it becomes much more than merely a marvelous comedy; it becomes an important and inspiring historical document, that happens also to be pretty damn funny too.Grade: A+",10,3,5,14 February 2006
Hot Fuzz," One of the Best Action Movie Spoofs I've Ever Seen
","'Hot Fuzz' is, simply put, one kick-ass movie.I haven't yet seen 'Shaun of the Dead' (though it's now going right to the top of my list), so I didn't know what to expect from this follow up movie from the same team, actor/writer Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright. I expected something much more jokey, more along the lines of a 'Naked Gun' movie. I had no idea this was going to be so unpredictably crazy and so relentlessly clever.Pegg plays a hard-core police officer married to his job who is assigned as sergeant to a wee, quaint English village that has absolutely no need for a police department. However, once there, he becomes convinced that a string of grisly deaths are not 'accidents,' as the townspeople are convinced they are, but rather brutal murders. He concocts a complicated theory about the who and why, but the truth turns out to be far simpler, yet much loonier. This twist gives the movie its biggest jolt of energy, and from the moment the real truth is revealed and Pegg turns vigilante cop, the film becomes one of the funniest action movie spoofs I've ever seen.My favorite thing about the film is that Pegg's character, cynical and suspicious of this perfect little village, is proved right in being both cynical and suspicious.'Hot Fuzz' caught me completely off guard and ended up being one of the best movies I saw in 2007.Grade: A+",10,1,2,18 January 2008
The Mummy," Take That, Boris Karloff
","Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz save the world from the undead in this special effects extravaganza.Though reputedly based on the 1932 Universal Pictures classic of the same name that starred Boris Karloff, this movie shares almost nothing in common with the original except for the fact that it features, well, a mummy. Actually, this is much better than the original. It doesn't attempt to be remotely scary, opting instead for a goofy, wise-cracking tone reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies. Of course, it's nowhere near as good as those -- it's not as light on its feet and it's burdened by a hefty load of not very impressive digital effects. But it's not a bad way to spend an evening.Grade: B",7,0,2,3 January 2008
The Others," I'll Take My Ghost Story with a Twist
","A marvelously atmospheric ghost story starring Nicole Kidman as a mother of two children who becomes convinced that her house is haunted.The film is part 'The Innocents,' the wonderful and overlooked Deborah Kerr film from 1961, and part 'The Sixth Sense,' the film that pretty much set the standard for twist endings, but it's fresh and original enough to stand on its own without having to bear comparison to other films. It boasts an impressive twist ending of its own, which I maybe should have seen coming but didn't. But it also knows that a twist ending is only as good as the movie around it, and it's used to enhance the film's story, not as a crutch.Nicole Kidman gives a terrific performance, one of two that got her attention in 2001 (the other being 'Moulin Rouge!').Grade: A",9,0,2,4 August 2010

","Oh dear, what hath Wolfgang Petersen wrought? A thuddingly stupid movie, that's what. 'Troy' gives beefcake a bad name, for while there's plenty of male flesh on display -- and a fair share of female flesh as well -- it's attached to such dopey, terrible acting that even the slicked up muscles seem unconvincing.Brad Pitt is hopelessly out of his element as Achilles in this version of the Helen of Troy story. And why anyone asked him to try for a British accent is beyond me. And why would he sound British anyway? Oh that's right, because this is Hollywood, and British is the go-to accent anytime directors want their American actors to sound like they're either from a different country or living several centuries ago.Dumb, dumb, dumb.Grade: D",2,1,3,3 September 2010

Usually these movies end with the teacher either dying or leaving his position for some reason or another, but almost invariably we must endure a scene where the music swells and his students applaud him in unison.Robin Williams stars as the teacher in this one, and the Academy gave him a Best Actor nomination because he cried.Grade: C+",5,1,4,29 August 2008
Brokeback Mountain," Ang Lee's Last Picture Show
","Perhaps the saddest thing about 'Brokeback Mountain' is that, though the story begins in 1963 and ends roughly in the early 80s, Ang Lee's film could have been set in the present day and not much would be different. Homosexuality has become almost stylish in America's urban areas, but out in the heartland, where men are still meant to be MEN, I can still see how homosexuals could spend their entire life in the closet for fear of being completely rejected, if not worse, by the society around them.'Brokeback Mountain' put me in the mind of last year's 'Million Dollar Baby' in its approach to controversial subject matter. Like Clint Eastwood's film, 'Mountain' avoids becoming an 'issue' movie. The point is not whether you think homosexuality is sinful, or that all gay people are damned to hell, etc. The point is about whether two human beings who share an emotional connection should be able to act on that. And I would think someone would have to have a heart of ice to come out of this film and not recognize how tragic it is that two people who obviously care as much about each other as the two men in this film do should have to live in fear of expressing their bond. The film also put me in mind of 'Baby' in its style--spare, quiet, unsentimental. The most important thoughts and feelings are conveyed through what remains unsaid.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give sensational and, for two straight heartthrob Hollywood actors, quite brave performances. Ledger especially is a revelation. Nothing he's ever done up to this point, with maybe the exception of his brief performance in 'Monster's Ball,' prepared me for his work here. He has a tough role, as Ennis Delmar, the character he plays, has an instinctual inability to show emotion of any kind. You can see in Ledger's face that his character thinks it's unmanly to expose himself, so his Ennis is all clenched jaw and swallowed words. The only emotion he expresses is violence; whether it's anger, grief, despair or even lust, his first instinct is to lash out and cause pain.Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is the more gregarious of the two, and the more willing to take risks with their shared secret. Ennis is more grounded in the reality of his environment. He accepts an occasional escape with Jack up into the mountains as more than either of them have the right to expect. Jack, on the other hand, as he says at one point in the film, isn't able to get what he needs from a secret meeting every couple of years. He wants a full committed relationship with Ennis, and is too rebellious to let the cowboy culture in which they live prevent them from having that. His character comes across as restless and reckless. You're left wondering whether Jack is attached to Ennis specifically or just the satisfying of desires that Ennis makes possible, until the film's final moments, when you realize just how important a role Ennis played in Jack's life.Meanwhile, the two principal actresses, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, deliver bravura performances in small roles, conveying loads of emotion in a facial expression or gesture. Watch Williams's face when she sees her husband, Ennis, locked in a kiss with Jack. Or watch Hathaway's when Ennis calls her near the end of the film to talk about Jack, and you realize that this wife who appeared throughout the film to know nothing about her husband's clandestine personal life seems to know a great deal, and has been hurt considerably by it.Ang Lee nails the good ol' boy culture of the American west. One has to think that screenwriter Larry McMurty also helped in this department. Like his 'The Last Picture Show,' 'Brokeback Mountain' paints a desolate portrait of deserted Western towns. These are essentially ghost towns, even though they're full of people. Boredom and stagnation are the norm. Men are men and women are women. Gender roles are strictly assigned and there's no deviation. In fact, one wonders at times whether or not Ennis is strictly gay, or whether he forms a bond with Jack because he's the one person with whom Ennis feels safe to be freely emotional without the fear of judgement. At times, it seems as if Ennis is drawn to Jack not because he's a man, but because he's another human being who seems to understand him.It's really amazing and heartening that a film with this subject matter is finding such mainstream appeal. It remains to be seen how much of an audience it draws outside of the urban areas. It would be nice to think that Americans everywhere will be able to put aside preconceived attitudes and be able to appreciate what is essentially a tragedy about two caring human beings, but that's probably too much to hope for. But even if this film makes a few people across the country think twice about passing judgement on people different from themselves, it will have served a valuable purpose.Grade: A",10,27,31,27 December 2005
Ed Wood," One Mad Genius Salutes Another
","Vies with 'Edward Scissorhands' as my favorite Tim Burton film -- though 'Scissorhands' wins in a squeaker.Burton was not above poking fun at infamous good bad movie director Wood, but you can tell he also obviously has some affection for the guy, and even admires his dedication to the craft. That makes all the difference in this movie, which could have been a glib if enjoyable comedy, and becomes in the hands of Burton something touching, a tribute from one mad genius to another.Johnny Depp gave us an early indication of his talent for playing crazy eccentrics, but it's Martin Landau, in a tour de force performance as washed up movie actor Bela Lugosi, who you will remember most.The film looks great in black and white, and has a terrific opening credits sequence.Grade: A",9,0,0,17 March 2009
The Hustler," Well Made, But VERY Depressing
","A stark, downbeat film, proof that Hollywood produced more in the late 1950s/early 1960s than just colorful Biblical spectacles and musicals.Paul Newman stars as Fast Eddie Felsen, one of the roles that made him famous and for which he would win an Oscar when he reprised it over twenty years later in Martin Scorsese's 'The Color of Money.' We think of Newman as making his name playing romantic leads, but look at this body of work during this time period: 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,' 'The Hustler,' 'Hud,' 'Cool Hand Luke.' He actually excelled at playing renegades on the fringe, and he very often took on roles in which he was far from likable.Piper Laurie (Oscar nominated) plays the doomed love interest. She wouldn't appear in a film again until 1976's 'Carrie,' for which she would also be nominated for an Oscar (that has to be some sort of obscure record). Standout performances come from Jackie Gleason, breaking his Ralph Cramden persona to play a slick rival pool hustler, and most notably George C. Scott, as Newman's oily manager.Robert Rossen directs in the same gritty, sweaty style he brought to 'All the King's Men,' a style that works well for the milieu. The movie is very good, but it's such a downer that it leaves a bad taste in the mouth when it's over.Grade: A-",7,1,3,23 October 2006
Spotlight," Excellent and Exciting Film in the Tradition of 'All the President's Men'
","'Spotlight' is the 'All the President's Men' of a new movie generation.Establishing a journalistic tone that matches the film's setting, it tells the story of a Boston newspaper team's efforts to expose the sexual abuse running rampant throughout the Catholic Church. It's a film with hardly a misstep or false note. Eschewing the histrionics and emotional manipulation that other films would have brought to the same material, 'Spotlight' understands that the screenplay and actors hired to interpret it are strong enough without any emotional embellishment, and the film is far more powerful because of the understated approach. The entire cast is at top form, with Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and John Slattery as the standouts (Ruffalo in particular delivers an impassioned soliloquy so emotionally powerful that it nearly brought me to tears), but this is an ensemble film with actors working together like a well-oiled machine, and it seems unfair to single out any one when they're all so good.Director Tom McCarthy is most known for his work to date on the Pixar movies, and you couldn't find a movie further away from the colorful palettes and winsome stories of the Pixar world. But he proves himself a versatile filmmaker, one who knows how to handle extremely varied material. It would be easy to discount the direction of this film, but one should not underestimate how difficult directing a film that consists almost entirely of conversations would be. And when one also considers that part of good directing is getting good performances from actors, McCarthy's goes down as some of the best directing of the year.So far, this and 'Mad Max: Fury Road' are my two favorite movies of the year. How's that for opposite sides of the movie spectrum?Grade: A+",10,13,26,23 January 2016
Terminator Salvation," Salvation Used to Come with a Sense of Humor
","The sci-fi series about cyborgs and the audiences who love them trundles on, giving us the least impressive (but still entertaining) installment to date.Judgement day has come and gone and the war between humans and machines is in full swing. John Connor (a super serious Christian Bale) is now in charge of the resistance, and a new breed of terminators built from combining humans with computers is under development. Meanwhile, SkyNet has issued a directive to kill Kyle Reese, John Connor's father, so that he can't come back in time and protect Connor's mother so that SHE can give birth to John Connor, who will one day lead the human resistance against the machines. Am I repeating myself? Thus the plot outlined in the four Terminator movies has finally come full circle (literally) like a dog chasing its tail.'Salvation' is flashy and well made, but there's also something humorless and dogged about it in comparison to the earlier movies. There's none of the tongue-in-cheek humor, and McG can't stage action scenes as well as James Cameron. There's lots of nifty special effects on display here, but nothing you haven't seen before. The actors don't seem to be having much fun, and the Terminators themselves don't play a very large role, which means the plot of this installment is much less compelling than its predecessors. It also easily has the cheesiest and dumbest ending of the series, or of any number of other movies I've seen recently, for that matter.And for the life of me, I still can't figure out how John Connor ends up being older than his own dad, who he spends most of this film trying to protect. If anyone can explain that to me, please private message me and I'll be eternally grateful.Grade: B-",6,0,2,3 June 2009
500 Days of Summer," An 'Annie Hall' for the New Millennium
","An utterly engaging bittersweet romance about a boy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a girl (Zooey Deschanel) who want different things from one another during the course of a gradually waning relationship.This is 'Annie Hall' for the 21st Century. The film is funny, brisk and entertaining, but it's also fairly serious minded about young love and the pitfalls it's prone to. Both actors give terrific performances -- Gordon-Levitt is proving himself to be one of our best up-and-coming actors, while Deschanel bravely gives us a heroine who we end up not really liking all that much.Despite some overly cute elements (the several scenes between Gordon-Levitt and his little sister, who gives him romantic advice during timeouts at her soccer game, for example), '(500) Days of Summer' feels one hundred times more authentic than the usual romantic comedy fare churned out by Hollywood. It suggests that some of our most significant relationships are more valuable for what they teach us about ourselves than the fleeting emotional connections they give us to another person.Grade: A",8,13,28,27 July 2009
Juno," I Fell Hard for 'Juno'
","'Juno' is this year's 'Little Miss Sunshine,' a tiny film with a gigantic heart.Ellen Page plays Juno (NOT like the city in Alaska, as she makes very clear at one point), a sixteen year old who acts tougher and older than she really feels and who finds herself pregnant after one experimental romp in an easy chair with her best buddy, Paul Bleeker (the terrific Michael Sera). She decides to give the baby to a thirty-ish yuppie couple (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) living in a sprawling McMansion who haven't been able to have a child of their own. The rest is a sweet, very funny and refreshingly unpredictable comedy about what it means to grow up.There are dilemmas in 'Juno,' but they may not be the dilemmas you're expecting. Diablo Cody has written a sharp screenplay that's fair to all of her characters. It was so nice for once to see a young, married, successful couple portrayed as something other than yuppies from hell, and both Bateman and Garner do wonderful work with their characters. Page is a revelation; this is one of those films that's so self-consciously quirky and in love with its own style that it could have been disastrous if not played just so, but Page nails the main character beautifully. She allows us to see Juno's vulnerability, and that's essential to the film's success. The film, unlike so many others, acknowledges that teenagers aren't equipped to deal with adult problems, and that there's a lot they could learn if they were only receptive to it. I give the film great credit for portraying Juno's parents (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney) as something other than buffoons or losers. And Simmons and Janney as actors have some of the film's best lines and moments.Only someone with a heart of stone could leave this film without a lump the size of Alaska in his throat. And, can I just say bravo to the filmmakers for including a terrific opening credits sequence. Am I the only one who's saddened by the fact that movies don't seem to have opening credit sequences anymore? Grade: A",9,5,16,17 December 2007
L.A. Confidential," Kinetic Modern-Day Noir
","This terrifically exciting modern-day noir is like a crime thriller from the 1940s given an extra jolt of color, violence and profanity. Director Curtis Hanson created one of the best and most memorable American film to be released that year, even if it got steamrolled by that cinematic behemoth, 'Titanic.' 'L.A. Confidential' has a fabulous ensemble of male actors cast as its cops and robbers -- Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey all do sensational work. Unfortunately, there wasn't room for any of them at year-end awards time, and it fell to the lone female, Kim Basinger as a Veronica Lake style femme fatale, to represent the film at the Academy Awards by winning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Basinger looks the part, but she's window dressing. This film belongs to its men.A kinetic and wildly entertaining movie.Grade: A",9,1,3,16 July 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," YO, HO, HO and a Mixed Bag of Fun
","Midway through the third installment of Walt Disney's deliriously popular pirate franchise, a character says of Capt. Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), 'Is he making this up as he goes along?' Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series.I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, 'The Curse of the Black Pearl,' but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because 'Pirates' is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel.That sequel, 'Dead Man's Chest,' takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. 'Dead Man's Chest' makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about.So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, 'At World's End,' gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The 'Pirates' movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival 'Star Wars' for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass?The 'Pirates' trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America.

Don Jon," Guidos and Guidettes in Love
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt has turned into one of the best and most interesting of Hollywood's young talents. He has a knack for picking good projects, and consistently takes on interesting roles, not content to glide by on his looks and charm like so many pretty boy actors.So it did not surprise me that 'Don Jon,' his debut as director (he also wrote and stars), is not a typical romantic comedy. Though billed as a movie about a sex addict, the film isn't about addiction so much as it's about the inability of people to form meaningful relationships with others because of preconceived notions (most of them completely unrealistic) about what those relationships should be. One would think based on previews that Gordon-Levitt's character, a guido with slicked back hair and an Internet porn obsession, meets his match when he falls for a hot dame (played by Scarlett Johansson) and must become a better man in order to earn the right to be loved by her. But that's not what happens, and one of the things I liked best about the movie is that Johansson proves to be the film's villain (as much as a movie like this has a villain), and that her expectations about relationships are just as distorted as his, just in different ways.'Don Jon' isn't a terrific movie. It feels more like an early draft than a fully fleshed out final product, with conflicts being resolved too quickly and patly, characters coming to realizations too easily. It was too hard for me to lose myself in the movie and forget that I was watching actors play parts, a sure sign for me that something about the film I'm watching isn't totally working. I felt this the most when watching the scenes between Gordon-Levitt and Julianne Moore, who plays an older and wiser woman who becomes Don's mentor in sex and love. Moore is a lovely actress and I always want to like her, but something about her character in this just didn't ring true for me, though a revelation about her character late in the movie gives it one of its nicest and most touching moments.So not a great film, but certainly one worth checking out as a rental, and good enough to make me look forward to what Joseph Gordon-Levitt the filmmaker is going to do next.The film also stars Tony Danza as Don's foul-mouthed father, and Alison Brie as his sister, who has exactly one line of dialogue but somehow manages to be one of the most memorable things about the movie.Grade: B",7,2,4,29 October 2013
X-Men," X-Men
","I had seen 'X-Men' many years ago and thought it was 'meh.' I recently re-watched it with my kids because I thought they might like the series and liked it more than I did the first time. It feels much less bloated and self-important than so many other superhero movies. I also just think it's cool that each person has his/her own unique abilities, especially when they work together to stop bad guys. Heroes like Batman and Iron Man, as far as I can tell, are only good at beating people up and wouldn't be much if it weren't for all their gadgets and costumes. But all of the X-Men actually have actual powers that set them apart.And good grief, I think Hugh Jackman is sort of silly most of the time, but can I please look like him as I get older?

Thor: Ragnarok," At Least It's Funny
","I think I saw the first 'Thor' movie. All of these superhero movies blend together in my mind. I know I missed some of them, because there was clearly plot exposition that probably would have made 'Thor: Ragnarok' make more sense. Oh well, these movies don't make much sense even if you have seen them all. They all devolve into loud and flashy spectacle by the time they're over and hope you'll be so dazzled that you'll forget any crappy parts. It's harder and harder for me to watch movies like this and get past the weapon fetishism they all wallow in -- there's such an emphasis on how cool you look wielding your big gun, the bigger the better. In the increasingly disturbing American gun culture, it's no longer possible (for me at least) to shrug stuff like this off as 'only a movie.' But whatever...I acknowledge that I probably shouldn't be watching movies like this in the first place if that's going to bother me.As for the rest? It's pretty funny, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and it's got Cate Blanchett looking sexy as hell in a dominatrix outfit (that is, until she puts on a ridiculous hat that makes her look like one of Satan's reindeer). I got tired of it, but as you might have gathered if you've stayed with this review, I'm probably not the target audience for it.Grade: B",7,0,4,5 June 2019
Match Point," Woody, Meet Mr. Hitchcock
","Anyone who laments the fact that Alfred Hitchcock is no longer alive to make thrillers can rest easy---the Woodman is on the case.'Match Point' is a ghoulishly entertaining movie that threatens to become a rip-off of 'An American Tragedy' mixed with 'Crime and Punishment,' until Woody jerks the film in a totally different direction and makes it utterly original.For about the first twenty minutes of the film, I was thinking how ironic it was that Allen's best movie in a long time (and even in the first twenty minutes you can tell it is indeed going to be that) should also be his most unoriginal. The plot is cliché, and is not helped by the fact that Allen borrows heavily from Theodore Dreiser in setting up his main character's dilemma. However, once the protagonist (for want of a better word) sets out to plan the 'perfect' murder, inspired by 'Crime and Punishment' (which you see him reading early on in the film), the movie becomes an anything-can-happen nailbiter, and had me on the edge of my seat.Scarlet Johannsson is remarkable as an emotionally unstable love interest; Allen uses her sultry good looks to perfect effect, and he includes her in some of the most erotic moments he's ever filmed. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who I can't decide whether or not I like, also equips himself well as the ex-tennis pro who finds himself torn between a life of privilege and his lust for the object of his desire. And all of the supporting players are excellent, though I expected no less from a Woody Allen film.Allen shows complete mastery of a genre he's never tackled. This doesn't even seem like an Allen film at first glance, but many of his recurring themes are here, and his usual knack for writing such strong characters with such believable motives adds much to the suspense and effectiveness of the film overall.A true stunner of a movie, easily one of the best of the year.Grade: A",9,13,22,17 January 2006
Midnight in Paris," A Mediocre Trip to the City of Love
","I suppose if I had seen 'Midnight in Paris' back when it first came out, before the awards hype and hyperbolic praise started proclaiming it one of the best movies of the year, I would have thought it was a perfectly fine if unmemorable Woody Allen movie, certainly better than many of his most recent efforts but not nearly as good as some others. But expectations were high after it started appearing on 10-best lists and winning awards, and so instead of enjoying the film for its modest charms, I was left wondering what on earth people saw in this that warrants its rapturous response.I long ago accepted that Woody Allen is going to traffic in tired clichés for the rest of his career. But an artist falling in love with the charms of Paris has to be one of the most tired. There is some fun to be had in waiting to see what famous names Owen Wilson's author character is going to come across next, and I have to imagine that what critics are responding to is the idea of one artist being able to interact directly with those long-dead artists who serve as their muses. So some scenes with characters like Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, the Fitzgeralds, etc. offer some pleasant whimsy. But the real-life part of the screenplay, detailing Wilson's excruciatingly slow realization that he and his horrible fiancée (written as a completely unbelievable caricature and played as a simply despicable human being by Rachel MacAdams) are not meant for one another, takes up far too much time. Not only is this part of the movie tedious, it's badly written, one criticism I usually can't level at Allen's screenplays.Sure, Paris looks lovely, but it surely says something about the movie that the thing I most remember about it is the performance of Alison Pill, a scene stealer as Zelda Fitzgerald but who has exactly three minutes of screen time.Grade: B-",6,2,4,30 January 2012
Youth," Life Is About the Journey, Not the Destination
","Two aged friends spend some time together at a Swiss resort reminiscing about their pasts, regretting their mistakes, and pondering their creative careers in this thoughtful, quiet film about what it's like to look back on your life and quantify the results.Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel are the friends, and both give marvelous performances, Caine especially in the role of a famed composer who is confronted with the life (a wife and daughter, played in a characteristically over-acted performance by Rachel Weisz) that he set aside to focus on his career. Paul Dano is a young film actor who's preparing for a role as Hitler, while Jane Fonda makes a late-act appearance as a Hollywood grande dame and who for one lengthy scene carries the movie away with her.'Youth' is beautifully shot, one striking composition following another, and it unfolds with an air of stately grace. If I had been in a different mood when I saw it, I might have found that air a bit suffocating and overly austere, but as it is I thought it was the perfect matching of tone and subject matter.'Youth' is less about what its various characters and sub-plots add up to than it is individual moments and how they add up to what we think of as life. As I get older myself, I realize that life isn't about achieving some defined goal -- those who make it so are bound to look back with a feeling of disappointment, either because that goal will never be achieved or because it proves to be not very satisfying when it is. Instead, life is a collection of little moments along the way, and what you do with them -- enjoy them, learn from them, try not to repeat them -- is what separates those who find happiness (or at least contentment) from those who do not.Grade: A",9,0,1,21 November 2016
Zodiac," Not Your Average Serial Killer Movie (And That's a Good Thing)
","'Zodiac' may frustrate viewers who come to David Fincher's latest film expecting a traditional serial killer thriller. The film begins with a couple of hair-raising and rather brutal recreations of murders carried out by the mysterious killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These early scenes are shocking and, compared to the rest of the film, disorienting, because they offer the only time that we come close to seeing events from the killer's perspective. As the film progresses, the Zodiac killer himself fades into the background, and the movie turns into a meticulous and engrossing document of the investigation to track him down, an investigation that includes countless blind alleys and false clues and which to this day has not reached a conclusion. I would be more prone to label the somewhat rambling screenplay as sloppy storytelling if I did not feel that Fincher tells the story exactly as he wants to. The elusive narrative works, because the film is about an elusive villain.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist working for the 'San Francisco Chronicle' at the time the Zodiac killer began his gruesome work. He becomes fascinated by the case, and takes it on as a sort of morbid personal hobby long after the police department has given it up as a lost cause. Graysmith eventually wrote the book on which this film is based, and according to his accounts, he discovered enough evidence about one of the suspects in the case to put the police back on his trail years after he'd been cleared for lack of evidence. Other characters come and go. Robert Downey, Jr. does characteristically terrific work as a reporter at the 'Chronicle' who grabs his own portion of notoriety through his involvement in the case. Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards play the two detectives in charge of the investigation. Chloe Sevigny plays Gyllenhaal's put-upon wife, who gradually loses her husband to his obsession. All of the actors deliver thrilling performances, many of them against the odds. Since this isn't a character driven movie, many of the characters remain undeveloped, but not, for once, to the detriment of the film. This story isn't about the people involved, but rather about their role in the Zodiac saga; once they've served their purpose, Fincher dispenses with them. Ironically, a film that clocks in at nearly 3 hours exhibits a great deal of narrative economy.Parts of 'Zodiac' are intensely creepy. Fincher effectively uses the rainy San Francisco atmosphere to its maximum potential, and the grimy browns and grays of the production design call to mind Fincher's other well-known films, like 'Seven' and 'Fight Club.' But 'Zodiac' is much more grown up than those films, and for an audience to enjoy it, it has to have an attention span. Long scenes are given to analyzing handwriting samples, recreating the scenes of murders, digging through newspaper clippings and files. You can tell that Fincher is fascinated by police work in the pre-CSI era, when fax machines were still a novel invention. He delves into the investigative process with a nearly fetishistic attention to detail, but he makes all of it endlessly mesmerizing. He does his best to bring everything to some sort of conclusion, but the real-life end to the story makes a complete conclusion impossible. This film is more about the journey than the destination, and what a journey it is.Grade: A",9,474,539,26 March 2007
Milk," Good But Not Great
","Gus Van Sant's rock-solid account of the rise of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk and his efforts to bring awareness to gay-rights issues is supremely capable and engaging, but there was something about the whole thing that just felt a bit uninspired to me.I knew absolutely nothing about Milk's story before seeing the film -- I was all of three when Milk was assassinated -- so I was very interested in it from a historical perspective. However, I just didn't connect to it on an emotional level. I'm not sure why, because I'm a chump for a good old fashioned underdog story -- which 'Milk' certainly is. And there's almost nothing negative I can say about the film that accounts for my lukewarm reaction to it. Sometimes there's just an intangible 'something' missing from a film that prevents me from responding much to it, and that's the case here.It does boast a tremendous performance from Sean Penn though, completely lacking in the hamminess Penn has been guilty of in his more recent film appearances. He unfussily gets down to the business of playing the character of Harvey Milk without self-concsiously reminding us that he's Sean Penn playing him. Weirdly, despite Milk being such a flamboyant character, Penn's performance is unshowy. Of the supporting cast, I was most impressed with Emile Hirsch, who plays a member of Milk's campaign committee. Hirsch contributes a great deal of energy to the film whenever he's on screen, and the scenes featuring him and Penn together are some of the movie's best.For once, I didn't like a Danny Elfman score. It's too obtrusive and is at odds with Van Sant's typically objective style. But other than that, I thought the film was extremely well done.My comment may have already made this apparent, but I'm rather puzzled at my own reaction to the film. Instead of being able to give it an enthusiastic endorsement, I rather thought that it was a good but not great 2008 offering.Grade: A",8,1,8,15 December 2008
The Prestige," Fine Looking Production Wasted on an Incoherent Script
","Christopher Nolan's latest puzzle movie is like a big heaping plate of spaghetti: when taken together, it looks like a complete and satisfying meal, but if you pick up any one noodle individually, you find that it's not connected to any of the others and just trails into nothing.I felt like a complete moron walking out of this movie, because I completely missed the big surprise twist at the end. My wife had to explain it to me on the way home. But in thinking back on the movie, I decided that the fault did not lie with me (or so I'd like to believe). Christopher and Jonathan Nolan have written a muddled and confusing screenplay, in which every single plot detail (and there are many) gets equal weight and nothing takes central focus. The ending doesn't feel so much like a creative twist as it does a cheap trick.The performances are fine, though none of the characters ever comes alive. There's so much intricate plot to race through that no one has time to develop any nuance into their roles, and all of the characters serve as ciphers for the plot rather than as psychologically believable and consistent individuals. Christian Bale comes off best; Hugh Jackman is as bland as ever; Michael Caine is just kind of there; and Scarlett Johannsen may as well not even be in the movie for the importance placed upon her.Movies like 'The Prestige' bug me. They spend all of their time trying so hard to trick and mislead that they never get around to telling a compelling story that I care anything about. Five minutes after you walk out of the theatre, the plot starts unraveling like wet Kleenex, because the film doesn't build its plot from the character level up (which the other magician film from this year, 'The Illusionist,' did and which is why that's a better movie). 'The Prestige' is a magic trick that leaves you wanting your money back.Grade: B-",6,2,8,30 October 2006
The Terminator," Gov. Arnold Comes Back from the Future
","James Cameron's time-bending sci-fi classic stars Governor Arnold as everyone's favorite cyborg sent back in time to assassinate the future leader of a resistance group that will wage war against a race of machines.The original film has a low-budget quality that makes it look quaint next to its big Hollywood sequels, but it somehow works well with the material. It gives the film the look and feel of one of those exploitative grindhouse movies from the 1970s, and I dug it.With Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn, and a whole bunch of other people that would show up in James Cameron's 'Aliens' a couple of years later.Grade: A",8,0,1,19 November 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," This Latest Journey with Helloby Is a Blast
","Ron Perlman is back as everyone's favorite demon in this wildly imaginative sequel to the 2004 superhero film.This time around, an ancient elf prince is on a mission to resurrect a dormant golden army so that he can declare war on mankind. It's up to Hellboy and his gang of fellow paranormals to stop him. This film spends much more time in the paranormal underworld than the first film did, and it gives director Guillermo del Toro the freedom to unleash his fierce imagination in conjuring up the beasties that live in that world. The makeup and visual effects in this film are astounding -- a particularly notable scene involves a plague of evil tooth fairies. And the production design is top notch as well. After seeing 'The Fall,' I thought I wouldn't see another film this year that looked as good, but I may have to revise my opinion.Only toward the very end, when the golden army is awakened, does the action drift toward the mundane. But the rest of the film is a blast.Grade: A",9,2,4,14 November 2008
Cloverfield," 'Godzilla' for the YouTube Generation
","This monster movie tries hard to be 'Godzilla' for Generation Y, but it doesn't quite make it. It's a terrific looking film and it's capably acted -- when you watch the special features on the DVD and realize that most of the time actors were interacting with nothing but green screens, it makes both the acting and the effects that much more impressive. But it's one of those gimmick movies that's pinned down by the very element that makes it unique (I use the word 'unique' loosely, since 'The Blair Witch Project' has already covered this ground, to an extent). The hook in this film is that the destruction of New York and the attempts of a small band of twenty-somethings to stay alive is captured on a camcorder by one of the kids. But the technical necessities required to pull off this stunt result in too many logical flaws, not the least of which is how long would it take someone running for his life from a giant monster ravaging downtown Manhattan to ditch the camera? But of all the holes the screenplay creates, the one most perplexing was this: how the hell do all of these young kids afford spacious apartments in Manhattan? Grade: B",7,0,1,13 May 2008
Sleepy Hollow," A Story Perfectly Matched to Tim Burton
","'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' with its Gothic trappings, eerie atmosphere and macabre sense of humor, was pretty much tailor made to be directed by Tim Burton, a director whose style could easily be defined as encompassing all of the above.Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci is his love interest. The story is filled out to fill a feature length movie, and I honestly can't remember much about the plot. But the plot doesn't matter, because the star of the film is its ghoulish production design.Miranda Richardson steals some scenes as a wicked and wickedly fun witch.Grade: B",7,0,0,30 June 2010
Hotel Rwanda," The Horrors of Genocide
","Harrowing and exciting true-life account of Paul Rusesabagina, a man who opened up his hotel to refugees during a Rwandan civil war.Don Cheadle gives an amazing performance as a man of business who reluctantly dons the cloak of a man of action in order to be a help to his people. The film addresses the horrors of the Rwandan genocide, and the horrific arbitrariness that makes one group of people so utterly hate another that they want to destroy them, but it's never preachy. Director Terry George successfully walks the delicate line between making an entertaining film about a terrible incident without exploiting it.Cheadle was rightfully Oscar nominated, and a nomination also went to Sophie Okonedo as his wife.Grade: A",9,0,0,3 September 2010
Once," I Don't Think I've Ever Seen a Mellower Movie
","Watching 'Once' is like sitting in on a jam session. It's mellow and relaxed. It doesn't amount to much, but it's pleasant enough.The director has said that he set out to make a movie so simple that the story could be summarized on the back of a postage stamp, and he's succeeded. An Irish busker meets a Czech émigré, and both flit around the edges of falling for each other while recording a demo album of the busker's music. Both are struggling with the loves in their lives, he with a girlfriend in London, she with her estranged husband and father to her little girl. The resolution of their stories, what resolution there is, felt right and realistic. This isn't a fairy tale, but neither is it Shakespearean tragedy. Life simply goes on.The film's biggest asset is its music, and indeed most of the songs in the film we see performed in their entirety. The movie isn't exactly a musical in the strictest sense of the word, since characters don't spontaneously burst into choreographed musical numbers, but like the best musicals, the songs in 'Once' illuminate the characters and play an integral role in the storytelling.A low-key little gem of a movie.Grade: A",8,9,10,27 December 2007
Ready Player One," Only Barely Resembles Novel
","I can't imagine that anyone who read and liked Ernest Cline's dazzling novel could be satisfied with this film adaptation of it.Which is odd, since Cline co-adapted the screenplay. Maybe he wanted to avoid the trap of the movie never living up to its source, so he decided to take the thing in an entirely different direction so it would be harder to compare the two. In any case, what lives on the screen resembles the novel only in the barest of outlines. Gone is the cleverness of the novel and its geeky reverence for 1980s pop culture. In its place is a soulless attempt to recreate one of those adventure movies from that decade, like 'Goonies' or 'Back to the Future,' but without the sensibility to pull it off. Again, very odd given that the director of this film, Steven Spielberg, practically redefined the adventure sci-fi movie. But he feels like the wrong match for this material. The movie is like watching a movie about 80s nostalgia made by someone who doesn't feel it and is trying to manufacture it based on a guess as to what it might feel like.Mostly the film is just visually overwhelming. A bunch of visual effects artists vomit a bunch of CGI on to the screen to see what will stick, and the end result is to numb the audience into submission.Grade: C",5,1,2,4 October 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Incoherent Plot, Ugly Production Design, Sluggish Pace -- Three Strikes and You're Out
","Egads, what a terrible movie! Fifteen minutes in, I was lost, and never again found my way. The basic plot involves the efforts of the British intelligence trying to root out a Russian spy in their midst, but this film is so preposterously hard to follow, not to mention glacially paced, that I found myself gazing at the decor for nearly the entire running time. Unfortunately, since the film is set in the drab Soviet world of the 1970s, the decor is mostly brown, gray and murky, much like the cinematography.I can't even tell you whether Gary Oldman, who received an Oscar nomination for his performance, is any good, not to mention any of the other recognizable actors (Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Toby Jones, Tom Hardy, John Hurt) who make up the rest of the cast. To know whether or not an actor is doing a good job, you have to understand the character he is playing and where that character fits in with the other characters and the general plot. This movie is like watching a bunch of random scenes strung together with no relation to one another.Here's a tip: if you're going to make a completely plot-driven movie, you better damn well make sure that plot can be followed by someone who hasn't read the book first.Grade: D",3,5,11,3 February 2012
The Hateful Eight," One of the Most Uneven Movies I've Ever Seen
","Quentin Tarantino is finally becoming the very thing he tries most to resist: a cliché.I've continued to defend Tarantino against critics of his films who claim he does nothing but peddle in senseless violence and that he's made a career out of borrowing other filmmakers' styles rather than develop one of his own. But after 'Django Unchained' and now 'The Hateful Eight,' I'm finding my interest in defending him starting to wane. After reading the divisive reactions to 'The Hateful Eight,' many of which confirmed my sinking suspicions that I would be in for yet another pointless bloodbath like 'Django,' I found myself pleasantly surprised by the film's first half. Tarantino's penchant for creating colorful characters and giving them juicy dialogue is in full force, and he's assembled again a cast of actors who, even if in some cases aren't really good actors, are able to convince you for the length of this film that they are because they sound so good saying the things they're given to say. And some of them ARE good actors, like Jennifer Jason Leigh who steals the show as a degenerate gang leader, and who knows exactly how to land every joke Tarantino throws out, which are numerous and which make the first half a riot. But the movie, after all the rambling dialogue and plot exposition, has to eventually come to a conclusion, and unfortunately, Tarantino has seemingly lost all ability to end a movie in any way other than killing off all of his characters as gruesomely and graphically as possible. The very violence that used to give his movies punch and get people talking has now become boring and routine and, worst of all, predicable. I watched the end of this film play out and thought, 'he gives us this great set up and these great actors and this is the only thing he can think of to do with it all?' Tarantino has taken a lot of heat for being misogynistic and racist. I don't think he's a misogynist -- nothing happens to Leigh's character that wouldn't just as easily happen to any of the men, and in his own way Tarantino gives us a rather feminist character in his refusal to concede anything to Leigh's gender; she's as nasty, if not even more so, a piece of work as any of the male characters. As far as racism goes, I don't think Tarantino's a racist either, but I'm not sure what he's trying to say about race relations. If 'The Hateful Eight' is any indication, he's saying that blacks have been so mistreated by whites that they are now free to do whatever they want to the white man with the added bonus of it being hilarious because it's so deserving. In this complicated and sensitive time of revived racial conflict, this is a poorly-timed moment to address the topic in so juvenile and facile a manner.'The Hateful Eight' is above anything else one of the most uneven movies I've seen in a long time. It can't settle on a tone or a point of view. It's too long, too excessive, and Tarantino clings too rigidly to tricks (like topsy-turvy chronology) that have made his previous movies interesting but now just seem so tired. One thing I can unequivocally say the film has going for it is its magnificent score, courtesy of Ennio Morricone, who won a well-deserved Oscar for it. The rest of the film's not a wash, but it did leave me feeling like it's time for Tarantino to crawl out of the sandbox and start playing with the big boys.Grade: B-",6,3,7,13 July 2016
Catch-22," Too Literal and Not Anarchic Enough
","Mike Nichols tries for a literal interpretation of Joseph Heller's amazing epic comedy, and the results crash and burn.'Catch-22' the book is, of course, unfilmable as it is. A movie version would have to be 12 hours long just to fit in all the characters and plots, but there would still remain the daunting task of finding a visual language that approximates Heller's surrealist, hilarious, nightmarish authorial voice. The best any movie could shoot for with a screen adaptation would be to capture the tone of Heller's novel, and that's where Nichols fails most. His 'Catch-22' tries to impose a linear, logical structure on a novel whose very point is the utter insanity of war. Therefore, the movie feels like a series of underdeveloped episodes that don't relate to one another, and characters that live on the page in almost three-dimensional detail are relegated to a mere minute or so of screen time each in the movie.I can't stand it when people rip movies apart by saying that they're not as good as the books on which they're based. Movies and books are completely different mediums and require completely different kinds of artistry. And I think it's possible to do a screen version of 'Catch-22' that would retain everything that is wonderful about the book while bringing to it the unique additions of cinema. But Nichols' film isn't that version. I wonder what Robert Altman could have done with 'Catch-22' if he'd ever taken a crack at it. His goofball, anarchic and cynical directorial voice would have been perfectly suited to Heller's novel. I've always thought that 'MASH,' the Altman film released the same year as 'Catch-22,' was more like the Joseph Heller novel than the film actually based on it.Grade: C",5,3,6,12 March 2007
"I, Tonya"," Glib Retelling of a Sensational Story
","I remember well the whole Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story (I was just graduating from high school when it all went down), and I was very intrigued to see how a movie would portray it all. At the time, I mostly just remember being done with the whole thing by the time it had played itself out. I was so sick of everybody involved, Kerrigan included, and it all just seemed so sleazy and embarrassingly American. The movie made me feel much the same way. These were trashy people living a trashy life style doing trashy things, and despite the film's clear intention to do so, it isn't able to wring much moral significance from the whole episode.Margot Robbie does a fine job in the lead role, avoiding the temptation to do a simple impersonation and instead trying her hardest to turn Tonya Harding into a three-dimensional character. The film limits her success, however, because of its dogged determination to remain glib and cartoonish and play the whole thing like a big joke that the audience is in on. This is weirdly at odds with choices the director, Craig Gillespie, makes at various points in the movie, like giving Tonya monologues about how she's a different person than the media would have us believe, or one uncomfortable scene during which Robbie addresses the movie audience directly and tells us that we collectively are as responsible for persecuting Harding as her abusive husband or monstrous mother. If handled differently, moments like these could have made this film a reflexive examination of America's unhealthy relationship with the media and its obsession with fame, however earned. But the movie is too eager to be a crowd pleaser to dwell for long on anything too serious, so it rushes on to its next bit of comedy and ends up doing to Tonya Harding exactly what it accuses its audience of. In addition to Robbie, Allison Janney is getting a heap of acclaim for her performance as Harding's mother, an absolute horror of a woman. She hits the marks she's asked to hit, but it's a shame that such a talented actress as Janney isn't given more to work with than the gross caricature she's given here. On the other hand, Sebastian Stan, as Tonya's buffoon of an on-again-off-again husband, gives a great performance that no one seems to be talking about.'I, Tonya' is entertaining, but it doesn't deserve to be remembered in the same company as some of the best films of 2017.Grade: B+",7,5,10,5 January 2018
Molly's Game," Fast Paced Entertainment
","Aaron Sorkin directs a movie like he writes one: with a snap, crackle, and pop.'Molly's Game' is a fast paced biopic about an ex-competitive skier turned poker grande dame who comes under a federal indictment when it turns out that some of her players are Russian mafia. Jessica Chastain commands the screen, which is a good thing since she's in nearly every scene. And Sorkin's dialogue is so fast and zingy that the film feels like a screwball comedy even when nothing funny is happening.Entertaining as 'Molly's Game' is, there's something intangible preventing it from attaining greatness. Maybe it's the fact that the character of Molly Bloom is portrayed too much as a madame with a heart of gold. She's such a sharp cookie that it's hard to believe she's as innocent as the movie makes her out to be, and I think the film misses out on some opportunities to dive into complexity in its interest to give us a female character to root for.Kevin Costner turns in some fine work as Molly's dad, and he gets the film's best scene, the one time the film slows down enough to allow both its characters and its audience to feel some genuine emotion.

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Bosom Buddies
","The ultimate 'buddy' movie.Buddy movies were all over the place in 1969 in various guises -- this, 'Midnight Cowboy,' 'The Wild Bunch,' 'Easy Rider.' 'Butch Cassidy' is the lightest and most accessible of these -- for that reason, I don't think it's as interesting to look at now as these other movies are. But it does serve up a dose of good old-fashioned Hollywood film-making, and in Paul Newman and Robert Redford, it presented audiences with a cinema duo as memorable as that of Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello, or if you prefer a more contemporary example, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, who had manufactured a similar screen chemistry the year before in 'The Odd Couple.' 'Butch and Sundance' is mostly a nostalgic comedy, harking back to the glory days of screen westerns. But for all its levity, there is something dark about it that's hard to describe. Butch and Sundance are anti-heroes in the same way that Bonnie and Clyde were in Arthur Penn's brilliant film -- they've got the glamour of Hollywood movie stars, but their doom is sealed from the second the film starts, and because they're so likable and charismatic, it makes it that much more upsetting to see them destroyed. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Butch and Sundance find themselves unable to exist in a world intent on their destruction -- in this way, the film comments both on the death of the traditional western, and on the alienated restlessness of an entire younger generation that was beginning to make itself heard in American cinema.Also starring Katharine Ross as the third point in a love triangle, and featuring one of the best film songs ever recorded, 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,' which accompanies Paul Newman as he shows off for Ross on a bicycle in one of the movie's highlights.Grade: A-",8,0,2,20 February 2007
Moana," Fairly Generic Disney
","It's nice to see a spunky female heroine of color at the center of a Disney film, and it's also nice that the story doesn't remotely involve her falling in love with anyone by the film's end, but this movie still couldn't completely shake off its patina of generic Disney message. The animation is pretty, the music is forgettable (with the exception of the rousing Oscar-nominated anthem 'How Far I'll Go'), and the story is moderately engrossing. This was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the 2016 Academy Awards, but it's no where nearly at the same level as some of its co-nominees, namely 'Kubo and the Two Strings' and my personal favorite, 'The Red Turtle.'Grade: B",7,2,3,31 July 2017
Crash," An Important Film, Even If an Imperfect One
","'Crash' has so many good things going for it, it's a shame that it's hampered by a clunky, obvious and over-earnest script. The movie is very Altmanesque in design, featuring a large ensemble cast and a plot that intricately weaves various plot lines together in surprising ways. Unlike Altman's best films, though, 'Crash' doesn't have that spontaneous, improvised feel; everything feels too forced and overly scripted. Every scene plays out in the same way, creating an ever so slightly monotonous pace. It's a movie with great intentions that isn't entirely successful at fulfilling them.But, the writing is my only complaint. From a directing and acting standpoint, 'Crash' triumphs. Paul Haggis makes the leap from screenwriter to director ably, and does a wonderful job of keeping his story moving fluidly along, no matter how implausible it might be. And as far as the ensemble goes, this is ones of those movies (also very like an Altman film, come to think of it) that has a cast full of actors who you've never seen act as well as they do here. I wouldn't say I've ever been much impressed by the dramatic range of Ryan Philippe, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser or Sandra Bullock, but they certainly impress here. Bullock, despite a tiny role, makes an enormous impression, and her brief monologue during which she describes what it's like to wake up every morning filled with anger without even knowing what she's angry about, was one of the most affecting scenes I've seen in a movie all year.Other cast members are excellent as well: Terrence Howard as a movie executive 'selling out' to white America; Thandie Newton as his frustrated wife, angry at him for not standing up to the very people who have made her privileged life possible; Don Cheadle as a hardened detective who has resigned himself to the unfairness of being judged by the color of your skin.Whatever its faults, 'Crash' deserves high praise for tackling with intelligence and conviction subject matter that other film makers wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. How refreshing in our time of political correctness that a film would dare suggest that stereotypes might be based on truths, and that a white director and writer can make a sharp film about the race question without feeling the need to cushion everything through the gauzy haze of liberal white guilt.Not a perfect movie by any means, but one that I think deserves to be seen.",8,2,5,27 January 2006
BlacKkKlansman," A Movie for Our Times (Unfortunately)
","I broke my embargo of Spike Lee movies to see 'BlackkKlansman' and was pleasantly surprised to discover one of the best movies of the year.I had long ago decided Lee wasn't ever going to make another good movie (the last one being 'Do the Right Thing' way back in the dark ages of 1989). His movies have always been angry, which isn't what bothers me, since he has a lot to be angry about. But they've been hectoring and preachy, hammering away at the same point over and over with a sledgehammer. They've alienated me, not with what they have to say, but with how they've said it. But 'BlackkKlansman' gives us a more mature, nuanced Spike Lee, one who's not so much angry (though he's still that) as much as he's sad and tired that a story set in the early 1970s has as much to say about our country now as it did then. Oh how far we haven't come.'BlackkKlansman' is perfectly timed. It's the best movie I've seen yet that captures the disbelief people like me feel that white supremacy can still be so predominant in our culture. It's funny, but its comedy has teeth. And though some may feel Lee overplays his hand at the end by bringing in real footage of recent events and our dear national leader, I think he's saying things that need to be not just said, but screamed from the mountaintops.Grade: A",9,6,13,30 November 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Mein Fuhrer.....I Can Walk!
","'Dr. Strangelove' had to have seemed strange indeed to 1964 audiences. This came out in the same year as colorful, old-fashioned Hollywood fare like 'My Fair Lady' and 'Mary Poppins.' Yet 'Strangelove' is far from old-fashioned or even colorful. Kubrick's film is stark and cold with a documentary-like air to it. It's also riotously funny. Peter Sellers is a film treasure. This film is a an orgy for Sellers fans, since he plays no less than three different characters, stretching his chameleon-like acting abilities to the limit. The funniest of his three characters is the dead-pan president of the United States, and the film's funniest scene involves him trying to gently break to the Russian premiere that we are about to launch a nuclear attack on his country. His portrayal of the title character is also inspired, and the image of Sellers in that wheelchair wrestling his black-gloved hand into submission with that crazy shock of hair and crazier glint in his eyes is unforgettable.The film also sports a great supporting cast, most notably George C. Scott as Buck Turgison, who discreetly takes calls from his bikini-clad girlfriend during war room briefings, Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper, who wields his cigar like a dangerous weapon, and Slim Pickens, as the pilot of the plane that is about to end civilization as we know it. My only complaint with the film is its somewhat sluggish editing, especially in the scenes showing the fleet of bombers on its way to their Russian targets. At times, the movie actually drags slightly, even though it's only 90 minutes long.But this is a minor quibble about a film that has rightly earned a spot in the cultural conscience of America. It will never be irrelevant as long as the ability to wage nuclear war exists, and it doesn't look like that problem will be going away any time soon.",9,2,4,29 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The Boy Who Loved 'Star Wars'
","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original 'Star Wars' film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first 'Star Wars' themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review 'Star Wars' as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to 'Star Wars' and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Trek' but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+",10,178,231,2 December 2005
The Expendables," What Should Be Exciting Instead Becomes Boring
","'The Expendables' boasts a potentially fun concept -- bring together a bunch of stars, past and present, known almost exclusively as action heroes and put them all in the same movie. And it is fun for a while, especially as people like Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger pop up in cameos. But by the time the movie is over, it's become a loud bore, and the cold-blooded manner in which the movie goes about satisfying its audience's bloodlust makes what should be a rousing and exciting finale instead rather disturbing and uncomfortable.One must give co-writer, director and star Sylvester Stallone some credit though for keeping his ego in check. Otherwise, there's no way someone who looks as good as Jason Statham (who disappointingly doesn't get to do any of the nifty stunt work he's known for) would be let within 100 feet of Sly and his seen-better-days pals. Though I did notice that Statham was not once allowed to appear without his shirt on....Grade: C",5,4,9,7 February 2011
MASH," The Definition of Organized Insanity
","Once that now famous and haunting opening theme song, 'Suicide Is Painless,' has finished playing, 'MASH' bursts on to the screen in a blaze of sound and movement. It's a typical Altman film, and that's a huge compliment. It may not seem like anything special now, because his style has been so influential on all manner of present-day filmmakers, but at the time, audiences had never seen a major studio film whose ordering principle was mass chaos.Altman films have forever spoiled for me just a tiny bit all other carefully framed, carefully constructed conventional films, because his movies feel so alive in a way that other films don't. 'MASH' is gloriously crazy, with all of the actors talking over one another and no apparent thought given to the framing of scenes. Altman has said that he wants his audiences to have to work at his movies. You have to decide what you want to listen to and who you want to watch, because virtually every character in the frame at any given moment is doing or saying something that's no less important than what some other character is doing or saying. But don't be fooled. Altman may have claimed innocence in imposing any kind of directorial hand on his material, but his films are as craftily constructed as any other. 'MASH' begins with a montage of wounded soldiers being delivered to the medical unit for treatment, and one of the last shots of the film shows a dead body wrapped in a bright white sheet being driven through the MASH unit while in the foreground a group of doctors play cards, pausing only momentarily to glance at the sight. The message is clear. This casual framing approach that in a sense brings the story back to where we started tells us that there is an organizing principle to the lunacy and madness, and that principle is death.'MASH' feels more like an adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel 'Catch-22' than the Mike Nichols film that was actually based on the book, which ironically came out the same year as 'MASH.' And I have to say that, unlike many other films that lose their lustre after many years and many viewings, 'MASH' gets funnier every time I see it. I think there are better Altman films, and more important ones, but few are are such damn fun.Grade: A",8,0,2,8 March 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," One More Violent Christ Fable
","Every so often I have that uncomfortable, squirmy feeling I'm sure all moviegoers do, when you're sitting in the theatre watching a movie that critics and audiences alike have hailed as a masterpiece, and you're not enjoying it all. That was me during 'Pan's Labyrinth.' My only reaction after coming out of this grueling, depressing Christ fable was: 'Did I see the same movie everyone else did?' Critics are likely responding to director Guillermo del Toro's fierce originality of vision, and indeed that is this film's most impressive asset. But the originality is wasted on a lame story capped by a lamer message, that essentially goes something like this: Don't worry if the life you're currently living brings you nothing but pain and misery -- all of that pain and misery will make you eligible for eternal happiness in Heaven. If you get cozy fuzzy feelings from canned religious homilies like this, then please, go watch this film and enjoy. But for one who doesn't believe in Heaven, and who would rather see films that offer practical messages of hope and salvation for our current troubled world, I felt gypped that in the end this movie had nothing better than that to say.I don't need movies to tell me that the world can be a cruel and uncaring place to live. And a movie certainly need not go back to 1944 Spain to offer up examples of that cruelty. But if it's going to address a problem, it should at least be part of the solution, and give me something I can use. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is bold in suggesting that a child's fantasy world may be no match for the harsh realities in which she is living -- in an industry that exists to sell us fantasy through which we can escape the real world, del Toro takes quite a gamble to give us this product that tells us just the opposite. But all of that boldness does nothing more than lead one to a Sunday school lesson that may just be the biggest fantasy of them all.There's very little fantasy in this film, actually, much less than the trailers would have you believe. A majority of the film is devoted to the sadistic actions of a military captain serving Franco's regime, and we get to see him smash a peasant's face with a wine bottle until it caves in, shoot numerous people in the head and other parts of the body, torture one man with all manner of carpenter's tools. At one point, we get to see him stitch up a knife slice in his face in graphic close up detail. Those of us with less of a lust for blood may wonder if the more graphic scenes are truly necessary. Defenders of them will say yes, and that the horrors of this film's reality must be made clear if the juxtaposition of the main character's retreats into fantasy are to be effective. But I say that there is a difference between using violence graphically and using it effectively, and that the most graphic moments in this film do nothing but cheapen the overall effect.And by the way, what is it with religious people and movies? Why does every religiously-themed film that anyone wants to see have to be dripping in sadism? What exactly do they teach you in those churches anyway? This is a really grim film folks, completely lacking in any kind of wit. Guillermo del Toro obviously has imagination to spare, but it's not the kind of imagination I want to be spending any more time with any time soon.Grade: C",5,10,27,2 January 2007
Knocked Up," A Comedy Classic? Not Quite....
","As with 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin,' I thought 'Knocked Up' was funny and a I had a good time with it, but it didn't warrant the rapturous response it has received from critics, or the inexplicably high rating it has received here at IMDb.Frankly, the joke about adult men refusing to grow up has worn thin, and not much more comic mileage can be squeezed from it. Also, it's a shame that a movie people are congratulating for its frankness and candidness doesn't have the balls to treat pregnancy the way it really is. It would have been nice in a movie about the beautiful act of bringing a child into the world for the filmmakers to extend that idea of beauty to the woman's body in pregnancy, but instead we have a gorgeous actress who never once convincingly looks, moves or acts like a pregnant woman, and who even looks gorgeous while she's in the middle of delivery no less.But, when you consider the typical Hollywood comedy being churned out these days, many of which I saw previews for when I went to see this film, you can understand why a movie like this, that has sharp acting and writing, and whose laughs come from well-delivered lines and good timing rather than juvenile pratfalls and fart jokes, is blowing like a fresh breeze through our summer movie theatres.Grade: B",7,3,9,11 June 2007
Alien," In Space, No One Can See You Wet Your Pants
","The film that can reduce grown men to tears, this movie scared the crap out of me the first time I saw it and still does. While its immediate sequel, James Cameron's 'Aliens' (1986) is very good too, it's really more harrowing than frightening. Ridley Scott's original is just plain creepy as hell. It's rare to find a film more atmospheric than this one. Though I don't know what it's like to be on a space crew on board a big-ass ship in the middle of the universe, somehow I think it would be just like this. And it doesn't get more unsettling than the scene where the crew heads out to investigate a distress signal and come across the empty remains of a giant ship with a big batch of eggs growing on the floor. Need I say more? Despite the notorious reputation of John Hurt's dinner scene, the film isn't that gory. If there's anyone left on the planet who doesn't know what I'm talking about, I won't ruin it. But let's just say the next time you're at a dinner party and someone begins retching violently while his stomach starts bubbling, clear away the dishes and grab a blunt object. But other than that, the scares are primarily psychological. Filmed before the days when CGI could do everything for film makers, the visual effects team here knew if they showed too much of the alien, it would just look cheesy. Therefore, the audience never sees much more of it than brief glimpses, and our dread builds with the dread of the crew, because we don't know what we're dealing with anymore than they do. The same serendipity made 'Jaws' a classic of suspense four years earlier.And of course, the acting in this film is leaps and bounds above what you usually see in horror movies. Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm are great fun to watch as they match up in one battle of the will after another. John Hurt made a believer out of me. And Scott uses Tom Skerritt as effectively as Hitchcock did Janet Leigh in 'Psycho.' 'Alien' really feels like a movie where absolutely anything could happen. I haven't really liked much of anything else Ridley Scott's done (and that includes 'Blade Runner'), but this movie at least proves he's got it in him to make a great film, even if he doesn't use that talent very often.Grade: A",9,1,2,30 September 2005
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Swing Your Razor Wide, Sweeney
","'Sweeney Todd,' Tim Burton's big-screen adaptation of the classic Stephen Sondheim musical, was faced with the nearly impossible task of meeting the expectations of both Burton and Sondheim fans alike. So if it falls a little short, I'm willing to forgive and forget. I think Burton made probably the best film that could be made from Sondheim's musical, but his movie also confirmed something I already suspected: 'Sweeney Todd' is inherently theatrical, and though Burton mostly succeeds in reinventing the musical as a film, he doesn't totally succeed in justifying the necessity of doing so.I felt during 'Sweeney Todd' the way I so often feel watching screen versions of stage musicals: the medium of film only serves to highlight the weaknesses of stage shows. Things simply work on stage that don't work on screen and vice versa, and that's the case here. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Sweeney Todd' the movie, but I've enjoyed live performances of the show much more, and despite all of my efforts to forget the stage productions while watching the movie, I couldn't help but compare the two.But let's talk about the movie. It's a deliciously macabre and dark story, and Burton deserves great credit for resisting the urge to make it more palatable to mainstream film audiences. Indeed, his interpretation of the tale is darker and bloodier than any stage version I've seen, and the film's final moments left me chilled and disturbed. Johnny Depp plays Sweeney, a vengeful barber who declares war on humanity for the wrongs he has suffered at the hands of a malicious judge and beadle. Helena Bonham Carter plays Mrs. Lovett, whose meat pie business becomes revitalized when she starts using Sweeney's victims as, ahem, ingredients. Carter and Depp have tremendous chemistry together, maybe because they look so much alike. Depp does a good job with Sweeney, but he's limited from the start because Sweeney is a one-dimensional character. Depp delivers an intense and frightening performance, but aside from the interest inherent in whether or not he'll be able to pull off Sondheim's notoriously difficult music (which he does just fine, thank you very much), I didn't find the performance itself that interesting. Carter, however, if a weaker singer than Depp, does wonders with Mrs. Lovett. This is the first version of 'Sweeney Todd' I've seen where I actually felt bad about what happens to her character. Carter balances the role beautifully between ruthless accomplice and maternal caretaker. She doesn't play the role big and blowsy like Angela Lansbury did in the original stage version, or like Patti LuPone has played it, and she'll probably be criticized for taking too meek an approach to the material as a result, but I think her's works wonderfully as a film interpretation of the role.Sondheim's score sounds glorious, but I was disappointed at the many cuts made to it. A few songs are missing altogether, and there's hardly one left that isn't at least shortened. My one bit of unqualified praise goes to the film's visual style, which is magnificent. The production design couldn't be improved upon.'Sweeney Todd' might get better with subsequent viewings, once the automatic screen-to-stage comparison is flushed out of the system and one can watch the movie for what it is. As it is, I liked the movie a lot without thinking it was one of the best of the year.Grade: A-",8,2,4,27 December 2007
Horrible Bosses," Stop the Presses! A Funny Comedy for Adults
","Those who think Hollywood is no longer capable of creating a funny comedy for adults need not worry, as 'Horrible Bosses' is proof that that increasingly rare phenomenon can still happen.'Horrible Bosses' is one of those comedies like the classic 'Ruthless People,' in which an outrageous and dark premise works because of good writing and an ensemble that knows exactly how to handle the material for maximum comedic value. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day play the requisite straight man, alpha male and dumbass, respectively, that male buddy comedies need, while Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell (sadly underused) play the titular bosses. All of them have a field day with their roles, and Aniston especially stands out because of the film's decision to cast her against type as a slutty, foul-mouthed sex kitten; you can almost hear Aniston sighing with relief as she gets to play something other than the cute-as-a-button girl next door.As with most comedies, whether or not you think 'Horrible Bosses' is funny will probably depend simply on whether or not you think the actors are funny. Charlie Day, for example, will likely drive some people crazy -- I thought he was hilarious.Grade: A",8,67,100,21 December 2011
The Best Years of Our Lives," Unbelievably Honest Movie for Its Time
","It's been a long time since I've seen 'The Best Years of Our Lives,' and I'm sure I was way too young when I did see it to fully appreciate it, but even then I could tell it wasn't quite like other old black and white movies I was used to.This film came out during a period in which Hollywood was interested in producing socially conscious message movies. 'The Lost Weekend' addressed alcoholism; 'Spellbound' addressed psychotherapy; 'Mildred Pierce' addressed the impact WWII had on the women left behind; 'Gentlemen's Agreement' addressed anti-Semitism. But these other films were heavy-handed, steeped highly in melodrama, and they seem laughable today, despite their good intentions. 'The Best Years of Our Lives' is different. It's a highly sensitive and understated look at what happened to men when they returned from WWII and tried to acclimate themselves back into the world they left. And remember that this came out not ten years after the end of the war, when historical perspective could safely remove the sting. This came out one year after the war's end! How often does a film, especially from back then, directly address a social concern while it's actually happening.This movie follows three men and their stories. We see Fredric March return to the bank at which he formerly held an executive position, forced to take a menial, secretarial job well below his skills. The pettiness of the civilian world is brought home to him when he gets into an argument with a supervisor over office supplies. We see Dana Andrews return to a wife that he doesn't know anymore, and who doesn't know him. Other war stories show men and their loves pining for one another while they're separated, faithfully awaiting the time when they can be together again. They don't mention that perhaps the strain on the relationship can cause people to fall out of love. And in the film's most uncomfortable storyline, we see a man who has lost both arms trying to deal with being handicapped in a society in which people with handicaps are viewed as second-class citizens. Much has been made of the fact that Harold Russell (who won both a special Oscar and the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role) was not a professional actor, and was handicapped in real life. It's really amazing to think how brave this movie was in speaking frankly about one topic after another that until that time had remained unspeakable.This movie definitely deserves a second look from me, and a first look from anyone who hasn't seen yet seen it at all.Grade: A+",10,4,5,30 March 2006
The Town," Accomplished, But Also Slow and Talky
","'The Town' showcases Ben Affleck's potential as a director, but it also highlights the qualities about his style that have so far prevented that potential from fully blossoming.Set in the dreariest, gloomiest parts of Boston, much like his directorial debut 'Gone, Baby Gone,' 'The Town' is a moody character study disguised as a heist film. The authentic feel and raw edges Affleck brings to his story go a long way toward masking the fact that it's full of pure movie cliché. A sensitive criminal (played by Affleck himself) becomes conflicted and dreams of starting a new life once he begins to receive the love of a good woman (Rebecca Hall, lovely as always but stuck with a somewhat thankless role). Affleck seems to have gone to the Clint Eastwood school of filmmaking, where everything -- both in the actual physical production and its tone -- must be gray and drab and ponderously 'important.' It's a slow and talky movie, and I found myself wishing Affleck would just get on with things already. I didn't dislike it, but I did find that my opinion of it began to gradually sink after I'd let the memory of it settle in my mind for a few days after watching it.Affleck clearly wants to be taken seriously as a Filmmaker with a capital 'F,' but he needs to remember that the best filmmakers manage to make movies that are both important and entertaining.Grade: B",7,1,2,20 January 2011
Closer," What Originated on Stage Should Have Remained on Stage
","In movie form, 'Closer' ended up being a bit of a turkey, but if nothing else it had the most attractive cast of 2004.Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman take the reins of this four-hander about relationships and the nastiness they can bring out in those involved. It's a fairly grueling, unpleasant exercise -- none of the characters is especially likable or even sympathetic, so it's hard to muster up any energy to care about them and their relatively insignificant problems. On stage this probably worked, but in a movie, restricting the point of view to four people doesn't make a lot of sense in context. If they're so miserable with each other, can't they branch out and date any number of the millions of other people living in New York? Still, the acting is pretty impressive, especially from Clive Owen, as a truly vile character, and Natalie Portman, sexy and enigmatic.Grade: C+",6,0,5,3 September 2010
Elf," A Modern Holiday Classic
","Will Ferrell has escaped the curse of most SNL veterans who try to transition to major motion pictures (at least those who have tried to make the jump in recent years) and manages to produce the most consistently funny films of probably any of them (including Mike Myers).'Elf' is destined to be a holiday classic, one of those you watch every year around the holiday season. Ferrell, a human baby adopted by elves (some scenes of him with his elf dad, played in a dead pan performance by Bob Newhart, provide the film with some of its funniest sight gags), goes off in search of his real father, a search that takes him to NYC. The joke of course is that Ferrell, wandering around the streets of New York in his elf costume and eating gum off of subway station railings, doesn't seem out of the ordinary in a place like NY, where people are used to crazies, and where every department store has a troupe of workers dressed as elves anyway.He finds his dad (played by James Caan), falls in love (with Zooey Deschanel) and helps save Christmas when Santa's sleigh malfunctions due to a lack of Christmas spirit. It's all very funny and harmless, with a sense of humour that manages to satisfy both those who like their Christmas cheer served warm and those sarcastic cynics (like me) who watch 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' and root for the Grinch.Favorite line, delivered when Ferrell gets a job in the mail room of a children's book publishing house: 'This reminds me of the North Pole, except that it smells like mushrooms and everyone looks like they want to hurt me.'

Taxi Driver," One Man's Terrifying Vengeance
","A perfect film.Martin Scorsese displays complete mastery over his medium in this deeply disturbing 1976 masterpiece, and to my mind hasn't yet made another movie as good as this one (no, not even 'Raging Bull').In 'Taxi Driver,' Robert De Niro plays Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who drives a cab for a living. Isolated and lonely, Travis prowls the hellish streets of New York's worst neighborhoods, willing to drive customers anywhere they want to go, quietly nurturing vague fantasies of vengeance on what he perceives to be a sick culture. The whole movie is a nightmarish fever dream. I've never seen anyone capture visually what on the page would be stream of consciousness narration as well as Scorsese does here. And De Niro gives the performance of his, or anybody else's, career. His Travis is a fascinating creation, and one of the most frightening screen characters in the history of cinema. No one could keep me up nights quite like the seemingly ordinary Joe who's ready to snap at any moment and feels that his grisly duty is handed down to him from on high.Cybill Shepherd plays Travis's nominal love interest with just the right amount of vapidity, and Jodie Foster, in a small, sweet and wonderful performance, plays Iris, the thirteen-year-old prostitute who becomes the object Travis sets out to save from the rotten world that has turned him into what he is. And the late Peter Boyle has a couple of beautiful moments as Travis's fellow cab driver, who tries to give him some counsel but is so obviously out of his league.Shortly after 'Taxi Driver' hit screens, Vietnam turned into a subject that film makers felt comfortable addressing directly ('Coming Home,' 'Apocalypse Now,' 'The Deer Hunter'). But none of these, though so much more actually ABOUT Vietnam, addressed half as well as 'Taxi Driver' the toll that that conflict took on the men it sent back home.Grade: A+",10,1,2,28 August 2007
Shutter Island," Despite Its Pedigree, 'Shutter Island' Feels Awfully Ordinary
","Martin Scorsese's Gothic thriller works overtime to wring chills from its creepy setting (an institution for the criminally insane) and mysterious plot twists. But despite, or maybe because of, all of the obvious and heavy-handed directorial flourishes (moody film noir lighting, constant rain and thunder, a screechy score that announces every emotion you should be feeling before you're allowed to feel it), the film is surprisingly unengaging and, even more surprisingly given its stylish director, fairly pedestrian.Leonardo DiCaprio plays a federal marshal who travels with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) to the eponymous island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate. They butt up against uncooperative administrators (Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow) and uncover a possible conspiracy that involves inmates being used in mind-control experiments similar to the ones inflicted by the Nazis on concentration-camp Jews. Throughout, we're treated to dream-like flashbacks in which we learn things about DiCaprio's past and help us understand the personal vendettas driving his behavior. Everything builds to a surprise plot twist that's meant no doubt to make us question everything we've watched up to that point in the film but which frankly didn't come as that much of a surprise.The film is chock-full of recognizable faces in brief cameos: Michelle Williams, Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine and most notably Patricia Clarkson. But despite the film's high production values and A-list cast, it's hard to believe that someone as talented and capable as Martin Scorsese made this. It's not a bad movie, but it's an awfully mediocre one. There's a reason a film by such a high-profile director was dumped in theatres in the dead of winter.Grade: B",6,4,8,28 July 2010
Capote," Highly Intelligent Look Into the Mind of an Artist
","The recent onslaught of bland, paint-by-number Hollywood biopics may leave you completely disinterested in seeing 'Capote,' the new film about eccentric author Truman Capote, directed by Bennett Miller and starring the chameleon Philip Seymour Hoffman. I hope you will reconsider if that is the case. 'Capote' is not a biopic in the style of last year's overrated 'Ray'---show childhood of celebrity (ideally working in some liberal doses of strife or abuse if possible), show scrappy rise of celebrity from modest beginnings, show celebrity reach peak status, show celebrity self-destruct (usually due to drugs and/or alcohol), show celebrity hit rock-bottom, show celebrity seek peace and affirmation, and end on fuzzy, heart-warming scene in which celebrity is honored with a standing ovation as the soundtrack music swells. 'Capote' is not that kind of film. In fact, 'Capote' is not really about the life of Truman Capote, but rather is about the chain of events that led to Capote writing the book for which he is best known, 'In Cold Blood.' This is perhaps the most intelligent film I've ever seen about the relationship between an artist/journalist and the subject about which he is writing. The movie asks: how morally responsible is a writer for his subject? As depicted in this film, Capote becomes fascinated by a brutal crime in a tiny Kansas town, in which two men brutally murdered an entire family because they thought a large amount of money was hidden in the house. As he spends a great deal of time with one of the men (Perry Smith) and begins to piece together his story, he becomes personally interested in helping him fight his case; eventually, however, Capote's desire to write a work of art overrides the personal interest he's taken in Perry Smith, and he leaves the prisoner clinging to a false hope that Capote is bringing the 'true' story (that is, the story of the men's innocence, though they're not innocent) to the world.Miller's film is unflinching in its portrayal of Capote as a selfish artist who plays with the lives of his creations; it's as if he's become so used to writing fiction that he forgets he is telling the story of real people, and moreover real people who trust him to have their best interests at heart. Hoffman has been great in just about every movie he's appeared in, so it was no surprise to me that he would be great here as well. His performance is more than a mere impersonation. He is so good at showing the audience the two sides of Capote: the endearing, lovable side that make people want to trust him; and the cold, manipulative side that takes over when he becomes Capote the artist. It's to Hoffman's credit that you don't leave the film necessarily despising Capote for his actions, but neither do you feel like you've just participated in a two-hour session of hero worship.Catherine Keener drabs down to play novelist Harper Lee; Clifton Collins, Jr. is soft and articulate as Perry Smith, which makes his final confession of the murders all the more chilling; and Chris Cooper adds another fine character performance to his list of character performances as head of the Holcomb, Kansas police department, leading the investigation.My only problem with the film is its monotonous pacing. I feel like the film makers wanted so hard to avoid any of the artificial traditional Hollywood trappings that they felt any burst of energy or activity would be betraying the film's realism.'Capote' is a fine addition to the genre of films committed to exploring the motivations that drive artists, and Hoffman may finally get his due from the mainstream establishment for his award-worthy performance.Grade: A-",8,0,3,31 October 2005
Life of Pi," Made Me Wish I Could Believe in God
","I read 'Life of Pi' years ago and remembered little of the details about the book other than that I enjoyed it. During the first half hour or so of Ang Lee's screen adaptation, I felt myself getting bored and restless. It seemed like a religious movie, a movie whose central premise was all about reaffirming a belief in God. As a non-believer, I don't begrudge films with religious themes, but I also don't really enjoy them, feeling like someone invited to a party where everyone else is speaking a different language.But then the main thrust of the story kicks in, the young boy Pi is stranded in the middle of the ocean with a lifeboat and a tiger, and I was engrossed by the beauty and spectacle that Ang Lee delivers. And then toward the end, there's a twist that I instantly remembered from the book as soon as it happens in the film, and that I can't believe I had forgotten. For that twist is what makes this film something beautiful and much more than a simple story about faith in a higher power. Instead, it becomes a story that gets much closer to the motives behind what I think drives most people to religious faith, and that is that believing in God is way more comforting than the alternative. Some people seem to be able to choose to believe, while others (like myself) simply can't, no matter how much more appealing life seems with a strong belief in a higher power. People will argue probably forever over this film's ending and what it means, but that's what it meant for me.Ang Lee needs to be commended. This film had to be a very difficult directing feat to pull off, confined as it is almost entirely to a lifeboat and a slew of CGI effects.A truly wondrous and wonderful film.Grade: A",9,12,20,15 February 2013
Lost in Translation," Sofia Coppola's Dad Taught Her a Little Something About Directing
","O.k. so maybe Sofia Coppola can't act, but the girl sure can write and direct.'Lost in Translation' is her sweet, melancholy story about two strangers at very different points in their lives (Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson) who nevertheless form a deep connection brought about by the culture shock both keenly feel while adrift in Tokyo. There's no ick factor here due to the age difference, because Coppola's screenplay does not fall into the cliché of having this be a romantic adventure. Instead, it's about two different people who find a friend in an unlikely place just at the point in their lives when they both desperately need one.Murray's trademark hangdog humor is put to perfect use, while Johansson gave us an early indication of her acting chops.Grade: A+",10,2,4,26 August 2010
Barry Lyndon," Like Stepping Into a Classical Painting
","I'm reading Thackeray's 'Vanity Fair' even as I write this comment, and what strikes me about 'Barry Lyndon' now that I've read something by the author who wrote it is how much the film recreates the experience of reading Thackeray. 'Vanity Fair' is nearly 700 pages of nothing much happening, yet it's all fascinating. That's 'Barry Lyndon.' Ryan O'Neal plays the eponymous protagonist, and Marisa Berenson his beleaguered wife in this costume drama that follows the exploits of our dear rogue Lyndon from young manhood to weary middle age. And that's really it for lead characters. Neither O'Neal nor Berenson registers much, but no matter. The true stars here are the film's magnificent and jaw-dropping production design, followed closely by its score, which, like in other Kubrick films, incorporates previously existing classical compositions that are perfectly matched with the material. Every shot in this film looks like a painting, which was Kubrick's intention and why he used such a square aspect ratio. The meticulous details of 18th Century court life make this movie endlessly fascinating, even if many viewers have complained that it's emotionally distant (a criticism that could apply to more than one Kubrick film).I loved 'Barry Lyndon' the first time I watched it, thought it was hollow and lacking the second time I watched it, and then went back to thinking it a masterpiece the third time I watched it. Let's see how I feel after a fourth viewing. As for now, it's my third impression that sticks.Grade: A",9,7,13,8 August 2007
Interstellar," Is Christopher Nolan Ever Going to Make Another Good Movie?
","OK, time for me to turn in my Christopher Nolan card.Ever since 'Memento,' I've been waiting for Christopher Nolan to make another film that isn't a big hot mess, and it seems I will be waiting forever. He comes up with terrific conceits that clearly make sense to him, but he simply cannot translate them to the screen and make them intelligible to anyone else. 'Interstellar' is his latest load of hooey, nearly three hours of sci-fi mumbo jumbo queasily married to a sentimental father/daughter drama. It goes on forever and includes all manner of tangents that a more concise writer or editor (anybody, please!) would have excised. Indeed, Nolan's biggest failing as a writer/director is that he can't seem to get his thoughts organized, and every movie he makes feels like a rough draft that no one ever got around to assembling into a coherent narrative. To give him credit, 'Interstellar' isn't anywhere nearly as incoherent as 'The Prestige' or 'Inception,' and it's not as leadenly humorless and self-important as 'The Dark Knight,' but it's just as exasperating as all of those other movies in its tendency to start with a good concept that it then buries under a heap of directorial self indulgence.I learned a long time ago to simply stop going to see Oliver Stone or Spike Lee movies when I realized that neither was ever going to make a good movie, and I guess I now have to add Nolan to that dubious list.Grade: C",5,8,17,3 December 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick Takes Us Through Boot Camp
","Stanley Kubrick jumped on the Vietnam band wagon that was raging in the mid-1980s and delivered this schizophrenic movie. The first half is about the brainwashing of a platoon of draftees during boot camp led by perhaps the most memorable screen drill sergeant in history; the second half follows this platoon as they head off into the war. The first half is fascinating and feels distinctly like a Kubrick film; the second half feels like a hundred other combat films.The biggest problem with 'Full Metal Jacket' is that it was made too late. By the time Kubrick got around to this, Francis Ford Coppola had long since given us 'Apocalypse Now' and Michael Cimino 'The Deer Hunter.' Those two movies alone contain so much iconic imagery about Vietnam (Coppola's especially), that no Vietnam film since has shown us something we haven't seen before. That's why the first half of Kubrick's film is so good -- it portrays a part of the war that frequently gets left out, the deliberate dehumanization that begins while recruits are still safely on American soil. The film deflates after the boot camp sequences and never totally recovers.But still, this IS a Kubrick film after all, and it's still very good, despite its flaws. It's certainly way better than the Vietnam film from the 80s that everyone remembers most, Oliver Stone's 'Platoon'.Grade: B+",Null,0,5,20 June 2008
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A Troubled Movie for Our Troubled Times
","The night before I saw 'Three Billboards...', my wife and I were talking about how surprised we are that, with all of the hot button issues swirling around America's cultural conversation right now, very few of them are being addressed in movies. Then I watched Martin McDonagh's (who ironically isn't even American) angry, sad, and haunting film and feel like it, along with 'Get Out,' also released this year, will be remembered as a film that captured a specific cultural moment better than many others playing in theaters at the same time.'Three Billboards...' is I think a movie whose sum is better than any of its parts. It's problematic, primarily in the uneasy tone McDonagh tries only fitfully successfully to create. It feels too often like someone trying to impersonate the Coen brothers but not quite getting it. Early attempts at dark humor fall flat, and eventually the screenplay just gives up trying to be funny altogether, and that's when the movie is at its best. McDonagh also suffers from a lack of discipline, and issues are addressed, like black distrust of the police or religious hypocrisy, that don't feel completely integrated into the movie's themes. But overall this didn't bother me as much as it might otherwise have, because more than anything this movie is about that undefined anger that seems to be pervading our culture right now and makes its target whatever happens to be in front of us in the moment. The two main characters in this film are overcome with a sense of helpless rage, much of it legitimate and targeted, some of it not, and both are faced with the same decision -- do they continue to feed it, or do they let it go? The way they and the movie answer that question is disturbing in a way that sneaks up on you and gets in your head. I realized days later that I was still thinking about this movie.Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson are excellent. Sam Rockwell is good with what he's given to do, but one wishes his character had been better written. As it is he's a caricature up to a point, and then he does a complete turnabout that comes out of thin air and feels like a case of satisfying character development being sacrificed for the sake of plot mechanics.Like 'Get Out,' time will tell how well 'Three Billboards...' holds up, but for now it's one of the few movies that has its finger on the pulse of what's happening to America, and that's enough.Grade: A",8,2,5,13 December 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," Not the Book, But Beautiful in Its Own Right
","It's difficult on a first viewing of 'The Grapes of Wrath' not to be somewhat disappointed with it. So much of Steinbeck's beautiful novel is left out of the film, and it's hard to see his story and characters wedged into the 'gee whizz' style of film-making so prevalent at the time. But once you get beyond a comparison of the movie to the book, you begin to realize that John Ford created a beautiful piece of work of his own, and the film inspires a great deal of admiration, and deserves credit for its gutsiness at tackling a story that wouldn't have gone down smoothly with film executives at the time.Of course the most controversial parts of the book are left out (like its final image, for example), but Ford still managed to work around the constraints forced upon him to fashion a hard-biting film. Henry Fonda is perfect casting for Tom Joad--never have his otherworldly eyes been used to greater effect. And Jane Darwell is pitch-perfect as Ma Joad--she captures the tough-as-nails dignity that the character has in the novel. The whole movie is lit by expert cinematographer Gregg Toland, who uses shadow and reflection to cast a ghostly pall over everything. Indeed, much of what Ford wasn't able to include in the film as words he communicates instead through images, and isn't that what a good book-to-film adaptation should do? One of those films that feels ahead of its time.Grade: A",9,63,74,10 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Whole Third Trilogy is Recycled Dud
","As soon as it was revealed that Rey is the granddaughter of Palpatine, and that Palpatine somehow still lives(!!???), I was officially done with this trilogy.Come on, how much can one story possible recycle from another? J.J. Abrams couldn't come up with anything as good as George Lucas's original story and characters, so he just borrows and mixes enough to try to fool us into thinking we're getting sequels rather than reboots, but he fails. Rian Johnson tried to take the story in some new and potentially interesting directions (though 'The Last Jedi' had plenty of flaws in its own right), but all of them are thrown out the window in 'Rise of Skywalker.' It's like the second installment never even happened. The only moments that roused me from my theater seat were those that referenced the original trilogy.Worst of all, 'The Rise of Skywalker' undermines even the modest joys to be had from 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi,' because now we see the story in its entirety and are aware of how flimsy it all is. It's painfully obvious that this trilogy's story was made up as it went along and not conceived as a cohesive whole. That's what made the first trilogy so good, and even the second trilogy, dorky as it is, has a fantastic and well mapped story to tell. This is just Disney throwing spaghetti at a wall to see what sticks and hoping that 'Star Wars' fans are so loyal to the franchise that they'll throw their money at any garbage as long as the 'Star Wars' logo is attached to it.Grade: C",5,101,180,6 January 2020
Pacific Rim," What a Piece of Junk
","'Pacific Rim' is a simply terrible piece of summer movie junk food from a director I expected much more from.In a plot that really isn't that much like 'Avatar' yet managed to feel like a rip-off of it, humans have waged war on a bunch of big monsters from the deep by building giant robots and controlling them with their minds. For the robots to work, they need to be piloted by two people, and it's important that those two people are as psychically linked as possible in order to be effective. Guillermo Del Toro, who made one of my favorite action movies ever ('Hellboy II'), could, I thought, be trusted to bring just the right blend of style, comedy and characterization to make this film rise above the summer fray. But this movie is lacking in all three, instead substituting thunderous sound and visual effects, apparently in an attempt to numb its audience into submission so that we no longer care whether or not what we're watching makes any sense.I felt the same way watching this movie as I did watching last year's 'Prometheus.' It's like Del Toro conceived this elaborate story in his head and then made only the second half of it into a movie. The feeling is not unlike coming into the second of a two-part miniseries, where you know what you're watching would make a lot more sense if you had seen it from the beginning.Grade: D",3,5,12,19 August 2013
American Sniper," Combat Film or Domestic Drama? Please Pick One, Mr. Eastwood
","People are seeing what they want to see in 'American Sniper' without paying a lot of attention to what Clint Eastwood is actually saying.There's been a liberal firestorm leveled at the film for its pro- military, pro-killer attitudes, to which I say: Have these people actually seen the movie?I identify as liberal myself and have aimed more than my fair share of criticism at our military and the things it's used for. But anyone who thinks 'American Sniper's' final message is pro-military is unfairly biased and isn't watching the film with an open mind. In Bradley Cooper's character, the film portrays the kinds of guys I think the military is probably full of -- guys who join up for noble ideals, are genuinely proud of America and their role in protecting it, think that's what they'll get a chance to do once they're in the military, and then are asked to do things that they can't mentally and emotionally handle. The film doesn't make a villain out of Cooper for being such a good and deadly sniper, which people seem to take exception to, thinking wrongly that if the film doesn't turn him into a villain, then it must intend him to be a hero. But I think the movie just feels bad for Cooper more than anything. He's just a decent guy who has a job and does it well, but the job he's asked to do is horrifying and something the average American can't even comprehend.As for the movie itself, I didn't like it very much, but not for the reasons everyone else seems to have for disliking it. I felt that Eastwood wasn't sure whether he wanted to make a domestic drama or a straight-up combat film. Combat mostly wins out, with the domestic part, which should have been most interesting, feeling like a somewhat obligatory add-on, full of clichés and standard melodrama. Sienna Miller, as Cooper's wife, is a fine actress, but she's stuck with a thankless and boring role. Cooper is very good, but the movie's emphasis on combat over character development limits how effective he, or anyone else given the same role, could be.Mostly, I came out of 'American Sniper' thinking: 'That was no 'Hurt Locker'.'Grade: B",6,4,13,1 February 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," As Glossy as a Magazine, and About as Substantive
","A slick entertainment with a plot someone phoned in and a fairy tale ending in which every conceivable loose end is tied up as neatly and happily as your average network sitcom. I had a lot of fun with the movie, but my expectations were low and would have been sorely disappointed if they'd been any higher. The key to any movie like this is: 'Know what you're getting.' Meryl Streep of course gets all of the praise for this film, and indeed she is a riot. She resists the temptation to play the role of Miranda Priestley as a gross caricature, and instead decides to play her as a real person, which gives the movie dimensions it wouldn't have had otherwise. The character of Miranda would have been too unbearable to be fun if someone else had played her, but Streep knows how to deliver a nasty line while letting us know she's in on the joke, and her character is by far the best thing about the movie.Stanley Tucci, that unsung character actor, is also terrific as Nigel, Anne Hathaway's Henry Higgins. Is there anything this guy can't do?'The Devil Wears Prada' sends an obligatory message about staying true to yourself and your priorities in life, a message the film itself undermines by making the world within the fashion magazine office seem more interesting and glamorous than anything going on outside of it.Grade: B+",7,1,2,5 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Blows 'Phantom Menace' Out of the Water -- Though That's Pretty Faint Praise
","This second installment in the 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy is leaps and bounds better than 'The Phantom Menace,' and there are moments in the film, unlike 'Phantom,' when it begins to FEEL like a 'Star Wars' movie.The little kid Disneyland quality that figured heavily in the first film for the most part gives way to a darker and more adult sensibility as Anakin grows into a young man. It doesn't help matters that Hayden Christiansen delivers a God-awful performance as Anakin, and that he plays a gradual descent into the dark side of the force like a petulant teenager who's been denied use of the family car. But more pieces of the puzzle that factor into the original trilogy click into place here, which makes it much more fun for 'Star Wars' fans than 'The Phantom Menace.' I have to admit that the end of this film, when we first see what will become the Imperial army amassed as the Darth Vader theme blasts away on the soundtrack, sends chills down this 'Star Wars' nerd's spine.Grade: B+",7,1,3,26 September 2006
Corpse Bride," More Creepy Fun from Tim Burton
","'Corpse Bride' is probably not quite as good as Burton's previous stop-motion masterpiece 'The Nightmare Before Christmas,' but that would be a tough act for anyone to follow (though actually, he didn't direct 'Nightmare' himself, so it's not really a direct comparison). 'Bride' has the same phantasmagorical look, the same delightful attention to detail, and the same sense of morbid fun that the earlier movie has. It's got a few Danny Elfman songs that sound very much like the ones he composed for 'Nightmare' and are probably the film's biggest weakness. But the voice-overs are terrific and the whole thing is thoroughly enjoyable.Grade: A-",8,5,10,26 September 2005
Lion," The Tribulations of a Privileged Dude Who Doesn't Actually Have Any Problems
","Am I the only one who wanted to punch Dev Patel in the face while watching this film? He plays Saroo Brierley, a young Indian man who was separated from his family when he was a little boy, funneled into the Indian orphan system, and adopted by a loving Australian couple. He longs to return to India to see his birth family again, but is torn between wanting to reconnect with his roots and remaining loyal to the people who raised him.The first half of 'Lion' is the film at its best, thanks to the winningly adorable Sunny Pawar, who plays Saroo as a little boy. But once Saroo ages into Patel, the film turns into a saggy, interminable series of scenes in which Patel mopes, lashes out at everyone who's nice to him, and spends every night staring at Google Earth while taking no action whatsoever. What his actual dilemma is is never made clear by the screenplay or Patel's performance. I stated above that he's torn between two cultures, but I'm only conjecturing about that, since that's not shown in the movie. Instead we watch a privileged man surrounded by supportive people whining about how he wants to return to India while we watch him and want to scream at him, 'Then get off your ass and just visit India already!!' Patel was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, but he didn't deserve to be. Nicole Kidman, who plays his adoptive mother, was much more deserving of her Best Supporting Actress nomination. The film also nabbed nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score, but won nothing.Grade: B-",5,25,60,21 March 2017
Romeo + Juliet," Baz Luhrmann, What Have Ye Wrought?
","Horrendous version of the Shakespeare tragedy directed by horrendous hack Baz Luhrmann, up there with Joel Schumacher and Danny Boyle among my five least favorite directors of all time.This is 'Romeo and Juliet' for the MTV generation, the movie equivalent of a shark, afraid that if it slows down for even a moment it will die. Luhrmann throws a bunch of images up on the screen and maintains a relentlessly ferocious pace, hoping we'll be too distracted to notice the horrible acting and the fact that our young leads don't understand the lines they're speaking. Well, that might work on teenage girls, who are probably the demographic most likely to admire this film, but I can't vouch for anyone else.Baz Luhrmann must be stopped at all costs. Why doesn't anyone else understand that??!!! Grade: F",1,3,6,17 June 2009
Forrest Gump," The Ultimate Fad Movie
","'Forrest Gump' is the ultimate fad movie. It came out big in 1994 and created a cultural sensation. It was easy to get swept up in its panorama of American cultural history, and all of the iconic imagery in the film made it seem like it was saying something important. But all these years later, this treacly piece of rubbish is nearly intolerable.The film is full of easy sentiment and false emotion. It depicts one thing after another (the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, Watergate, the AIDS crisis) that trigger automatic emotional responses in the audience, so that the filmmakers don't have to do any work of their own to make the material effective. But underneath the lesson in American history and the admittedly terrific soundtrack, I can't help but wonder what point the movie tries to make. Are we to applaud Forrest for his pluck and resiliency when the only reason for them is the fact that he's too simple minded to understand the things that happen to him? Are we supposed to emulate him? Is the message that we all make life too complicated, and that we all need to buckle down to the only things that really matter, like love of country, God and our dear ol' mama? If so, gag.Tom Hanks is a winning presence in the film, and if anyone was going to be able to carry this story along, I imagine he did just as good a job as anyone else would have. But the only character worth watching as far as I'm concerned is poor little Jenny, played valiantly by Robin Wright Penn, who comes closer than anyone to playing an actual human being, despite the film's tendency to chew her character up and spit her out.This movie is like a box of chocolates...too much of it and you'll be sick.Grade: C-",4,16,34,16 March 2009
The Passion of Joan of Arc," One of the Most Formally Striking Movies I've Ever Seen
","Carl Dreyer's 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' is a film that feels light years ahead of its time. Lean and mean, focusing its entire narrative on the interrogation of Joan that inevitably lead to her execution by burning at the stake, the film is kinetic in ways that most films even now aren't. Composed almost completely of tight close ups, Dreyer and crew cut rapidly between disconcerting, asymmetrical shots, giving the film a breathless, anxious, nearly frenzied pace.Maria Falconetti gives an almost unbelievably intense performance as the title heroine. Her performance, and the film in general, does get a bit monotonous -- it exists primarily of impassioned gazes into the middle distance, giant, tearing eyes opened wide, an expression of passionate, nearly demented religious fervor on her face. It's not a film that concerns itself with characters and plot, so we don't get to know Joan as a person. It's difficult to care for her particular plight and we instead feel compassion for her as one human being feeling compassion for another. For that reason, the film left me remembering its striking images and formal style more than any emotions I might have felt while watching it. But it's no less of a remarkable cinematic achievement for that.Grade: A",9,2,4,10 August 2014
Gone Baby Gone," A Pointless Exercise in Human Nastiness
","This crabby pill of a movie takes place in the dreg districts of Boston and stars Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as a boyfriend/girlfriend detective team who are hired to search for a missing child. What follows is a twisty plot with a stupid and implausible finale. The movie is surly, everyone involved is in a bad mood, and the whole thing left me gloomy and angry.What am I supposed to take away from a movie like this? The film thinks it's asking weighty moral questions, like what does it mean to do the right thing, what's the difference between what is right and what is legal, etc.? But any point gets lost in the ugly, horrid world the movie lives in. Director Ben Affleck has been getting loads of praise for painting such an accurate portrait of working-class Boston, and maybe he did, but then why in God's name does anyone want to live there? The film makes Boston look like the worst place on Earth, filled with degenerates and thugs. One scene set in a drug house -- by far the most demoralizing scene in the film -- is straight out of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' inbred hillbillies and all. After a while, your only defense in this film is to laugh at the preposterous human ugliness Affleck unrelentingly heaps on you.Maybe good performances could have saved the movie -- or more accurately, good characters, because the performances are decent. But I don't know what any actors could have done with this material.I'm sick and tired of Hollywood churning out movie after movie that has no reason for existing other than to make people feel bad. What happened to movies that communicate ideas and engage in dialogue? Now film makers seem to think that what moviegoers want more than anything is to simply wallow in human baseness and meanness. It's movies like 'Gone Baby Gone' that are responsible for the insidious belief that the world is a much more nasty and violent place to live in than it really is.I'm glad this one bombed.Grade: D",3,13,33,7 November 2007

There are the usual abundance of one-liners and sight gags, and as always with a Pixar movie there's enough to entertain both the adults and their kiddies.Randy Newman composed the score and the film's title song, 'If I Didn't Have You,' which finally won him the damn Oscar after about a bazillion nominations.Grade: A-",8,0,1,27 July 2010
The Lost City of Z," Unforgivable Bastardization of Actual Events
","If a viewer didn't read anything about the actual adventurer Percy Fawcett and his experiences exploring the Amazon jungle in the early part of the 20th Century, 'The Lost City of Z' would probably strike him as a pretty decent historical adventure with some good central performances and a welcome message about embracing little known cultures that gives it a sense of relevancy in our current cultural climate. But if one reads even a little about the real Fawcett and his attitudes, this film becomes an unbearable concoction that takes a complicated story and character and turns it into yet another white male savior story, one that is totally tone deaf to conversations happening in the real world at this moment.Percy Fawcett was a bigot who pretty much abandoned his family for his megalomaniacal obsessions, and he had so much trouble reconciling the actual Amazonian natives he found with the preconceived notions he had of them in his head (in other words, they weren't as savage as he wanted them to be) that he invented the theory that a race of 'white' natives emigrated to the Amazon first and created a new race. But in the movie, Fawcett, as played by Charlie Hunnam, is fascinated with the people of the Amazon and advocates for them in the face of obstinate English attitudes about white European supremacy. And his family, particularly his wife, played by Sienna Miller, maybe once in a while misses him, but mostly are proud and supportive of his exploits. In the real story, Fawcett left his family destitute and they had to live a nomadic existence, moving from her to there in an effort to scrape together the means of subsistence.I'm the last person to demand that movies based on historical events be rigidly faithful, and I'm comfortable with dramatic license. But there are limits, especially when the director and writer chooses to focus his story on race during such a racially charged moment in history. James Gray has defended himself by saying that he wanted to focus on Fawcett's accomplishments rather than his faults, and that if he had been portrayed as the ass that it sounds like he was audiences wouldn't have been able to see past that. To which I say, 'Why don't you let your audience figure that out for themselves?' Instead, he decides to condescendingly give us the version of the story he wishes had existed, as if the people going to see it don't know how to look things up on Google, and doesn't give us the chance to digest a more complex version of events for ourselves. Where is Werner Herzog when you need him?This is by no means a badly made movie, and in many ways is actually a well made one, but its casual distortion of history prevents me from being able to give it a high rating or recommend it to anyone.Grade: C-",3,3,8,31 December 2017

I really don't like anything about superhero movies all that much, but this one is pretty good, because, like the second one, it's funny and it doesn't take itself so seriously and it's got Paul Rudd, who's able to make just about anything at least watchable.Grade: B",7,0,1,5 June 2019

But she's surprisingly winning and likable, and she makes the movie winning and likable too.Colin Firth plays Bridget's love interest, in only one of several leading-man roles that have made me question why women are so ga-ga over him. His character's last name is Darcy, in a wink-wink nudge-nudge reference to his portrayal of the character with that name in the A&E version of 'Pride and Prejudice' that his fanbase is so nuts for.

Captain America: The First Avenger," Someone Please Remind Me to Stop Watching Hollywood Super Hero Movies
","Remember that scene in 'A Clockwork Orange' when Alex has his eyelids forced open and is being conditioned to get sick from watching violent films? Someone needs to do something similar to me so that I will lose the urge to watch big-budget Hollywood super hero movies.I told my wife about half-way through this especially stupid example of the genre to remind me next time I thought it sounded like a good idea to rent 'The Green Lantern' or something about my experience watching 'Captain America.' I hate to be lost during a movie, but if I'm lost because the movie is especially intricate and complex, then I can at least tolerate it. But when I'm lost because the movie itself is so badly written and directed that ANYONE would be lost, I lose patience instantly.I'm not even going to ask the questions about this movie that I want to ask, because no one is going to be able to answer them without making something up anyway, and because it would be giving the movie too much credit to take it seriously enough that questions are necessary. Suffice it to say that the two most entertaining things about the movie were the 'let's see who can come up with the most ridiculous German accent' contest duked out between Hugo Weaving, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci; and the performance of Tommy Lee Jones, who barks out dry one-liners as if he was born to fulfill that very task.Grade: D",2,3,7,30 November 2011
American Hustle," Everybody Hustles to Survive
","'Some of the stuff depicted in this film actually happened,' or something to that effect, claims a title card at the beginning of 'American Hustle,' David O. Russell's tribute to small-time crooks and the men and women who love them. People are referring to the film as a screwball comedy, but it's not. I'm also noticing a lot of Internet hate directed at the film, with people referring to it as a narrative mess, too light and fluffy, not as good as they were hoping it would be. I don't think it's a great film, and not even Russell's best (that honor belongs to 'I Heart Huckabees' for me), but I don't know why people hate it so much, as if the film has personally betrayed them in some way. It's very good and engaging, with excellent performances across the board. Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence each delivers a memorable, indelible characterization that grows in richness the longer you let the film linger in your head, proving once again David O. Russell's expertise in directing crackerjack ensembles.I have a feeling that much of the vitriol leveled at 'American Hustle' has to do with the fact that it's considered to be a serious contender at this year's upcoming Academy Awards and might provide films like '12 Years a Slave' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street' with some stiff competition. But I'd certainly rather watch this film a second time before again subjecting myself to either Steve McQueen's or Martin Scorsese's endurance tests. Give me a lighter weight film any day over an 'important' slog.Grade: A-",8,0,4,9 January 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Oh, Those Corleones....
","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two 'Godfather' films, 'The Conversation,' and 'Apocalypse Now') and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another ('Peggy Sue Got Married,' 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', the third 'Godfather') earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before 'Jack' there was 'The Godfather.' While I feel the whole 'Godfather' trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think 'The Conversation' and 'Apocalypse Now' are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire 'Godfather' trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. 'The Godfather' doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, 'The Godfather' offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.Grade: Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-",7,4,11,26 July 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Perhaps a Perfect Action Thriller
","Paul Greengrass's sophomore outing as director of the Jason Bourne franchise is the best yet of the series.This is a sensational film, exciting and wildly entertaining. For what it sets out to be, it's nearly perfect. The other entries were also good, but what I came away praising in those were individual action scenes. In 'Ultimatum,' I was finally impressed with the writing of this series. They're very carefully constructed in and of themselves, but what's more, they're carefully constructed AS a series, so that characters and plot lines develop throughout the films, and little hooks in each film keep enough loose ends untied to make you care about what happens next. For example, though these movies are streamlined as can be, and stick pretty closely with Bourne, one of my favorite elements in this film was the expansion of Joan Allen's role and the battle of wills that occurs between her character and her rival CIA agent, played coolly and icily by David Strathairn. And though there's nothing in this film to match the sheer technical mastery of the car chase scene in the second installment, there's a hair-raising chase in this one set amongst the rooftops and maze-like alleyways of Tangier that should go down as a classic nailbiter.There hasn't been a movie this summer I've enjoyed as much as this one.Grade: A+",10,1,3,27 August 2007
Fargo," The Coens' Best
","I imagine popular opinion now holds that 'No Country for Old Men' is the best Coen brothers movie ever made, but for me this 1996 crime thriller will live on as their masterpiece.The Coens have always had trouble integrating their warped sense of humor into their films, and too often they tip the balance over into the grotesque. But in 'Fargo,' they for once strike the perfect balance between the macabre and the absurd, and though laughs abound, the film never lets us forget the seriousness at the film's center.The plot revolves around a money scheme gone badly awry, but the scheme itself doesn't matter. The Coens are more interested in watching what can happen to a bunch of ordinary Joes when money lust is involved. Anchoring the film with a beautiful performance is Frances McDormand as pregnant police officer Marge, whose country bumpkin accent and demeanor belies the sharp acuity of her investigative skills. The Coens are frequently mean and snide to their own characters, as if they're making movies about people who they feel superior to, but Marge is one of their most fully-realized and warmly human creations. She's the lioness protecting not only her cub but everyone else's cub as well, and the fact that she goes about her job with a smile and a friendly 'hello' doesn't make her any less ferocious.I love the film's final scene, in which Marge and her husband watch the evening news, both without actually speaking the words asking the other just what kind of world they're bringing their unborn child into.Grade: A+",10,2,3,16 June 2009
Rush," What's This? A Ron Howard Movie That Isn't Intolerable?
","I never thought I would ever watch a Ron Howard movie again much less write a good review of one.Howard hasn't made a movie since 'Parenthood' that has not bored me to tears and almost angered me with its pedestrian refusal to take any risks. He's turned into a lesser version of Steven Spielberg -- his films are just as maudlin and emotionally manipulative, but they lack Spielberg's technical panache.However, the great reviews of 'Rush' and the awards attention that swirled briefly around Daniel Bruhl got my butt in the seat for it, and I was surprised by actually liking it. It's a lean, mean telling of the intense rivalry between race car drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda. You don't need to care much about race car driving (I certainly don't) to enjoy the story, particularly that of Lauda, who overcame a devastating accident to return to the track. Bruhl is as good as everyone said he was at the time, and Chris Hemsworth, as Hunt, is serviceable if nothing special. This is still a Ron Howard film, so don't expect it to push any boundaries, but it's much more technically daring than anything else he's made, the cinematography and editing putting the audience in the driver's seat more than once.Grade: A-",8,8,10,8 May 2014
Predator," An Oddly Appealing Sci-Fi Horror Film
","What is it about this sci-fi horror film that's so appealing? All I know is that every time I come across it on cable, I almost have to stop what I'm doing and watch it.Governor Arnold leads a platoon of commandos into the jungle to face off against a malicious alien. There's your plot. It's an even more uber-macho version of the previous year's 'Aliens', the only difference being the location and the particular characteristics of the alien. This one has dred locks and can make itself invisible -- all you can see is a sort of ripple in the air when it wants to make itself unseen. It picks off the platoon members one by one in increasingly grisly fashion, until Arnie flexes his pecs and nukes the place.To be followed by numerous sequels, none of which I've seen, and all of which I'm sure were unnecessary.Grade: B",7,1,2,23 June 2008
Nightcrawler," A Nocturnal Horror Story
","A creepy film that gets under your skin and stays there.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a sensational performance as a skeezy loner who chases down crime and accident scenes in the middle of the night, films them and then sells his tapes to the rabid news media who know that the more sensational the story, the bigger the ratings. It's a depressing and depressingly relevant commentary on the obsession our culture has with news of the most depraved variety and the bottom feeders who profit by it.The film brings to mind 'Taxi Driver,' though the character created by Robert De Niro is actually the more terrifying of the two. Travis Bickle thinks he's bringing justice to the world through his violent actions. He's the avenging angel on a self-imposed mission. Gyllenhaal's character, on the other hand, has no illusions about himself or his motive, which is pure greed.I've never seen Gyllenhaal act as well as he does here, creating with his emaciated frame and raccoon eyes a nightmarish creature of the dark. Rene Russo (where's she been?) is also terrific as a news producer who becomes Gyllenhaal's primary customer.I had some problems with the ending. It gets a little too Hollywood for a film that avoids the clichéd trappings of typical studio product. But it wasn't disappointing enough to mar my overall reaction to the film.Grade: A",8,1,2,25 March 2015
The Aviator," Scorsese's Biopic Has the Style but Not the Heart
","Martin Scorsese's biopic about the rise and fall of eccentric entrepreneur Howard Hughes has energy to spare -- indeed, it barely pauses for breath -- but it remains a somewhat unengaging piece of cinema anyway. It's technically accomplished, but cold and lacking in heart.Leonardo DiCaprio played Hughes and gave audiences the first indication that he was capable of a mature film career after 'Titanic.' Cate Blanchett steals every scene she's in as Katharine Hepburn in a performance that manages to be a dead ringer for the real thing without being a mere impersonation. And Alan Alda is deliciously villainous as a corrupt senator. Other casting -- like Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner(!?) and Jude Law as Errol Flynn -- works less well.Grade: B+",7,0,0,3 September 2010
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Typically Safe Levinson Film
","The mid-1980s signaled a Vietnam revival in American cinema, and 'Good Morning, Vietnam' was Barry Levinson's contribution. Though boasting a pretty decent and characteristically hyper performance by Robin Williams, the movie over all is fairly forgettable, mostly because Levinson has always specialized in fuzzy, safe films that don't have anything by which to distinguish them.Like many of the other Vietnam movies that came out around the same time, this one has a great soundtrack.Williams received an Academy Award nomination for his performance.Grade: C+",6,3,7,20 June 2008
Burn After Reading," Perhaps the Worst Film the Coen Brothers Have Ever Made
","That noxious odor in the air is the Coen brothers going down in flames after hitting one out of the park last year with 'No Country for Old Men.''Burn After Reading' is a hateful film that I pretty much loathed every second of. A bunch of good actors give terrible performances in this story about two morons who get in over their heads when they try to hold some leaked CIA information for ransom. Every actor in this ratchets his/her performance to the level of the grotesque, and they're all about equally unwatchable. John Malkovich is one note, while George Clooney and Frances McDormand mug and grimace their way embarrassingly through the plot. Brad Pitt, who I guess is supposed to be our comic relief, is painfully unfunny, as is the Coens' attempts at humor. The story itself isn't bad, but instead of the clever dialogue you can usually rely on the Coens to deliver, the brothers fall back instead on repeated uses of the f-word and some dildo humor.The Coen brothers have always been hit-or-miss with me, and 'Burn After Reading' represents them at their juvenile worst.Grade: F",1,8,17,29 December 2008
Watchmen," Entertaining -- If You're a 13-Year Old with Serious Anti-Social Tendencies
","Goes down as one of the most miserable viewing experiences of my life.Zack Snyder, the peddler of crap who inflicted '300' on an unsuspecting world three years ago, is at it again, and has made a movie even less watchable than that other one. Snyder's modus operandi as a director would appear to be taking silly material deadly seriously, and he creates pounding, monotonous and -- in the case of 'Watchmen' -- disturbingly sadistic films. '300' at least had a camp sensibility, even if unintentionally, that was easy to make fun of. 'Watchmen' is just thuddingly boring when it's not being whiny or revolting.Set in an alternative version of the 1980s, 'Watchmen' is about a group of former superheroes who were driven out of service by a public who no longer wanted their help. Though how exactly most of them were superheroes is never clear. Only one, Dr. Manhattan, a big blue cloud of radioactive material with killer abs, has special powers; everyone else is just really good at beating people up. The rest of the plot is nearly impossible for me to summarize, since there's so much of it and almost none of it makes any sense. I imagine only people familiar with the source material could tell you what this movie is actually about. All I know is that half of the film's interminable running time had gone by and I was still waiting for a plot, or even the beginnings of a point, to emerge.'Watchmen' feels like it was written by an angry 13-year old who thinks it's cool to see the world as a cold and uncaring place but only because he's never known anything but comfort and shelter. It takes a petulant attitude about human nature and tries to convince us that humans are at heart cruel and sadistic. But really, the only person who comes across as sadistic is Snyder himself, whose gratuitous use of graphic violence borders on the pornographic. Snyder needs to understand that intelligent adults understand the impact of violence in the real world, and may not relish the idea of seeing a little girl's severed leg being torn apart by dogs, or the head of the man who killed the little girl hacked apart by a meat cleaver. Moments like these -- and there are far too many of them -- take on a life of their own and remove the viewer from the world of the film. It's very difficult to get back in, especially if the movie's no good to begin with.The cast of actors, some of them very good in other things, should be embarrassed by the performances they give here, though I'd like to think it's not their fault. Billy Crudup, Jackie Earle Haley and Matthew Goode deliver all of their lines in an expressionless monotone (though Goode deserves points for doing so while looking exactly like David Spade). It falls to Patrick Wilson and the actress who plays Silk Spectre (I'm too lazy to look it up) to give me characters I came even close to caring about. I didn't care about them, really, because they're boring as hell, but they at least seemed to be playing human beings.One shouldn't have to be familiar with the original graphic novel to appreciate the film -- the film's merits should speak for themselves. Unfortunately, they don't. Message to Zack Snyder: next time try making a movie that WASN'T first a graphic novel, and maybe you'll have better luck. Though somehow I'm doubtful.Grade: F",1,9,19,5 August 2009
The Bourne Identity," I've Finally Gotten Around to Jason Bourne
","I was slow in coming around to the Bourne movies, and now I'm squeezing in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' so that I can see 'The Bourne Ultimatum,' which is getting raves.'The Bourne Identity' is about what I expected. It's a slick action thriller that will satisfy the craving for dumb stunts, car chases and fistfights, but which also has a brain in its head. You'll have to suspend a whole bunch of disbelief, and there were a couple of instances that went so far as to make that quite a challenge indeed. Like many films of its ilk, this one doesn't know what in the world to do with female characters, so our main one screams and acts helpless, while the only other one (played by Julia Stiles) plays really no part at all in the proceedings. I only suspect that her importance increases later, as I see that Stiles is in the later movies as well. The men, meanwhile, do what men in these movies do, which is survive blows and falls that no mortal could actually survive, and bark out macho orders while strutting around with their hands on their hips.I recently took a trip to Paris and Barcelona, so I very much enjoyed the location filming in Paris, and got quite excited when even some shots of Barcelona made it into the film during one montage.Grade: B+",7,0,1,16 August 2007
The Killing Fields," A Rousing Film About a Bloody Subject
","A visceral, kinetic and exciting film from Roland Joffe (whatever happened to him?).Set against the bloody backdrop of Cambodia during the civil war that saw the surge of the Khmer Rouge, 'The Killing Fields' tells the story of an interpreter (the non-actor Haing S. Ngor) who befriends an American journalist (Sam Waterston) and then descends into the nightmare of Cambodia while Waterston sits helplessly in America wondering if his friend is dead or alive. It's one of those liberal films Hollywood loves to make, that asks us to feel guilty about our cushy American lives even as people in other countries are being butchered. It's not heavy handed or manipulative though, and Joffe films the whole thing with a journalistic approach that fits the subject matter and lends the film a documentary-like quality.Ngor, who had never acted before, is amazing, and though Waterston gets top billing as the most recognizable actor, Ngor is the film's true star.Grade: A",9,1,2,17 March 2008
Baby Driver," Style Will Only Get a Movie So Far
","One of the more disappointing films I've seen recently, because it starts out so promisingly and so its eventual down-hill trajectory seems all the more steep in comparison.'Baby Driver' has one of the best opening credits sequences I've ever seen, some kinetic and whiplash car chases, and an awesome soundtrack. In its main protagonist, played pretty winningly by Ansel Elgort, it also has an engaging and sympathetic character -- or at least, he starts out that way, until he becomes an empty cipher for director Edgar Wright's fetishistic preoccupations, a problem that plagues the entire movie.The early scenes of Baby finishing his life of crime and meeting a cute girl are the film's best. But the energetic pop and fizz of the movie quickly curdles after that into a tedious and juvenile barrage of non- stop violence and implausibility. If Wright had established a satiric tone like he did in movies like 'Hot Fuzz' and 'Shaun of the Dead,' I might have been able to tolerate the film's descent into stupidity. But he doesn't, instead playing things straight, so that characters like the ones played by Jamie Foxx and John Hamm (who's badly miscast by the way) become so obnoxious and irritating that I groaned every time they reentered the film. We're supposed to believe that Baby has a heart of gold and is a victim of circumstance, but by the end of the film he's as ruthless as anyone else and can kill with the same casual ease as the bad guys, so we kind of stop caring about him. And the movie can never be forgiven for what it does with his love interest, a completely disposable character who blindly follows Baby even after she's seen him kill a man and who exists for the sole purpose of being rescued. I haven't seen such a worthless female character in a film in a long time.The only other bright spot aside from the ones I've already mentioned is Kevin Spacey, who knows how to play a bad guy as someone who you know is only going to bring grief to the characters you care about but who you want in the movie anyway because he knows how to be sinister and likable at the same time.Style will only get you so far.Grade: C-",4,6,14,25 July 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Of Hobbits and Orcs. And Elves. And Wizards. And Fairies, and.....
","Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is a monumental achievement, I won't argue with that. The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration.But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there.After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough. I think it says something about your endeavor when the most interesting character in the film is the one who's computer animated.The person who really deserves the most credit for this trilogy is its editor(s), who had to take god knows how many hours of footage and shape it into something resembling a movie.Grade: B",7,0,0,23 July 2010

This is one of those movies that's hard to review because I learned to like it before I knew what film criticism even was.

The Caine Mutiny," Dutiful Film Adaptation Never Really Takes Off
","This all-star screen adaptation of the Herman Wouk novel is forcefully acted, but it has a by-the-numbers feeling to it, and the drama never really takes hold.I can aim much the same criticism at the book, which I thought plodded along rather dully and went on for far too long. The movie is actually a pretty decent adaptation, considering the screenwriters had to reduce an 800-page novel to a two-hour film. They picked the right parts to jettison, deciding wisely to stick closely with the events involving Queeg and the Caine, and eliminating much of the narrative surrounding Willie Keith, our guide through the story. There's still too much of him, though, and not enough of Humphrey Bogart, who stepped out of character to play a possibly crazy and possibly dangerous naval captain. Van Johnson and Jose Ferrer should be singled out for their performances, Johnson playing the Caine's executive officer who instigates the mutiny and Ferrer playing the naval lawyer hired to defend the mutineers. The film trips along speedily enough, and it hits all of the high points, but it never really comes alive as a movie and instead feels like what it is -- a fairly faithful but rather uninspired adaptation.And the less said about Max Steiner's blaring and woefully inappropriate score, the better.Grade: B",7,0,2,23 May 2008

","Aw, come on IMDb'ers, why the low rating? Where's your sense of loyalty? I can't hear that Kenny Loggins title song and see those pairs of dancing feet during the opening credits without sitting down to watch this whole movie. And even if it's largely to make fun of it, I still love it for old times' sake.Kevin Bacon is the tough city kid stuck in some podunk Midwest town where dancing has been outlawed. John Lithgow is the preacher who serves as Bacon's arch nemesis; Lori Singer is the preacher's daughter who has a hankering for the new dangerous kid. Dianne Wiest is the reasonable mom who acts as referee between dad and daughter. The whole thing is sillier than an episode of 'Laugh-In,' but many of the actors (particularly Lithgow, Wiest and Bacon) are good enough to actually sell the material.

Cast Away," Hanks Pulls Off What Not Just Any Actor Could
","I remember being fairly dismissive about 'Cast Away' upon its initial release before I'd seen it. I wasn't thrilled with the direction Robert Zemeckis had gone as a director ('Forrest Gump' anyone?) and I was just about Tom Hanks-ed out by the time he made this. But then I saw it, and found myself impressed by both the direction and more notably by Hanks' performance.The difficulty of that performance should not be underestimated. Hanks plays a man stranded on a desert island and spends the vast majority of time alone on screen. Even if there are better actors than Hanks out there, it takes a certain kind of screen presence to pull that off, and Hanks has it. His Academy Award nomination was richly deserved.Grade: A-",8,3,4,13 July 2010
The Thing," John Carpenter's 'Thing' Is No 'Halloween'
","The man who showed the world how scary a movie he could make with nothing more than a shoestring budget ('Halloween' in 1978) demonstrates that less can be more when it comes to making a horror movie that will truly scare you.John Carpenter gets quite a bit more money to throw at the screen and uses it to create all kinds of nifty makeup and creature effects in his 1982 cult classic 'The Thing,' but it's the movie's quiet early scenes, before anything much is actually happening, that are the most unsettling.'The Thing' isn't exactly a remake of the 1951 classic 'The Thing from Another Planet,' though it shares the source material of that film. It's a reinvention and is largely better than the earlier version. Kurt Russell and a group of scientists working at the North Pole become prey to a shape-shifting alien that has the ability to look just like any one of them, and the real tension in the film comes from the mens' increasing inability to trust one another -- after all, who's an alien and who isn't? This adds an effective punch of psychological complexity that was missing from the 1950s version, which presented itself as a straight-up monster movie. In John Carpenter's version, the paranoia and claustrophobia that develops from being trapped in your own worst nightmare are as scary as any of the oogie-boogies running around in the snow.But the film relies too much on its gross-out effects, which no doubt looked state-of-the-art in 1982, but which look silly and dated now. Carpenter didn't take to heart the lesson he taught audiences in 1978 -- that a person's imagination is going to cook up something ten times scarier than anything a filmmaker can actually show you on screen.This is a worthy addition to the horror canon, but its quality has been overrated by fanboys.Grade: A-",8,1,6,20 October 2009

He and a bunch of jokey man's men head off to stop it, and of course they're successful, because if they weren't, we wouldn't be able to see Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck swap tongue at the movie's end to the strains of a maudlin Aerosmith song.'Armageddon' is proof (if further proof was needed) that special effects alone are never enough to make a movie tolerable.Grade: D+",3,2,7,22 June 2010
The Revenant," A Boring, One-Note Slog
","Revenge may be a primal human drive, especially in the setting and time period in which 'The Revenant' is set, but it makes for a very boring narrative hook if you don't give a hoot about the person seeking revenge or the person that person is seeking revenge against.Alejandro G. Innarritu's latest exercise in human misery is two and a half hours of Leonardo DiCaprio suffering capped off by a showdown that finds him getting what he wants -- the death of the man who left him for dead after being mauled by a bear and then killed his son. Does Innarritu use this story to bring any insight into the human condition? Are we given any reason to care about DiCaprio's character other than a couple of obligatory flashbacks that use narrative shortcuts to tell us that he had a wife who was killed? Could the villain, played by Tom Hardy without a hint of nuance or subtlety, be any more of a caricature? Innaritu directs every single shot with a self-conscious sense of self- importance, as if he's pausing to say to the audience, 'Just wait and see how impressed you are going to be with my directorial skill.' Too bad it all adds up to such a boring, one-note slog.DiCaprio will win what everyone seems to think is a long overdue Oscar for this performance, despite the fact that he's given the same performance in his last ten movies and he's asked to do no more in this one than grunt, moan, and grimace his way through it. Every time I hear anyone talk about how brilliant he is in 'The Revenant,' the focus is on how difficult the shoot was, not how well he acted the part. Honestly, the brilliant makeup work is 95% of his performance.'Birdman' was the first Innarritu movie I've really liked, and it looks like that was an anomaly. His philosophy seems to be predicated on the belief that human existence is something to suffer through until one finds a reward in the afterlife. Since I don't believe that at all, his movies have nothing to say to me. Grade: C",5,12,22,24 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg Can Make Even the Cold War Maudlin
","I thought that the Coen brothers as co-screenwriters of 'Bridge of Spies' meant that we might get some restraint and intelligence to balance the maudlin platitudes that almost certainly come attached with a Steven Spielberg film. But I was wrong. Spielberg takes a chilly Cold War setting and then proceeds to pump sentimentality into it until by the end it's as sunny and warm as a Folgers coffee commercial.Tom Hanks, as usual, does his best to calm Spielberg down, and plays the main character as an every man Joe trying to do the right thing despite Spielberg's attempts to cram his heroics down our throats. But by the film's end, he's as overwhelmed by the rest of us by Spielberg's schmaltz, served with healthy doses of the requisite pounding Spielbergian score, this one supplied not by John Williams but rather by Thomas Newman.Mark Rylance won an Oscar for playing a Russian spy who barely speaks, and I suppose I appreciated his ability to convey emotions without histrionics, something Spielberg certainly isn't capable of. But I can't say I really see that he did anything special enough to warrant an Academy Award.The Coens were nominated for their script, which they co-wrote with Matt Charman, and the film also copped nominations for Best Picture, Production Design, Original Score, and Sound Mixing.Grade: B-",6,0,2,15 April 2016

","James McAvoy gives what could have potentially been an award-worthy performance if it had appeared in a different film.He plays a man with multiple personalities who kidnaps three young girls as a part of a plot two of the personalities have hatched to unleash a powerful and unstoppable identity. Betty Buckley, in a better performance than the role necessarily needed, plays a therapist working with him and who begins to unravel the alarming plot. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan, who hasn't made a movie I've wanted to see since 'Signs,' crafts a nifty and effective thriller with three fourths of his film, and then sort of if not completely ruins it by taking his idea too far and pushing the supernatural elements to the point where we realize we're not even watching the same kind of movie we were at the beginning. This particular story, and especially McAvoy's performance, would have been compelling enough without Shyamalan's characteristic inability to understand when he's ruining his own premise.Grade: B",7,19,27,7 August 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," When Does Snape (or Anyone Other Than Harry and Hermione, for That Matter) Come Back into the Story?
","These Harry Potter movies are starting to make me grumpy.Coming out of 'Half-Blood Prince,' I felt that the filmmakers didn't even try to make the film coherent to people who hadn't already read the book, and that trend continues with the first half of 'Deathly Hallows.' To make matters worse, all fun and whimsy have been drained out of this story, so not only was I confused, I was also depressed. The who's who of adult British actors that have been the only reason to stick with this series in the first place are mostly absent, save for an initial action sequence that stands as this film's highlight. It all goes downhill from there, and most of the movie consists of Harry, Hermione and Ron (and mostly just Harry and Hermione), sitting around in barren, rocky places looking gloomy. (If the kids can whisk themselves away anywhere, why don't they at least go into hiding someplace warm and sunny?) These characters simply aren't interesting enough to carry an entire film, and the absence of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Brendan Gleeson (who bites it off screen early on but whose death is treated so casually by the script that you might not even know he died), David Thewlis, etc. is sorely missed.The film's production values and sheer technical skill are enough to mask the fact that the script doesn't make any sense, and it's not until after the movie is over and you've had a chance to ruminate on it that you begin to feel like you've been snowed.I will see the final installment because I might as well now, but it damn well better be good.Grade: C",4,2,2,24 August 2011
The Hills Have Eyes," Needlessly Savage and Not Remotely Scary
","My wife recently planned a night out with her girlfriends, so I had the T.V. to myself and the chance to watch some movies she wouldn't want to see. I had a hankering for some good old fashioned vintage porn and a good scary movie, so I rented this, 'Debbie Does Dallas' and 'Taboo.' Of the three films I rented, 'The Hills Have Eyes' was by far the most pornographic, and the last of the bunch I'd want my child (if I had one) to see.It astounds me that the MPAA will give a movie like '9 Songs' (which does happen to be a lousy movie) an NC-17 rating, virtually guaranteeing that no mainstream movie theatre will carry it, just because it depicts real sex between real people, and then turn around and give a movie like 'Hills' an R. What kind of sick world do we live in when the sight of penetration is believed to be more damaging to our youth than the sight of people getting axe picks through their heads and their intestines ripped out? And lest you think I'm just a cranky prude, let me say that I love horror movies, and I'm always on the outlook for good ones ('The Descent' happened to be fantastic) but I've nearly given up hope that today's batch of filmmakers know the first thing about what scares people. I'm not opposed to gore, and I think it can be used effectively (again, 'The Descent'). My objections to 'The Hills Have Eyes' rest almost entirely on the fact that it's not effective horror. It's gruesome, to be sure, and it does inspire a sort of visceral reaction from the viewer, but so would a car accident. I've not seen the original Wes Craven version, but the film that this most reminded me of, 1974's 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' gave me close to the same feeling, except that Tobe Hooper's film is unbelievably scary in addition to being nauseating, and it uses true film-making skills to scare the pants off of you, not simply digitally enhanced makeup and sound effects.It depresses me that there's a market for movies like 'The Hills Have Eyes.' I must be getting older, because I'm starting to worry about the state of our country's youth. Doesn't anyone have the attention span anymore to be scared by a clever, psychological thriller, or even a sophisticated slasher film like 'Chainsaw Massacre' or 'Halloween,' where your imagination did the work that computers do now? Horror movies used to be fun -- now they're just exhausting. I used to come away from then scared but exhilarated -- now I come away just feeling bad. It's hard to have fun in a movie that shows a woman's baby being held at gunpoint so that a sadistic mutant can suck on her boobs, and then shoot her in the head anyway; or in which a boy comes across the body of his dead mother being disemboweled and eaten. I don't believe that anyone should be stopped from making films like this; I just wish people would have the brains to stop wanting to see them.

Cold Mountain," Anthony Minghella Tries for the Great American Movie (and Fails)
","There is a difference between a movie about a grueling journey and a grueling movie, but 'Cold Mountain' didn't get that memo.Director Anthony Minghella is cut from the same cloth as Sam Mendes: both are non-American directors who try time and again to make the great American movie and fail.'Cold Mountain' is about a man (Jude Law) who goes on a bizarre odyssey from the battlefields of the Civil War back into the arms of his true love (Nicole Kidman). The journey is harrowing and unpleasant, and Minghella makes us feel every ounce of it without counteracting the unpleasantness with any suggestion as to why we should care.Law is good, Kidman is bland, and Renee Zellweger is ridiculous in a hammy performance as a Southern good ol' gal. A bunch of famous people (like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Eileen Atkins and Natalie Wood) pop up in cameos. It's kind of like a dismal Southern version of 'Around the World in 80 Days.'

Little Miss Sunshine," A Movie That Will Make You Proud to Be Ordinary
","Much of 'Little Miss Sunshine' shouldn't work, yet almost all of it does.One of the best ensemble casts in recent memory delivers this outrageous material with a tremendous amount of heart and conviction and, as a result, a screenplay that threatens to stretch the bounds of credibility comes across as believable and achingly poignant. The characters are given such strong motivations for their actions that everything they do and say feels utterly plausible, even when the film itself threatens to teeter into Faulknerian Southern Gothic crossed with National Lampoon's 'Vacation.' The writers, director and cast stubbornly refuse to allow us any tidy character assessments. Therefore, we see the brittle and harsh side of Toni Collette's otherwise loving mom; the warm, charming and please-like-me vulnerability of Greg Kinnear's otherwise smarmy and nearly intolerable dad; the intellectual pompousness and snobbery that peeks its head through Steve Carell's otherwise emotionally wounded suicide case; and the affectionate patriarch lurking behind the otherwise gruff and offensive exterior of Alan Arkin's grandfather, whose greatest crime may be that he's too honest.'Little Miss Sunshine' hands over this motley cast of characters and lets us glory in their imperfections, and through doing so helps us feel better about our own. As the movie points out, perfection isn't possible, and the aggressive pressure in American culture to achieve it is only making people miserable about failing at something they never had a chance of succeeding at in the first place. The movie is so warm hearted though, that its ultimate lesson isn't a downer. At the end, this close-knit family realizes that they're proud to be ordinary, and dammit, so am I.Grade: A+",10,1,6,18 September 2006

I enjoyed it very much the first time I saw it, but I don't want to revisit it the way I like revisiting 'Rear Window,' 'Psycho' or 'The Birds.' Almost every Hitchcock film has at least one classic set piece that everyone remembers, and this film has at least two: the crop duster sequence, in which Cary Grant is pursued across an empty field by a sinister plane (very creepy) and the breathtaking climax on Mt.

Hugo," Can't Argue with Its Message, Even If I Didn't Warm Much to the Movie
","Martin Scorsese takes a stab at making a film children can enjoy, and the results are.....mixed.If the entire film had been as enchanting as the first five minutes, 'Hugo' would really have been something special. As it is, it's infused with a love of cinema, and particularly the joy to be found in discovering and preserving the history of the art form. And for that reason alone, I, an avid movie buff myself, am thrilled that this film exists. However, I didn't find myself warming to it all that much in any other regard. It's a bit slow and one-note -- the loneliness of Hugo, the little boy at the film's center, is brought home adequately within the film's first fifteen minutes, but it's another hour or so of movie before the plot progresses past that. Frankly, it's a bit grueling to watch a little boy missing his dead father for an hour. Once the meat of the film begins to develop, and Hugo and his friend discover that they are in the company of none other than film pioneer Geroges Melie (played by Ben Kingsley), the love of cinema comes practically pouring off of the screen and things improve somewhat.Still, there is a lot of business involving Sacha Baron Cohen and other denizens of the train station in which Hugo lives and which serves as the film's principal setting that is tiresome. Cohen plays his character like he's a villain from an animated Disney movie, which is completely incongruous with the rest of the film, and wonderful actors like Emily Mortimer, Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour are introduced only to torment us with the fact that they are given barely any screen time and nothing to do with the time they're given.'Hugo' looks lovely, and if you're going to see a 3-D movie this would be the one. But I've decided I could do without 3-D. The technology supposedly brings a heightened level of realism to the film-going experience, but I always find that it does just the opposite; things looks unnatural and awkwardly placed in relation to one another.Grade: B+",7,1,2,20 January 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," I'll Take a Terminatrix to Go Please
","Common consensus seems to be that 'Terminator 3' is the weakest in the series, and maybe it is. But I actually really liked this movie.Claire Danes is no Linda Hamilton, but that's o.k., since we get the Terminatrix, a brand spanking new female cyborg that's virtually unstoppable. I kept waiting for her to begin firing bullets from her boobs like that android in the 'Austin Powers' movie. People don't seem to like that this film went for a lighter, more comic tone. But come on -- how seriously is anyone expected to take this story? The screenplay also has a reflexive quality to it, with Arnold the actor, feeling his age as an action movie star, playing an old and outdated model of cyborg, who can't keep up with the new times.Grade: B+",7,1,3,19 November 2008
Doctor Zhivago," Suffers from Comparison to Other Lean Epics
","I credit David Lean with introducing to film audiences epics that could think as well as dazzle. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' and 'Lawrence of Arabia' are as fascinating to watch as intimate character studies as they are big historical panoramas. With 'Doctor Zhivago,' Lean lost that intellectual edge and made a fabulously entertaining soap opera that, no matter how easily it goes down, still leaves me longing for the challenge of his earlier pictures.'Zhivago' creates a fascinating and sprawling portrait of turn-of-the-(20th)-century Russia and the lives of a few characters as they navigate the tricky waters of political and socio-economic turmoil. But the central story, revolving around Omar Sharif's doctor, is not as compelling as that of T.E. Lawrence or the British military commander created by Alec Guinness in 'Kwai,' and Sharif himself is rather a bland presence here, as is his love interest, played by the gorgeous but somewhat vapid Julie Christie. Without these two generating any heat, it's somewhat difficult to warm to them. I found myself more often paying attention to the sets and costumes than I did the actors.Other members of the cast do better by their roles, and make much more of an impression with much less screen time: Rod Steiger, Geraldine Chaplin and Tom Courtenay in particular. But 'Doctor Zhivago' can only be as good as its doctor, which is why this film, despite all of its merits, must remain a more minor work in Lean's canon.Grade: B+",7,0,2,12 December 2006
The Shining," A Truly Scary Movie
","'The Shining,' Stanley Kubrick's funhouse ride through hell, terrifies me. It scared me when I first saw it, what, 20 years ago, and it continues to scare me to this day.Aside from borrowing a sketchy outline from the book's central premise, Kubrick's film does not much resemble Stephen King's novel. Kubrick vastly improves on the original story, and makes it far more horrifying -- and memorable -- than King did. King was not so much interested in the domestic drama elements of his story, and so the novel focuses overtly on the supernatural -- there's no doubt in the book that the demons plaguing Jack, and driving him to insanity, are quite real. Kubrick, on the other hand, creates a dysfunctional family horror film. Rather than explain away Jack's behavior as the work of a menacing dark spirit -- though Kubrick does allude ambiguously to that -- the film spends most of its time exploring the dynamics of this small nuclear family, one that is trying hard to ignore some ominous signs of serious domestic trouble. It's much scarier to think that a dad and husband might just go crazy from isolation, responsibility and a male inferiority complex than from demonic possession.In Jack Nicholson, Kubrick found an actor who could both make you laugh and scare the pants off of you at the same time. He takes Jack so over the top that he sails right past hammy and circles back around to truly effective. Shelley Duvall is a wonderful actress when she can find a role to fit her unique physical characteristics, and she's perfect as Wendy, the suffering wife, who isn't quite as much of a doormat as you think she's going to be. And Scatman Crothers is great as well, as the head chef of the Overlook Hotel who knows a little something about its secrets.Kubrick is an expert at knowing how to use images to frighten us. He creates isolated images in this film that I've never been able to forget: the twin girls hacked up to pieces in a hotel corridor; the vacant stare on Jack Nicholson's face as he slowly cracks up inside while his wife and son play in the snow outside; and creepiest of all, the sight of a man in a bear costume fellating a butler in one of the hotel's rooms, an image that has psychologically scarred me for life.Add to all of this Kubrick's chilly, stately tracking shots that prowl through the hotel like something alive and that distorted, eerie musical score and you have one of the scariest movies ever made.Grade: A",9,0,2,18 October 2006
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Refreshingly Multicultural
","A refreshingly multicultural spin on a genre that has traditionally been predominantly male and predominantly white. What I love about a film like 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is that a wide range of young kids can watch this film and see in it people who look and sound like them. It resembles the world as it actually exists rather than the worlds of most super hero movies, where white men are constantly saving the day. It also has a funky sound and look to it. The movie teems with urban flavor and the animation, purposely pixelated to recreate the look of an old-fashioned comic book, is gorgeous.But this is still, disappointingly, a super hero movie, which, if popular sentiment is any indication, is pretty much a problem only for me. That's fine, I can live with that knowledge. The movie is just so formulaic, with a draggy central story line about a kid whose insecurity prevents him from rising to his full super hero potential until....guess what?....he does. There's one (or a few) too many scenes with other characters giving him lectures about how to become his true self, etc. etc. And the story is weak, a confusing mish-mosh of villains and mega-weapons and alternate universes. True to super hero movie conventions, the filmmakers try to disguise how messy the screenplay is by burying it under an avalanche of loud, hectic action scenes that throw a lot of stuff at us and hope something sticks.So my dislike of super hero movies and everything that comes with them prevented me from fully enjoying this movie, but if I'm going to watch a super hero movie at all I want more that look and sound like this one.Grade: B+",7,4,23,18 December 2018
American Beauty," Sam Mendes Gets It Wrong -- Again
","Sam Mendes' entire film career has consisted of woefully misguided attempts to dissect the many ills of American culture without remotely understanding them. Perhaps he should spend some time slinging his arrows at Britain's problems before jumping across the pond.'American Beauty' is a movie about American suburban malaise set in a version of suburban America that simply doesn't exist. Its characters are either gross and grotesque caricatures or mere vessels for regurgitating Alan Ball's pretentious screenplay, forced to utter lines that never sound like things people would actually say. Kevin Spacey gives the consummate Spacey performance -- one-note snideness delivered in a sardonic monotone -- that he gives every time he's in front of a camera, while poor Annette Bening is unwatchable in a frenzied performance that I have to believe was forced on her by the director, since she's never again been as bad, either before or since. The worst of the film's dialogue is reserved for all of the angst-filled teenagers, and most conspicuously for Wes Bentley, a tortured and philosophic youth who reads a ridiculous soliloquy about the beauty to be found in a plastic bag as if he's reciting Shakespeare.The film has a weird preoccupation with homosexuality that doesn't really fit and makes itself most manifest in the character of Chris Cooper, a closeted ex-serviceman who, true to the film's form, is depicted as a goulish representative of conservative America.What is the point you ask of all this glib satire? Hell if I know.Grade: D",3,6,13,28 June 2010
Warrior," I Was Totally Sucker Punched
","The only thing 'Warrior' could have added to make its shamelessly manipulative screenplay even more emotionally manipulative would have been a three-legged dog dying of cancer. This movie makes 'Rocky' look as austere as an Ingmar Bergman film.But damned if it didn't work on me anyway! The story of two brothers with heaps of back story who face off at an MMA championship, 'Warrior' couldn't have a hokier set up, but it's executed so well that it almost makes you buy it. Get this -- one brother plans to give the $1 million prize money to the widow of a brother in arms who was killed in action; the other wants the money so that he can dig his family out of financial crisis and save their house (I might throw in that his daughter suffers from a serious heart condition). Don't worry about not having a rooting interest.But here's the thing. The screenplay wisely avoids a lot of talky scenes in which these two brothers work out their personal demons, estrangement from each other and their gruff father (played by Nick Nolte). These guys aren't very articulate, so their pent up rage and anguish, at each other and at life in general, comes out in the ring, and that somehow feels right. The film understands that men aren't frequently given a lot of options for expressing themselves, and that sometimes beating each other up is the closest they're ever going to get to declaring a love for one another.I'm embarrassed to admit that I almost cried at the end of this movie.Grade: A",8,1,5,3 February 2012
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," He's Baa-aack
","The original 'Terminator' movie had a low-budget look about it, but money was obviously not an issue with this blockbuster Hollywood sequel.This time around, Ahhnold is the good guy, sent back in time to protect the son of Linda Hamilton from another and more advanced terminator, ALSO sent back in time to kill him. This new model looks like liquid mercury and can take on the appearance of anyone and anything he happens to be around. This gives the visual effects artists all kinds of opportunities to show off, which they do. These effects were a big deal at the time, and even with all of the more sophisticated computer effects of today, they still hold up well.The film looks dazzling, and it benefits from a sense of humor that the first one didn't have.Grade: A",9,3,4,19 November 2008
Duck Soup," A Great Time
","I can't say I'm necessarily a huge Marx Brothers fan, but I also can't claim to be an expert on them, since I've only seen this and 'A Night at the Opera.' Based on these two films, I've concluded that I like the IDEA of a Marx Brothers movie more than I like the movies themselves. Groucho is such a cultural icon that, like Charlie Chaplin, he inspires warm nostalgic feelings in movie buffs even if you've never seen one of his movies.However, that said, I have to assume that 'Duck Soup' is the Marx Brothers at their zaniest best, and it is very funny. This is the film that includes the famous 'mirror' scene, in which two men in a doorway becomes a hilarious comedic bit, as one man thinks he's looking into a mirror because the other is matching his actions and gestures. It's inspired scenes like that that seem to have given the Marx Brothers their longevity. You remember individual skits that can be easily shown in a 60 second clip rather than the movies as a whole.Grade: A",9,1,2,4 January 2006
Apocalypse Now," This Movie Isn't About Vietnam; It IS Vietnam
","Francis Ford Coppola's extraordinary Vietnam film is deeply flawed, but in this case the flaws feel so right for the subject matter that they almost make the movie better.This movie is a perfect marrying of source material and directorial vision. Setting Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' against the backdrop of the Vietnam jungles is brilliant, and the dark odyssey of Martin Sheen's character is so nightmarish, feverish and sweaty that this movie feels more like it IS Vietnam than merely ABOUT Vietnam.With a number of memorable appearances, notably Robert Duvall as a war-hungry Army officer glorying in the carnage around him; Dennis Hopper as a drugged out photojournalist who's lost his mind to the jungle; and, perhaps most memorable for its pure weirdness, Marlon Brando as Kurtz, the officer who's gone missing and has fashioned himself as a dark God amongst the primitive natives.The movie totally loses its way toward the end, but that somehow feels right.Recommendation: Don't watch the redux version if you can avoid it. It's yet further proof that directors usually have good instincts and that what they initially cut from their movies should remain cut.Grade: A",9,1,2,8 November 2007
The Battle of Algiers," An Astonishing and Authentic Examination of Terrorism
","Wow, 'The Battle of Algiers' really could have been made today, couldn't it? I don't know if I should be comforted or disturbed that the events depicted in Gillo Pontecorvo's film so closely mirror those going on in the Middle East right now. On the one hand, it's comforting to realize that events and tensions that seem scary in the present day have been going on virtually forever, and that every generation has probably thought at some point that the world they lived in represented the human race at its lowest point. But on the other hand, it's disturbing to think that the same patterns have been repeating themselves for ages and we as a race just keep making the same blunders over and over again.'The Battle of Algiers' chronicles in near documentary fashion the struggle of the Algerian Muslims against the imperialist French rule in the 1950s. Overwhelmed by the might and resources of the French military, a rebel group of Algerians resort to terrorist tactics to make themselves heard. Stuck in the middle are the everyday Algerian and French citizens, who die in bombings and attacks perpetrated by both sides, and are fed propaganda explaining how each side is working in their best interests.There's a scene mid-way through the film in which a French military commander lectures a gathering on the personalities and philosophies of terrorist cells. He explains the terrorist cell structure, and how the best way to kill the cell is to cut off its head. Sound familiar? Pontecorvo's film is engrossing, and one that will always (sadly) be relevant. His sympathies obviously reside with the Algerians -- the film ends with images of an Algerian uprising that occurred two years after the main events depicted in the movie, with Algerian people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and shouting cries of 'freedom,' 'liberty' and such. But we do see the human cost and dubious morality of terrorist warfare, and the film fairly showcases the brutality inflicted by both groups.'The Battle of Algiers' has an astounding authentic quality to it that makes it almost impossible to believe that this is a fictional film and not a documentary.Grade: A",9,1,4,16 April 2007

","Piece of garbage from garbage peddler Roland Emmerich about a man's crusade to avenge the destruction of his family by a British officer during the American Revolutionary War.The film puts at its center a villain so ridiculously evil that we root for the protagonist by default, even though his motives are just as sadistic. And the fact that this story is sold as a patriotic tribute to America only adds to its nauseating qualities.Yet one more film in the long line of films indicating that Mel Gibson cannot be involved in a project that does not revel in brutality.Grade: F",1,23,49,14 July 2010
Edward Scissorhands," Tim Burton's Best
","My favorite Tim Burton movie.Johnny Depp plays the eponymous eccentric, a patchwork man created by an old inventor (Vincent Price) who dies before he can give him hands. A tragedy of sorts ensues when he's adopted by a suburban American family, only to ultimately discover that there's no place for him in the 'normal' world.'Edward Scissorhands' covers many of Burton's recurring themes: the artist as mad genius; the lack of tolerance for anything different from the norm. But what I like about it is the intense heart beating at the center of the movie. It's full of love, really, and of kind people. The community is quite accepting of Edward at first. Only when they become scared do they fall into their 'follow the herd' mentality, but they're not bad people. The character of Edward himself is a miraculous creation, the first sign of what Johnny Depp's idiosyncratic acting choices were capable of. Edward is filled with nothing but kindness and the desire to be kind to others. And the inventor loves his creation the way a father would love his child.The film is sentimental to be sure, but it's sentimental in the way that a fairy tale is, and it works. Every time I see the scene when the inventor gives Edward a heart made out of a cookie, or the scene where Edward creates an ice sculpture while Winona Ryder dances in the 'snow' created by the ice shavings, I have to fight down a lump in my throat.And let me say that this film would not be what it is without Danny Elfman's marvelous score, one of the best ever written for a movie.Grade: A",9,0,0,17 October 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," Don't Totally Buy the Happy Ending, But That Doesn't Mean I Don't Like It
","Much of the talk swirling around 'Silver Linings Playbook' has centered on Jennifer Lawrence and her feisty performance, but Bradley Cooper is the one who impressed me. Nothing I've yet seen Cooper in prepared me for how good an actor he can be given the right direction and material.The direction and material in this case is supplied by David O. Russell, who has made one movie I outright love ('I Heart Huckabees') and a few others ('Three Kings', 'The Fighter') that have been almost as good. I'm not sure I'd class 'Silver Linings Playbook' at quite the same level, but it's pretty darn good. Cooper, who dominates the film and is in nearly every single scene, plays a troubled man recently released from an institution and determined to get well. Lawrence is an agitated young woman who's got all sorts of issues of her own, and we wait to see if this odd couple is going to end up together at the movie's end. Russell is not a conventional filmmaker, so a happy ending, or at least a conventional one, is not necessarily guaranteed, and I guess the fact that the film ends by resolving everything a little too neatly after giving us such a serious, unrelentingly grim first half is by biggest quibble with it. Still, it's nice to think a story like the one portrayed here could end the way this one does, even if I don't really believe it would.Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver play Cooper's mom and dad, and in a few scenes, Russell is able to brilliantly convey the family dynamic that led to Cooper's issues in the first place.Grade: A-",8,2,13,29 November 2012
The White Ribbon," The Best Horror Film of 2009
","Michael Haneke's super creepy and unsettling film about a small German village in the days leading up to World War I is the best horror movie I've seen in a long time.Things are deeply wrong in this particular village, though they're wrong in ways that are hard to define and which no one will admit. We're introduced to a hard-core patriarchal culture in which men dominate women and children in whatever ways they choose and in which violence and brutality are so seamlessly woven into the fabric of the society they're not even worth commenting on. But the children are watching and learning, and when random, strange and cruel incidents start occurring, it's the children who are most suspect.I don't think Haneke's point is that child abuse led to the rise of Nazism. Of course it's significant that this film is set when it is, and yes, the children in it would be the right age to become the Nazis of the future. But I think Haneke was interested in broader themes and means for his film to be an investigation of how the atrocities of a people at one isolated point in time are the product of a complicated and dysfunctional past. In this particular case, the result of an unhealthy German culture led to the development of Fascism and Nazism. But apply the same scrutiny to other cultures at other points in history (yes, even to the America of today) and watch the skeletons come tumbling out of the closet.Grade: A+",10,2,8,19 October 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fincher Style to Spare, But Terrible Material
","I've not read the book on which David Fincher's newest movie is based, and after seeing the adaptation I certainly don't want to. For it's obvious, even to someone who hasn't read it, that Fincher and company are fighting an up-hill battle against borderline terrible material.That material is all about perversion, sadism, torture, murder, and it's particularly occupied with all of the horrible ways in which men can victimize women. It's the kind of story in which the serial killer gets caught and then delivers a lengthy soliloquy directly to the main protagonist so that the audience can be bluntly told what the writer wasn't creative enough to tell us in any other way and another character can swoop in in the nick of time and stop the serial killer from killing our hero.But Fincher's talents as a director are considerable, as are those of his cast, and the film is pretty entertaining up to a point. But it goes of for far too long, there are one too many story lines, and the material becomes too preposterous to bear. What the film has going for it is the performance of Rooney Mara, sensational as the titular character. Though the film treats her character like crap, Mara herself is hypnotic and carries the film, no small feat given that she by no means has the most screen time (that honor belongs to Daniel Craig, also very good). The incessant violence against women is hard to take after a point -- the story isn't smart enough to make any commentary about that violence, so it just comes to feel uncomfortably gratuitous.One bit of unequivocal praise I can offer this film -- I doubt I will see as kick-ass an opening credits sequence in any other movie this year.Grade: B",7,2,6,20 January 2012
Dreamgirls," Really, Really Bad (I Mean, Really)
","What?....What did you say?....Sorry, I'm having a little trouble hearing you....I think all of the caterwauling in this movie gave me permanent hearing loss.......I'm suing Bill Condon.....Either the stage version of 'Dreamgirls' sucked royally and they made a very faithful (and sucky) film version of it, or the team responsible for transferring the stage hit to screen totally butchered what was at one time a good thing. I doubt I'll ever know, because having sat through this mess once, almost nothing could induce me to come within 10 miles of anything remotely 'Dreamgirls'-related in future.Beyonce Knowles looks gorgeous but completely fades into the background as the lead singer in a black trio loosely based on the Supremes. The group's manager, played with a mumble and a sneer by Jamie Foxx, wants to bring black music to a mainstream white audience, but instead sells out to the man and makes the black performers and the music they sing progressively whiter. One of the trio, Effie, doesn't fit into this scheme. She's too black, too loud, too....er, everything, so she's booted. But never fear, Beyonce sees the error of her ways, makes up with Effie and gives Foxx a what for. This whiff of a plot plays out over two hours, all of it whirling by in a nauseating barrage of images and songs that all sound the same, making one wonder if Bill Condon was trying to break some kind of record for how fast he can make a movie plot move.Someone needs to tell Condon that simply making a film move fast does not make it inherently interesting. Indeed, 'Dreamgirls' is a leaden bore, and what little plot there is is ridiculously hard to follow, because scenes just charge from one to another seemingly at random, songs bleed into one another, and whole decades flash by during montages that don't clearly indicate how much time is supposed to be passing. Jennifer Hudson, who received idolatrous praise for this movie, gives a one-note performance as big-mouthed Effie. I think she was meant to be endearing and spunky, but instead she's aggravating as hell. She sings every song at the same ear-splitting volume, and gives no indication that she's taken the time to understand the words she's singing. It doesn't really matter though, as the songs here do nothing to further the plot, and don't match the characters that sing them. The only songs I remotely liked were 'Love You I Do,' one of the handful written directly for the film, and the pseudo-rap song that Eddie Murphy's character sings at one point (which ends with him dropping his pants!). Effie's big number, 'And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,' is intolerable and actually laughable. Beyonce's big number, 'Listen,' recreates the sound of a pussycat being slowly squeezed through a meat grinder.Speaking of Eddie Murphy, he's the only thing that makes 'Dreamgirls' watchable, and that's really only because he spends all of his screen time doing his Little Richard impression from Saturday Night Live ('I'm getting' in the hot tub!'). Everything else about this movie is a total disaster.Grade: D-",2,1,4,23 July 2007
In the Name of the Father," Rousing Film About the Triumph of Justice
","Following closely on the heels of another movie about the IRA, 1992's 'The Crying Game,' came Jim Sheridan's effective and rousing 'In the Name of the Father,' the true story of a group of men wrongly accused of participating in a series of IRA bombings.This film is fun to watch for its period detail and for the predictably excellent performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. But Emma Thompson, playing the attorney of Day-Lewis and his father (Pete Postlethwaite), though given a much smaller role, really brings some fire to the proceedings through her energetic performance. Thompson had just been discovered by American audiences in 'Howards End' the year before, and was also winning acclaim in 'The Remains of the Day' even as she was making her appearance in this one, and it was refreshing to see her in a more contemporary role.Though nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Day-Lewis), Best Supporting Actor (Postlethwaite), Best Supporting Actress (Thompson) and Best Director, the film was shut out.I'm not a huge fan of Jim Sheridan's movies in general, but I liked this one.Grade: A",8,1,4,9 February 2009
Being John Malkovich," Clever Conceit Runs Away with the Film
","'Being John Malkovich' announced the arrival of Charlie Kaufman as a major new talent among screenwriters, and though I've been resistant to much of his work, including this film, I can't deny that he's certainly established himself as a presence.'Being John Malkovich' is a case of a film being too clever for its own good. The premise is a hoot -- a nerdy dude (John Cusack) discovers a portal that allows those who pass through it to live inside John Malkovich's head for a while. His mousy wife (Cameron Diaz) and new-found fling (a fetching Catherine Keener) want in on the action too, until word is out and there's a virtual stampede of people wanting to be Malkovich.The film is nothing if not original, and it's engaging to a point, but the screenplay gets ahead of Kaufman and the whole thing spins out of control.Malkovich plays himself and gives a performance so grotesque that it was almost unwatchable for me.Grade: B-",6,1,2,29 June 2010
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Funny But Overrated
","There are many humorous moments in this film, and kudos to the creators of it for making an adult movie for adults, but I think the praise heaped on it has made it out to be a much better movie than it is. Given the desultory crop of summer movies we've been subjected to in 2005, it's no wonder that a film that's even remotely original and fresh gets critics frothing at the mouth.This film suffers from what so many screen comedies do: some jokes and scenes just fall flat, and when they do, the whole pace of the movie is thrown off. It's not riotously funny, but there's enough to keep you chuckling through the dead parts.

It takes an outlandish premise to begin with but stretches it to the point that no human being with the ability to think could possibly tolerate it.

The Men Who Stare at Goats," You Don't Need an Oscar to Be the Standout in This Movie
","An only fitfully funny comedy about a journalist (Ewan McGregor) who teams up with an ex-special agent (George Clooney) when he (the journalist) suspects that there's quite a scoop to be found in the agent's history. The film obviously thinks we're going to think it's quite a scoop too, as it employs all manner of self-consciously cutesy hijinks in telling its story about a unit of the U.S. armed forces that tried to harness psychic powers (among other things) in finding non-violent means of combat. The problem is that the story lurches along in fits and starts; the screenwriter stops the flow of action every five minutes or so to give us backstory, some of it relevant, some of it not. As a result, neither narrative thread ever has a chance to build any momentum, and though the running time of the film is tight (a mere 90 minutes) it feels like it meanders on forever.I guess we're supposed to be tickled by the sight of well-known and Oscar-winning actors (like Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey in addition to Clooney) goofing off, but it's the lone non-Oscar winning member of the cast (McGregor) who comes off best.My parents reviled this movie and had me prepared for a stinker.

Jarhead," As Unfocused as the Gulf War Itself
","'Jarhead' is like a 'best-of' compilation film of other classic war movies. At different times, it reminded me of 'Apocalypse Now,' 'Full Metal Jacket,' and David O. Russell's 'Three Kings,' among others. The problem is that it never achieves a style or point of view of its own. As a narrative, it's as unfocused and messy as the war it's about. However, it does manage to send you out of the theatre remembering specific images or moments, so in that way it's effective.Director Sam Mendes obviously wants us to feel the way Martin Sheen's character does in 'Apocalypse': adrift in a surreal nightmare. However, the difference between Coppola's film and this one, and what made the former successful and this one less so, is that even among the madness of Vietnam, the protagonist of 'Apocalypse' had a distinct purpose. The movie was moving toward an eventual goal, which gave the chaos of the rest of the film some foundation. In 'Jarhead,' it's all chaos and no apparent goal, which Mendes seems to be saying is the point of the Gulf War in general, but that doesn't necessarily make for a compelling film.It doesn't help that the characters in 'Jarhead' remain virtual nonentities. They are the stock characters of any war film, easily described in one-word summaries: the 'crazy' guy, the 'sensitive' guy, the 'jaded' guy. We really learn nothing about the central character played by Jake Gyllenhaal, and what we do learn about him is wildly inconsistent.The entire film feels vaguely critical of American military policy in the Middle East, but it never sharpens its critique into any point that has impact. This isn't the first time Mendes (a British director) has pointed his criticism at American values and left me wondering what point he's trying to make. David O. Russell does a much better job in 'Three Kings,' because he introduces an opposing point of view to American actions. 'Jarhead' is so insular, so focused on a bunch of kids that don't have any point of view, that we don't really have a point of view either.But as I said earlier, there are some very memorable sequences in this film, and even if they never really coalesce into anything of substance, taken on their own they have their own emotional impact. I particularly liked the sequence in which the soldiers are being interviewed by American media, but are coached beforehand on what they are and are not allowed to say. That's a much-needed reminder that we at home are likely never really getting the true story of what's going on in foreign lands. Other images, like a horse covered in oil, wandering through burning oil fields; or a highway full of charred cars and bodies, everything still frozen in the exact position it was in at the moment of destruction, come close to equaling some of the images Coppola gave us in his film.America has dug itself into a hole in the Middle East, and who knows how or when we're going to be able to dig ourselves out of it. 'Jarhead' wants to add yet one more dissenting voice to our country's actions, but it doesn't really have anything new to say. If its words were as good as its images, I would say it could be a terrific movie. As it is, it doesn't have the stuff to join the list of all-time great war films.Grade: B",7,1,3,15 November 2005
Collateral," Great Premise But Ultimately Stupid Movie
","'Collateral' takes a promising premise and ruins it with stupid execution.Tom Cruise plays a hit man who pretty much kidnaps cab driver Jamie Foxx and makes him drive him around all night while he does his dirty work. There was plenty of material for an interesting character study, but chronically inconsistent director Michael Mann instead goes the action movie route, which finds Foxx turning into superhero while Cruise tracks him down like the Terminator.Foxx received a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this in the same year that saw him win the lead Oscar for 'Ray.'

Dark City," Wow, I'm Really in the Minority Here
","I've read reviews of 'Dark City' in many places (and many of them here) hailing it as a modern science fiction masterpiece, so boy was I disappointed when I watched it and came to the sober conclusion that it's just not very good. Yeah, yeah, yeah the visuals are stunning, blah, blah, blah, but as is proved time and again, visuals alone can't make a movie. At least this had an interesting story, but as befalls so many films in this mind-bending sci-fi genre (and 'The Matrix' suffers from this as well, though it's a far better movie), the writers have set up such a cerebral concept that the movie grinds to a halt when it has to trudge through all the exposition just so that the audience can keep track of what's going on. Though that in itself is never very clear in 'Dark City.' This movie just rushes from one scene to the next, in an attempt to create a breathless and exciting tone I guess, but scenes aren't allowed to play themselves out. We're on to the next set piece before we've had time to absorb the one we just saw, and the characters get buried underneath all the furious editing. However, I don't believe there would be much chance for them anyway, since most of the actors aren't very good either. Rufus Sewell and William Hurt do o.k. but Jennifer Connelly phones in a wan performance and Kiefer Sutherland is barely watchable in a lamentable impersonation of the creepy Nazi chasing Indiana Jones in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' His line delivery is so eccentric and monotonous that I was cringing every time he opened his mouth by the film's end.No, I'm afraid the majority is out to sea with this one. This film and 'masterpiece' don't belong in the same sentence.Grade: C-",4,61,114,17 September 2005
Dunkirk," A Technically Brilliant Film with No Emotional Center
","'Dunkirk' is the first Christopher Nolan movie since 'Memento' that I've actually liked, mostly because he does the exact opposite of what he does in most of his movies. Rather than build a baffling, incoherent epic around a concept too ambitious to ever make sense as a movie, he crafts a spare, naked film about a very specific and compressed series of events, namely the military disaster that resulted in the messy evacuation of Allied forces from the beaches of Dunkirk in France.The film is technically brilliant. Its stars are its editor, composer, and cinematographer, who work seamlessly together to maintain a throbbing pulse of dread throughout the entire film. There are some big stars in the movie -- like Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, and Tom Hardy -- but they mostly blend into the background of the faceless and nameless many who tried to find a way, any way, to get off the beach before the German forces arrived. Nolan can't resist getting up to some of his old tricks, like some mixed up chronology that makes things somewhat disorienting for the viewer at first. But they're used well and serve the story rather than overwhelming it.I didn't much care for the heavy handed, schmaltzy passages that pepper the later part of the film and feel more like Steven Spielberg than anything that came before it. Indeed, the whole film does feel a bit like 'Saving Private Ryan' in that it spends most of its running time creating a visceral, almost documentary-like recreation of events and then can't help throwing in some old- fashioned Hollywood sentiment as if the director feels he has to reward his audience with some feel- good pap to make up for putting us through the ordeal of everything that precedes it.Overall I admired 'Dunkirk' for its technical craft, but I was mostly left cold by it. It doesn't have any emotional core to it, the feel-good passages aside, which are more bombastic than emotional anyway. There are people to care about in the abstract, but no real characters. These men don't have inner lives, none that we're shown in any case, and that limits the impact of what happens to them. They're representations of men rather than the flesh and blood real thing.Grade: A-",7,1,6,25 August 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The First Potter Film to Feel Like a Film
","Alfonso Cuaron picks up the reigns of the blockbuster film franchise from Chris Columbus. The result is the first Harry Potter movie to feel like a movie and have its own cinematic vision.I haven't read any of the Potter books, and those who have claim that Azkaban isn't as faithful to the source material as the first two movies. Whatever. This movie works in a way the first two didn't, and if story is left out, the excising was done very well, because the film has a narrative drive to it that makes it immensely exciting and clear as a bell to follow. One of the film's highlights is the time travel sequence, helped in no end by Cuaron's swooping, active camera and John Williams' ticking stopwatch score.David Thewlis and Gary Oldman are introduced in the large roles of Professor Lupin and Sirius Black, respectively, and the movie belongs to them. Emma Thompson is briefly hilarious in a couple of small scenes as Madame Trelawney the psychic.Grade: A-",8,3,4,8 October 2010
Ratatouille," Not as Incredible as 'The Incredibles'
","Wow. Number 51 on IMDb's top 250, huh? I thought 'Ratatouille' was cute, but I didn't like it THAT much.Pixar's latest boasts beautiful animation, perhaps the most accomplished yet, but the film as a whole never reached the inspired and dizzy heights attained by 'The Incredibles,' to my mind a small masterpiece. 'Ratatouille' straddles an awkward and ambiguous line: a little too cartoony to be a completely adult film, but a little too sophisticated to be dismissed as a film for kids. It tells a warm and touching story about accepting differences and overcoming our preconceived prejudices, but I kept waiting for that unique brand of Pixar humour that never (or at least rarely) surfaced.The best thing about this film is Peter O'Toole, who plays Anton Ego, a fearsome food critic who delivers a beautiful soliloquy at the film's climax that encourages people to embrace things that are new while still retaining the ability to discriminate between things that are quality and things that are not. The soliloquy also happens to sound beautiful as delivered in O'Toole's mellifluous voice.In a food culture dominated by total crap like McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell (among others) I appreciated 'Ratatouille''s reminder that good, well-prepared food is a way to treat your body while so many people are poisoning theirs'. But I just didn't see the masterpiece here that so many others seem to.Grade: B+",7,2,5,9 July 2007
The Lego Movie," Could Easily See This Making My Top 10 of the Year
","What a blast! My wife and I took our five and three year olds to this movie, and I think we had more fun with it than they did.That's actually not very surprising, since the Lego franchise is defined by sarcastic humor full of pop culture references, many of them references to the pop culture of my own childhood rather than that of the present. 'The Lego Movie' is fast, fun and colorful, and is capped with a surprise twist that had almost as much of an emotional impact on me as the ending of 'Toy Story 3' did, and in the same way.My favorite moment is the appearance of the Millennium Falcon, and the alternate version of what happens to it when it's trying to escape the giant space slug in the asteroid field. If you don't see why that's funny, then you're just not going to like this movie, and I will feel sorry for you.Grade: A",10,1,6,19 February 2014
Aliens," James Cameron's Powerhouse Sequel to 'Alien'
","Say what you will about James Cameron's attempts at more 'serious' film-making ('Titanic'? Ha!), the man does know how to put together an action movie. He takes a completely different approach to this second film in the 'Alien' series than Ridley Scott did to the first -- whereas Scott's film was slow, creepy and scarier for what you didn't see than for what you did, Cameron's is nearly non-stop hard-core action. It works though, and for all the difference in their styles, the two films cohere very well together.In this sequel, the focus moves away from the science/research angle of the first and instead focuses on a group of marines sent to a ghost town of a space station to investigate the disappearance of the colonists. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is along for the ride again, and Cameron uses her fear of what they could potentially be walking into effectively. Whereas in the first one, we were scared because we shared the scientists' cluelessness about what was going on and only learned things as they learned them, in this one we're scared in the same way Ripley is, precisely because we know what's going on and how terrifying it is. And Cameron ups the ante here -- instead of one single alien as a nemesis, this group of marines has to deal with hundreds of them.I'm not really a fan of the subplot involving Newt, the little girl the marines find and who forms an attachment to Ripley. But the story does give Ripley's character a lot of motivation and makes her stand off with the aliens much more personal.I've seen this film a few times, so you'd think it wouldn't hold any suspense for me now, but I just watched it again over the weekend and damned if I wasn't on the edge of my seat.Grade: A",8,5,6,31 March 2008
Dallas Buyers Club," How to Survive an Epidemic
","Matthew McConaughey is currently giving the performance of his career in 'Dalls Buyers Club.' And while that may not be saying much, since McConaughey's career hasn't exactly been an example of acting genius, I should add that his performance is impressive in any context, not just in relation to his own resume. He plays Ron Woodroof, a man who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and given a month to live and decides to take his treatment into his own hands when he begins to gather evidence that AZT, which was being pushed hard by the FDA as THE big AIDS drug at the time, does more harm than good. He opens up a 'buyers club,' in which people with HIV can enroll for a $400/month membership, including access to an alternative drug cocktail. In this way, Woodroof hovered just outside the boundary of legality, because though he acquired the drugs illegally, he wasn't technically selling them. He was selling memberships, and the drugs were a perk.'Dallas Buyers Club' can't escape that syndrome common to many movies that are based on true stories -- the screenplay feels written to hit all of its marks and cover all the basic facts rather than to explore characters, themes or dramatic possibilities. If the subject matter is engrossing enough, this doesn't necessarily have to be a drawback (last year's 'Argo,' for instance). The subject matter of 'Dallas Buyers Club' is certainly interesting, but it didn't have a lot of relevance for me personally. I was 10 in 1985 and the AIDS epidemic isn't something that impacted me or anyone I know personally. The film tries to beef up its universal relevancy by implicating the FDA in general and its focus on making money rather than on protecting the public. But that storyline is only one of many the film charges through to make sure it crosses its 'T's and dots it 'I's.But still, it's a very good movie, and the accolades the cast is receiving are well deserved. Along with McConaughey, Jared Leto is excellent as a wayward transvestite, and Jennifer Garner, who no one is talking about, is quite good as well as a doctor who has misgivings about her own industry's practices.Grade: A-",7,2,7,17 December 2013
The Exorcist," A Steaming Pile of Demon Puke
","A ridiculous and laughable 'horror' film about demonic possession. 'The Exorcist' is simply terrible. William Friedkin directed with an iron fist, and there isn't the least shade of subtlety to this story. You may feel assaulted, but you won't be scared.Poor Ellen Burstyn has to wade her way through this crap in the thankless role of mother to Linda Blair's possessed daughter. The two actresses are quite effective in the film's early scenes, when the possession has yet to fully take hold, and these scenes are the creepiest in the movie. But once Blair is relegated to the bedroom, strapped down to the bed and bedecked with caked-on prosthetics, this movie gives up all claims to seriousness and becomes a procession of shameless shock moments. Jason Miller and Max Von Sydow wander around and intone imperiously as the two priests assigned to the exorcism, and Mercedes McCambridge gives the film's most lively performance as the demon's voice.Disgustingly, Friedkin actually claimed that this film was religiously significant, a ruse that worked, since it became a blockbuster. Times haven't changed. Religious fanatics turned Mel Gibson's bloodbath, 'The Passion of the Christ,' into a cultural phenomenon, and they've done the same to this. If religiously-themed films have taught us anything, it's that religious people certainly do like their Sunday school messages to come packaged in pain and suffering.Grade: D",2,7,18,7 June 2007
Goon," Beer, Buddies and Brawls (Not Necessarily in That Order)
","Seann William Scott proves himself capable of carrying a comedy in this potty-mouthed, and very funny, movie about a lug head who's hired by a flailing hockey team because he's good at fighting.Jay Baruchel, who wrote and produced the film, also stars as Scott's buddy and chief supporter, doing his best to make up for parents (the dad is played by Eugene Levy) who are disappointed with a hockey player son. The ever-delightful Alison Pill is also in the cast as Scott's love interest, and I just want to say that it's about time someone gives this woman a starring role in something. And Liev Schreiber is cast as a crusty soon-to-retire hockey player who serves both as Scott's idol and his arch nemesis.The film is based on a true story, and I suppose I should be at least a little appalled at its unapologetic tendency to glory in brute violence for the sake of brute violence. But I don't look to movies to teach me moral lessons, so I thought it was a lot of fun.Grade: A-",7,0,0,25 July 2012
Gandhi," Serviceable Rather Than Inspired
","Actor turned director Richard Attenborough helmed this biopic about the famed pacifist and, as frequently happens with biopics, especially when they're about noble and revered figures, turned it into something perfectly respectable and ever so slightly dull.The film won just about every Academy Award it was nominated for, so that should tell you something right there.Ben Kingsley does deserve praise for carrying this three-hour epic on his slim shoulders, and the film looks meticulous.

American History X," This Film Is All About Edward Norton's Performance
","Edward Norton came out of nowhere in 1996 to deliver a trio of performances (in 'Everyone Says I Love You,' 'The People vs. Larry Flynt' and 'Primal Fear,' for which he received an Oscar nomination) that left everyone amazed at his versatility. Then came 1998 and his beefed-up performance in 'American History X,' that no one believed he could pull off and then won him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination. I think it's his performance, rather than the movie itself, that people have since reacted so strongly to. He's great, but the movie is a bit of a hot mess.Norton plays a skinhead who goes to prison for a vile crime and comes out a reformed man, determined to see that his little brother (Edward Furlong) doesn't go down the same path he did. But director Tony Kaye doesn't have a disciplined bone in his body, and the film has too much stuff constantly going on to give the story or its actors their due. It also doesn't help that Furlong, whose character we're supposed to be rooting for, is a vaguely unlikable actor who it's hard to warm to.If an actor who on paper looked to be more suited to the role than Norton had played the lead, I wonder if this film would have the cult following it does.Grade: C+",5,4,8,21 June 2010

","Trashing a Michael Bay movie is like shooting fish in a barrel, but what the hell.'Pearl Harbor' makes 'The Rock' seem subtle by comparison. Does that give you an idea of what you're in for? The historical bombing of the Hawaiian military installation is given the Bay treatment, which means everyone in it looks like they should be posing in an Ambercrombie & Fitch catalogue, and the terrible devastation is pure titillation disguised as an 'important' history lesson.Nobody gets out of this one unscathed, but Cuba Gooding, Jr., as a religious cook, and Jon Voight, as FDR, fare especially badly.Grade: D",2,2,5,27 July 2010
Jackie," Frustratingly Superficial
","If you already know a lot about Jackie Kennedy and what made the woman tick (which I don't), this film named after her and chronicling the days surrounding the assassination of her husband and our nation's president might be fascinating. Those looking to this film to teach them something about the former first lady will be sorely disappointed.'Jackie' is a tone poem of moods, one that remains frustratingly superficial when one wants it to delve deeper into the psyche of this woman who made such a deep impression on American popular culture. Natalie Portman, who received an Oscar nomination for bringing Jackie Kennedy back to life, is pretty good I guess, but she's really only asked to convey a procession of emotions that exist independently of one another rather than create a complete character. 'Jackie' is about all of the things in relation to JFK's assassination that I didn't care much about (Jackie wandering around the White House trying on gowns while chain smoking) and about none of the things that I would have found interesting (like the actual impact the event had on her and her legacy).Billy Crudup appears as an interviewer, Greta Gerwig is on hand as Jackie's right-hand woman, and Peter Sarsgaard makes no attempt to look or sound like Bobby Kennedy. But this is Portman's film all the way.The film received two additional Oscar nods, one for Best Costume Design, which went to Madeleine Fontaine for recreating Jackie's signature period style (including the famous pink suit) and the other for Best Original Score, for Mica Levi's sparse music.Grade: B",6,0,0,5 May 2017
Tropic Thunder," Funniest Movie of 2008?
","I always find movies and actors that are willing to lampoon themselves and their own business to be a breath of fresh air, and 'Tropic Thunder' is nothing but Hollywood lampooning itself.If you've found this comment, you likely already know what this movie is about, so there's no need for a summary from me. I'll just say that I thought it was very funny, and proof that Hollywood is capable of making a comedy that can be enjoyed by adults. The principal male cast gels wonderfully, even if Robert Downey Jr. completely steals the show as a dude dressed up as a dude playing another dude, with even the big name actors in cameos (I'm talking to you, Tom Cruise) doing their material justice.If Hollywood is going to insist on making disposable formula films, at least it's a comfort to know that IT knows that it's making disposable formula films. Nothing would be more depressing than to think that Hollywood is giving us movies like the one being made fun of in 'Tropic Thunder' in all seriousness.Grade: A",8,2,5,2 September 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Who Needs the 7 Deadly Sins When You Have 7 Deadly Exes?
","'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is a visually inventive film that takes the idea of competing with ex-boyfriends and girlfriends to literal extremes.Michael Cera plays Scott Pilgrim, whose confidence with girls has been decimated by ill treatment from a former fling. He falls hard for Ramona, a blue-haired rollerblader, but to win her hand, he must first defeat her seven deadly exes, video game style.This movie will probably not be for everyone. It's got a hyper, jokesy and self-aware tone that could get old if you're not in the mood for it. But I had a lot of fun with it, and especially with the seven exes, three of whom are played pretty hilariously by Chris Evans, Brandon Routh and Jason Schwartzmann.Look also for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo by Thomas Jane, playing a member of the vegan police.Grade: A-",8,3,9,11 January 2011
Enchanted," It's Nice to See That Disney Can Make Fun of Itself
","A cute and diverting Disney film that pokes fun at other Disney films.Amy Adams does fine work as a cartoon princess named Giselle who is banished to that frightening, sinister world otherwise known as New York City by an evil queen (Susan Sarandon) who doesn't want her marrying her dashing stepson, Prince Edward (James Marsden), and stealing her crown away from her. Giselle winds up in the care of Patrick Dempsey (who's come a long way since his days as a gigolo pizza delivery guy in 'Loverboy'), an uptight divorce attorney who doesn't believe in true love. Giselle of course, in true Disney princess fashion, believes in nothing else, and the two fall predictably in love, much to the dismay of Edward, who has followed Giselle to New York.Much of the humor in 'Enchanted' revolves around contrasting fairytale mannerisms and beliefs to the, shall we say slightly more jaded, attitudes of modern-day New York. Giselle and Edward are both completely lacking in irony or sarcasm, and don't understand feelings like anger or scorn. They both also have a habit of breaking out into big production numbers at the most inopportune times, which provides the film with its highlights. When Giselle wants to clean up a messy apartment, she enlists the help of God's creatures, just like Snow White did so many years ago, but the ones that show up here are pigeons, rats, roaches and an army of flies. It would be easy to dismiss Adams' performance as unchallenging, but I think it would take a lot of skill to carry a movie like this, and she does it well. Marsden is also quite funny as the pompous prince with gleaming white teeth. Demspey is kind of droopy, while Susan Sarandon hams things up as the wicked stepmother. The film grows rather tiresome by its conclusion; the filmmakers can't resist a CGI showdown between the queen (in the guise of a giant purple dragon) and our lovers. But overall it left me entertained.Grade: B+",7,1,3,14 December 2007

It's the kind of movie that garners a cult following (which it has) and that's better enjoyed if you know nothing about it. There's a big surprise ending (one of the most famous in film history) that will spoil the film if you know it beforehand. In fact, I wonder if the film would hold up as well to a second viewing once you know what's coming.Received Academy Awards for its screenplay and for the performance of Kevin Spacey, before anyone realized that Spacey would just deliver the same sardonic performance in every movie he'd make from that point forward.Grade: A",8,1,2,12 May 2009
The Duchess," Drag Out Your Period Garb for Another Uninspired Stroll Through History
","Keira Knightley has become the go-to actress for portraying spunky feminist characters in period dramas. In her latest, she plays the Duchess of Devonshire, who challenges her husband's right to openly philander by doing some open philandering of her own. But of course she finds that double standards reign supreme, and we are shown the sacrifices a woman is willing to make in order to stay with her children.The movie is period designed to the hilt, and everything else about it (writing, acting, directing) is fine, but none of it is exceptional. Mostly, it just made me want to watch 'Barry Lyndon' again. The movie doesn't distinguish itself from a hundred other period films you've seen that are just like it, and beyond the specifics of the Duchess's life (which may be enough for some viewers), it doesn't tell us anything we don't already know.I take that back -- it did answer one question for me. If you're wondering whether or not all of those towering wigs surrounded by all of those burning candelabras ever resulted in a pyrotechnic mishap, they did.

Quantum of Solace," Bond Needs to Lighten Up
","Let's get it out of the way and answer the question everyone wants to know the answer to: Daniel Craig's sophomore outing as James Bond is not as good as 'Casino Royale.' I've never been a James Bond fan, and 'Casino Royale' was really the first one I've ever liked. So I'm not comparing 'Quantum of Solace' or Daniel Craig to any of the other Bonds. On its own terms, 'Solace' just isn't that much fun. It's certainly fast, and it has plenty of rapid cut action sequences that films like this seem to require. But it also has a brutal, dogged quality to it, and there isn't anything here that you haven't seen done a hundred times (notably in the recent Bourne movies, which have more intriguing story lines to along with their well-orchestrated action sequences) and done better.Craig is still refreshingly scrappy when compared to Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan, but he's also turned Bond into a rather boring character, more terminator than international man of mystery.Grade: B",6,3,6,27 November 2008

The Dirty Dozen," The 1960s' Version of World War II
","Robert Aldrich's hugely entertaining WWII film channeled through the anti-establishment sentiments of a 1967 America.Lee Marvin plays a troublesome Army major who's given the assignment of training a bunch of convicts for a suicide mission behind German enemy lines. Half of the film is a precursor to Army comedies like 'MASH' and 'Private Benjamin,' complete with hijinks and wargames. The second half, which shows the actual mission put into play, turns serious and contains the film's most unsettling commentary on war. What these murderers and rapists are asked to do by the military is almost too heinous even for them, yet the ones who survive are commended by the very people who treated them like scum before.The Dirty Dozen of the film's title is comprised of a host of recognizable faces like Donald Sutherland (superb as a dimwit), Charles Bronson (surprisingly good; I never gave him much credit for being a good actor), Telly Savalas (grossly overplaying his murderous religious fanatic character), John Cassavetes (Oscar-nominated) and Clint Walker (built like a brick s*ithouse!). The Army brass is played by Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy and Robert Ryan, who gets a chance to show off his comedic side as Marvin's arch rival.This film, and especially its last half, provided much of the inspiration for Quentin Tarantino's latest (and also very good) WWII film, 'Inglourious Basterds.'

Gone with the Wind," Frankly....This Is One Fine Movie
","I know 'Gone with the Wind' has been teased to death, and there seems to be a sort of snob appeal among the film critical community in denegrating this film as overblown Hollywood melodrama. But the thing that impresses me about 'Gone with the Wind' after seeing it recently on the big screen is that it's one hell of a good movie. The entire first half moves with a propulsive energy that not many films can match. Victor Fleming (billed as director, though there were at least four director names attached to the project) stages one sensational set piece after another, and hardly a scene goes by without a quotable line or a memorable image.The success of any adaptation of 'Wind' is going to rely greatly on its Scarlett, and here I can't say enough about Vivien Leigh's performance. I quite simply cannot imagine any other actress in this role, so perfectly does Ms. Leigh embody it. She's in virtually every scene, but even after four hours of her, I'm not tired of her, and her ability to captivate the screen while she's on it doesn't lessen for an instant.Clark Gable is Clark Gable, perfect for his role as well and an able match for Leigh, but his performance plays as window dressing as compared to Leigh's powerhouse work.I also want to mention Olivia de Havilland. In her own way, she is just as powerful in her role as Leigh is in Scarlett's. Melanie's character is less dynamic and so by sheer necessity de Havilland is frequently upstaged by Leigh. But she holds her own nonetheless. And what struck me is the chemistry the two actresses have when on screen together. The scene in which Scarlett attends a party dressed in bright red, braving the gossip she knows will attend her presence, and Melanie walks slowly forward, determined to prove herself a refined lady by welcoming Scarlett unconditionally, is a tour de force for both actresses.I take points away for some soap operatic elements in the second half that grind the story to a halt, but otherwise this film deserves its place as one of the greatest achievements in American cinematic history.Grade: A",9,8,15,29 April 2005
Legends of the Fall," When Will Edward Zwick Stop Inflicting His Movies on Us?
","Edward Zwick makes pretty but quite terrible movies, and 'Legends of the Fall' is no exception.This leisurely yarn has something to do with brothers working on a cattle ranch falling for the same woman. I don't remember much about it except for numerous shots of Brad Pitt riding by on a horse, lovely locks flowing in the breeze, and a rather embarrassing performance by Anthony Hopkins, who plays the brothers' dad and spends the last half of the film stumbling around after his character suffers a stroke. Julia Ormond is pretty but vapid -- she's a less talented and less interesting version of Juliette Binoche.The whole thing might go down smoother if director Zwick didn't feel the need to constantly pound everything down your throat.Grade: C-",4,3,7,17 March 2009
No Country for Old Men," A Minor American Classic, Friendo
","'No Country for Old Men,' the Coen brothers' screen adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's nailbiter of a novel, is doggedly faithful to its source, which will please fans of the book, but which is also what limits it from achieving greatness. As it is, the movie will probably and deservedly be remembered as a minor classic, but that's due more to its execution than it is its subject matter. It's as accomplished as 'Fargo,' still the Coens' best movie in my opinion, but it doesn't carry a powerful message the way that film did, or have any characters who make a lasting impression.Josh Brolin plays a Vietnam veteran living in Texas sometime in the early 1980s who comes across a satchel of money ($2 million to be exact) at the scene of a drug deal gone bad. He takes off with it, his arrogance leading him to believe that he will be able to outsmart whoever comes looking for it. Who comes looking for it is Anton Chigurgh, a relentless psycho who's as untraceable as he is unstoppable (played by Javier Bardem). Tommy Lee Jones plays sheriff Ed Tom Bell, who provides the film with a voice over narration in which he laments the state of the world and the awful nature of crime in his day as compared to those of his dad and granddad, both sheriffs before him. In McCarthy's novel, all of this is told in clipped and deadly serious language, and it all feels more full of philosophical import than it is; it's not until you've put the book down and start thinking about it that you realize how lightweight it is. I was interested to see if the Coens would bring any depth to the material that wasn't inherently there. They don't. Therefore, the movie is supremely engrossing and suspenseful, and I hung on every scene and image they put on the screen, but it didn't feel like an important movie to me. On the other hand, who says that every movie has to be important? The Coens bring some of their trademark ghoulish humor to the film, which was welcome, because I thought McCarthy could have lightened up a bit himself in the novel. The film feels oddly unemotional, mostly because all of the principal action revolves around characters who aren't remotely sympathetic (including Brolin's, who's a bit of a jerk really, when you think about it). The warmest character in the film is Brolin's wife, played in a lovely performance by the Scottish actress Kelly McDonald, but her part is tiny, and the character herself has little to do other than look perplexed or suspicious. I thought Bardem lacked the menace necessary to pull off Chigurgh, who's more of a supernatural representation of evil than a real character; I couldn't help but think what Benicio Del Toro could have done with the role. And Woody Harrelson pops up miscast as a hit-man, in a role as pointless in the movie as it is in the book.But again, all of these weaknesses were things the Coens inherited from the source material. They've made the best movie possible of McCarthy's novel, and 'No Country for Old Men' easily joins 'Fargo,' 'Blood Simple,' 'Miller's Crossing,' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There' at the top of their canon.Grade: A",9,4,9,2 December 2007
District 9," Well Executed, But Demoralizing and Depressing
","Why isn't anyone talking about how similar 'District 9' is to 'Avatar,' the other attention-getting sci-fi film of the year?In both, a man belongs to an organization intent on oppressing an alien race. In both, he undergoes a kind of transformation that puts him in the aliens' place and causes him to sympathize with them. In both, the villains are thuggish military types, horror-show caricatures.Unfortunately for 'District 9,' though its similarities beg comparison to 'Avatar,' it pales in comparison in just about every respect. It's a well-made allegorical tale about apartheid in South Africa, but I can't say I enjoyed watching it, as it's nasty and harrowing in a way that's off putting rather than exhilarating. The main character is sprayed with a liquid that causes him to become one of the aliens, and his slow transformation, as his human body disintegrates, is dealt with in stomach-churning detail. Also, the film's version of humanity is depressing and demoralizing, as is its depiction of an alien race. It was hard to root for anyone, because nothing much seemed worth saving. I just felt bad after it was over, and like I needed to take a shower.Grade: B",6,1,4,15 January 2010
Mamma Mia!," Relentlessly Awful
","If this aggressively, sadistically cheerful movie does not make you want to jab a fork into your eye within the first two minutes, then you and I should probably never get together for drinks.A stage musical based on the songs of ABBA was probably an unnecessary endeavor to begin with, so a movie based on that stage musical is unnecessary to the second power. But was that any reason to inflict a film this terribly made and relentlessly un-entertaining on its audience? Who was director Phyllida Lloyd trying to punish anyway?'Mamma Mia!' the movie! retains a single monotonous! tone of mania! that I think is supposed to be wacky but instead comes across as deranged. I didn't think I could be embarrassed by a Meryl Streep performance, but this movie proves that there's a first time for everything. Streep mugs and writhes and jumps up and down on beds and emotes to pointless songs shoe-horned into a vapid plot to the point where I just wanted someone (the grip, the script supervisor, anyone) to shoot her and put her out of her misery. But the misery inflicted by Streep's performance is nothing compared to the misery endured having to listen to Pierce Brosnan sing ABBA songs in the style of Bruce Springsteen. Wonderful actresses like Julie Walters and Christine Baranski are asked to behave like fifteen-year-old girls (which is the only demographic I can even come close to seeing this film appeal to, by the way). Other nightmarish images flash across my eyes when I think back on this movie, like a phalanx of male dancers wearing scuba flippers and a fleeting glimpse of Stelan Skarsgaard's naked ass. Everyone looks like they're having a good time, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were doing so at gunpoint.What's next, a musical based on television commercial jingles?

The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Pitt the Major Flaw in This Otherwise Strange and Beautiful Western
","2007 is shaping up to be the year of the Western revival.There's not much need of a plot summary for 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,' because it's all right there in the title. And there's not much plot to summarize anyway. This is a movie more interested in character than plot and more interested really in aesthetics than character, and it's a strangely fascinating film. It's certainly one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time.The young actor Casey Affleck is a revelation as James's assassin. His Robert Ford is awkward and stammering, whose appearance and behavior leads people to believe he's dumber than he is. His idolatry of Jesse James is fueled by the dime novels he collects and in which James so frequently appears. The character as written is somewhat obtuse; I'm not sure I completely ever understood what makes Ford turn on James, or when the change in his feeling occurs. But Affleck does wonders with what he's given to work with and gives one of the best performances I've seen thus far in the year. Unfortunately, at the film's center is Brad Pitt, and he creates a vacuum which the film succeeds in spite of rather than being dragged down by. Pitt is simply not a good actor, but his good looks and sheen of Hollywood glamour will assure that film makers keep giving him starring roles. I kept thinking about Russell Crowe's marvelous performance as an outlaw in '3:10 to Yuma' and couldn't help but wonder how much better this film would have been if Crowe had been cast instead. Pitt doesn't sink the film, because the cast he's surrounded by does such good work (in addition to Affleck, Sam Rockwell is a stand out as Robert Ford's older brother), but he prevents it from being even better than it otherwise could be.Some may be turned off by the film's formality; virtually every shot looks like a carefully composed photograph. But I thought the film's tone and visual style matched the subject. After all, we're talking about a legendary figure here, someone who's as much myth as man, so why not give the movie the imprint of myth as well? 'Jesse James' isn't much interested in ideas, though I think it wants to be. Only in the movie's final moments, after Ford has assassinated James and then suffers the harassment of a public that decides to idolize James in his death and deride Ford as a coward, does the film toy with the question of what distinguishes a hero from a villain. It doesn't come to any conclusions, and because of Pitt's inadequate performance, it never explains why James was able to make himself into a legend while Ford died a figure of infamy. But I was willing to let the film's sheer physical beauty and fine supporting cast sweep me along with them and cause me to not care too much about anything else.Grade: A-",8,4,10,10 October 2007
Batman Begins," Second Best of the Series
","It still doesn't beat Tim Burton's first film, but 'Batman Begins' is better than the rest of the Batman movies to date. Christian Bale makes a terrific Bruce Wayne--he may be the best actor to have played him so far. And top-tier actors like Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, while maybe not greatly challenged by the material given them, still make the most of smaller roles.My biggest problem with this film was its structure. The first 20-25 minutes of the movie are actually quite boring; there's so much plot exposition and back story to work through that the film grinds to a halt trying to slog through it. However, once Bruce Wayne begins his actual transformation to Batman, it's as if someone flicked the power switch on and the movie takes flight. From that point forward, it's a lot of fun, dark and brooding, as Batman should be, but also full of that cheeky brand of humour common to comic books.There are many times when I wish the fight scenes had been more visible; director Chrisotpher Nolan shoots everything so close and edits everything so fast that you can't really see what's going on, a shame since there are plenty of opportunities for sensational fight choreography. But there's enough in this movie to like to make criticisms like this seem like afterthoughts.Grade: B+",7,2,5,5 July 2005
To Rome With Love," Not Much Love for 'Rome'
","One of Woody Allen's easily disposable movies, full of half-baked ideas and a bunch of story lines, none of which is interesting enough, either dramatically or comedically, to hold your interest.The best part of the film, other than its gorgeous Italian setting, is the presence of Allen himself and that of one of his regulars, Judy Davis. Any time the film veered away from them, I sat impatiently waiting for their return, despite the fact that the film gives these two actors, both so talented at being funny, absolutely nothing funny to do. But the film doesn't give any of its cast -- which includes Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, Roberto Benigni and Penelope Cruz -- anything to do either, so Davis certainly shouldn't take it personally. She just landed herself in one of Allen's stinkers. Too bad she couldn't have gotten a part in 'Blue Jasmine,' a film that reminded me why I return to Allen again and again despite his tendency to make three terrible movies for every good one.Grade: C-",4,1,4,20 September 2013
Bridesmaids," Wiig Tries Hard, But This Is No 'Baby Mama'
","A moderately funny comedy that highlights the considerable talents of the under-utilized Kristen Wiig and makes you wish she had been given better material to work with.When Wiig and her 'Saturday Night Live' fellow alumna, Maya Rudolph, are on screen together, the chemistry is palpable and makes one wonder why someone didn't think to give these two a buddy comedy along the lines of 'Baby Mama.' But instead, Rudolph gets little screen time, and the show belongs to Wiig. Wiig is a very funny comedienne, but the character she gets to play wears out her welcome early on, long before the movie wants to let her learn the lesson all such formulaic comedies must have their main characters learn and rebound for that happy ending. Therefore, the crash and burn that Wiig's character endures becomes pathetic instead of funny, despite Wiig's frantic efforts to wring comedy out of situations that don't lend themselves much to laughs.Still, the film is a diverting enough amusement for a Friday night, and there are enough laughs to make some of the more mediocre parts worth sitting through.Grade: B",6,0,2,25 November 2011
Before Sunset," Growing Up and Growing Apart

Both are scared that their memories of what they connected to so much in the other won't be accurate, and that a moment that has been fixed in both their lives like a shining diamond will be tarnished.'Before Sunset' pulses with the melancholy inherent in growing up and maturing.

The Princess Bride," A Uniquely Charming Fairy Tale
","This utterly charming fairy tale for grownups proves that Rob Reiner and Ron Howard must have gone to the same school of film-making -- both are at their best when they're being light-heartedly whimsical, but make absolutely dreadful films when they try to get serious.This film wouldn't have been anywhere nearly as good if everyone involved had tried to make something more ambitious. Instead, a great cast delivers sweet and funny material, and the emphasis is on characters and story rather than gee-whiz special effects.In a large ensemble of recognizable faces, the standouts for me are Wallace Shawn, in perhaps the funniest poisoning scene ever made, and (I can't believe I'm saying this) Mandy Patinkin as a swarthy swashbuckler. This is the only time in his woeful career that he has appeared on a screen and not utterly repulsed me. It helps that he doesn't sing.Grade: A",9,1,5,23 June 2008
Saving Private Ryan," One of the Most Overrated Films Ever
","Count me among the group of dissenters that thinks 'Saving Private Ryan' is 20 minutes of technically expert film-making capped by 140 minutes of monotonous war film punctuated by treacly and typical Spielbergian emotional histrionics.Spielberg's attempts at meticulously recreating the Omaha Beach invasion that take up the first half hour or so of this film are stunning. But the film grinds to a halt after that with a lame story and shallow characters that go nowhere. Spielberg wants us all to feel guilty (doesn't he always) about what soldiers in WWII went through, but his way to do that is to throw brutal violence in our faces every few minutes. The thing is, it's not the violence that makes other and better war films bring home the horrors of war to its audience; it's the depiction of what war does to a man's psyche. It's another film from 1998 set during WWII combat, Terence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line,' that stands as the year's masterpiece about war. But audiences ignored that film because Malick wasn't willing to hold their hands and tell them how they should feel, something Spielberg could teach a class in.Grade: B",6,5,10,21 June 2010
The Pianist," Polanski's New Spin on an Old Classic
","Before seeing 'The Pianist,' I thought there couldn't possibly be a movie about the Holocaust that could tell me something I didn't already know, or make me feel an emotion I haven't already felt a hundred times before about the topic. But director Roman Polanski proved me wrong.There's a scene in 'The Pianist' in which Nazis invade a Jewish apartment building and 'clean out' its tenants. They pick up an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, carry the chair to the edge of the balcony, and casually tip him over the edge to fall to his death on the pavement below. The moment shocked me in a way that nothing in Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List' did, I think precisely because, unlike Spielberg, Polanski isn't interested in manipulating his audience into feeling something. The strength of his movies has always been that they unfold with a detached, objective point of view and let audiences draw their own conclusions. The scene described above is so shocking because Polanski does nothing to embellish it and therefore never draws attention to the fact that you're watching a movie.The rest of the film is like that -- it's harrowing and unpleasant at times, but it also rewards the viewer by saying something about a historical event when I didn't think there was anything left to say.Grade: A",9,2,3,4 August 2010
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson Off His Game
","I don't know that I'd call 'The Grand Budapest Hotel,' Wes Anderson's latest bit of whimsy, exactly a misfire, but I certainly didn't like it as much as some of his other recent films.Almost always there's a strong emotional core to Anderson's films that anchors the idiosyncratic absurdity that defines his style. But that emotional core is missing in this film, leaving us with a slew of Anderson creations, cartoonish characters that don't engage us because they're not given time to. His film is stuffed with famous names, some of them Anderson regulars, some of them new to his world, but virtually all of them are given short shrift. I was excited when, for example, Jason Schwartzman made his entrance, because he's been given the opportunity in previous Anderson movies to make such a comedic impression, but he gets about two minutes of unremarkable screen time before the story whisks on to the next disposable character. It's the first Wes Anderson film I can think of that caused me to actually be annoyed by his self conscious style, a sure sign that in other respects Anderson was off his game.I should add, though, that Ralph Fiennes is sensational. His performance is the one thing about the film I can praise without reservation.Grade: B",6,27,49,2 April 2014

","'The Transporter' is a not bad action flick that, true to the genre, is heavy on the action and not much else.Don't look here for a plot you can sink your teeth into. The focus is on outrageous and at times downright dazzling set pieces designed to show off the athleticism of star Jason Statham. He's a relaxed and easy to watch action hero, and as long as he's engaged in kicking butt he easily carries the film, but he doesn't have the charm of, say, a Jackie Chan, and he doesn't do as well with the scenes where he's actually required to speak. But fortunately, he's not required to speak frequently, and when he is, he's only asked to deliver a few words at a time. Wise decision by the screenwriters.You're not going to add any points to your I.Q., but you just might have a good time.Grade: B+",7,0,0,4 April 2006
The Favourite," Deliciously Wicked
","'The Favourite' is a deliciously wicked and fictionalized account of what might have taken place between Queen Anne of England, her friend and confidante Lady Sarah, and a maid with aspirations named Abigail, as Sarah and Abigail vied for the Queen's favor.Director Yorgos Lanthimos, whose last two films, 'The Lobster' and 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer,' were marred by his determination to make his audience queasy, goes a little easier on us with this one. If you like his style, don't worry -- the film has his fingerprints all over it. But whereas those other films mentioned were so weird as to pull me out of the narrative, 'The Favourite' is more like 'Dogtooth,' the film that introduced me to Lanthimos in the first place, in that the weirdness is hypnotic and kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see where this whacky movie was going to go next. And unlike 'The Lobster,' which apparently was supposed to be a comedy, 'The Favourite' actually made me laugh many times.The acting is stellar, with Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone all giving crackerjack performances. The film explores the lengths to which people will go in order to yield power over one another. Though all three ladies get plenty of opportunities to shine, the film feels more 'about' Abigail than anyone, and we watch her first wrestle with her morals as she realizes how skeezy she will have to be to beat Lady Sarah at her game, then commit to doing what she has to do to be top dog, and finally left wondering why she wanted to be top dog in the first place, a warning given to her by rival Lady Sarah that she refuses to heed. And Olivia Colman's Queen Anne is a wolf in sheep's clothing, her physical and emotional frailty a camouflage for her monstrous obsession with being adored.'The Favourite' looks stunning, the kind of film that wins Oscars for production design, costume design, and cinematography but actually deserves them. The film reminded me once in a while of Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon' in its look and tone, though 'The Favourite' isn't afraid to get its hands dirty whereas 'Barry Lyndon' remained stately and pristine.Easily one of the best movies of the year.Grade: A+",10,23,47,3 December 2018
Seabiscuit," Use the DVD as a Coaster If You Want Your Full Money's Worth
","Using your copy of 'Seabiscuit' to set drinks on would be a more interesting use for it than actually playing the boring thing. Oh, what a safe, boring, dull movie this is. Gary Ross obviously went to the Ron Howard school of directing, where points are pounded home with a hammer and anvil and manipulated emotions are manufactured with assembly-line rapidity. This is the kind of movie where everyone delivers lines that sound like they should be on self-help bumper stickers; homilies are handed out like parking tickets. And the movie doesn't end until each character gets to deliver at least one clunker, and most of them get to deliver many more. 'Seabiscuit' isn't even really a bad movie--it's an uninteresting movie, which is much worse. Even bad movies can be fascinating, but the filmmakers here aim so low at trying to please the lowest common denominator of viewer that they've put together a batch of pandering mush that has not one genuine emotion in it.Yuck...Grade: F",2,6,16,29 April 2005

That's what you have with 'Tucker and Dale vs. Evil,' a very funny horror comedy that upends the psychotic-hillbilly motif that's played so straight in so many other movies by having the hillbillies be sweet, lovable guys who don't understand why a bunch of preppy college kids are attacking them.Not only is the movie funny, but it's surprisingly sweet and smart, with two terrific performances at its center and some clever writing throughout that prevents what could have been a one-note joke from imploding.And I'm going to start including 'frat bitch' as part of my standard vocabulary.Grade: A",8,2,2,1 June 2012
Revolutionary Road," Everything This Movie Has to Say Has Been Said Before and Said Better
","The subject of suburban misery and malaise, and the myth of the American dream, has been dealt with so frequently in movies, television and literature that you may wonder what more there is to say about the topic. If 'Revolutionary Road' is any example, the answer is: not much. Indeed, the whole time I was watching this strangely insubstantial film from director Sam Mendes, the only thing I could think of were all the other movies I've seen that have dealt with the same themes and dealt with them better.Frank and April Wheeler are the miserably married couple at the center of this story. Frank, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, goes off to work in a featureless anthill of a company, diddling the occasional office girl on the side. April stays home and frets over the acting career that never materialized for her and rebelling against the stifling sameness of suburbia that she feels she's better than. Most of the film consists of monotonous scenes of these two screaming at each other. I guess it's meant to be a sort of modern-day 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?', the story of a married couple who could be helping one another but instead decide to tear each other apart, except that the material isn't nearly as interesting as Edward Albee's play, and neither are the characters.For 'Revolutionary Road' to work, we have to really understand why April is so unhappy, and that's something the film doesn't tell us. Kate Winselt tries awfully hard, but she can't make much of this rather unlikable character. She didn't have my sympathy because I never understood her problem. I understand suburban unhappiness in general, but I didn't understand it as presented here. DiCaprio has the easier time of it, because Frank it turns out isn't all that unhappy with his life, and pretends to be so largely for April's benefit. The film doesn't establish much about these two before they met or about the early days of their marriage. We're supposed to feel emotions about them in a vacuum without any context. I didn't feel anything.There's not much relief from DiCaprio and Winslet, as one or the other is in virtually every frame of the movie. There are a couple of recognizable actors in supporting roles, namely Kathy Bates as a real estate agent friend and Michael Shannon as her bonkers son. This character is wedged awkwardly into the narrative as the movie's id, shouting out truths everyone else is trying to avoid having to admit, but Shannon's performance is over the top and I didn't know what I was supposed to make of him.With wonderful films like 'Far from Heaven,' 'The Hours,' 'All That Heaven Allows' and 'Little Children' (which stars Winslet in a stunning turn, no less) and the cable series 'Mad Men' exploring the same themes as 'Revolutionary Road' but much more capably, there's really no reason to waste your time or money on this gloomy, depressing movie that has nothing to say. It's not an awful movie, but at the same time it has very little to recommend it.Grade: C",5,22,38,14 January 2009
Foxcatcher," Like Watching Bugs Eat Each Other in a Jar
","In 'Foxcatcher,' director Bennett Miller goes for a slow-boiling sense of building tension, but he keeps such tight reins on his film that he ends up almost suffocating it. Its clinical restraint works well at the beginning, but as things progress and something rotten begins to emerge from out of the film's bizarre true-life story, he refuses to change the film's pace and it begins to drag when it should be moving toward a conclusion.I couldn't find much fault in the film's acting though, especially in Steve Carrell's uber-creepy portrait of a member of the DuPont family who serves as a nightmare version of the sense of privilege and exception that the super-wealthy can have about themselves. Channing Tatum hasn't completely convinced me that he's not just a flash in the pan, but he went a long way to earning my respect as the block-headed wrestler who wants to get out of the shadow of his brother and falls for DuPont's spell. And Mark Ruffalo brings his scruffy naturalness to the role of Channing's older brother, the biggest victim of the film and the only thing that comes close to giving this twisted and sordid tale something warm and normal to anchor it. Indeed, my biggest problem with the film is that it's like watching bugs in a jar -- it's so clinical and detached that I found myself morbidly fascinated watching these particular insects eat each other but not caring all that much about the outcome.Grade: B",7,1,5,1 February 2015
28 Days Later...," Decent Idea....Not Very Good Movie
","'28 Days Later' would be a much better movie if the film makers had known what story they wanted to tell. As it is, they start with a high-concept apocalyptic plague premise that degenerates into a slap-dash, jumbled action movie. I suppose Danny Boyle and screenwriter are trying to make the idea of people being infected with rage relevant to our current troubled world state (the film begins with an image of multiple T.V. monitors each showing news footage of one violent action or another), but I think they are much more taken with the idea of making a gross-out movie that will appeal to the alternative grunge crowd, not realizing that grunge is now cliché. What is supposed to feel cutting edge feels stale and like something you've seen done before and done better. The movie gets kudos from me for its visual look, and I do admit that it's never boring, but there's a general feeling of senseless nastiness that negates any message you're going to get from this.Grade: C",4,0,1,29 April 2005
Lawrence of Arabia," Majesty in the Desert
","The moment David Lean makes you aware you are in the hands of a master comes early on in 'Lawrence of Arabia.' Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) holds a lit match close to his lips and with one quick puff of air blows it out. Before the action is even completed, however, Lean has cut to a shot of a desert vista, with the sun slowly rising over the lip of the horizon. It's one of the most famous elliptical edits in cinema history, second maybe only to the bone/spaceship cut in '2001: A Space Odyssey.' And it's only the first of countless memorable moments in 'Lawrence of Arabia.' The appeal of David Lean epics has always been his ability as a director to maintain an equilibrium between the scope of his films and the characters in them. Character development is never sacrificed to massive set pieces or knock-your-socks-off action sequences. 'Lawrence of Arabia' has these elements too, but at heart it's a character study of one remarkable man. Lean seemed to understand that impressive landscapes alone are not inherently interesting; but if you place a fascinating character among those impressive landscapes, you can have movie magic.'Lawrence' feels unlike other historical epics of its time. In most 'big' films--I'm thinking of movies like 'Ben-Hur,' 'Spartacus,' 'Cleopatra,' all movies that premiered roughly around the same time as 'Lawrence'--one gets the sense that directors framed compositions based on how much they were able to fit into their widescreen lenses. One rarely sees characters filmed from anything closer than a medium shot, and usually the background is stuffed to overflowing with garish art direction. Everything feels static and wooden. But in 'Lawrence,' Lean keeps his frames constantly alive by juxtaposing huge landscape shots with extreme close-ups of actor faces. In one especially brutal scene, after a battle that results in the slaughter of many people, the action cuts to a close-up of O'Toole, looking panicked and crazed, gripping a bloody knife in his hand as if he's reluctant to drop it, obviously both disturbed and titillated by the carnage he just witnessed. It's moments like that---not just an impressive battle scene but a character's reactions to the results of that scene---that set 'Lawrence' apart from other standard epics.And of course, I have to reserve space in my review for the performance of Mr. O'Toole. He is perhaps my favorite actor, not one of the most prolific, but certainly one of the most unpredictable. He has a flair for choosing eccentric characters that give him almost unlimited room in which to perform. He carries 'Lawrence of Arabia' almost singlehandedly on his slim shoulders. That's not to say the supporting cast isn't great, but O'Toole towers above them all. O'Toole understands that the most influential figures in history could also be the most difficult and ruthless when they needed to be, and he gives Lawrence an incredibly complex characterization, leaving his audience in doubt as to whether he should be worshiped or feared, or perhaps both.Lean would never direct an equal to 'Lawrence of Arabia' again. His later films are certainly more than watchable, and 'A Passage to India' is even quite remarkable in its own way, but we would never get another 'Lawrence.'

","Oy vey, 1997 was a bad year for Steven Spielberg.Much like in 1993, when Spielberg had two movies circulating movie theatres, one a prestige film with Oscar written all over it ('Schindler's List') and the other one of his fun house rides ('Jurassic Park'), 1997 saw the release of 'Amistad' and 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park.' However, 'Amistad' happened to be perhaps the worst movie he ever made, with 'The Lost World' a close second.He clearly should have stopped while he was ahead, because while the visual effects in this sequel to his original dinosaur movie are just as good, everything else is abysmally worse.Grade: F",1,6,17,17 July 2009
It Follows," The Horrors of Sexual Awakening
","'It Follows' joins 'The Babadook' in a mini-boom of horror films in the last year or two that turn the literal psychological states of their main characters into tangible bogeymen that are every bit as real (and seemingly unstoppable) as Michael Meyers or Jason Voorhees. In 'The Babadook,' the protagonist's overwhelming grief became first a frightening predator lurking in the shadows and then a demon that possessed her and turned her into the monster. In 'It Follows,' the predator springs from adolescent sexual awareness and promiscuity, a sort of walking, talking STD that no medical treatment is going to get rid of. In fact, it's easy to read 'It Follows' as an anxious response to our modern-day knowledge of every consequence, from deadly to merely embarrassing, that can arise from sex, both protected and otherwise. But I think the movie is less about the fear of anything so specific as contracting an STD, and more about that purgatory between adolescence and adulthood when kids start doing and feeling adult things without the life experience to process them emotionally. It's no accident that parents are absent in this film; these kids are on their own, navigating the scary emotional waters of sexual awakening without a compass.The movie isn't totally successful, and it's certainly not very scary. The threat at the center of the film is sometimes treated as a supernatural force, sometimes as something corporeal that can be outrun and killed, and the balancing act between the two is frequently awkward. But it's a thoughtful movie and, like 'The Babadook,' it picks as its monster something far more horrifying, because so much more real, than any monster dreamed up in a slasher film.Grade: B+",7,1,7,16 August 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Monkey See Monkey Do
","This prequel to the 1968 cult classic about apes and the humans who don't love them takes forever to get going, but once it does, it proves to be a pretty entertaining action film.James Franco is the scientist whose tinkering with genetics and all that jazz is responsible for creating a race of super-intelligent apes and a virus that at the same time begins to kill off the human race. Some not very impressive special effects early in the film give way to some quite impressive ones later, as the apes ban together and declare war on San Francisco, leading a no-holds-barred charge across the Golden Gate Bridge for the sanctuary of Muir Woods. In between, John Lithgow is given the thankless task of portraying an Alzheimer's patient and Frieda Pinto (of 'Slumdog Millionaire') shows up to prove that she has absolutely no chemistry with James Franco. The villain of the piece is, typically, corporate greed, as personified in this film as the head of Franco's lab and who manages to work in a reference to money into nearly every line of dialogue he's given.People who are expecting camp on par with the 1968 film, or any lines to equal some of the doozies delivered by Charlton Heston in that film, will be disappointed, as this film approaches its material with utmost (and misguided) seriousness.Grade: B",7,2,4,11 March 2012
City of God," Visceral and Fabulous
","'City of God' is an adrenaline jolt of a film that for once manages to find a balance between stylistics and substance. The director, Fernando Meirelles, stuffs his movie to the brim with machine-gun editing, swirling cinematography and pounding music, but while this reliance on fancy tricks has ruined other films, Meirelles is so expert at blending them seamlessly into an engrossing story that the viewer quickly accepts them as inseparable from the world of the film. He delivers a deeply emotional and human story that obviously owes much to Scorsese and Tarantino---but his movie feels completely original, never like a rip off. And underneath all of the action and plotting, there is a compelling message about about the power of art (specifically the camera) and a suggestion that, just as the pen is mightier than the sword, the camera is mightier than the gun. Can't recommend it enough.Grade: A+",10,9,18,29 April 2005
The Little Mermaid," Under the Sea with Disney
","'The Little Mermaid' revitalized Disney's animation department and would make it a force to be reckoned with over the next several years, before Pixar came along and picked up the mantle.'Mermaid' isn't one of my favorites (I prefer 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King' over it), but it is a beautiful and now nostalgic throw back to hand-drawn animation, and it does boast one of the best scores written for a Disney film. It kicked off the trend of show-stopping production numbers that every Disney musical must have; in this one it's 'Under the Sea.' Grade: A-",7,6,7,4 September 2008
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Lee's Movie Takes Flight (And So Do Its Actors)
","Versatile director Ang Lee ('The Ice Storm,' 'Sense and Sensibility,' 'Brokeback Mountain') made a certain type of Chinese martial arts film a crossover hit with 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' and it's only because of this film that later similar movies, like 'Hero,' 'House of Flying Daggers' and 'Curse of the Golden Flower' received even the attention they did in America.'Tiger/Dragon' is the kind of movie that feels more profound than it actually is, because all of the lines are delivered in a foreign language and with stoic import. But the plot and ideas are really just typical kung fu movie melodrama -- and that's not a criticism. The movie takes flight, as any good martial arts movie does, when it's fighting, and the combatants literally take to the air, defying the laws of gravity to chase each other through roof and tree tops.And it certainly doesn't hurt that we get the twin eye candy of Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang.'Tiger/Dragon' became only the third film ('Z' and 'Life Is Beautiful' being the others) to be nominated for both Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film Oscars in the same year. In all three cases, each went on to win the latter award.Grade: A",8,0,0,12 July 2010
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Film Buff's Dream
","'Once Upon a Time....in Hollywood' is entertaining as hell for an avid film buff. Steeped in the elegiac luster of an era in which the golden dreams of Hollywood were colliding with the darker, spoiled illusions of counter-culture America, the film, as its fairy tale title suggests, is one big 'What If?' 'Inglourious Basterds' was a 'what if' movie too, providing an alternate ending to WWII in which Hitler is taken down in a literal blaze of cinematic might. The scope is much smaller in this film, circling as it does around a washed up cowboy star (Leonardo DiCaprio), his career stunt man and personal buddy (Brad Pitt), and their run in with the Manson gang in the days leading up to the murder of actress Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie). For all of its usual Tarantino swagger, there's an ethereal, delicate, and melancholy thread running through the middle of this film. It's at once a love letter to movies while at the same time a sad acknowledgment that life can't be more like them.I'm not big fans of either DiCaprio or Pitt, but I can and have liked them in other things depending on the movie that surrounds them. I liked them both tremendously in this. Tarantino has always been an expert at casting. He gets the right people for the right roles, and the result is that even mediocre actors give great performances in his films almost by default. The two men get the showiest roles, but it's Robbie who threatens to steal the film. She gets virtually no dialogue, but it's mesmerizing to watch her play Tate as a budding starlet new to fame, flitting around Los Angeles, sneaking into theaters to watch herself in movies, and enjoying the promise of a fairy tale career. That we know what happens to Tate in real life imbues Robbie's performance with an intense sense of tragedy. We fall in love with her a little bit, but don't want to because we know we'll have to say goodbye to her.Except that we don't, which brings us to the film's finale, the one thing I really had a problem with. I didn't have a problem with the story; in fact, I thought the idea of what happens was pretty hilarious. But the abrupt transition into stomach-churning violence really turned me off and took me out of the world of the film. Unlike in his other movies, the violence is fairly short lived and it doesn't ruin the whole experience, like it did in 'Django Unchained' and 'The Hateful Eight.' But it feels so exploitative, and I was disappointed that Tarantino felt the need to end such a beautiful little movie with his trademark violence-as-porn. And worse, it's played for laughs. The audience I saw this with (though admittedly small) was yucking it up, which made me queasy.Still, my reservations about the ending aside, this is Tarantino's best movie since 'Inglourious Basterds,' and really the first one since maybe 'Jackie Brown' that I felt wasn't just a parody of other directors' styles.Grade: A",9,13,22,28 August 2019
Beasts of No Nation," I Feel Almost Obligated to Watch Films Like This
","I've heard more than one person say that they can't watch a movie like 'Beasts of No Nation.' It's a sentiment I understand. After all, who really wants to watch a movie about child soldiers recruited to become killers in savage African civil wars? But these things are happening, and the bare minimum I can if I want to respect myself as a citizen of the world is to watch movies about it, and fictional ones at that. This isn't even a documentary.And if people can get past the premise, they will find themselves watching a gripping film. A tough one, yes, and one that might make your stomach churn. But it's extremely well made, with excellent performances from child actor Abraham Attah and Idris Elba, as the child protagonist and the leader who recruits him, respectively. This young child experiences a multitude of things, any one of which would permanently scar virtually anyone. And the film doesn't offer a contrived happy-ish ending to reward us for sitting through the suffering, which is one of the things I most appreciated about it. Because let's be honest; is there even a remote chance that stories like the one told here could end happily?In this year of bickering about the whiteness of the Oscars, this film and its lack of nominations being held up repeatedly as an example, I can at least feel like I did my part -- you don't get much further away from white Hollywood and the stories it likes to tell than this film.Grade: A-",8,4,5,13 February 2016
Gone Girl," A Pot Boiler by Any Other Name....
","I've decided that David Fincher as a director is only as good as his writers. All of his movies look and move the same. They're all dreary grays and browns and each one gives the impression that Fincher is striving to make The Great American Movie whether or not the subject matter warrants. It falls, then, to his writers to distinguish one of his movies from the next, and if there is any playfulness or humour in a Fincher film, it's not because he put it there.I haven't read 'Gone Girl,' but since the screenplay is by the same woman who wrote the book, I trust that the film is fairly faithful both in story and tone to the story on which it is based. In that case, it's a crock of hooey masquerading as a serious work of art, a pot boiler that pretends to have something to say. Indeed, I've heard that Gillian Flynn intended for her book to be a commentary on modern marriage, to which I say, HA!'Gone Girl' is entertaining enough while you're watching it, but the thing completely unravels as soon as you start thinking about it afterwards. It's all about plot and nothing about character. To a certain extent, Flynn has made her story critic proof, because the lead female character, played well by Rosamund Pike, is just flat-out insane, which means she doesn't have to be consistent and her motives don't have to be plausibly explained, because the explanation is 'Hey, she's crazy!' Makes for a convenient narrative device but isn't especially interesting as a central character. Ben Affleck fades into the background, proving once again that he's far more interesting behind the camera than in front of it.Don't get me wrong, I actually enjoyed 'Gone Girl' for what it was but didn't give it an once more credit than it deserved. And the ratings here at IMDb at the time of this review!! The 86th best movie of all time? Give me a break. Anyone who thinks 'Gone Girl' deserves to be on the list of 100 greatest movies ever made needs to see some more movies.Grade: B",7,2,8,7 December 2014
Django Unchained," If This Is What We Have for Entertainment, Who Needs the Nightly News?
","I've been a long-time Tarantino defender, always feeling that his films are smarter than anyone gives them credit for. Every time Tarantino releases a movie, people get up in arms about how violent, irresponsible, etc., etc. it is, for some reason holding him to task for 'violence in our media' when the makers of the James Bond movies, Bourne movies and other such violent fare get off scot free.And while I still don't think Tarantino, his movies, or movies in general for that matter should be held responsible for violence carried out by people living in the real world, like it or not what is happening in the real world has an impact on how I respond to movies. That may be why I nearly reviled Tarantino's latest, 'Django Unchained,' a throwback to the bloody spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone and his ilk.Tarantino is always recycling old genres, and I think enjoyment of his movies frequently depends on how much you enjoy the genre he's playing off of. I don't happen to like westerns very much, so that may be partly why I was unable to warm to this film. But I think that's only a small part of my reaction. Mostly, I felt for the first time that Tarantino was making a juvenile film, wasting his considerable talents on violence as pornography. In other Tarantino films, violence has been beside the point -- the films themselves have been violent, but the violence has been what happens in between the moments when we are learning about his characters and enjoying a story well told. In 'Django,' violence IS the point. It's about the horrible, degrading things human beings do to each other, and our protagonist is a blank slate of a character with a one-word motivation: REVENGE. Revenge as a primary motive is boring unless the character seeking revenge is interesting, and Jamie Foxx isn't a talented enough actor, nor Django a fully-enough realized character, to make it interesting. The only person who makes the film worth watching is Christoph Waltz as a ruthless bounty hunter. He's so good in his role that the film fiercely misses his absence once he's out of the picture; unfortunately, the film goes on for another 30 minutes or so after Waltz exits.The final hour or so of this movie exists in my head as a vague blur of stomach-churning devastation. The bullets, blood and bodies fly, and while I appreciate Tarantino's determination to show us what happens to a human head when you shoot it with a shotgun (which is far more than most violent movies do), I had about as much fun watching it as I would an autopsy or a car accident.I live in Chicago, where the news reports contain a daily body count of the people shot in the city overnight, usually crimes motivated by revenge. And elsewhere, we've been recently inundated with news of slaughters and shootings around the country, crazy people who perceive that they've been wronged in some way taking out their fury on those who had nothing to do with it. When this kind of casual human carnage is so tragically real, as we are reminded on a daily basis, a movie that revels in it feels tacky as well as pointless.Time to grow up Quentin and start making movies for adults.Grade: C",5,2,8,4 February 2013
Get Out," White Liberal Elite America's Worst Nightmare
","'Get Out' is going to make some people very uncomfortable -- if they ever even watch it, that is -- and that is the movie's point.Coming out in this racially charged time and amid outrage over the whitewashing of Hollywood, 'Get Out' gives us a horror movie that ends ***spoiler alert**** with a young black man brutally murdering an entire clan of affluent liberal elite white people....and he's our hero! He's our hero because these liberal elite white people are anything but sympathizers to the Black Lives Matter movement. On the contrary, they use their white liberal status and privilege to convey an image of tolerance and acceptance while systematically capturing healthy black people and performing scientific experiments on them in order to hijack all of their best physical characteristics.This premise might sound outrageous, and it is, but it's handled exceptionally well in this rather goofy horror movie that isn't afraid to go for it. Director Jordan Peele shows mastery in ratcheting up mystery and tension, and the first three fourths of the film, which are all build up, are gripping. It's unfortunate that the last quarter of the film doesn't show any of the creativity that the lead up to it does -- it's a rather pedestrian resolution to what up to that point has been anything but a pedestrian movie. But disappointing ending aside, the overall impression the film left on me was positive.'Get Out' is easy to pick apart in retrospect. The plot doesn't even really make that much sense once one has had time to reflect on it. I'm still unclear as to what exactly the scientific experiments in the film were accomplishing, and a last-minute surprise reveal did nothing to clarify that point for me. But sometimes a movie is more important for being the right kind of movie at the right moment in time than for any of its individual merits, and 'Get Out' feels like that kind of movie to me. Good as movies like 'Moonlight' and 'Fences' were, they were always going to have a limited audience. But 'Get Out,' by virtue of being a genre film, might actually pull in more of the audience who actually needs to hear its message. It's the first movie released since the Black Lives Matter movement that suggests that, from a black person's perspective, the liberal progressives who are championing black rights are no more to be trusted than the overtly racist. They're all variations of a system designed to maintain white dominance.Grade: A-",Null,6,17,12 April 2017
Drive," If Nothing Else, the Coolest Movie of the Year
","The flat-out coolest movie released in 2011.'Drive' stars Ryan Gosling as a Hollywood stunt man who moonlights as a driver for various sordid and criminal activities. One such 'job' gets him in the tangled middle of a noirish mess, at the center of which is a crime boss played with chutzpah by Albert Brooks. Gosling's enigmatic figure is reminiscent of Travis Bickle, the character created by Robert De Niro in 'Taxi Driver,' but even more solitary and taciturn. And like Bickle, he explodes in violent expression when pushed too far.Gosling isn't the only one who conjures impressions of 'Taxi Driver'; the whole movie does, with a healthy dash of 1980s crime thrillers thrown in for good measure. The film is awfully and explicitly violent, and my one complaint about it is that the violence is so graphic at times that it threatens to take over the movie. But that one quibble is easy to overlook in the face of a movie that is so tremendously stylish and entertaining. The only other movies from 2011 that looked as good as this one -- and as much like a MOVIE -- were 'The Artist' and 'The Tree of Life.' The intensely likable Carey Mulligan co-stars as Gosling's love interest, and 'Mad Men' fans will be pleased to see Christina Hendricks in a bit part, and one that's decidedly un-Joan like.Grade: A+",10,1,4,5 March 2012
Insidious," Manages a Good, Creepy Scare Here and There
","'Insidious' belongs to the modern brand of hard-sell horror movies, the ones that try to frighten with loud sound effects, jump scares, and creepy kids. It feels the need to wow us with a frenzied conclusion and a last-minute twist, as if it was tailor made to show up eventually on one of those YouTube compilations assembled by a twenty-year-old who hasn't seen any horror movie released before the year 2000.But within that circle, 'Insidious' fares better than others, like 'Paranormal Activity' and 'The Conjuring,' two films that it brings to mind. It's competently shot and directed and manages to provide some good old-fashioned creepy suspense. The ending of the film goes off the rails in a way that I like, getting so weird and out there that it actually works.By far the creepiest scene for me involved a little boy dancing to 'Tiptoe through the Tulips.' I'll never hear that song the same way again.Grade: B",7,0,0,27 October 2015
The Theory of Everything," Interesting by Default
","'The Theory of Everything' is the kind of standard-issue biopic that breezes through the life of whoever is its subject (in this case Stephen Hawking), hitting all the highlights while glossing tidily over all of the complexities that would actually exist and surely did in real life.At least this one isn't afraid of addressing the less flattering elements of its protagonist, namely the fact that Hawking dumped his devoted wife for his nurse after his wife had spent years caring for his every need. Eddie Redmayne gives an impressive physical performance as Hawking (it's no wonder he won the Oscar -- the Academy loves performances like these), while Felicity Jones suffers nobly, as wives always do in biopics like this. She is really the more interesting character, or would be if the film allowed her to be, instead of treating her as an assemblage of personality traits it can use to move the plot forward. All of the dramatic conflicts in the film are treated equally, and none of them seem to carry much significance. Hawking's announcement that he's leaving his wife, for example, is handled by the actors as if he's told her he just spotted a mouse in the basement.The film does a good job of recreating its time period, which is something another Oscar-bait period piece from the same year, 'The Imitation Game,' didn't do. Still, the film manages to look like a magazine ad, everything bathed in a glossy glow.The story of Stephen Hawking is so interesting and the movie is competently enough made that it ends up by default as being interesting itself. But is it too much to ask that a biopic once in a while do something, anything, surprising or daring?Grade: B+",7,1,1,18 April 2015
2012," So Dumb It's Not Really Any Fun
","I made the mistake of watching '2012' and 'Battlefield Earth' in the same weekend. I think I can still feel my brain cells dying.I can enjoy a big, dumb movie as much as the next guy, and anyone going into '2012' thinking it's NOT going to be a big dumb movie deserves what he gets, but come ON. Did it have to be THIS dumb? John Cusack looks bored and embarrassed to be headlining this special effects extravaganza about the end of the world. He plays an obscure writer who leads his family to safety as the Earth's crust becomes separated from its core and starts to slip around like a loose sock. As far as I can tell, this means that the South Pole ends up where Milwaukee, Wisconsin used to be, but somehow whole mountain ranges, cities (what's left of them after mega-quakes tear them apart) and the people still living are able to just ride around the world's axis like they're on a big merry-go-round. The first action sequence is so preposterous that it leaves the film nowhere to go. Cusack, driving the best-made limo of all time, out runs a fault that is tearing Los Angeles away from the continental United States, even at one point (I'm not making this up) driving it through a building as it's collapsing(!) to end up safely on the other side. Why is it that if I tried this I'd pop a tire within two minutes? This scene, and many more like it, are played for yucks, which doesn't help. The special effects are surprisingly bad for such a high-profile movie. But the worst thing about '2012' is how tired it feels. Roland Emmerich is now stealing from himself, taking stray parts of his other movies and patching them together in the hopes that they'll again strike gold.The cast also includes Amanda Peet, who tries valiantly to give an actual performance, and at the other end of the spectrum, Woody Harrelson, who the Motion Picture Academy should sue for defamation. Being nominated for an Oscar in the same year that you give a performance like the one he gives here pretty much discounts 80 odd years of Academy history.Grade: D",2,5,7,13 April 2010
The Lives of Others," A Beautiful Statement About Humanity Triumphing Over Oppression
","This superb, gripping film tells the story of a celebrated playwright, Georg Dreyman (played subtly by Sebastian Koch) living in the stifling oppression of the German Democratic Republic in the early 1980s, who is put under surveillance by a cabinet minister who loves Dreyman's girlfriend, the ill-fated Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), and wants an excuse to ruin Dreyman's life. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe, giving the film's best performance) is assigned surveillance duties, and stakes himself out in the attic of Dreyman's apartment building, listening in on Dreyman's conversations and numerous intimacies. Dreyman is not a subversive, at least not in deed, until a beloved friend in the theatre commits suicide because of a ruined career brought about by the GDR officials. This loss compels Dreyman to action, and he writes a scathing indictment of the GDR which he publishes anonymously in a West German liberal magazine. Wiesler knows that Dreyman is the author, but has become so fascinated by Dreyman and his life, and so doubtful as to the moral motives of the GDR, that instead of turning Dreyman into the authorities, he becomes his secret accomplice.'The Lives of Others' begins solidly but unremarkably. I enjoyed the first half hour or so of the film, but wasn't heavily involved in it. But it works a kind of intense, gradual spell, and before I realized it, I was engrossed in this story and cared deeply about how it would end. A plot summary makes it sound like a highbrow soap opera, or like something we've seen before, but it's not either of these things. It's a thematically rich film anchored by a strong central character in Wiesler. He's fascinated by Dreyman's life -- his artistic abilities, his circle of friends and the stimulus of freely shared ideas, the love and companionship he shares with an attractive woman -- but it's Wiesler who for us becomes the fascinating character. We see his life juxtaposed to Dreyman's -- coming home to an empty apartment, hiring a prostitute for a fleeting moment of intimacy -- and we understand exactly why he takes the actions he does throughout the film. His life is utterly lacking in any kind of artistic or intellectual freedom, and when he begins to fake reports about the goings on in Dreyman's apartment, making up entire episodes and even giving elaborate details about a fake play he claims Dreyman is writing, we see how just the tiny bit of freedom granted him to create something completely his own becomes the crack in the foundation of his loyalty to his superiors. It's a wonderful statement about the power of free thought to combat oppression, and at the same time a lovely story about simple human kindness. The ending especially is breathtaking in its sweet simplicity.And as I'm a fan of film scores, let me say that this film has a marvelous one, especially the recurring passage of pulsing strings that drives the movie forward and creates all the hair-raising tension of a Hitchcock film.Grade: A+",10,8,14,26 February 2007
Hellboy," Great Acting, Lousy Story
","How many times do you come away from an action movie (and one based on a comic book series no less) remembering the characterizations more than anything else? This was the case for me in watching 'Hellboy.' I was totally impressed with Ron Perlman's dry as vermouth performance, and that alone elevates this film above your standard comic book to screen adaptation. Unfortunately, the story is so uninvolving that it never puts the characters in situations that really engage the viewer, so the acting talent much of the time feels wasted.This film looks great, too, but come on, by now don't all Hollywood action films look pretty good, and shouldn't they, given the amount of money thrown at them. No, the makers of 'Hellboy' have all the ingredients for a spicy, rich, delicious stew but only manage to muster up a mediocre broth that needs a lot of salt.Grade: B-",6,3,7,20 June 2005
Good Will Hunting," Gus van Sant Gets Sappy
","Every once in a while, director Gus van Sant gets sappy, and movies like 'Good Will Hunting' are the result.The director of terrific films like 'To Die For' and 'Paranoid Park' is nowhere in evidence in this story about a math phenom (Matt Damon) working as a janitor while a bunch of dumber and richer kids get all the good stuff life has to offer. Robin Williams plays a counselor, Minnie Driver plays a love interest and Ben Affleck plays a best friend. The film launched the careers of Affleck and Damon, who won an Oscar for writing the film's screenplay. But the screenplay is one of the worst things about the film, full of lines and speeches that maybe looked good on paper but aren't at all believable as things people would actually say in any version of reality I know.Not a bad movie, but not one I'd waste any more time on, and certainly wildly overrated.Grade: B",6,3,6,16 July 2009
Room," Makes a Better Movie Than Book
","'Room' is the rare film that improves on the book on which it's based.I had a complicated reaction to the novel. I found the first half actually set in the room to be nearly unbearable. I'm a father of young boys and trying to imagine the scenario set up in the book made me almost physically ill. I'm not sure I could have read the whole thing if the mother and her son had not escaped from their captor, but once they did, I felt like the air went out of the book and everything that happened after was much less compelling.The movie spends much less of its time in the room itself, because what takes pages and pages to describe in the book can be conveyed much more quickly with a few carefully chosen images. Therefore, more of the film takes place on the outside, but the filmmakers do a better job of making that the compelling narrative. The movie becomes a tribute to the resilience and adaptability of children, and captures that feeling parents experience when the world and all it contains once again becomes a wondrous place because they're seeing it through the eyes of their children.Brie Larson won an Oscar for her performance, and while I certainly don't begrudge her the win, I didn't feel that her performance was necessarily the slam-dunk best of the year that her dominance of the awards circuit suggested. The one who amazes in the film is Jacob Tremblay, playing Jack. He carries the film in a way that many adult actors can't manage, and some of the later scenes, especially those with his grandmother (played by a wonderful Joan Allen), quietly reduced me to a quivering mess.Grade: A",9,2,4,11 April 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," That's a Mighty Gray and Brown Movie You've Made There Peter Jackson
","Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is a monumental achievement, I won't argue with that. The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration.But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there.After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough. I think it says something about your endeavor when the most interesting character in the film is the one who's computer animated.The person who really deserves the most credit for this trilogy is its editor(s), who had to take god knows how many hours of footage and shape it into something resembling a movie.Grade: B",6,1,2,23 July 2010
Schindler's List," Spielberg's Entrance to Adulthood
","'Schindler's List' was THE movie of 1993, and nothing came close to touching it in acclaim. It felt like the movie Steven Spielberg had been waiting years to make, and despite his previous efforts at making movies for grown ups ('The Color Purple'), this is the first movie that suggested he was maturing as a film maker.So does it hold up after all these years? Mostly. But is it a typical Spielberg movie? Most definitely. The first 3/4 of the film are compulsively watchable and entertaining, if you can consider brutal and graphic scenes of concentration camp violence entertaining. Spielberg uses a near-documentary style that fits the material perfectly, and using black and white with only occasional splashes of color feels like an inspired decision. But boy is that last quarter of the film schmaltzy, and has Spielberg's gooey fingerprints all over it. I don't know that something as horrific as the Holocaust needs a lot of emotional embellishment, but Spielberg just can't help himself.However, I forgive Spielberg in this particular case. This was obviously a story that meant a great deal to him, and I'm not sure it's fair to expect him to remain emotionally distant from it. He tells his story with a great deal of passion, and for the most part he tells it very well.Grade: A",8,9,13,10 February 2009
Across the Universe," Imagine There's No Heaven, Just People Loving One Another Here on Earth
","A fresh breeze sweeping away the cloud of gloom that has descended on Hollywood this fall, 'Across the Universe' is a nice antidote to all of those grimy, dour films currently filling movie theatres. The point of all of those seems to be that we live in a crappy world. The point of 'Across the Universe' is that sure, things may be crappy now, but they've been crappy before, and as long as the important things -- like love -- remain, the world we live in can always get better.A simplistic message? Perhaps. But no less welcome for that. Stage veteran Julie Taymor, most known for her revolutionary staging of the Broadway musical 'The Lion King,' sets her movie in the turbulent 60s, when anti-Vietnam sentiments and racial discord were reaching a boiling point, but there's no doubt that the criticism of American foreign policy is aimed squarely at the leadership of today who currently have us embroiled in another potential Vietnam, Iraq. The movie unfolds in bursts of song and color (the score is comprised completely of Beatles tunes), and even though the movie is far too long given its wisp of a plot, it mostly manages to sustain an infectious energy.The Beatles songs mostly sound great, and they're used creatively. I already knew I liked the Beatles, but hearing their songs performed here in a different context reawakened an appreciation for them. 'I Want to Hold Your Hand,' for example, originally a perky pop anthem, becomes here a heartbreaking ballad performed by a young girl in love whose object of affection doesn't return the favor. 'Come Together' plays over a dazzling montage juxtaposing New York's Wall Street elite (represented by a troupe of suited business men dancing in unison) to its disenfranchised. And 'Let It Be' becomes a gospel anthem underscoring the Detroit riots. Other songs fare less well, like 'Strawberry Fields Forever,' which feels awkwardly shoe-horned into the film. The young cast of mostly unknowns is attractive and engaging, even if the film doesn't demand much from them. The standout for me was Dana Fuchs, playing a singer obviously modeled after Janis Joplin.Grade: A-",7,1,4,6 November 2007
The Incredibles," Pixar Does It Again
","The Pixar team continues its winning streak with this sharp, snappy, surprisingly adult animated adventure film about a family of former superheroes who cannot fit into 'normal' society no matter how hard they try. I'm actually surprised that kids stayed with this film long enough to enjoy the fast-paced non-stop action of its second half; the film's early scenes are a quite funny commentary on bland, middle-class suburban America and the insidiousness of mediocrity that it encourages, obviously aimed more at its adult audience than it is at the kiddy crowd.My only complaint is that Pixar animation always looks slightly creepy when applied to human characters. The actors and animators do as much as they can to infuse the characters with warmth and to make them engaging, but they can't completely get around the fact that there's a plastic, lifeless quality inherent in digital animation that doesn't exist in its hand-drawn counterpart. But that's not a huge detriment here and doesn't prevent this film from being a lot of fun.Grade: A",8,1,1,6 June 2005
The Mist," Something Wicked This Way Comes....
","Just in time for Thanksgiving comes the feel-bad movie of the year. Man, I thought after 'Gone Baby Gone' that I'd seen the year's biggest downer; I shouldn't have jumped the gun.'The Mist' is based on a Stephen King short story and is written and directed by Frank Darabont ('The Shawshank Redemption,' 'The Green Mile'), who has created a cottage industry out of adapting Stephen King stories to the screen. This one contains considerably less philosophical babble than the other two films, both of them bloated and self-important in my humble opinion, and is more of an exercise in visceral, grab-at-your-guts horror.The movie focuses on a group of townsfolk in a small Maine community who wind up battling for their lives in a grocery store when a giant fog descends on the town after a night of raging storms. It's not long before all sorts of mighty fake looking creepy crawlies come slithering their way out of the mist, and before the people themselves begin going a bit buggy (excuse the pun). None of them is buggier than a crazy religious fanatic played entirely too well by Marcia Gay Harden, who whips the more susceptible into a terrified frenzy with her doomsday babble and becomes a bigger threat than the giant gnats and spiders buzzing around outside. Another group of more rational folk ally themselves with the square-jawed, perfectly stubbled Thomas Jane, who plays a loving dad whose primary concern is his young son. This is the group I'd want to belong to, and it also includes Frances Sternhagen, who starts chucking cans of peas at Harden, to the applause of the audience I saw this with, and the terrific actor Toby Jones, ****SPOILERS AHEAD**** who finally shoots the demented lunatic in the head, again to enthusiastic applause. This wasn't as gratifying to me as seeing her head getting ripped off by a giant octopus would have been, but I guess it's the next best thing.The movie flirts with greater themes, such as the nature of humanity, the existence of God, etc., but it wisely doesn't veer too far onto any of these paths. Stephen King, despite what Darabont seems to think from his previous films, is not the person to go to for intellectual musings. Darabont makes his film fairly streamlined and sticks to the point, which is to see how and if our merry band of survivors will escape with their lives. I won't ruin the ending for you, but I give the film credit for having the balls to stick with a majorly downbeat ending, even if it did leave me wanting to kill myself. And please heed this movie's R rating -- this is NOT a movie for kids, unless you want your children to be psychologically damaged, in which case go and enjoy.The film's special effects team can't resist the urge to show us the monsters in all of their tentacled and slimy glory, but I couldn't help but think how much more effective the movie would have been had we never actually seen any of the creatures, and instead had let our imaginations do the work for us.Grade: A-",7,2,6,27 November 2007
Stardust," Not 'The Princess Bride,' But Then Few Fantasy Films Are
","Fantasy adventure is a genre I very much enjoy, and it's a genre too neglected by Hollywood. 'Stardust' is a fun and enjoyable addition to it, even if it won't go down as the cult classic it so obviously wants to be.The film's biggest flaw is that there's simply too much going on, too many plot strands, and the film itself is too long. You can feel it working overtime to create the same kind of whimsy that infused a movie that IS a cult classic, 'The Princess Bride.' But that movie was small, charming and simple. It didn't stuff itself to the brim with digital effects and thunderous action the way 'Stardust' does, and the latter film doesn't come close to the former. But I did appreciate the humour in 'Stardust' and its refusal to take itself seriously. Charlie Cox and Claire Danes are likable enough as an impetuous English lad and the fallen star he falls in love with, respectively. Michelle Pfeiffer looks gorgeous (at least at first) as a witch intent on regaining her former beauty, even if she's not at home with the film's comic elements. Unfortunately, Robert De Niro is miscast as a swishy pirate with a penchant for corsets and boas, and his big comic scene just feels uncomfortable. But Ricky Gervais adds some fine comedy in a couple of brief scenes, and Peter O'Toole lends the whole thing some credentials by virtue of his mere presence.Even if it has its faults, I liked 'Stardust' and hope to see more films like it.Grade: B+",7,1,3,9 January 2008
The Elephant Man," One of Lynch's Most Mainstream Films Is Also One of His Best
","This lacerating film about John Merrick, a man in 19th century England who suffered from a terrible physical deformity and was treated as a circus sideshow by a public who did not understand his condition, proves that David Lynch is as adept at mainstream, linear storytelling as he is at putting miraculous fever dreams on the screen. I experienced 'The Elephant Man' as something physical; my heart literally ached while watching this profoundly sad yet oddly exhilarating film.People may not think of Lynch as an especially emotional director; his experimental approach at film-making may leave some feeling detached. But the more I see of his films, the more I come to appreciate that all of his films have a strong emotional core to them, so it doesn't surprise me that he would do so well with this story. He films in beautiful black and white, which gives the film an old-fashioned look that feels right for its time period and subject matter, and he makes use of a brilliant musical score. All of the actors are terrific, but especially John Hurt, who is able to act through heaps of prosthetic makeup (the actor himself is completely unrecognizable), to deliver a powerhouse performance. I defy even the most cold-hearted cinephile to watch his final scene and not have to sniffle back at least a tear or two.What a wonderful, wonderful movie.Grade: A+",10,1,1,5 December 2007
A Quiet Place," When Silence Is Scary
","John Krasinski proves himself to be a director of promise with this smart horror movie set in a near future when humans have to be completely silent if they are to survive.There are strange, spider-like creatures on the loose, you see, and while they can't see or smell, they can hear the tiniest sound, and when they do they come creepy crawling along to tear you apart. What these creatures are, or where they come from, is never explained, which is a wise move on the part of the filmmakers, because the air of mystery adds to the overall scariness of the premise. We don't know any more than the characters in the movie, who focus not on the big picture wheres or whys, but rather on surviving moment to moment.'A Quiet Place' deftly straddles the delicate line between being entertainingly scary and disturbingly off putting. Much of the content in this film is of the variety that personally bothers me very much and can make horror films feel more like endurance tests than anything else. I'm talking specifically about children being in peril for the entire movie, and the frantic helplessness parents feel in trying to protect their young from circumstances beyond their control. I don't generally enjoy stories like that, and there's a moment early on in 'A Quiet Place' that sends the message to its audience that all bets are off and the movie isn't necessarily going to follow horror movie rules, including keeping the kids safe. But Krasinski as a director has more on his mind than just making us feel awful, and instead focuses on the strength and resilience of families when pushed into situations they could never imagine, and the willingness of parents to bear almost anything to keep their kids safe.In a world that never shuts up, 'A Quiet Place' reminds us how scary silence can be.Grade: A-",8,1,2,9 October 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," A Superb Film and Flawless Performance from Al Pacino
","Al Pacino gives what I think is the best performance of his career in this stellar Sidney Lumet film. Pacino plays an amateur bank robber who wants to use the stolen money to pay for his lover's (Chris Sarandon's) sex change operation. All goes wrong and the robbery becomes a media frenzy, and Pacino becomes a sort of hero, winning the sympathy of the crowd against the authorities. This anti-establishment story is so bizarre that it's no surprise that the film is based on true events. Truth is stranger than fiction, indeed.Pacino plays his character as a lovable, frenzied, desperate regular Joe, and our hearts go out to him. He's not a bad guy, but he's a guy who has made a lot of bad decisions and trapped himself in a corner. Charles Durning gives a fine performance as the chief of the police who develops some sympathy of his own for the hapless crook. And John Cazale, the poor perennially overlooked John Cazale, plays Pacino's right-hand man.Lumet directs with a fast, breathless pace. It's easy to see how his background in television work makes him a perfect choice to direct this kind of 'reality T.V.' material. Indeed, as is the mark of many a classic film, the situations portrayed in 'Dog Day Afternoon' could all too easily play themselves out for real today without much alteration.Grade: A+",10,4,6,8 August 2007
School of Rock," Jack Black Scores
","Jack Black is like Jim Carrey--he works so hard at his comedy that the strain at first overshadows the humour. But like Jim Carrey, he keeps so insistently at his viewers that they can't help but be won over totally by his zaniness. I didn't think Black was very funny when this movie started, but he plays the role so earnestly and with so much personality that I was a Jack Black fan by the time it was over. There seems to be a generation of film makers now (Richard Linklater, Cameron Crowe) that are redefining the qualities that can make someone 'cool,' and their movies are full of welcome messages. Cool isn't about how you look or dress or act. Cool's a state of mind, man. Peace out.Grade: A-",8,0,0,29 April 2005
Amadeus," Rock Me, Amadeus
","Milos Forman serves up a deliciously macabre film based on the Peter Schaffer play about brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and lesser composer and Mozart arch rival Antonio Salieri. This is Salieri's story much more than it is Mozart's. More than anything, the film is a study of the devouring envy one artist can have for the talents of another.F. Murray Abraham is good as Salieri; he has never since gotten as juicy a film role as this. But he's upstaged by Tom Hulce's Mozart, played as a giggling, flamboyant showman who's absolutely oblivious to Salieri's mounting hatred. Indeed, one of the aspects of the rivalry that is most heartbreaking, and which adds fuel to Salieri's fire, is the degree to which Mozart doesn't even recognize Salieri as a rival. Though the movie is meticulous in its period detail, the screenplay is peppered with modern, slangy American dialogue that frees it from the museum piece stuffiness that so often infects other period films.Bravo.Grade: A",9,1,3,17 March 2008
The Man Who Would Be King," Disappointing Adventure Film
","An old fashioned, uncomplicated adventure film from John Huston that never manages to become fully engaging.Sean Connery and Michael Caine play a couple of shysters who want to establish themselves as leaders of some obscure foreign country and then rob it of its riches. The plot never made a whole lot of sense to me, even though the screenplay had the clear blueprint of Rudyard Kipling's original story to follow. Huston is pretty high on my list of overrated directors; a few of his films from the film noir years are excellent, but most everything else falls flat for me. His direction in this film is too leaden to bring it alive. It's supposed to have a bit of rollicking adventure about it, but it instead feels like a slog.Nominated for four Oscars in 1975, including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Film Editing.Grade: B-",6,4,11,16 November 2018

One of them is Sigourney Weaver, who's smoking hot and is a far cry from the butch role she played in 'Alien' and for which at the time she was probably most well known. The other is Rick Moranis, who is hysterical as a possessed geek and runs around stealing the movie right out from everyone else in it.Bill Murray is his droll self, the special effects hold up well even now, and how can you not like that theme song?

Call Me by Your Name," A Daring Love Story
","It would be easy to dismiss how daring 'Call Me by Your Name' actually is, yes even in 2017 when gay relationships are more accepted than they probably ever have been. There are still plenty of people in the world who would not give a film about the budding sexual and emotional relationship of two young men a chance. This film has some serious balls for treating the subject so delicately and yet so erotically.Make that two sets of balls, one owned by Timothee Chalamet and the other by Armie Hammer, who play the lovers. Chalamet gives one of the most understated but impressive performances of the year as the younger of the two who is experiencing an infatuation comprised of equal parts love and lust for what we suspect is the first time. Hammer is the object of his obsession, a studly, bronzed student who is staying in Italy for the summer and working for Chalamet's professor father (Michael Stuhlbarg). The film is languid and sun drenched, creating visually what a summer spent lounging in the Italian countryside must feel like. Both of the principal actors have a great deal of screen time, but the film easily belongs to Chalamet, who in the course of one summer experiences more reciprocal love and inevitable heartbreak than many people experience over the course of their entire lives. The best scene in the film comes late into its running time, and it's comprised of a soliloquy delivered by Stuhlbarg in which he attempts to help his son deal with the pain he is feeling over an ended romance and also hints that romantic relationships between men, even men who identify as primarily straight, are possibly more common than anyone realizes, or would be if men felt that they were allowed to have them. It's one of the best scenes I saw in a movie this year.Grade: A",8,2,5,31 December 2017
Gran Torino," Tell Me Punk -- Are You Feeling Lucky?
","In the last few years, Clint Eastwood has enjoyed a career renaissance like no other, but I've become increasingly resistant to his films. Movies like 'Mystic River' and 'Million Dollar Baby' felt like masterpieces while I was watching them, but after I'd had time to digest them and think about them, they began to unravel. As for 'Letters from Iwo Jima,' I found it accomplished but cold and formal, like Eastwood was trying too hard to make a Great American Movie.For those reasons, I went into 'Gran Torino' with modest expectations. Whether or not time will be kind to it I don't know, but as of now this stands as the best of Eastwood's recent string.Eastwood himself plays a relic from the past, Walt Kowalski, a lonely and gruff widower living in Detroit, hateful toward anyone who's not white and not much better to those who are. He reluctantly becomes involved in the lives of an Asian-American family next door when a neighborhood gang terrorizes them, and we see gradually see the ice of Walt's reserve melt as he realizes that cultural divides aren't so hard to hurdle after all. Trailers bill the film as a Dirty Harry/vigilante-type story, and people may come to the film in anticipation of seeing Eastwood kick ass. He does do some ass kicking, but the film has much more than vigilantism on its mind, and a surprisingly sweet and warm narrative emerges as Eastwood decides it's up to him to teach the boy next door how to be a man.The film is not without its missteps, notably in Eastwood's depiction of Walt's awful family, caricatures of yuppy affluence and privilege (he made similar stumbles in depicting Hilary Swank's trailer-trash family in 'Million Dollar Baby'). And the screenplay gets off to a horribly clunky start, especially in some early scenes between Walt and the neighborhood priest. But by the time the story had sucked me in, these flaws became increasingly easier to overlook.'Gran Torino' doesn't feel like it's trying to achieve greatness, and maybe for that very reason, it does.Grade: A",9,3,7,13 January 2009
Hero," Visual Poetry
","'Hero' is a jaw-droppingly gorgeous film that is truly worth seeing for its lush production design alone. Director Zhang Yimou brings a visual elegance to the kung-fu genre film, and a magical realist sensibility to the narrative itself, the results of which are a very violent film where the violence seems to have consequences, and the line between hero and villain isn't so much a line as a vast field of shaded grey.The film is reminiscent of 'Rashomon' in its fragmented approach to telling its story; one is never sure whether or not the version he is hearing is the truth. That may be because in the world of 'Hero,' the truth is very open to interpretation--one man's noble act is another man's crime.The film pays its respects to various art forms, all of which are compared to the artistry of swordplay: music, literature, dance. Just as a skilled swordsman can yield nearly unstoppable power, so can the artist impact the world around him.No one will accuse Yimou of being a subtle director, and I do have to say that the continuous fighting gets ever so slightly monotonous. Yimou does a good job of combating this monotony by changing the color palettes and showcasing increasingly dazzling choreography, but when the character of Snow challenges the character of Broken Sword to a duel for what feels like the fiftieth time toward the film's conclusion, I sympathized with Broken Sword when he says, 'Must violence always be the answer (paraphrased).' Still, this is a minor quibble, and one must also remember that this film is working within the confines of its genre, and that that's just how these films are.Grade: A",8,0,1,29 July 2005
The Hurt Locker," The First Movie About Iraq to Truly Move Me
","In 'The Hurt Locker,' director Kathryn Bigelow has created the first fictional film about the war in Iraq that has gotten into my head and stayed there. I can't account for how accurate it is in its details, but based on interviews and documentaries I've seen about soldiers' experiences in Iraq and the emotional toll it's taken on them, I believe that this film captures very well the feelings of futility and depressing waste of human life that the Iraqi conflict (or any war, for that matter) sends home with the people who are engaged in fighting it.Jeremy Renner gives an astonishing performance, one of the best of the year, as the explosives expert whose job it is to disarm booby traps. He's one of the most tragic characters I've seen on screen in a long time. He's got so little in his life to care about that putting his life at risk on a daily basis is the only way he can feel anything. Most of the film takes place in Iraq, and the majority of it is tense and brutally suspenseful. But it's a few scenes late in the film showing Renner's character coming back to a domestic life that no longer has any place for him that will break your heart.Grade: A",9,2,10,2 March 2010
The Longest Day," One of the Most Impressive Physical Productions I've Ever Seen
","'The Longest Day' is a small miracle of a movie. Despite being directed by a handful of different men, it manages to be more coherent and more consistent in tone across its considerable running time than many films directed by a single person. This is not an episodic film in the sense that each director gets his own moment to shine before handing another section of the movie over to someone else; no, all of the variously directed segments are interwoven into a seamless narrative about the events leading up to and taking place on the day of the American invasion of Normandy during WWII.Released in 1962 and produced by an artist of the old school, Darryl F. Zanuck, 'The Longest Day' sits somewhere between the patriotic WWII films of the 1940s and 50s, to a greater or lesser degree all propaganda films, and those of the 1970s and 80s, which would downplay the heroism of war and instead focus on its barbarity and its toll, physical and mental, on those who fight them. This film leans much more toward the former, but it does dip its toes in the water of the latter by including a couple of moments that ask us to reflect on the sheer horror of what it must have been like to see combat during the World War. Of course, compared to a film like 'Saving Private Ryan,' its version of the Normandy beach landing looks quaint, but taken as a whole this film is better than Spielberg's, because it rejects the maudlin and sentimental story around which Spielberg anchored his film and replaces it with a much more objective, journalistic style. The film looks jaw-droppingly amazing, a marvel of sheer physical scale. If this were made today, CGI effects would do at least a half of what real actors and physical locations do in this film.The film stars everybody and his mother. OK, so actually it doesn't feature anyone's mother, since only one role in the movie out of hundreds, that of a French resistance fighter, is played by a female. But it's a who's who of male talent, some of them -- John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Sal Mineo, Richard Burton -- already superstars when the film was released, and others -- Sean Connery, George Segal, Rod Steiger -- about to become so.But the real star of 'The Longest Day' is Samuel E. Beetley, the film's editor. This is a movie entirely made in the editing room, and it's one of the best examples of the art form ever committed to screen. Beetley was rightfully nominated for an Oscar nomination, but had the misfortune of seeing his work go up against that other little movie from 1962, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' which won just about every technical award it could. That would have been a tough choice, but I'm not so sure that, much as I love 'Lawrence' and think it's overall by far the better film, I wouldn't have given Beetley his due.The film did win Oscars for its black and white cinematography (thankfully 'Lawrence' was in color) and its special effects. In addition to editing, it received nominations for Best Picture and Best Art Direction (B&W), which is also phenomenal.Oscar trivia: 'The Longest Day' was one of three films in 1962 (the other two being 'The Music Man' and 'Mutiny on the Bounty') that managed to be nominated for Best Picture without receiving nominations for directing, acting, or writing, the only time that's ever happened in a year with only five Best Picture nominees.Grade: A",9,1,3,6 February 2017
Moulin Rouge!," Ugh!
","Well, I guess I didn't 'get it,' since that's how everyone who loves this stinking movie explains away those of us who don't. Couldn't have anything to do with the ridiculous performances (who else wanted to see John Leguizamo take a long walk off a short pier, and who else but me felt embarrassed for poor Jim Broadbent, terrific in so many other things), Baz Luhrmann's irritating directorial style (his target audience would appear to be 14-year old girls with ADS), or the banal music ('Hedwig and the Angry Inch,' a REAL musical, made fun of 'I Will Always Love You.' 'Moulin Rouge' pays homage to it). This film is vapid eye candy stretched out over an exhausting 2 hours. Congrats, Baz---you've succeeded in inventing a new genre---the feature-length MTV video.

Ex Machina," And God Created Ava
","Stories about artificial intelligence (or at least the ones I've seen) most usually focus on the moral implications of those who create it. Are we entitled to wear the mantle of a god, and if we are, what is our obligation to the things we create? 'Ex Machina' is a unique addition to the genre, because it flips the question: what moral obligations (if any) inform the responses of man's creations, and are we prepared for the consequences if we create intelligence without a sense of right and wrong? The fear that our technology will some day turn on us is not a new one and hasn't been since the dawn of storytelling. But this film manages to mine some new and interesting ideas from the same general premise. Ava is an artificial being created by a sort of mad scientist (Oscar Isaac). A programmer who works for the scientist (Domhnall Gleeson) wins the chance to spend a week at his reclusive complex and interact with Ava as a sort of test to see how convincing she is. A cat and mouse game ensues between the scientist and programmer as the latter decides he needs to liberate Ava from captivity. What neither takes into consideration is Ava's ruthlessness and willingness to do whatever she needs to do to gain her freedom.'Ex Machina' plays out slowly and creepily, heightening the tension by gradual degrees. It's not a totally satisfying movie if you begin to think about it too much -- many details feel thrown in to service the plot rather than because they feel right for the story, not the least of which is how quickly Gleeson's character becomes infatuated enough with Ava to want to run off with her. But if you're willing to suspend disbelief a bit, the film offers an unusually intelligent and cerebral compliment to the glut of technology-run-amok films on the market.Grade: A-",8,1,3,17 August 2015
Patton," Solidly Crafted and Smart WWII Drama
","A fairly rousing WWII film that boasts a tremendous performance from George C. Scott in the title role. The movie begins famously with Scott addressing a troop of soldiers while standing in front of a massive American flag. It's a daring way to open a movie, and Scott makes it riveting. He's so good in the first few minutes that you might think the rest of the film loses some steam afterwards. It doesn't. Scott carries this film for its entire 170 minutes, and there's hardly a scene that he's not in.'Patton' isn't so much a biopic about one man as it is a document of one leader's decisions during wartime. It's smart and sensitive enough that it doesn't pander to easy sentiment or mindless patriotism, yet it's not exactly an indictment of war either. It seems to take the point of view that WWII was horrible but necessary, and that leaders like Patton were necessary if we were going to win -- people who seem custom made to exist during wartime and whom you can't imagine existing in any other context.Grade: A",8,2,4,14 March 2007
The Illusionist," A Thinking Man's Pot-Boiler
","'The Illusionist' is a nifty but rather strange film. It's a mystery whose central mystery, once revealed, isn't all that mysterious, yet the film manages to build an exciting amount of suspense anyway.It's success, I think, lies in the fact that it builds a great deal of character development and character-driven subplots into the film, so that not everything hinges on how tricky you find the ending to be. As Paul Giamatti's police inspector character begins to connect the pieces of the puzzle in the film's climactic moments, it's more fun to watch his face responding to the trick than it is to see how the trick was pulled off in the first place.Edward Norton, as usual, does a fine job as master magician Eisenheim, who meets his long-lost childhood love (Jessica Biel) ten years after they were parted and told they could never be together, due to class differences. From there, it's up to Eisenheim to pull off his most elaborate illusion yet, and make them 'disappear,' as his young love asks him to do early in the film. But where does reality end and illusion begin? The film plays with that question in what is mostly pot-boiler fashion while giving it just enough intellectual trimmings (talk about the soul, etc.) to satisfy those who want a little meat with their thrillers.And Philip Glass provides a musical score that sounds for all the world like the one he composed for 'The Hours,' though what worked so well for that movie feels less suited for the material here.Grade: B+",7,1,2,19 September 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Flame On, Guys! (Wasn't That a Song by the Village People?)
","I'm used to being in the minority when it comes to movies. But usually, I hate movies that everyone else seems to love. It's much rarer that there will be a movie almost universally disliked, but which I actually enjoyed. 'Fantastic Four' is one of those.Maybe by the time I saw this I was just sick of all the brooding, psychologically complex superheroes out there and found a good old-fashioned cheesy comic book movie refreshing. What I like about this story is that the Fantastic Four have their superpowers foisted on them, and then have to figure out how to use them. They have a regular Joe quality to them that makes them easier to relate to. They don't have sinister back stories full of murdered parents, ugly childhoods, seething feelings of revenge. They're just geeky scientists who can do pretty cool things.People seem to be responding to the second installment, 'Rise of the Silver Surfer,' marginally better than they did the first, but I like both of them. After the overblown mess that was the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy and all of the dithery angst that filled Sam Raimi's 'Spiderman' series, it's nice to sit back and let 90 minutes of fun, worry free action adventure cleanse the palate.Grade: A-",7,6,13,25 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Maybe Brad Pitt Should Stick to Zippers
","I read a book a couple of years ago called 'The Confessions of Max Tivoli,' about a man who ages backwards. The book was nothing special, a moderate diversion at best, but what it did do well was explore the emotional and psychological conflicts the main character faced as he watched everyone around him -- including his love -- lose their youth while he gained his.That same kind of conflict is the missing ingredient in 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,' and without it, this wisp of a story doesn't add up to anything. This film is a three-hour journey with a blank slate of a character who doesn't seem to react much to the things that happen to him. Yes, Benjamin Button ages backwards, but the film never establishes how Benjamin's life is any different because of this quirk than if he had aged traditionally. The gimmick offers a lot of excuses for cool special and makeup effects, but otherwise this is just a long and rather boring episodic story that doesn't have anything to say about its characters.It's time for the world to face that fact that Brad Pitt is simply a limited actor, and it's a mistake to put him at the center of any film that relies on a complex performance to make it work. The same thing was wrong with last year's 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,' but that film worked despite Pitt's presence, largely because good actors were cast in all of the other roles, and they created interesting characters to compensate for the dull one at the film's center. The same is not so here. The only other actor who gets a meaty role to play is Cate Blanchett, and though she looks lovely, she's simply not given the material with which to create a memorable performance. Taraji P. Henson, who plays Pitt's mother, just does the strong Southern mom routine that Sally Field already created in 'Forrest Gump.' The best performance comes from Tilda Swinton, who has a tiny role as an enigmatic woman who shares some intimate moments with Benjamin. She was so fascinating that I would rather have left the movie I was watching to follow her story instead. That's never a good sign.It's hard to believe that the David Fincher who made last year's endlessly fascinating 'Zodiac' helmed this film as well. While 'Benjamin Button' is nowhere nearly as maudlin as it could have been (and probably would have been in someone else's hands), it's downright gloopy compared to Fincher's other works. The sentimentality is not helped by Pitt's thunderous voice over narration that's full of machine-made homilies, the kind that start with phrases like 'The funny thing about home is....' or 'Sometimes the people that mean the most to us....' The film is as technically accomplished as they come, every scene pretty as a picture. But one wishes that Fincher and company had spent a little less time making their film look nice and more time fleshing out a story that would engage our interest for nearly three hours.Grade: B-",6,7,17,29 December 2008
Transformers," Uncle Sam Wants You (to See This Movie)
","I was actually slightly motion sick after leaving this film, so my final impression of it is somewhat marred by that, but overall this was dumb summer fun at its best. I was the right age for the transformer toys, but I never really got into them. However, having played with them is not a prerequisite for enjoying the film.These kind of movies crack me up. They are so obvious in their intentions to traffic in the gut emotions of an audience not used to thinking very critically about what they are watching. This film, like most of Michael Bay's films, is a gussied up military recruitment ad, the kind where all of the soldiers in it are muscled and oily, and where they do a lot of walking toward the camera in emphatic slow motion. There are girls in the film (two of them, to be exact), but they're basically just guys with breasts and nice legs. The government is to be feared and distrusted, because they keep secrets from the American people (like the fact that the Hoover Dam was really built as a facade to hide alien robots and their belongings), while the military is heroic and manly. To make itself feel relevant, the film even throws in some action scenes set in the Middle East.It was refreshing, though, that for once all of the chest-thumping is not reserved solely for the United States, but rather for the human race in general. The message in 'Transformers,' other than that geeky teenagers have the stuff soldiers are made of, is that the human race isn't so bad after all, even if we have a lot to learn.Grade: A-",7,3,9,9 July 2007
Hidden Figures," Ladies, Welcome to NASA
","'Hidden Figures' is the NASA version of 'The Help,' in which a bunch of white moviegoers watch a palatable civil rights tale with a happy ending and then get to congratulate themselves for being so open- minded about watching a movie about black people in the first place.Actually, 'Hidden Figures' is a much better movie than 'The Help,' and it tries much harder to create three dimensional characters rather than the cartoonish caricatures that populated the other film. Taraji P. Henson, Janelle Monae, and Octavia Spencer are the three ladies at the film's center, black women who had to fight tooth and nail to get themselves taken seriously at NASA, while Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, and Jim Parsons get the thankless roles of playing the characters who represent WHITE PEOPLE and their varying degrees of racist bullsh*t. Though it isn't exactly subtle, it could have hit its emotional buttons much harder than it does, and it's a quite enjoyable film.Lost the 2016 Best Picture Oscar to 'Moonlight,' which is as it should have been.Grade: A-",8,2,6,16 June 2017
Coco," Didn't Connect with 'Coco'
","I have to admit that 'Coco' left me a little bit cold.It's got dazzling and colorful animation, and it brilliantly brings to life the land of the dead. It's also refreshing to see a high-profile animated film focused on a people and a culture (in this case Mexico and specifically its celebration of the Day of the Dead) that aren't traditionally represented in mainstream movies. But the story just didn't connect with me the way the best Pixar movies (like 'Wall-E' and 'Toy Story 3') do. I knew when I was supposed to cry, but I wasn't sad enough to. I'm not at all religious and I don't believe in an afterlife or think about the dead in the same way this film obviously does, so maybe that explains my rather indifferent reaction to it when others seem to be responding so strongly to it.Grade: B",7,3,14,5 December 2017
1917," Technically Accomplished, Emotionally Weak
","The first thing anybody will tell you about '1917' is that it was filmed to look like one long take. It's the kind of movie that uses 'making of' featurettes as part of its marketing strategy. Unless you really dig movies that are technically accomplished but not much else, beware. Remember 'The Revenant?' Remember how whenever anyone involved with that movie talked about it in public all they talked about was how grueling it was to film? They didn't talk about the characters, or the story, or the themes, or the emotional investment. No, it was just a bunch of logistics about how to work in the cold.Yes, '1917' is a technical marvel, and I would probably recommend it just so that people can see it for themselves, as I'm sure a lot of people will be dazzled enough by it that they won't care that the gimmick came first and the story came later. My problem is that, for a movie that's supposed to make us feel what it's like to be dumped into the chaos of war, it feels so overly choreographed. The film never stops being impressed with itself, and as the camera tracks and swoops and swirls around perfectly art directed WWI battlefields, you can practically hear Sam Mendes cooing 'wait till they get a load of THIS shot.' I was so distracted by watching the gimmick that I never felt involved in the story.But maybe that's for the best, since there isn't much of a story to be invested in. Mendes went to the Steven Spielberg school of directing, where character motivations are so simplistic that a five year old could understand them. Thomas Newman provides a typically thunderous score that telegraphs every time it comes blaring on the screen exactly how we're supposed to feel, which can pretty much be summed up as 'War Bad. Heroes Good.' Roger Deakins, who deserves every ounce of praise he's sure to get for this movie, does create some beautiful and astonishing images, but the one-shot approach gets monotonous after a while and draws attention to what a contribution skillful editing would have made to the film's rhythms.One thing that surprises me somewhat is that among all the awards buzz this film is generating, none of it has been for lead actor George MacKay, who delivers a stunning and stunningly physical performance. Because the whole movie is designed to look like one continuous shot, he is by definition in literally every moment of it, and he totally carries it. If Leo DiCaprio could win an Oscar for grunting and grimacing his way through 'The Revenant,' why shouldn't MacKay be recognized for this?Grade: B+",6,11,26,21 January 2020
Lincoln," My Stovepipe Hat Off to You, Mr. Day-Lewis
","'Lincoln' is the kind of movie that it's easy to admire but difficult to love.It would be easy to dismiss the film as pure Oscar bait, and the Academy predictably ate it up, making it the most nominated film of 2012. But to give Steven Spielberg his due, though his films have frequently been tailor made to the tastes of the Academy, I've never felt like winning awards was his primary motivation for making films. A passion for the story he's telling has always come through, sometimes so much so that it works at odds to the film's success ('Amistad,' 'War Horse.') In 'Lincoln,' Spielberg restrains himself admirably, and mostly chooses to leave out the emotional manipulation that can make his films so unbearable. The acting is the star of this movie, particularly that of Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role. What Day-Lewis does isn't even acting as the term applies to pretty much any other person in the movie business. He becomes Lincoln, and if the performance isn't as showy as his transformation into Daniel Plainview in 'There Will Be Blood,' it's no less amazing. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones are the other two principals who copped Oscar noms, and both are terrific. Nearly everyone else in the world (and that includes James Spader) is in the movie -- you never know who's going to pop up next.It takes a considerable amount of talent from all involved to make a movie about the ratification of an amendment 150 years ago -- considering we all already know the outcome -- not only engaging but downright suspenseful.Grade: A-",8,0,1,15 February 2013
Sing Street," A John Hughes Movie for a Generation of People Who Don't Know Who John Hughes Was
","One of my favorite movies of 2016 is this charming, funny, and poignant film set in 1985 Ireland.'Sing Street' is like an 80s movie filtered through a 2016 perspective, so all of the requisite themes and characteristics of films like 'The Breakfast Club' and 'Pretty in Pink' (and pretty much any film starring Molly Ringwald) are present -- championing nonconformity, resisting the oppression of rigid rules and institutions, montages of upbeat pop songs -- but refreshed to feel relevant in our current cultural climate. This film gave me the feeling I think Richard Curtis films are supposed to, except that his movies are so terrible.And 'Sing Street' has a kick-ass soundtrack.Grade: A",9,2,4,27 January 2017
Children of Men," Left Me Speechless
","I'm nearly at a loss for words.'Children of Men' took my breath away with the sheer visual audacity of its storytelling and the deep strength of feeling contained in it. Alfonso Cuaron, adding his voice to the many other directors who have made post-9/11 films about the grim state of a world governed by terror and hopelessness, has given us one of the most memorable and dramatically satisfying films I've seen in a long, long time.Much ballyhoo has greeted the trio of Mexican directors who released films this year, and people have been wetting themselves over Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's 'Babel' and especially Guillermo Del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth.' 'Children of Men' blows both of these films off the map. Cuaron's world view seems to be as grim as his compatriots, but unlike Innaritu and Del Toro, Cuaron seems to think that the world in which we live is worth saving and uses his movie to deliver a practical message of hope that resonates in the here and now. 'Children of Men' is the most uplifting downer I think I've ever seen, and the long scene in which a small, crying baby temporarily halts the warfare and carnage taking place around it, for one instant uniting enemies in the wonder and glory of new life, reduced this viewer to tears (and I don't cry easily at movies).Cuaron's visual style is absolutely stunning. He creates a meticulously detailed vision of a nightmare future that is all the more horrifying for its plausibility. And there are a couple of extended set pieces (I'm thinking most notably of the one in which a car containing our hero, Clive Owen, and a group of activists/terrorists is attacked by an angry mob, the entire scene filmed in one long take by a camera that never leaves the car) that astounded me with their showmanship. And yet, for all of its directorial panache, I never felt that style overwhelmed substance -- Cuaron ably and completely welds style to subject in such a way that his approach always perfectly serves the story he's telling without drawing attention to itself.I think it's very interesting that the end of this film is inspiring so much debate, and that different people have completely opposite readings of it. Some think it's dismally depressing, lacking in any sign of hope. Others think it's optimistic, the happiest ending possible in such a dystopian work of fiction. I believe the ambiguity is intentional on Cuaron's part, and I personally came away exhilarated by the powerful message of hope, and a reinforcement of the belief that there will always be good people willing to do good things for others in the belief that the world can change for the better. Maybe I read into the ending what I wanted to read into it, but maybe that's the point. Perhaps those who think this movie has nothing to say have given up already on the state of the world, while those of us who find in it a happy ending are those who will continue to refuse to accept that a world governed by panic and fear is acceptable.'Children of Men' makes a nice companion piece to this year's 'Little Children,' another downer that ended up being one of the biggest feel-good movies of the year for me. It's so refreshing to find that there are directors who want to do more than simply wallow in gloominess, and actually offer solutions even as they highlight problems.Grade: A+",10,6,14,10 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Would a Bright, Primary Color Here or There Be Too Much to Ask, Mr. Eastwood?
","'Million Dollar Baby' hit me like a punch to the solar plexus while I was watching it in the theater. But then afterwards, when I started to think critically about the movie, little nagging details started to really bug me and took away from the film's lingering impact.Clint Eastwood does fine work as an actor, but my praise of his directing abilities has cooled somewhat over time. There's something overly formal about his films that always remind me I'm watching a movie. 'Million Dollar Baby' is relentlessly gray and brown, both in actual physical production design and in tone. Though it seems like matter-of-fact filmmaking stripped of any pretense, Eastwood infuses his controversial story with very little ambiguity. He stacks the deck so much in favor of the film's final thesis -- that assisted suicide with dignity is better than living out the rest of one's life in a paralyzed state -- that there's little room for argument. And the goonish caricatures he presents as Hilary Swank's trailer trash family are an embarrassment to his movie.This film clearly comes from a heartfelt place, but it's not without its flaws.Grade: B+",7,0,3,3 September 2010
Garden State," Terrific Debut
","'Garden State' is an excellent first effort for Zach Braff: personal, textured and authentic. There are really only a couple of scenes (his reconciliation with his father and the soliloquy delivered by Denis O'Hare's character) that feel clunky and too pat. The rest of the film is notable for how realistic it feels --- the characters don't necessarily find their ways to happy endings, but they do come to better endings.Zach Braff gives a great performance here in addition to his directorial debut. Natalie Portman also shines--there's something so magnetic about her persona, she can walk into a scene and immediately make the movie about her (as she did in 'Closer'). And all of the other actors in smaller roles -- Peter Sarsgaard, Ian Hom, Jean Smart -- create memorable characters with the sometimes limited material they're given to work with.When I was watching the special features on the DVD of 'Garden State,' the director of photography mentioned how he thought the movie's look and feel are reminiscent of the Hal Ashby movies from the '70's, and I thought this was very astute. Watching 'Garden State,' I was reminded of 'Harold and Maude.' It's quirky and goofy like that movie, but it doesn't ever feel forced or like it's trying too hard.

Confidential.' But this movie deserves some attention of its own, thanks largely to the two terrific central performances of Pacino and Depp. It's also adeptly directed by Mike Newell, whose biggest claim to fame up to that point was directing the break out hit romance 'Four Weddings and a Funeral.'

Event Horizon," Movie Can't Survive Its Ending
","Many films have explored the paradox of being trapped in the infinite vastness of space, and 'Event Horizon' joins the club.This blend of sci-fi and visceral horror is never much better than a cut-rate version of 'Alien,' but at its best it does manage an effectively claustrophobic atmosphere and a sense of creeping dread. But the film's best moments are a distant memory by the time the last 20 minutes or so have played out, and we watch a scary premise collapse under the weight of its attempt to make sense. Many of the final scenes are just silly, and the very end is a clunker.Movies like this don't need terrific actors, but it could have used one better than Laurence Fishburne, who has the largest role and never acts like anything more is at stake in this life and death scenario than whether or not he's going to get the salad dressing he asked for.Grade: C+",5,1,2,2 November 2010

This ain't your standard Disney fare, but is rather a morbid and hilarious movie that I watch every Halloween season. The songs by Danny Elfman seem so-so upon a first listen, but they get better on multiple viewings too. If you like Edward Gory, you will like this movie (though he's not credited as doing so, his artwork *had* to inspire the people who designed this movie).Grade: A+",9,1,2,10 October 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Best Film About American Media Since 'Network'
","Every once in a while, a character actor who has made a living popping up here and there in mostly unmemorable roles, is cast in a film and does such an amazing job that everyone starts immediately wondering why he or she isn't more famous. However, if you think about it, this sort of makes sense. Character actors don't carry around the baggage of being big-name Hollywood personas; they can entirely sink into a role and not fight audience tendencies to watch them as a celebrity rather than as a character. This works even more to their advantage when they're asked to play real people.I'm not even that familiar with Edward R. Murrow, the famous American newscaster who waged a media war that eventually brought down Joseph McCarthy, but even if David Strathairn comes nowhere close to accurately impersonating Murrow, he gives a fantastic and intense performance. This movie is a terse, succinct account of the Murrow/McCarthy debates; there's not really a wasted moment or one single superfluous scene or line of dialogue. George Clooney (who deserves much credit for his work as director on the film) plays Fred Friendly, producer at CBS and, as portrayed here, Murrow's chief ally. The chemistry between he and Strathairn is terrific, especially in a scene toward the end of the film when they both have their hands slapped by the head of CBS, played by Frank Langella. Despite the fact that he appears in virtually every scene, and as good as he is, Strathairn does not walk away with the picture; it's a generous lead performance in that he allows every other actor, even in mostly small roles, to shine (Clooney should probably be credited for this as well). Robert Downey, Jr. and Patricia Clarkson play a secretly married couple who work on Murrow's news team. Their storyline might feel unnecessary on a casual viewing, but I thought it brought a nice dose of humanism to the film, and reminded the viewer that the war against McCarthyism was not simply an effort to save careers and professional reputations, but also to save personal and private lives. The movie is so tightly contained and so confined to the world of the news room, that it would be easy not to think of anyone in the film as having actual lives beyond the ones they lead at CBS, and the Clarkson/Downey, Jr. storyline is a clever way to convey that. And let me throw in one last bit of praise for another actor, Jeff Daniels, who in recent years has really impressed me with his versatility, and makes quite an impression in this film in only two or three brief scenes.'Good Night, and Good Luck' is unashamedly one-sided. Clooney obviously has very strong feelings about the role media should play in American culture, and the responsibility news providers should feel in brining the public what they think the public needs, not necessarily what it wants. Given the fact that a recent devastating earthquake in Pakistan has been all but ignored by American media in favor of World Series coverage, I'd say this message has significant relevance. And in the lessons learned by the McCarthy debacle, it's not hard to draw a parallel to the current Bush Administration, and its efforts to label anyone remotely critical of American policy in Iraq as unsupportive of our troops or as unpatriotic, a band wagon on to which too many Americans are jumping for my comfort.I've not seen as good a film about the American media since 'Network,' and in some ways I like this movie even more. 'Network' is satire, effective satire, but satire nonetheless; it never feels exactly real. 'Good Night...', on the other hand, is remarkable for how authentic it feels; I never felt like I was watching scripted actors, but rather was watching an especially exciting documentary. This is easily one of the 'must see' films of the year.Grade: A+",10,3,6,24 October 2005
Mulholland Drive," Films Just Don't Get Much Better
","While not strictly a horror film, 'Mulholland Drive' scared me more than most bona fide horror films I've seen. I remember going out to the alley to throw away some trash after watching this movie and looking over my shoulder the whole time.'Mulholland Drive,' while enigmatic, is one of the more accessible of David Lynch's puzzle pictures. Naomi Watts blows the lid off the joint in a tour de force performance as a young woman who goes to Hollywood to become an actress and is swallowed by the rotten jungle that is the city of dreams as it exists in Lynch's brilliant head.I used to dismiss Lynch as too clinical and cerebral a director. His movies always made me feel bad without understanding why. But after seeing more of his work, I'm struck by the strong, almost aching, emotional quality that pulses through much of it, underneath the visual and narrative sleight-of-hand. 'Mulholland Drive' is scary as hell, but it's also deeply sad and moving.This was the best film of 2001.Grade: A+",10,6,10,26 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Didn't Leave Me Wanting More
","As the dust settled on 'The Force Awakens' and I had a chance to re-watch it a few times, the weaknesses and flaws that were initially masked by both low expectations and it being so much more like a 'Star Wars' movie than any of the prequels became painfully obvious. Fun as it is at times, it's just a rehash of 'A New Hope' with a hopelessly lazy second half.I was worried that 'The Last Jedi' would therefore be a retread of 'The Empire Strikes Back,' and the fact that it's not is a notch in its favor. However, one wishes that Rian Johnson's entry in the space saga had 'Empire's' propulsive narrative drive and cliff hanger surprises. Instead, he's made a film that feels like a placeholder until someone figures out where they want to take this story.I am a 'Star Wars' fan, but I am not upset about the things all of the other fans seem to be upset about. I feel like it's still early enough that I can't explicitly talk about what those things are for fear of spoiling the plot for others, but I overall embraced the film's theme of letting go of the past, even if that means letting go of some of our preconceived notions about the 'Star Wars' universe and the characters who populate it. 'Star Wars' for a new generation, indeed.No, what I disliked about this film was more lazy storytelling and the fact that it felt stalled. There was a lot of action happening on screen, yet by the end of the movie I felt like the overall story had gone nowhere and all of the characters ended in the same place they started, with us having learned nothing new about them. Finn, for example, didn't have a reason to be in the movie, while Poe, who gets more screen time than in 'The Force Awakens,' shows us that he's a hotshot, which we already knew. The most interesting character of all of them is Kylo Ren, and 'The Last Jedi' does well by him. And Adam Driver is emerging as the new cast's standout.I did like the murkiness introduced into this film, and the suggestion that good and bad are points of view and the line between heroes and villains can be paper thin. But this movie should have left me begging for a third installment to wrap up all the unanswered questions and mysteries, while it instead made me shrug my shoulders about this part of the 'Star Wars' story and want to go watch 'Rogue One' again (which I did).Grade: B+",7,6,23,20 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," I've Played Video Games That Make Better Movies Than This Stinker
","I was absolutely amazed by 'Guardians of the Galaxy'....amazed at how bad it was after hearing how wonderful it was.People in all seriousness are discussing whether or not this film is the new generation's 'Star Wars.' Have the people who are discussing this even seen 'Star Wars?' They must be thirteen years old.Indeed, thirteen year olds and younger are the only demographic I can possibly imagine liking this film. It struggles to achieve the same sense of whimsy and humor that infused the original 'Star Wars' trilogy, the Indiana Jones movies and even more recent super hero films (see 'Hellboy II' for a film that perfects it). But it fails miserably, mostly because the cast doesn't have the talent or the chemistry to pull it off. Chris Pratt creates a vacuum at the film's center -- he doesn't have the screen presence or charisma to carry it. And he's surrounded by a film that just starts in the middle of a dumb story, as if everyone coming to see it is already an expert on this particular series, even though it's one of the most totally obscure of any of the superhero stories. And the action sequences are a frenetic muddle made worse by the 3D. When the biggest asset in your live action film is a CGI talking raccoon, you know you're in trouble.Seriously, I am a big fan of the Ratchet and Clank video game series, which this movie put me in mind of, but R&C (a video game!!) has more humor and narrative cohesion than this film.Grade: D+",4,20,47,15 August 2014

","SCARY AS HELL!!!! This is one of the rare horror films that knows how to make gore frightening. But it's not just the blood and guts that terrifies here. it's Sam Raimi's accomplished direction and his fearless ability to make the movie so damn WEIRD that makes it such a good entry in the horror canon.A bunch of kids are staying in an isolated cabin in the woods and conjure up a bunch of demons from beyond. Sounds pretty standard. But Raimi directs with such a unique style -- cartoonish and campy in a way, yet utterly terrifying in spite of, or maybe because of, that approach -- that I wound up watching this film with one hand poised to cover my eyes at any moment, and I don't scare easily.I am not among those that think the film's sequel, 'Evil Dead 2,' is a masterpiece.

The Piano," One of the Best Films of 1993
","A lot of audiences didn't quite know what to make of 'The Piano' upon its initial release, which I think is a testament to its originality. I really hadn't seen anything quite like this movie and was riveted on my first go around with it.Jane Campion wrote and directed this story about a mute woman arranged to marry a landowner (Sam Neill) in 19th Century New Zealand. She has two loves: her young daughter (played by Anna Paquin) and her piano. She's drawn to a frightening but magnetic worker on the plantation (Harvey Keitel) and begins a torrid affair with him. Things come to a boil when she's found out by her husband.The film is intensely erotic without being gratuitous. The characters are fascinating, and the acting is uniformly stellar. Holly Hunter gives a brave and fierce performance. Not brave because she allows herself to be filmed nude frequently or because she recreates quite graphic sex acts; but rather brave because she allows her character to be complicated and difficult and perhaps to some even unlikable. She never asks for our sympathy, but she does ask for our understanding. Neill and Keitel offer able support, and child actor Paquin amazes and delivers a quite un-childlike performance.Top the whole thing off with vivid cinematography and a lush score from Michael Nyman and you have one of the best films to emerge from 1993.Grade: A",9,1,4,10 February 2009

I just wanted to add my voice to those who love this movie. If you're a movie buff, I don't see how you could come away from this film anything but dazzled, since, if nothing else, 'Kill Bill' is a joyous celebration of movies at their most eager desire to entertain.An energetic, startling, vivid, funny and at times surprisingly beautiful movie.Grade: A+",10,2,5,25 January 2006

Bernardo Bertolucci's sprawling historical epic is beautiful to look at, but it also has a brain in its head, something rare for the usual Best Picture winner. Still, it's one of the most accessible films Bertolucci has ever made, and one has to wonder if it would have received the acceptance it did had it not been so mainstream. After all, Bertolucci's masterpiece, 'The Conformist', a far better film than 'The Last Emperor' in almost every way, was almost completely ignored by the stuffy Academy back in 1971.Grade: A",8,0,1,20 June 2008

Writer/director Cameron Crowe has proved time and again that he can't write female characters worth a damn, mostly because he treats them the way adolescent boys treat women when they 'discover' them for the first time.This film goes down smoothly enough, but it's too long and Crowe's writing style is too self-consciously cutesy for my taste ('Show me the money!'

You've payed homage to yet another older film by sucking out all of the charm and entertainment value that made the film worth remaking in the first place.The original 'Clash of the Titans' from 1981 had a sense of whimsical adventure. Those involved knew just how seriously to take it all, which wasn't very seriously, and the effects served the story rather than seeming to exist for their own sake. The remake is a smörgåsbord of same-old same-old CGI that we've already seen a hundred times in other films, and the whole thing is too dogged and earnest to be much fun. The cast is lacklustre, even big deal actors like Liam Neesona and Ralph Fiennes, and can't inject the film with the campy sensibility that great actors like Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith and Burgess Meredith brought to the original. This version also removes the love story that brews between Perseus and Andromeda, which gave the first film a sense romantic and heroic adventure.The first boring and unmemorable action film of 2010.Grade: C",5,1,2,6 April 2010
Jurassic World," One Dinosaur, Two Dinosaur, Red Dinosaur, Blue Dinosaur
","Oh, will those crazy dinosaur-creating scientists never learn? As if all the people gobbled up by giant reptilians run amok over the course of three previous movies wasn't enough, a giant corporation thinks it's a grand idea to open Jurassic World, the Sea World of dinosaurs. And because dinosaurs have become de rigeur, audiences demand bigger and meaner ones if they are to continue buying tickets. Thus, a team of geneticists manufacture monsters intended to satisfy customers, until they do too good a job and create one that's a sort of super hero and has all the best traits from various other dinosaurs combined into one. When it escapes from its pen, things go predictably badly.Once I recovered from the disappointment of realizing that Bryce Dallas Howard was not going to be swallowed up or torn apart by the movie's end, I was able to settle in and enjoy this movie for what it was, which is a game if somewhat lacking attempt to recreate the roller coaster thrills of Steven Spielberg's first installment. Remember that one, that ancient relic of a movie that came out way back in 1993? Yes, it's so old I'm surprised it was even in color. Of course we need a reboot -- God forbid anyone should be bothered to push a button and stream the original from any number of available services.'Jurassic World' has lots of set pieces that sound good on paper, and they manage to offer up a moderate does of entertainment, but there's something lacking from the whole enterprise that made the first one so special. It's got the same slick production values and technical wizardry (though the visual effects in the first one look better than the ones in this, despite being more than 20 years old). But it feels like a movie written and directed by a committee; you never appreciate Spielberg's ability to direct an action sequence until you see someone try to imitate him.Chris Pratt, once again, is not up to the nominal challenge of the role he's been given. Every time I see him in a movie, he's just missing whatever essential quality the character he's playing needs in order to work. In 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' it was a roguish scruffiness. In this, it's a macho resourcefulness. But he's never convincing as anything other than a pretty boy bro. It's like ordering Indiana Jones and getting a doofus frat boy.The most memorable sequence in the movie is one where a flock of pterodactyls swoops down on the unsuspecting visitors to the theme park and wreak all kinds of havoc. The rest of the movie is a blur.Grade: B",6,4,11,10 January 2016
Paranormal Activity," Had the Makings of a Horror Classic, But Then That Ending....
","Oh, why, why, why did the makers of this movie ruin what had been a hugely creepy little fright flick with a terribly stupid ending? In the tradition of 'The Blair Witch Project,' 'Paranormal Activity' is one of those gimmick movies, in which a young couple films themselves sleeping at night in an attempt to capture on screen the ghostly goings on that have been plaguing them. There's not much more to the movie than the pleasurable tension it gradually builds as the freaky happenings escalate in intensity from night to night. There are some hints at a traumatizing past for the woman and a sometimes strained relationship with her boyfriend (who she clearly wants to be her fiancé), but the screenplay doesn't go anywhere with these narrative threads. It's just as well, because the appeal of the movie lies in the fact that these are supposedly two ordinary joes filming themselves without pretense, and too much narrative would ruin the effect.For almost its entire length, 'Paranormal Activity' is pretty scary, and proves how much horror you can eek out of doors that move by themselves and things that go bump in the night. How disappointing, therefore, that the film thinks it needs to cap itself with a hard-sell finale like something right out of a big-budget horror film. It really mars the effect of everything that's preceded it.The DVD version of the film offers an alternate ending that's much better and is much more consistent with the rest of the movie's tone. But the makers clearly thought they needed something grander to please the teeny-bopper crowd.Grade: B",6,0,2,1 April 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Depp Nearly Ruins It
","I usually like Johnny Depp's quirky approach to characters and credit him for making many films much better than they had any right being, but for once his instincts are off. In Tim Burton's new take on the classic children's story, he nearly derails the film with his weird, creepy interpretation of candy empresario Willy Wonka.It's not that I was comparing this to the Gene Wilder original; I didn't much like that version either (though I liked Wilder's performance more) and thought Roald Dahl's book was due for a retry. And in the first 20 minutes, leading up to the day actually spent in the chocolate factory, Burton nails Dahl's story just right. In many ways it's a perfect matching of artist and source material, and the cordial relationship shows for a while. But once Depp enters the picture, Burton gives him free reign to walk away with it, but I didn't like where he took it.People have said Depp reminds them of both Carol Burnett and Michael Jackson. Throw Carol Channing and Frances McDormand from 'Fargo' into the mix and you get a pretty good idea of how he plays the character. The thing is, the writers screwed up big time in giving Wonka so much back story and making him a character that begs for redemption. The great thing about Wonka in the book was that he wasn't explained; he was a candy genius, his life was devoted to making great candy, end of story. The point Dahl was making was about proper ways for children to behave, not about reconnecting with your family, father/son relationships, blah, blah, blah. Dahl's book was perfection, so why mess with it? Other than the awful additions, however, this film stays much truer to the book than the 1971 version. There are some great songs by Danny Elfman for the Oompah-Loompahs to perform, the bad kids are deliciously bratty, and Freddie Highmore is really winning as Charlie. Maybe in another 30 years they'll try to adapt this book again and get it right. Or people could just stop trying to make movies of the book and (gasp!) actually read it instead.Grade: B-",6,0,3,6 September 2005
The Adjustment Bureau," When Bad Execution Happens to a Decent Premise
","What could have been a nifty, high-concept premise is hampered by poor execution in this supernatural thriller starring Matt Damon and Emily Blunt.The religious angle is pushed a little too hard for my personal taste, but I could even have swallowed that if it hadn't been couched in a lame script that spends half of its time delivering plot exposition straight up to the audience. There are a thousand plot holes throughout the movie that had my wife and I rolling our eyes with exasperation, and most of them are admittedly nicely resolved by the ending. But though I liked the resolution the movie came to -- and the message about the role free will plays in the lives of men -- a good movie doesn't make its audience wait until the very last scene to convince them that it's not just a stupid and badly-written piece of disposable junk.Emily Blunt is appealing as always, but her character is terribly annoying (I would have slapped her right around the time she dunked my cell phone in a cup of coffee), and Matt Damon is serviceable but unmemorable. John Slattery has fun simply playing a variation on Roger, his character from 'Mad Men,' and Terence Stamp tries to bring some British dignity to the proceedings, if unsuccessfully.Grade: C+",5,2,5,8 December 2011
Cold War," Not Much Chemistry
","A musician and his muse carry out an on-again-off-again romance in the two decades following WWII.'Cold War' left me feeling like my lack of understanding about Poland and post-war Polish identity prevented me from fully appreciating this movie. The whole time I was watching it, I felt like there was something I was missing. But I have to judge a movie based on my personal reaction to it, and this one left me cold. The two leads have little chemistry, and the movie doesn't make a compelling case that these two damaged souls can't live without each other. We're just told they can't, but we're never shown. Because I didn't care about their relationship, and I didn't much care for them as individuals (we never learn very much about either of them), I never felt vested in anything happening and I couldn't care less about whether they ended up together, apart, alive, or dead.The film has some rapturous followers, so I'll have to just live with the fact that I missed the boat on this one.Nominated for three Oscars at the upcoming 2018 Academy Awards: Best Foreign Language Film (Poland), Best Director (Pawel Pawlikowski), and Best Cinematography.Grade: B-",6,20,35,6 February 2019
Black Hawk Down," A Dunderheaded Combat Film from Ridley Scott
","Ridley Scott followed up his thunderous and bombastic (and inexplicably Oscar-winning) 'Gladiator' with this equally thunderous and bombastic combat film.Heavy handed as they come, 'Black Hawk Down' tried to position itself at the time as the next 'Saving Private Ryan,' a thinking man's war film. Too bad the film is dumb as a stump, well choreographed but a big zero in the story and character department. No matter how well executed battle scenes are, they're not overly engaging if not anchored to a story or people we care about. Missing those elements, this film is a monotonous bore, and an excruciatingly long one at that.Nominated for 4 technical Oscars, the film won for Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing.Grade: C-",4,2,5,26 July 2010
Silence," For a Non-Believer This Movie Is a Slog
","It's my own fault. I broke my own rule about watching religious movies, so I shouldn't have been surprised that I was bored to tears by 'Silence.' I don't believe in God, and religion plays absolutely no role in my life. I think the Bible is mythology, created for the same reason mythology existed for other cultures -- to explain things about the world that are otherwise unexplainable. That religion is important to the vast majority of humans does not bother me. I have nothing against those who practice. But I'm not moved by stories of faith or the struggles of those who undergo religious doubt, because for me there's about as much worth in expending mental energy trying to decide whether or not Tinkerbell is real.I didn't care about anybody in 'Silence,' Martin Scorsese's ambitious dud of a movie. I certainly didn't care much about the main protagonist, a priest played by Andrew Garfield, because his primary conflict is trying to understand why God stays silent in the face of so much human misery. Well that question for me was answered before the movie even began, so I certainly didn't need 2 and a half hours of pontification about it. I felt the most for the Japanese people who weren't allowed to practice Catholicism by a brutal regime who would torture and kill them if they did not reject it, because I believe people should be able to worship however they want. But this all happened so long ago and it all remains so abstract and Scorsese was not able to bring it alive in any compelling way.Nominated for a Best Cinematography Oscar.Grade: C",4,4,5,30 August 2017
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," The Fabulous, Mesmerizing Hedwig
","Fantastic rock musical about a German transsexual singer and her band's rivalry with a young and mainstream hipster.'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' is simply brilliant, a glorious ode to making peace with yourself, whoever you are. John Cameron Mitchell, who created the role and the stage show on which the film is based, is phenomenal, taking a character whose persona is built on caricature and letting us see the good, bad and everything in between of the real person. It helps that the film's soundtrack is stunning -- there's not really a weak song in the bunch.My personal favorites are 'Origin of Love' and 'Wig in a Box.' Grade: A+",10,0,1,28 July 2010
Big Fish," Tim Burton's Tall Tale
","A change of pace for director Tim Burton, about a young man (Billy Crudup) trying to come to terms with his father (Albert Finney) by bonding with him over his father's tall tales about his past.Ewan McGregor plays Finney as a young man, and the story sequences give Burton free reign to indulge his penchant for fantasy and surrealism. The present-day portions of the film, which also feature Jessica Lange as Crudup's mom, are a bit more heavy handed and sappy, the sentimental overdose barely kept in check by the good actors.Danny Elfman provided the Academy Award-nominated score.Grade: B+",7,0,0,30 August 2010

","Absolute stunner from Michael Mann about an everyday Joe (Russell Crowe, fattened out and uglied up) who teams with a powerhouse attorney (Al Pacino) to expose corrupt dealings at a big tobacco company.The film is based on a true story, and the payoff is only as good as it was in real life, which is modest to say the least. But the film benefits from smokin' direction from Mann and stellar performances by Crowe, Pacino and Chrisopher Plummer, who plays Mike Wallace, the man who broke the story to the American people on '60 Minutes.' Nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, 'The Insider' went home empty-handed while embarrassingly lesser films like 'American Beauty' and 'The Cider House Rules' dominated.Grade: A+",10,1,2,28 June 2010
Quiz Show," Redford's Fiendishly Entertaining Movie About Entertainment
","Robert Redford reminded everyone what a good director he could be with this slick and supremely entertaining film about the quiz show scandals in the early days of television.The subject seems at first glance like rather feeble material for good drama -- after all, it all happened so long ago and it was just a silly T.V. game show we're talking about here. But Redford digs into something deeper, namely the power television (or any medium, for that matter) has over its audience and the responsibility of that audience to play an active role in processing the information that medium is feeding to it.With stellar performances from Ralph Fiennes, Rob Morrow, Paul Scofield and, yes, even John Turturro, an actor I generally resist.Grade: A",8,0,0,17 March 2009
The Dark Knight," Very Good, But Yikes, Let's Keep Things in Perspective
","Whatever else it may be, 'The Dark Knight,' Christopher Nolan's follow up to his 'Batman Begins,' the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It's full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don't let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can't possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it's through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger's creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He's not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it's this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it's still, after all, a Batman movie, and it's not the best film since 'Citizen Kane.'

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Introducing the Nurse Ratched of Hogwarts
","This fifth installment in the Harry Potter franchise doesn't match Alfonso Cuaron's cinematic vision brought to life in the third film, but it is an improvement over its immediate predecessor, 'Goblet of Fire.' It shares some of that film's sense that a tremendous amount of plot is being squeezed into too short a film, and that all sorts of things that might bring subtlety and nuance to the story are being left out, but it's crisper and better adapted -- you don't have to have read the book to understand what's going on.The most persuasive argument for watching 'Order of the Phoenix' is to see Imelda Staunton's deliciously evil turn as Dolores Umbridge, a kind of fascist grandmother decked out like Jackie Kennedy, who may just have to kill you if you break her rules. She's the Nurse Ratched of Hogwarts, and you can tell Staunton is having a ball playing her. Well, I had a ball watching her....Grade: B",7,1,2,15 October 2010
Into the Wild," Didn't Find This Movie Remotely Moving
","It's too bad that I saw Werner Herzog's amazing documentary 'Grizzly Man' before I saw 'Into the Wild.' One can't help but be reminded of Herzog's film while watching Penn's, or the fact that Herzog's is so much better.Both films have as their focus troubled young men who travel to the Alaskan wilderness to escape a society in which they feel they don't belong. Both men have persecution complexes of a sort, and feel that there's something noble in their efforts to commune with the wilderness. But 'Grizzly Man' is an objective, journalistic account of Timothy Treadwell, and Herzog's fascination is with the obsessions that made him tick. 'Into the Wild,' being a fictional film, is already once-removed from the real-life story of Christopher McCandless, and director Penn piles on so much bombast and padding, that the impact of the story becomes blunted under a veneer of pure Hollywood studio.My biggest obstacle in liking this film is that I didn't like the character of Christopher, nor did I like Emile Hirsch, the actor who plays him. McCandless, who gives himself the moniker Alexander Supertramp once he's set off on his odyssey, is an arrogant 20-year old who thinks he has the world figured out, and woe be to anyone who tries to tell him otherwise. His psychological troubles stem from the emotionally (and the movie suggests at times physically) abusive environment he grew up in. His parents are played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as cartoonish caricatures of Southern aristocracy; his sister, played by Jena Malone, is the only one who Christopher believes understands him, and her character provides the film with one of the most thudding voice over narrations I've ever heard in a movie. We get it -- he shuns the materialistic world as a way of shunning his affluent parents. But a two and a half hour movie built around a kid learning a lesson that many of us already knew going into it makes for a mighty tedious movie indeed.That lesson, learned too late, is that human companionship makes life worth living, and that happiness means very little if you have no one to share it with. Many recognizable actors show up throughout the film as strangers Christopher comes across and develops fleeting relationships with, and all of them have a chance to pontificate. The trouble is that all of them (especially Catherine Keener as a hippie and Hal Holbrook as a lonely old man) are so much more interesting than Christopher himself that we wish the movie would stay with them and let Christoper be on his merry way.This movie really copped out as far as I'm concerned. Everyone Christopher comes across is gently understanding of his plan even if they try to discourage him. Not once does someone tell him that his actions represent supreme cowardice and hypocrisy. If he was so bothered by the state of society, why didn't he do something productive to help change it rather than run away and hide? Maybe this is the point Penn was trying to make, but I felt like Penn himself couldn't decide whether Christopher's behavior was foolish or admirable.I feel like I was meant to come away from this film moved by the tragedy of a life wasted. But I wasn't moved at all, nor did I find it all that tragic. 'Grizzly Man' -- now THERE's a film that moved me.Grade: B-",6,15,34,12 October 2007
Annie Hall," I Lurv 'Annie Hall.' I Luff It (with Two 'F's).....
","Woody Allen grew up with 'Annie Hall,' his at-the-time unconventional romance about two insecure but lovable New Yorkers. There's a distinct line dividing the films he had made up to that point, all of them really a 1970s equivalent to the screwball comedies of the 1930s. 'Annie Hall' brought him respect and admiration from the 'serious' film community (in other words, the film won Oscars), and Allen's movies were different from that point forward.Allen uses a complex narrative structure to tell what is in essence a simple story, using flashbacks and forwards, and integrating devices that in his earlier movies had simply been gimmicks (like talking directly into the camera) seamlessly into his story. But all of that aside, the strength of 'Annie Hall' is due to the wonderful characters Allen wrote, and the delightful performances of him and, especially, Diane Keaton, who plays Annie divinely. When Keaton first introduces us to Annie, she's a dingbat full of eccentric tics. But over the course of the film she evolves into a complicated, vulnerable yet tough woman who all too realistically outgrows Allen's character, Alvy Singer, a neurotic comedian who thinks every single person he comes in contact with is harboring hidden anti-Semitic tendencies. 'Annie Hall' gives a perfect illustration of how two people who are right for each other in so many ways just can't make a relationship work. It's funny as hell at times, but it's predominant tone is one of nostalgic melancholy.Grade: A",9,2,4,18 September 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," The Best Movie I Never Want to See Again
","I used to think '2001: A Space Odyssey' was a Great Movie, but now I'm not so sure. Now that I've seen it a few times, I feel like I've gotten all there is to be gotten from it, and the thought of sitting down to watch it again triggers my brain to begin thinking of all the other things I could be doing with my time. Is that the sign of a great movie? Shouldn't we be able to revisit great movies again and again and find something fresh about them years after they initially hit the screens? I don't know.Anyway, '2001' is at least a terrific movie and an important one. No science fiction film made since can deny the influence of this movie's vision of space. Many of the special effects look more realistic than the computer generated effects of today. And while I defy anyone to truly explain the meaning of this film with confidence (I wonder if even Kubrick could have), it certainly makes you feel *something,* even if you're not sure what that something is.On the first viewing, the pacing of the film seemed stately and fitting for a film about drifting through the cold depths of space; now it just seems ponderous. It's even more pronounced now how little the human actors register in this film, and how HAL (which is just a voice, really) steals the show. And when I was younger and more eager to accept the opinions of film scholars and other purported know-it-alls, I thought the ending was profound and full of meaning; now it seems pretty obtuse and vague.But when it comes right down to it, Kubrick's worst movie is anyone else's masterpiece. His movies never feel comfortable with human emotions, so the fact that this movie could almost exist without humans at all comes as little surprise. His style has always been slow, but it comes as a welcome change from all the frenetic, hyper crap being produced now. And at least this movie makes you think, even if it doesn't provide any answers, which again is more than I can say for most of the movies playing in theatres this weekend.So I may not rate '2001' as highly as I once would have, but I fully support its place as one of the most audacious and significant films of all time.Grade: A",8,5,13,30 September 2005
Toy Story," The One That Started It All
","The first computer animated film from Pixar that dazzled audiences and critics and signaled the eventual death of hand-drawn animation.But let's not hold that against this film, because this is one of the best animated films ever made. Pixar has had an outstanding run; they've knocked one out of the park every time they've been up to bat, and 'Toy Story' set the standard. It contains that brand of cheeky humor Pixar has mastered, that makes its films both enjoyable at a basic level for kids and at a more sophisticated level for adults. Its films have gotten progressively more sophisticated, and I like movies like 'The Incredibles' and 'Wall-E' more, but this one is an awful lot of fun.Grade: A",9,1,2,12 May 2009
Blood Diamond," Ridiculous in More Ways Than I Can Count
","Just in time for the holiday season, director Edward Zwick offers the latest in his long line of bloated, liberal do-gooder movies, this one designed to make a bunch of privileged Americans feel ever-so-slightly-guilty about all of their Christmas consumerism. Of course, he (and Hollywood) doesn't want you to feel TOO bad about it (they want to make money off of us after all), so he gussies up his movie with a bunch of traditional action-movie histrionics that maybe wouldn't seem ridiculous if this was a jungle flick from the 1940s, but that in the here and now of 2006 feels like a hopeless attempt to give us our medicine with one hand while spoon feeding us ice cream with the other.This is sanctimonious, hypocritical film-making as only Hollywood can deliver, folks. Let's show people what it's like in Africa, but let's not make it too realistic for them or they might not enjoy that popcorn they're scarfing down. We could tell the real story the way it really is, though no one would come to see it, or we can show Djimon Hounsou and Leonardo DiCaprio flexing their pecs and capitalize on people's love of a good ol' blockbuster.DiCaprio plays a jaded diamond smuggler with a heart of gold. Jennifer Connelley plays a fiery reporter with whom he falls in love (yeah, right). Djimon Hounsou plays the noble savage (big surprise), who once again proves that he is cast in films primarily for his ability to scream at the top of his voice while delivering his lines. If you can muster up one ounce of concern about what happens to any of these people, good for you. I certainly couldn't, and while the lady next to me in the theater was sniffling and dabbing her eyes at any one of the film's shameless bits of sentimental nonsense, I was checking my watch and stifling a yawn.I have no doubt that Edward Zwick has the best of intentions when making his movies, but I should have listened to my gut and stayed away from this film. He treats his audience as if they're stupid and can't understand a point unless it's underlined three times and has 20 exclamation points tacked on to the end. Yes, I'm glad that there are filmmakers who want to tell important stories to mass audiences and try to find methods of storytelling to which those audiences will respond. But if you're the kind of moviegoer who would rather engage in an intelligent discussion than listen to a bully -- no matter how well intentioned he may be -- pound away from his pulpit, Zwick's films are nearly intolerable, as this one is.Grade: C-",4,6,19,27 December 2006
Men in Black," They Live Among Us
","Pretty funny and original sci-fi/comedy about a team of FBI agents whose task it is to keep track of the aliens living among us and eradicate those who wish to do us harm.The odd couple pairing of Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith as the salty veteran agent and the hotshot young recruit, respectively, works pretty well. I'm not a big fan of Smith's antic schtick, but it's humorous to watch Jones's deadpan reactions to it.The makeup and visual effects team are responsible for numerous witty sight gags, and Danny Elfman provides a playful fun house score.Grade: B+",7,1,1,17 July 2009
Midsommar," Relationship Horror
","Writer/director Ari Aster really has a thing for dysfunctional family dynamics. 'Hereditary' basically gave us the family from hell, and 'Midsommar' gives us more of the same. At the center of this horror movie is a couple whose relationship is limping along -- he pretty much won't break up with her because of some recent traumatic events involving a murder/suicide in her family and the guilt he would feel at leaving her. Not the makings of a great romance. It's no wonder then that both find themselves allured, though in different ways, to a psycho hippy community while traveling in Sweden. He's wanted sexually for some mumbo jumbo rituals while she enjoys being embraced by one big damn family, no matter how bonkers they may be.Aster is an effective filmmaker and knows how to put together images that will unsettle and linger in the viewer's mind for a while. But this movie is too long and too lugubriously paced to be as effective as it might otherwise be. Florence Pugh is really good in the film's first half, but by the end she's so zonked out and hysterical that her performance grows tiresome. It's not really her fault -- it's just that there's far too much movie for her to have to fill.People who like a hard 'R' rating will get their money's worth, but much of what gives the film its 'R' rating comes off as silly.Grade: B",6,0,1,8 November 2019
The Graduate," Thank You Mr. Nichols
","Thank you, Mike Nichols, for giving us 'The Graduate,' because it, along with the superb 'Bonnie and Clyde,' finally blew the cobwebs off of the Hollywood film and gave movie audiences something immediate and relevant. Because of the audacity of directors like Nichols and Penn (and Peckinpah and Hopper and Schlesinger and Kubrick) the 1960s are now known as the decade that ushered in a movie renaissance when they could have been known instead as the decade that gave us 'My Fair Lady' and 'Cleopatra.' 'The Graduate' just has a different feel to it as compared to many of its contemporaries that's hard to explain if you can't see it. Like 'Bonnie and Clyde,' it's about restless characters, and the movie feels restless too. It's quick, jittery, fast paced. The camera moves and does original things. Actors seem to be occupying real three-dimensional space rather than manufactured studio sets. And then there's that fantastic Simon and Garfunkel score, the first time a pop soundtrack was so integral a part of a film narrative (and its marketing). While studios were still trying to churn out big-budget, ponderous Biblical and historical epics, or antiquated musicals that felt like products made especially for grandma and grandpa, 'The Graduate' feels like a product aimed squarely at the youth market, and reassures young people that film has something to say to them. And let's not forget that the movie also introduced audiences to Dustin Hoffman, who would be such a major player in said film renaissance in the upcoming decade.Grade: A+",10,2,3,11 January 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Leave Your Expectations at the Door and Just Have Fun
","Let's get this out of the way: this is not the A&E 5-hour version of Jane Austen's novel. This movie does not star Colin Firth. This version takes greater liberty with the Austen book than does the A&E version.Good, I'm glad that's behind us. Now just sit back and enjoy what happens to be a stellar film. Of course this version is a less literal adaptation, but it doesn't have the luxury of being 5 hours long. And there is much about this version that I thought was actually better than the A&E version. For example, this version is much more cinematic and never more so than at the astoundingly filmed ball scenes, when the camera takes off swooping and swirling around the actors in some of the most complexly choreographed shots I've ever seen. Keira Knightly and Matthew Mcfadyen seem more right for the roles than did Jennifer Ehle and Firth; they're at least closer to the age of the characters as depicted in Austen's book. Brenda Blethyn improves on the character of Mrs. Bennett, turning her into a real human character rather than a broad caricature. And Judi Dench has a ball storming on to the screen in a couple of scenes and decimating everyone in her path.This film is for people who already know the book and Austen's characters. It's a very fresh and exciting telling of a very familiar story---who really needs yet one more ploddingly faithful movie that dares not deviate at all from the novel? We already have a faithful adaptation that's not going away just because this movie came out, and the book is always there to reread if you need your fix of unadulterated Austen. All I can say is, I was in an audience full of obvious 'Pride & Prejudice' junkies, and they were on the edges of their seats through the entire length of this film. Highly recommended.Grade: A",9,3,5,14 November 2005
Singin' in the Rain," MGM Near the Top of Its Musical Game
","The heaps of scholarly criticism heaped on 'Singing' in the Rain' have done it a disservice by giving it the ball and chain reputation of an IMPORTANT picture in cinema history. Let's not forget why 'Singin' in the Rain' was made, which was to provide a form of escapist entertainment, nor why it's still so loved now, which is because it's great fun and everything clicks. It's not homework, and it's not medicine.I don't even think it's the best movie musical ever made (I liked MGM's 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers' more), and it's not one I feel compelled to go back to again and again. I'm not a huge fan of Gene Kelly, and think he's squirrelly when he's trying to be dashing, and Donald O'Connor's manic energy is just as likely to be exhausting as it is funny. But there's no improving on Jean Hagen's pitch-perfect performance as the ditzy villainess, and Debbie Reynolds shows how sweet and charming she was early in her career, before she became a broad.The songs and dances aren't especially well integrated into the film --you can practically hear the gears grinding whenever the film transitions from its book to its musical portions. But the numbers are so wildly entertaining in and of themselves that you don't much care. The 'Singin' in the Rain' sequence does what far too few films do -- it transports you to a place where what's happening on the screen in front of you is the only thing that matters.Grade: A-",8,4,5,28 June 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Memories, Like the Corners of My Mind
","Michel Gondry's fabulous head trip stars Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet (superb) as members of an on-again off-again relationship who take part in an experiment that allows people to delete memories from their heads.The question the film obviously asks is: would you get rid of painful memories if you could, or are those memories as much a part of you and your growth as the pleasant ones? Gondry finds a dazzling visual way to represent the deterioration of his protagonists' memories, and for all its cerebral sleights of hand, the film carries a big emotional wallop.Winslet is dynamite and should have won the Oscar for which she was nominated.Grade: A",9,0,2,3 September 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Nothing Wonderful About This Wonderland
","Pretty terrible sequel of sorts to the famous Lewis Carroll story that finds Alice returning to Wonderland years after her first adventure to do battle with the Jabberwocky and end the reign of the tyrannical Red Queen.A lot of money and some pretty decent actors are thrown up on the screen in a frenzy of special effects, production design and action sequences that are meant to distract us from how badly written and unengaging the whole thing is. Johnny Depp is given a large role as the Mad Hatter and does his standard weirdo routine for the umpteenth time. Alice is a black hole at the film's center, mostly because the actress who plays her is uber-bland. The only thing that occasionally roused me from my drowsy stupor was Helena Bonham Carter, who gives the film its only laughs as the Red Queen.At one time I thought Tim Burton had the makings of a great filmmaker. I'm not so sure anymore.....Grade: D",3,13,18,2 March 2011
Avatar," A Work of Astounding Beauty
","It's been a long time since I've found myself so utterly immersed in the fictional world created by a film as I was in the one brought to life in James Cameron's astounding 'Avatar.' His new film does what 'Star Wars' did way back in 1977: it translates in visual terms the detailed imaginings existing solely in the head of a geek filmmaker. While watching 'Avatar,' I forgot that any other world, including the one I live in, existed.And the 3D gimmick is only partially responsible for that. I'd like to see the film again without the distraction of 3D, because I think it would hold up just as well. James Cameron is unpardonably clunky when it comes to narrative storytelling, but as a director of action and movement, practically no one can touch him when he's at the top of his game, and you don't need 3D to appreciate that.'Avatar' has the less welcome Cameron trademarks, the ones that ran amuk in 'Titanic' and killed the non-action portion of that film. He yields his writer's pen like a sledgehammer, and you'd have to be a moron to miss the points he makes in this film about environmentalism, cultural understanding and the global community. And don't even get me started on his villains, in this film portrayed as corporate and military goons in the kinds of gross caricatures Stanley Kubrick lampooned back in his 'Dr. Stragelove' days. But the vast majority of the film is told in the language of images rather than words, and it's easy to overlook the film's flaws and be instead transported by its beauty.Sam Worthington, Zoe Caldana and Sigourney Weaver ground the film with terrific performances, and I've never seen motion capture effects work better than they do here. It was frequently hard to remember that we were looking at partially computer generated images and not actors in body makeup.This is one movie that for once is deserving of its hype.Grade: A",9,6,17,30 December 2009
Chariots of Fire," Stiff Upper Lip, Old Man -- It's Only the Olympics
","Very British, very proper and very dull movie about two English athletes competing in the 1924 Olympics. It's one of those inspirational stories that undoubtedly had audiences on their feet cheering at its end, but now the only thing memorable about it is its theme song.'Chariots of Fire' came out at a time when Hollywood was beginning to fall in love with British films, and for a while there in the 1980s and early 1990s, everyone equated tasteful film-making with good film-making. If movies perfectly recreated an historical period and did it with reserve, they won awards, no matter how embalmed the final product might have been.I'll be generous because it does have good music.Grade: B-",6,5,12,28 December 2007
Drag Me to Hell," Drag Me to Some Other Better (and Scarier) Movie
","Those hoping that 'Drag Me to Hell' represents a return to Sam Raimi's horror roots will be sorely disappointed. This is more 'Spiderman' than 'Evil Dead.' The likable young actress Alison Lohman plays a woman cursed by an old crone who must figure out how to break the spell if she doesn't want to be dragged you know where. Her efforts involve some time spent at a seance, the sacrificing of a pussy cat, and lots and lots of scenes of the creepy old lady jumping out at our heroine and uttering over-amplified sound effects. Indeed, the only nominal scares to be had in the film come from this over-used effect, and it's not scary so much as merely startling, and stops being even that after Raimi uses it for the umpteenth time.I'm not criticizing Raimi for making a scary movie that's not scary. It's clear his tongue was planted firmly in cheek when making this film, and that he was more interested in kitsch than he was chills. But that doesn't mean I wasn't disappointed in the final product. It's hard not to be disappointed in teeny-bopper fare like this when you know what Raimi is capable of. It's like expecting 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and instead getting an episode of 'Charmed.'Justin Long plays Lohman's boyfriend, and though the character he plays is a supportive good guy, there's something so smarmy and cocky about Long that I couldn't help but dislike him.Grade: B-",6,1,3,1 November 2009
Grindhouse," Tarantino Has Done It Again; Rodriguez, Not So Much
","What 'Grindhouse' proves more than anything is how much better a director Quentin Tarantino is than Robert Rodriguez. It's unfortunate for Rodriguez that his film and Tarantino's are being presented in a format that allows the audience to compare them side by side; the comparison only highlights Rodriguez's flaws and Tarantino's talent.'Planet Terror,' Rodriguez's segment, is a tribute to the trashy zombie flicks of yesteryear, but it's a completely disposable movie. I know Rodriguez would probably take that as a compliment, since the grindhouse films to which he and Tarantino are paying homage are remembered for being the movie equivalent of junk food. But Tarantino creates a film that could easily stand alone outside of the double feature gimmick concept, while Rodriguez uses his opportunity at genre parody to make nothing but a frenetic gross-out film. I had fun with a lot of 'Planet Terror.' I especially liked Rose McGowan, as go-go girl (don't call her a stripper) Cherry Darling, who gets her leg gnawed off by crazed zombies and has it replaced with a machine gun that she uses to mow down her enemies while performing gymnastics. It's hooks like these that keep 'Planet Terror' afloat. Rodriguez uses today's advanced technologies to include all of the outrageous images and stunts that makers of trash cinema would maybe have included themselves if they could have. But much of 'Planet Terror' just made me feel sort of bad and depressed. The sight of mass human carnage in these post-9/11 days, when footage of suicide bombings assaults us on a daily basis, carries unpleasant connotations, and it's awfully difficult to lose yourself in the 'fun' of seeing bodies ripped and blown apart with all of the indifference of a director who gets off on the site of human bloodshed. Therefore, I felt a slight sense of relief when 'Planet Terror' ended.But then Tarantino's 'Death Proof' came roaring on to the screen, and memories of Rodriguez's segment were immediately wiped away. In 'Death Proof,' Kurt Russell plays stuntman Mike, who uses his grizzled charm to lure girls (like Rose McGowan, who pops up again in this segment, albeit in a very different role) into his bitchin' retro car and then kills them. Or he follows groups of girls riding in their own cars and plows into them at 200 miles per hour, as he does in the film's most disturbing and graphic scene. But after doing away with one such group, he sets his sights on another (the immensely charismatic trio of Rosario Dawson, Tracie Thoms and real-life stuntwoman Zoe Bell, who plays herself) -- and instantly recognizes his mistake. Half way through 'Death Proof,' Tarantino switches gears, and instead of following a 'girls in danger' template, he makes the girls the dangerous ones. It's as if every female ever victimized in a grade-Z horror flick is resurrected in this group of fierce females, and work through them to get their revenge. The film is unpredictable, fresh, rousing and immensely exciting. It sent me out on a high. Tarantino is incapable of making a thoughtless movie, and I'm beginning to think he's incapable of making a bad movie. Where Rodriguez is content to appeal to the most basic urgings of the adolescent males he clearly assumed would be his audience for this, Tarantino is interested in doing something more. 'Death Proof' is not simply imitative of grindhouse cinema. Tarantino has always excelled at mimicking the genres he loves while making something completely unique out of them, and he does the same here. 'Death Proof' isn't only an homage to the loved films of Tarantino's past; it's also an elegy. Stuntman Mike is a relic of an age when filmmakers created special effects in real time and space, without the help of CGI, and indeed no CGI was used in the astonishing extended action sequence that comprises the last third of Tarantino's film. He recognizes grindhouse films as the trash that they were, but it's clear that they also represent to him a certain kind of freedom that doesn't exist for filmmakers anymore. Makers of grindhouse movies knew that their films were going to be discounted by the mainstream movie establishment anyway, so they could revel in a kind of artistic freedom and make the movies they wanted to make without thought as to box office or awards potential. It's no wonder that this particular genre appeals to an auteur like Tarantino.And of course, linking these two films are the batch of fake trailers for other sleazy cinematic offerings. 'Thanksgiving' seems to be the one that audiences remember the most, but I actually thought 'Don't' was the wittiest, and the one that felt most authentic.'Planet Terror': B- 'Death Proof': A",8,3,7,16 April 2007
The Artist," The Sounds of Silents
","This light-footed and -hearted soufflé of a movie is a reminder of just how much fun it can be to go to the movies.A film about a silent film star struggling with the transition to talkies that is itself a silent film is the kind of cutesy high concept premise that could go down in flames in the hands of the wrong team. But writer/director Michel Hazanivicius and his stars, Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, know exactly how to sell the material so that it all works beautifully. What I liked most about the movie is that it doesn't spend all of its time winking to itself for its own cleverness, as you might expect it would. It doesn't use its silent film conventions to make any kind of commentary on silent films. Hazanivicius and company wanted to make a silent film because they thought it was the best way to tell this particular story, and that's just what they've done, without apologies.Dujardin and Bejo are being lauded for their performances, and rightly so. It would be easy to dismiss their work as being unchallenging, but I have a feeling both had more difficult roles than one might first assume, and that the fact that they both make it look so easy is part of why they're so good. And the movie looks stunning -- one of the benefits of it being silent is that with words removed from the equation, the images take on extra responsibility to communicate the movie's ideas to us, and what cinephile could resist anything that makes a film more cinematic? This film and 'The Tree of Life' both for the moment stand at the top of my list of favorite films of 2011, and it's interesting to me that both are examples of films that let pictures rather than words tell their stories.Grade: A",9,1,3,20 January 2012
Invictus," Dripping in Good Intentions; Lacking Anything That Would Actually Make It Entertaining
","An example of what happens when good intentions kill a movie dead.Clint Eastwood's 'Invictus' is tasteful, reverent and serious, all qualities that would make for a great funeral eulogy but which do not necessarily make for riveting filmmaking. Morgan Freeman plays South African president Nelson Mandela capably and actually manages to avoid turning him into a wax-work version of the real-life figure, a trap another actor might have fallen into. But Eastwood's film is thuddingly boring, not translating one ounce of the inspirational vigor this story should.The final half hour or so of the film depicts a famous rugby match that saw the South African team win the world cup, a victory in which Mandela had the foresight to see an opportunity to unite South Africans in a moment of national pride. But the game itself is edited poorly, simply showing random bouts of action interspersed with reaction shots from spectators, so that we never know where we are in the game, what any one play means, or even that the game is close to being over until it actually is. And Eastwood should have his rights to use slow motion revoked forever -- the device is used so relentlessly during the film's climax that it almost becomes a parody.Matt Damon tackles a South African accent as captain of the rugby team. Damon is a fine actor, but how he managed to get nominated for an Academy Award for this performance is beyond me.'Invictus' has all the excitement of a high school civics textbook.Grade: D",3,3,5,4 August 2010
La La Land," A Love Song About Bittersweet Happy Endings
","After the ebullient opening scene of 'La La Land,' a musical number staged in an L.A. traffic jam and featuring a cast that celebrates the diversity of that city, I thought I was going to adore 'La La Land.' But nothing else in the movie quite measures up to that opening scene.I liked the film, some of it quite a lot, but it did not affect me the way it has so clearly affected others. I'm a bit surprised that people are talking about leaving the movie on a high, or referring to its ending as happy. 'La La Land' doesn't exactly end unhappily, but the happiness it does deliver to our principal characters is qualified. The film, both an homage to and a contemporary re-calibration of the MGM musicals of Hollywood's golden age, suggests that human lives have more than one possible happy ending, and that by choosing one you necessarily have to pass over another. Better be sure, then, that the one you choose is the one that will leave you with the fewest regrets about the ones you let pass by.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have enough chemistry to light a fire. Indeed, they have so much that one is almost disappointed that they aren't a real-life couple. I don't know that the characters they play in this film take either actor that far out of his/her comfort zone, but both give terrifically charismatic performances. Stone especially steals the film right out from under the feet of everyone else, Gosling and kinetic director Damien Chazelle (of 'Whiplash' fame) included.I've seen others refer to 'La La Land' as a love letter to Los Angeles. I don't know L.A. that well, and what I've seen of it I didn't care for, so I might be biased. But this film struck me as less a valentine to the City of Angels and more of an examination of the allure the world of fame exercises over dreamers, and the determination that world demands of those who are going to make it there.Grade: A-",8,1,5,3 January 2017
The Last Samurai," A Good Movie Turned Bad
","How disappointing that 'The Last Samurai' becomes dreadful in its last half, because the first half is quite engaging. This movie is what results when a director with left-leaning sensibilities tries to make a liberal-minded 'message' movie without the courage of his own convictions. So the movie is not content to merely show us the crisis facing the Samurai in the face of westernization and letting our sympathies lie with them....Oh no, fearful that an American audience would not take to a film centered around Japanese characters, we have to have a white, hot-shot Hollywood actor to root for, who sweeps in to be our hero. We get a token Japanese hero to root for as well, but guess who remains living at the end of the film? Didn't Kevin Costner already make this movie? Tom Cruise's heart is obviously in the right place. He gives an incredibly earnest performance...and that's part of the problem. He's SO earnest that I never forgot for a second that I was watching Tom Cruise, Mr. Hollywood A-List, feeling self-important for attaching himself to such an important film. Ken Watanabe received heaps of praise for his performance, but I fail to see what the hype is about. And the obligatory love story is just silly---obviously, the movie makers thought so too, because they make only a half-hearted attempt to develop it in the first place.I loved the message in 'The Last Samurai,' but I hated the approach taken to the material. It's yet one more movie in which the creators give the audience not one single amount of credit for having a brain; emotions are force-fed to us through superficial means like slow-motion and thundering music. Not comfortable with any amount of ambiguity, all of the Americans except for Tom Cruise have to be evil, and all of the Samurai have to be entirely noble. The film inadvertently makes the point that killing someone with a sword or a bow and arrow makes you a better person than killing someone with a gun, conveniently sidestepping the fact that killing is killing, regardless of how it's done.My summary: a pretty film with not a brain in its head.Grade: C-",4,4,9,29 April 2005
Life Is Beautiful," Paging Mel Brooks....
","Ugh! Roberto Benigni's attempts to use Chaplin-style humor as a balm to soothe nightmares about the Holocaust make a mockery of both him and the historical events his film depicts.I'm not offended by the humor itself -- Mel Brooks proved that you can make Nazis funny. My problem with this movie is that the humor is done badly; Benigni is irritating and painfully unfunny. And when the film isn't trying to be a comedy, it's unbearably maudlin and sentimental.'Life Is Beautiful,' like 'Cinema Paradiso,' is a foreign film for people who otherwise never watch foreign films.It's got a nice score, I'll give it that.Grade: D",2,5,12,21 June 2010
Up," Up, Up in the Air with My Beautiful Balloon
","As they did in 'Wall-E,' the Pixar team creates an opening twenty minutes or so of movie in 'Up' that in itself is a small masterpiece of streamlined narrative film-making, and if it doesn't leave you reduced to a puddle of dribbly tears by the time it's over, you have a heart of stone. However, also as in 'Wall-E' but even more so here, the first part of the movie is so skillfully crafted that it leaves the rest of it somewhat lacking.I feel like the Pixar filmmakers are trying too hard to satisfy two different audiences with the same movie. 'Up' is about very adult issues -- dealing with the loss of a life partner, the obsolescence of old age -- crammed around a not-all-that-interesting adventure comedy story designed to delight the kiddies. 'Wall-E' suffered from the same syndrome slightly; but the theme of environmental awareness in that film was universal enough, and integrated wholly enough into the action sequences, that the schizophrenia of it all was easy to overlook. In 'Up,' I would have preferred to just continue the story that's set up in the opening moments without the kid movie tangent, and that's what ultimately made 'Up' a much less memorable viewing experience for me than other recent Pixar films.I wonder how long it will be before Pixar forms a unit that makes animated films strictly for adults, as they seem to want to.Grade: A-",8,0,0,10 December 2009
The Hurricane," Ponderous and Self-Congratulatory
","Denzel Washington plays boxer 'Hurricane' Carter in this biopic about Carter's struggles with racist America even as he was ascending boxing's pedestal.Veteran Norman Jewison, no stranger to films about social outrage, and particularly to films about racism ('In the Heat of the Night'), perhaps is a little too close to his subject matter, as the whole film is too preachy, earnest and self-congratulatory.

A Clockwork Orange," 34 Years Old and Still Going Strong
","'A Clockwork Orange' never fails to polarize its audience. It seems that the viewer ship of this film either loves it or loathes it. Some (I among them) salivate over Kubrick's complete mastery of the film medium while others want to burn the film as morally dubious at best and repugnant at worst. The criticisms I hear most often leveled at the film concern the fact that Kubrick has us sympathizing with a young punk whose favorite pastime is violence (any kind, including beatings, rapes, bludgeonings and stabbings). I do agree that we sympathize with Alex, the film's main character, but I disagree that this is to the film's detriment. The movie, like the book on which it is based, is told essentially in first person. Alex narrates the film, and we never see an event occur that Alex himself is not present to witness. Even the mise-en-scene of the film (the distorted angles, stylized sets, use of slow and fast motion, etc.) lend the film a subjectivity and reminds the audience that it is seeing events unfold through a perspective other than its own.I think anyone with a shred of humanity will sympathize with Alex; I think that's the movie's point. Alex treats others as if they are animals, and we are repelled by it. Then, when the state treats him as if he is just another animal, why should we not be just as repelled? In some ways, the questions this film poses can have practical applications to the ongoing debate over the death penalty. Does recoiling at the idea of putting someone to death mean that we condone the crimes he or she committed to have that sentence brought against them in the first place?I want to save my last comment for Malcolm McDowell's unimprovable performance. I can't imagine anyone playing Alex better than he does. He's got the perfect blend of charm, charisma and menace that this character needs. His performance is comedic and scary at the same time. It's a shame that he didn't receive more recognition for this film when it was released.Grade: A",9,1,3,29 April 2005
The King," It's Hard Out Here for a King
","'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' was on TCM the other night. I re-watched a little bit of it, and then I had this brilliant idea that I wanted to make a new adaptation of it, but I don't like any of Edward Albee's dialogue, so I'm going to dump it all and write my own. It's going to ROCK, and I don't see how I could possibly fail. It's not like Albee's dialogue had anything to do with the success of his play.If you're going to give us yet another screen adaptation of 'Henry V' (because apparently neither the Laurence Olivier or Kenneth Branagh versions exist) but you're not going to use Shakespeare's actual text, then the least I feel I deserve is a 'Henry V' that feels like it has some reason for existence -- i.e. relevance to our current times. But this film doesn't have that. It's just full of a lot of cliche 'it's hard out here for a king' ideas about leadership, politics, and war that we've heard a million times in a million better movies. 'The King' looks handsome, but its own sense of self-importance is so cumbersome that watching it is like slogging through the mud that mires the English and French warriors fighting it out in the film's climactic battle.The film is slow and ponderous and its solemn tone never varies. Timothee Chalamet (as Hal) seems bored to be in this film, and his performance has a curious lack of energy. The first time we see him in the movie he's sleeping, and it's like he never fully wakes up. I'm sure his bedroom eyes could make a tweener swoon, but my goodness someone give the boy a sandwich and a jolt of caffeine. My wife could body slam this dude, and she's about 5'4' and 120#.Joel Edgerton, who wrote the screenplay, plays Falstaff, but his primary purpose for being in the movie is to look gross. The film wants us to think the relationship of Falstaff and Hal is critical to the plot's outcome, but it doesn't ever feel like more than a sketch. In fact, that applies to the whole movie. I saw one review that described this movie as being a bunch of plot developments on an outline that no one ever bothered to connect to one another with substance, and that's a pretty apt description of my own experience watching it.With about five minutes of screen time, Robert Pattinson shows up late in the film (because he's obligated to appear in literally every movie released in 2019) and tries his hardest to inject some life into it by way of a Monty Python French accent. It's like he listened to all of director David Michod's notes on how to play the character and then was like 'nah.' He makes fun of Hal's penis size before beheading a child and then slipping around in some mud, and appears to be having a blast doing it. I'm glad he had fun, because someone connected to this film deserved to.Grade: C+",5,8,12,20 November 2019
The Fly," Spooky and Intense -- One of Cronenberg's Best
","Deeply unsettling David Cronenberg remake of the sci-fi chiller about a scientist playing around with genetic experimentation who accidentally mixes his DNA in with that of a house fly. The slow deterioration of his body as he turns into a mutated monster gives the makeup and special effects artists for this film free reign to create all manner of gruesome and frightening images. Jeff Goldblum, as the scientist, gives perhaps the best performance of his career. As an actor, he's always a bit off-kilter, so he's a natural fit as a mad genius. Geena Davis, as his love interest, does terrific work too, and delivers a performance that's something more than the standard issue work you might expect in a movie like this.Though the film is full of scary moments, perhaps the scariest is when Golblum's scientist character calmly asks Davis's character to leave his apartment because he's afraid he will hurt her if she stays.Grade: A",8,0,1,7 May 2008
Groundhog Day," Cult Classic That Lives Up to Its Hype
","Finally got around to seeing 'Groundhog Day,' the cult classic about a jerk of a T.V. weather man (Bill Murray) who finds himself stuck reliving the same day over and over.I was afraid that the very premise of the film would force some predictability on the screenplay: he has to first figure out he's reliving the same day, then finds it cool that he's reliving the same day, then gets sick of reliving the same day, etc. And it does tick off these boxes, but in a way that's much more creative and less formulaic than it might otherwise have been. Murray is perfectly cast as a misanthrope who gradually learns how to become a better man when he's forced to practice, and Andie MacDowell, who I don't particularly like (and of whom this film didn't make me a convert) is fine if bland as Murray's love interest.The film does actually make you think about what you would do with yourself if you had to repeatedly live the same day. Would you be maddened by the sameness, or would you embrace the possibilities? Kind of like life itself, no?Grade: A-",8,0,3,5 March 2015
Love & Mercy," Not a Traditional Biopic (Which Is Good) But Not Completely Successful Either
","'Love & Mercy' thankfully avoids the pitfalls that plague most other blah biopics, eschewing the device of taking us through the troubled childhood up through the inspirational finale of whatever famous person's life happens to be the film's subject. While Brian Wilson is the main subject of the film, the movie isn't so much about him as it about his contributions to the Beach Boys' phenomenal success as a band. We don't learn his life story; we witness instead how one of the most troubled passages of his personal life coincided with one of the most fertile period for the group. However, while I was relieved that this didn't end up being a paint by numbers biopic like every other biopic put to screen, I did feel like the filmmakers didn't quite know how to fill the gap where a different movie would have inserted all of the traditional biopic material. Paul Dano and John Cusack give fine performances as the young and older, respectively, Brian Wilson, but there isn't a lot of story to tell here, certainly not enough to warrant the film's 2+ hour running time. The film is at its best when it's depicting the jam sessions during which Wilson came up with some of the Beach Boys' most iconic tunes, but the parts of the film that chronicle the tug-of-war between Wilson's girlfriend (played likeably by Elizabeth Banks) and his doctor (played loathsomely by Paul Giammati) turn into a slog, and unfortunately these make up the bulk of the movie.And it's odd that a movie about the Beach Boys would feature so little of their music.Grade: B+",6,0,0,22 August 2016
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A Naturalistic Account of the IRA
","This fascinating film about the Irish Republican Army in 1920s Ireland has an improvisatory feel about it. Not many scenes in the movie feel scripted. There are many scenes showing groups of men and women arguing, debating and fighting, but it all feels natural, and like the way these kinds of moments would play out in real life. Indeed, thinking back on the movie, it seems like much of it took place without dialogue, or at least without significant dialogue. This may be an odd comparison, but it reminded me of Michael Cimino's style of film-making in 'The Deer Hunter' and 'Heaven's Gate': the emphasis on male solidarity up against forces too strong to oppose, the environment almost becoming a character in the film, the loosely choreographed scenes and the fact that much information is conveyed through imagery rather than words.The nominal focus of the film is on two brothers who start out on the same side of the Irish/British conflict, but who become opposed to one another as the IRA fragments into conflicting factions. The brother against brother plot line is of course meant to symbolize a larger and more universal struggle, but it's not dealt with in a heavy-handed manner.A very good and overlooked film.Grade: A-",8,1,6,3 January 2008
How to Train Your Dragon," Why Kill Dragons When You Can Ride Them?
","A fun, snappy animated film about a young Viking who would rather make friends with the dragons preying on his village than hunt them.The universal message at the heart of 'How to Train Your Dragon' is one of understanding, and how the more you fully understand the world around you, the less you will have to be afraid of. The story is told with a lot of spirit and the animation is sensational, but it never manages to achieve that level of magic, the one that makes you want to laugh and bawl at the same time, that has become the hallmark of Pixar's animated films.Grade: A-",8,1,1,17 February 2011
Rocky," The Ultimate American Success Story....Just in Time for America's 100th Birthday
","'Rocky' is one of those quintessential 'right place/right time' movies. Movie-going America, beleaguered by bleak and cynical tales of everything their country was doing wrong, were ready for this underdog success story, which illustrates that living in America ain't so bad after all.But come on. If people were being honest, they would admit that 'Rocky' just doesn't hold up very well now. Director John G. Avildsen's only notable film since this one was 'The Karate Kid' in 1984, so that tells you something right there. There's nothing wrong with loving 'Rocky' for the inspirational fairy tale that it is, but the fact that it looks gritty and real like all of the other serious socially-themed films from the same time period has allowed it to join them on the list of important cinematic achievements so abundant in the 1970s, and it's just not an important film.With, of course, Sylvester Stallone in a star-making performance, one that he's been trying to recapture ever since, and Talia Shire, fresh off the 'Godfather' movies and ready to have a leading part of her own. But the scene stealer in this film is Burgess Meredith, who plays Rocky's coach and agent like a cranky pirate.Grade: B",7,0,3,28 August 2007
The Red Violin," Compilation Film Suffers from Same Problems That Plague All Compilation Films
","One of those compilation films, essentially a series of short films linked by a common theme, character or plot hook. In this one, a violin makes its way from owner to owner across centuries, and we follow its path and get a feel for the history it acquires along the way.Like any compilation film, some parts are better than others and none of it is especially engaging because you know the film is going to move on to new characters and places before long. I never really understand what motivates filmmakers to make movies like this.On the plus side, there are nice visuals and a lush, Oscar-winning score.Grade: B-",6,1,1,30 June 2010
Shine," Shine On, Mr. Rush
","Geoffrey Rush amazes in this true-life story about the rise and fall and rise of a concert pianist with acute emotional and psychological problems.The film itself is pretty standard biopic fair, its pedigree elevated somewhat by its independent, art-house vibe. But Rush is a revelation, and this is the movie that brought him to mainstream attention, particularly after winning the 1996 Best Actor Oscar.Armin Mueller-Stahl gives a frightening performance as Rush's stern and domineering father, and Noah Taylor does nice work, seamlessly portraying Rush as an adolescent.Grade: A-",7,2,4,16 June 2009
Sicario," 'Male' Film from a Female Point of View.....Sort Of
","In a year in which the movie industry is being raked over the coals for not being diverse enough, 'Sicario' had the opportunity to give us a woman's perspective on a genre generally reserved for macho men. And it makes good on that opportunity for a while, but in the end, the film's decision to drop its female protagonist and let events play out in a very traditional and male way makes it one of the bigger disappointments of my movie year.Emily Blunt plays an FBI agent who's recruited to join an inter-department task force whose objective is to take out a Mexican drug lord. Her role on the team is left intentionally vague, both to her and to us, for most of the movie; not until the film's last third do we learn that she's there so that the CIA can basically dot its 'i's and cross its 't's in establishing clearance for doing whatever it needs to do, much of it illegal, to control the situation.Stories about idealistic folk who wake up to the questionable motives and methods of whatever cause they've aligned themselves with are a dime a dozen -- just earlier this year the movie ''71' covered the same thematic ground but set it against the backdrop of the IRA conflict in Ireland. But for its first half or so, 'Sicario' feels like a fresh approach to the subject, mostly because it's told from a female point of view. Emily Blunt is a very good actress, and though she's not given perhaps as full a character as she could have been, she's given enough to work with and she does well with it. But toward the end, the film decides it's no longer interested in her, and it instead follows Benicio Del Toro's CIA double agent while he carries out criminal acts in the name of U.S. justice, and that's where the movie lost me a bit. It wouldn't have bothered me so much had not the movie leading up to that been told exclusively from Blunt's point of view. We don't see any events that she herself isn't present to witness. The change in perspective is jarring and disappointing.'Sicario' is far from a total loss. It's quite a well made film and though it didn't live up to the potential it established for itself, I still enjoyed it. But how much more I might have enjoyed it had it lived up to its promise.Grade: A-",7,1,2,29 January 2016

The Descent," Scared the Hell Out of Me
","'The Descent' is like 'Steel Magnolias' crossed with 'Deliverance,' with a healthy dash of 'Alien' and 'The Blair Witch Project' thrown in for good measure. What a truly creepy, scary movie this is, and what a nice surprise to find that good horror movies are still being made.This movie isn't for those with a weak stomach, as it's pretty gory. Yet it doesn't rely on gore for its scares. The director creates a claustrophobic atmosphere that would have been scary enough had the party of female cave explorers had nothing out of the ordinary to contend with. But throw in a batch of icky psycho tunnel dwellers and this movie becomes a nice blend of psychological and visceral horror.It's also a movie that stuck with me for a long time after seeing it. It made me feel really bad, but in kind of a good way if that makes any sense. I felt after seeing it much like I felt after 'The Blair Witch Project.' This is one definitely worth hunting down (pun intended).Grade: B+",7,2,5,2 January 2006
Some Like It Hot," Good, But Not One of the Greatest Comedies of All Time
","My wife loves this movie, mostly on the strength of Jack Lemmon's wild performance, but I have to admit that I've remained resistant to its charms. I don't DISLIKE it, but I always have trouble understanding how it pops up again and again on various lists as one of the funniest comedies ever produced.Of course, much of my lack of appreciation probably has to do with the fact that cross dressing comedies have become a dime a dozen now, but were virtually unheard of at the time this film was released. And even more notable, Jack Lemmon's character actually kind of LIKES pretending to be a woman, so this film manages to work in some fairly ahead of its time gender politics into its mostly escapist comedy trappings. But the film is hampered by too much Marilyn Monroe, who was just a terrible actress, like it or not. The woman could not act, and no amount of sex appeal (though I think she had very little of that as well) could change that fact.Still, my reservations aside, the strengths in this film mostly outweigh the weaknesses. Billy Wilder delivers a sharp script even if his direction seems to be at cross purposes with the movie's comedic elements, and Tony Curtis gives a hilarious and dead-on impersonation of Cary Grant that rivals Lemmon's manic antics in its pricelessness.Grade: B+",7,2,17,20 September 2006
Pulp Fiction," Where to Begin?
","What more is there to say about 'Pulp Fiction.' Released in 1994, the film was an adrenaline shot to the heart of the film industry. Though the movie payed homage to a variety of film genres and styles (film noir, gangster film, French New Wave), it managed to be unlike anything seen before. Whether you love 'Pulp Fiction' or hate it (and I, for one, love it) you can't deny the impact it had on film-making moving forward into the 21st Century. While watching 'Pulp Fiction' for the first time, I knew sitting there in the theatre that I was seeing something that would immediately influence movies forever, and it has. I won't bother to summarize the plot, since plot in this movie is only of incidental importance anyway. I won't bother to single out individual performances, since the performances are uniformly excellent. I will save my praise for Quentin Tarantino's audacious attempts to show us something original, daring and experimental and for giving us a welcome break from the stale products Hollywood studios have been churning out for years. If you're one of the handful of people in the world who haven't yet seen this film, run out and see it now. I can't guarantee you'll like it, but I can guarantee that you'll have a definite opinion about it, and even that is refreshing these days.Grade: A",10,1,2,29 April 2005
Les Misérables," Yes, These French People Sure Are Miserable
","Director Tom Hooper clearly wants us to wallow in the realism of revolution-era France. I can think of no other reason for his making his makeup artists work overtime to make Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway and an assortment of extras look as awful as possible and then stick the camera up their noses so that we can appreciate every open sore and rotten tooth in extreme closeup. There's a scene of Jackman carrying Eddie Redmayne through the Paris sewers, both covered in excrement until all you see of either of them are eyeballs, like something out of 'Predator' or 'Rambo.' The one moment of comic relief in this angst-filled endurance test is a romp with a couple of grimy innkeepers during which the bodily fluids fly copiously. If Hooper's intention was to convince me that I never would have wanted to be alive in early-19th century France, he convinced me.The problem is, 'Les Miserables' the musical isn't remotely realistic. It reduces one of France's many revolutions into a few power ballads and a trite romantic triangle. The characters are paper thin, and are meant to be mere stand-ins for large themes: one character represents 'goodness,' another 'justice,' another 'greed,' etc. On stage, the thinness of the characters and the melodrama of the plot were easy to overlook, because the physical production was so impressive and the music so bombastic. But take the bombast away from 'Les Miserables,' and all you're left with is a plot that seems downright silly on screen, and a bunch of characters who could be played by anyone. Hooper, in his attempt to make this a more realistic film, takes away the one thing that makes 'Les Miz' worth watching -- the music. Oh, the songs are all there, but they're hushed and subdued, as if the orchestra were instructed not to drown out the singers (who, as I'm sure we're all sick to death of hearing by this point, sang their songs live on set). This decision, which has been used as a gimmick in marketing the film, was supposedly landed upon in order to give the actors more freedom to act. Which would be fine if there were any need for them to. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway sure got the memo, as both act the heck out of their roles, but there's only so much you can do with cardboard characters and songs that just outright tell you what the characters are thinking anyway.I don't want realism from 'Les Miserables.' I want to hear 'I Dreamed a Dream' belted out by someone who knows how to belt out a Broadway show tune (sorry Anne). I want 'Master of the House' to be the rousing show-stopper it is on stage rather than the dismissed restroom break it is in the movie. It's not a good sign when, at a movie's climax, when you're supposed to be moved to tears, you're instead wishing that the main character would just shut up and die so that you can get up and relieve your numb butt.Grade: C",5,7,13,11 January 2013
Titanic," Two Movies for the Price of One -- Too Bad Only One of Them Is Decent
","'Titanic' is really two movies: one of them is an exciting, James Cameron-style action film, 'The Poseidon Adventure' with better special effects; the other is a dull as dirt period romance, so simplistic and clichÃ© it seems like something conceived in the mind of a twelve-year-old girl.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet became household names because of their performances in this, and they do invest the film with a great deal of spunk, but they've got absolutely terrible material to work with. Cameron is clearly no writer, but he is a good director of action, so just tune in to this one once the big ship has actually hit the iceberg, and you'll save yourself a lot of time.The supporting cast includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Winslet's uptight and aristocratic mother, Victor Garber as the skipper..er...captain, and Billy Zane, in an embarrassingly awful role as the movie's villain. The character as written is like something out of a silent movie, and Zane plays him as such -- if he had a mustache, he'd be twirling it. Too bad his performance is completely at odds with the totally contemporary performances of just about everyone else.Cameron reveals an almost fetishistic obsession with recreating the glamour of the famed ocean liner, and the glee with which he then goes about demolishing it and the people on it borders on the disturbing. It's like watching a little boy build an elaborate train set just so he can have the pleasure of blowing it up with firecrackers.Grade: B",6,3,6,16 July 2009
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," When Being Too Faithful to Source Material Is a Bad Thing
","I read enough of the first 'Harry Potter' book to know that Chris Columbus virtually recreated it scene by scene. However, I also read enough to know that what he put on screen was a plodding, overly literal adaptation that doesn't have an ounce of magic or creativity in it.To be fair to Columbus, I don't really know what the alternative was. The fan base for 'Harry Potter' wanted the experience of watching it to match exactly the experience of reading it, and would have revolted at any more daring cinematic vision. It always makes me wonder why people want to watch movies based on their favorite books in the first place -- just read the books instead.Grade: B-",5,1,2,27 July 2010
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," So Much Plot, So Little Time
","The sheer size of the Harry Potter books begin to be a problem to the people determined to make them into films in this fourth installment.'Goblet of Fire' moves at breakneck speed, clearly intent on squeezing in all the main plot elements without testing the attention span of its audience. But even to someone who hasn't read the book (I'm one of them), it's clear that much nuance and character development had to be left out, as well as several details that make the movie downright confusing if you have time to stop and think about them, which you don't until well after the movie's over.The big additions to the cast are Miranda Richardson, a hoot as gossip columnist Rita Skeeter, but who falls victim to the trimming of the screenplay and has far too little screen time; and Brendan Gleeson, wonderful as Mad Eye Moody.Grade: B",7,0,0,8 October 2010
The Shape of Water," Fairy Tale for Adults
","With 'The Shape of Water,' Guillermo del Toro has crafted a wondrous fairy tale for adults. Many are saying it's not as good as 'Pan's Labyrinth,' but I didn't much care for that movie and liked this one much more. It's anchored by a marvelous and silent performance by Sally Hawkins, as a mute cleaning lady in a government installation during the Cold War who falls in love and tries to rescue a strange, amphibious being who is wanted by both the American and Russian governments. She's aided in her efforts by gay next door neighbor Richard Jenkins and work partner Octavia Spencer. It's notable that the three principal characters are people pushed to the fringes of society because of various things 'wrong' with them from the perspective of 1960s America: being handicapped, being gay, being black. That a rag tag group of disenfranchised misfits dare to go up against the government and military establishment of a world superpower gives the film both a tremendous rooting interest and mirrors what's happening right now in American culture, in which groups who previously had no voice in the cultural conversation are now being heard loud and clear.The one thing I did not like about this movie is what it chooses to do with its villain, played by...who else?...Michael Shannon. I guess he's meant to represent the white establishment, but del Toro and Shannon take the character too far, turning him into a nightmarish psycho, when really the story would have been more interesting if the villain had remained more of a faceless institution rather than one single crazy dude with a score to settle. del Toro also can't resist the urge to peddle in gratuitous and graphic violence, most of it connected to Shannon's character, and which doesn't really serve any purpose other than to pull the audience out of the movie. The film doesn't need it and would have been better without it.Still, even with its flaws, 'The Shape of Water' is a visually absorbing and evocative beauty and the beast tale with one foot planted in old Hollywood and the other in our current unsettled times.Grade: A",8,100,220,31 December 2017
The Untouchables," Pound, Pound, Pound, Mr. De Palma
","I know this film has quite a following, but I found it to be fairly ridiculous. In typical fashion, Brian De Palma pounds away at the viewer, music, sound and performances amped up to deafening levels, and he directs with hammer and anvil obviousness. I'm sure he thought he was being immensely clever to pay homage to the Odessa steps sequence from 'The Battleship Potemkin' in the climactic set piece that takes place on the staircase (imperiled baby carriage and all), but it comes across as cheesy. De Palma and Oliver Stone must have gone to the same school of film-making, because neither of them gives his audience an ounce of credit for being able to think for itself.Grade: C",5,5,14,20 June 2008
The Godfather: Part III," Oh, Those Corleones...
","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two 'Godfather' films, 'The Conversation,' and 'Apocalypse Now') and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another ('Peggy Sue Got Married,' 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', the third 'Godfather') earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before 'Jack' there was 'The Godfather.' While I feel the whole 'Godfather' trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think 'The Conversation' and 'Apocalypse Now' are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire 'Godfather' trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. 'The Godfather' doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, 'The Godfather' offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade: Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-",5,1,5,26 July 2006
The Disaster Artist," Not Quite as Fun as Watching 'The Room' Itself
","'The Disaster Artist' begins with some recognizable entertainers talking about Tommy Wiseau and his legendary cult classic terrible movie 'The Room' and why such a bad movie is so beloved. The tone of that opening segment carries throughout the film. James Franco, who plays Wiseau with equal parts satire and sincerity, clearly admires the man even while acknowledging his flaws, and the whole movie feels like an inside joke in which the people in it are both laughing at and with Wiseau and his creation.It's probably not a great sign that the best parts of 'The Disaster Artist' are those in which Franco and company recreate the making of 'The Room.' If you've seen it, then of course these scenes are hilarious, and the fun comes in seeing how right they get it. The rest of the film is about Wiseau and his relationship with Greg Sestero, played by Franco's brother Dave, and either because Franco isn't a good enough actor, or because Wiseau isn't as interesting a character as people want to think he is, I found these parts to be far less entertaining. I can't even imagine how 'The Disaster Artist' would play for someone who hasn't seen 'The Room.' It's such a niche film. And while I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Disaster Artist' and think it's a good film, it really just made me want to watch 'The Room' again. I'm not sure which film should be more complimented by that statement. Grade: A-",7,0,1,13 December 2017
The Fountain," This Tree of Life Would Be Put to Better Use as Firewood
","The only compliment I can pay 'The Fountain' is that it's not ordinary. However, a little ordinariness might have helped this nearly unwatchable mess of a movie.Darren Aronofsky has made a cerebral, abstract film completely lacking any ounce of emotional significance. It comes across as one of those films that one person had too much control of. I can't believe for a second that there weren't people around Aronofsky who thought this movie was completely indigestible bilge; unfortunately, none of them had the balls to tell him so.In 'The Fountain,' Hugh Jackman plays some sort of doctor in the near future who is engaged in research to slow the aging process (or something -- I was never entirely clear on this point). His wife (Rachel Weisz, a long way away from 'The Constant Gardener') is dying of a brain tumor, and curing her with these new but unperfected methods becomes an obsession of Jackman's. Meanwhile, she has written a book about a Spanish Conquistador during the inquisitions (Jackman again) who is sent by Queen Isabella (Weisz again) to find the famed tree of life. And as if that weren't enough, another version of Jackman (this one bald, looking like a cross between Kevin Spacey and Dr. Evil) floats around space in a big bubble with said tree of life (which I think we are meant to think at this point is Weisz in her immortal form) pausing occasionally to break off pieces of its bark to eat.All of this is treated with utmost seriousness and earnestness, and the results are ridiculous. The tone of the film is one of unrelenting gloom, with sombre music and muted line readings. Jackman is not nearly a capable enough actor to handle this role, though to be fair, I don't know that anyone else would be either. He mostly just looks sad and harried, and the only difference between any of the incarnations of him is in how much hair he has on his head and face (there's the hairy Jackman, the moderately hairy Jackman and the shaved Jackman). Weisz mostly floats around in a stranded role as no more than something for Jackman to respond to. Arronofsky apparently was able to convince both of them to take this nonsense seriously, and the results are simply embarrassing at times. My wife and I laughed out loud more than once, and trust me, nothing in this movie was meant to be funny. But the climax, in which the Conquistador begins to gobble sap from the tree of life, only to have flowers erupt from all of his bodily orifices, is a tour de force of unintentional screen comedy.Ellen Burstyn inexplicably shows up in a small role as Jackman's boss. I have to believe she only agreed to do so as a favor to Aronofsky for giving her such a good role in his 'Requiem for a Dream.' Grade: F",1,20,37,5 August 2007

","I feel the way about 'Mystic River' that I do about a lot of Clint Eastwood's movies: they seem really good while I'm in the middle of watching them, but they fall apart when I think back on them.'Mystic River' suffers from Eastwood's at times too heavy hand. The acting is stellar and the atmosphere is effective. But the whole thing is sold too hard as an epic tragedy to completely work. It would have to be much more stylized overall to make that tone work, but Eastwood's straight-forward approach as a director is the exact opposite of stylized, and the whole thing is too morose and gloomy to be credible.Sean Penn and Tim Robbins received all the attention and acclaim for their performances, but I most remember Kevin Bacon as a one-time childhood friend turned cop, and Laura Linney, briefly terrifying as a gangster moll wannabe.Grade: B+",7,0,0,26 August 2010
Zombieland," Zombies with a Sense of Humor
","This hilarious skewering of the walking dead genre is gross as can be, but it's also funny as hell and even -- dare I say? -- rather sweet.Jesse Eisenberg, who I usually find pretty unappealing, is likable as a geek who manages to survive a zombie apocalypse and stays alive by following a laundry list of zombie survival rules (things like always checking the backseat and staying on top of your cardio regimen so you can outrun the undead when necessary). He comes across Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a crazy fellow survivor with a penchant for Twinkies. This unlikely pair eventually teams up with a couple of sisters, and these individual loners who until now have believed that the key to survival is to trust no one form a little island of family in a sea of carnage.'Zombieland' is mostly a goof, but it does carry throughout a relevant message about the power of human kindness and connection to help people cope with a world that's full of nothing but bad news. The cast has a lot of chemistry, and the film is quick and clever.There's a cameo from a big-time movie star playing himself that comes about halfway through the movie and gives it some of its biggest laughs.Grade: A",9,0,0,30 March 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," Life's Not Always So Wonderful
","My apologies to all of you 'It's a Wonderful Life'-ers out there. Please believe me when I say that I've tried multiple times to develop warm feelings for this movie. But it's just not meant to be. I've seen this film a couple of times, and I never want to see it again.I want to beat James Stewart's George Bailey about the head and shoulders every time I watch the movie. Perhaps the most passive-aggressive hero in motion picture history, George Bailey spends half of his time sacrificing his own happiness for the sake of others, and the other half whining about his hard luck. No, George, it's not hard luck...it's the result of your own decision making skills. Either be selfless and stop complaining, or be a bastard and screw everyone else. But make up your mind, and don't take two hours to do it.Ahhh, perhaps I now live in too cynical and jaded a world to tolerate George's namby-pamby indecision. But maybe that's a reason better than any other to keep this film around. Character aside, however, the one thing I can unequivocally praise about this film is the performance of Stewart. He provides a welcome bitter edge to combat Capra's sugary-sweet corn. His breakdown scene in a bar, where he desperately prays to God to help him keep himself together, is a tour-de-force.Drag it out every Christmas and enjoy...I won't begrudge you that small pleasure.

Every Howard movie I see makes me feel like -- no matter what the subject matter -- he's determined to create a movie that would be o.k. for eight-year-old kiddies to watch. Works fine when you're dealing with mermaids and firemen, but not so much when dealing with material like this.Jennifer Connelley proved that Joan Allen no longer necessarily cornered the market on mopey suffering wife roles, which turned out to be a good thing for us, because Allen was then free to play a hot CIA agent in the Bourne movies.Grade: C",4,5,11,23 July 2010

Columbus's style fits the bubble-gum kiddie movie tone of the first two books, but would have been completely mismatched with the later installments.The fun of all the Harry Potter movies lies in seeing what big-time British talent will pop up as the various adult characters, and in this one it's Kenneth Branagh as the preening Gilderoy Lockhart who gets most of the fun.Grade: B",7,5,6,8 October 2010
The Departed," Scorsese Gets Back to Basics
","Critics and fans alike are hailing 'The Departed' as a return to form for director Martin Scorsese, and though I don't exactly know what a return to form is for a director who's made such a list of diverse films, I understand the sentiment.'The Departed' is not as good as 'Taxi Driver' or 'Raging Bull,' but it is as good, and maybe even better, than 'GoodFellas.' Like 'Fellas,' it's fast, brutal and wildly entertaining. But also like 'Fellas,' it comes off as fairly glib and lacking in the greater psychological or social meaning that made 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull' such great films.It's nearly intolerably exciting at times; I came out of the theatre actually sweating. Scorsese gets terrific work out of his male ensemble (and lone female, Vera Farmiga), especially Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio, who play moles on either side of the cops and robbers divide and end up hunting each other. Scorsese's point, that the line between those that break the law and those that enforce it is hopelessly blurred, is obvious and easy. But the film is so well acted and so technically accomplished that you feel that you're in the presence of greatness, even if the story itself is standard-issue pot boiler stuff.The ending is somewhat of a let down. It feels like the screenwriter got lazy, and instead of resolving matters in a creative fashion, decides that the best way to tie up loose ends is to kill off virtually the entire cast, with one blow-your-brains-out shot after another. But the overly tidy ending does not diminish the impact of this propulsive, addictively watchable and disturbing film.Grade: A",9,3,6,20 October 2006
Die Hard," Yippe Ki-Yay, Mother#@**%
","Bruce Willis proved himself a bankable star in this hard-core action movie, and he's been enjoying the benefits ever since.This is one of the all-time great guy movies out there, the kind of movie that's great to come across late at night when you're bored and have nothing else to do or watch.

Psycho," We All Go a Little Mad Sometimes
","I can't decide whether 'Psycho' or 'Rear Window' is Hitchcock's best film. My answer on any given day is usually dependent on which one I've most recently watched.There's no need to go into the performances, or the shocking story, or the Bernard Herrman score (one of the best ever in film history). All that's been covered. Having just watched this film again in honor of Halloween weekend, I was struck fresh by the movie's frankness, which had to have been beyond uncomfortable for film audiences at the time. Supposedly film executives on screening this film were shocked more than anything else by the shots of the toilet in the hotel bathroom. If that was enough to shock, then what about references to transvestites, sexual arousal and release, and the blood-splattered bathroom that Hitchcock shows Perkins cleaning up in rigorous detail? The movie is so honest about the human body, its more unpleasant urges and physical qualities, that when the camera follows a swirl of blood down the shower drain, you half expect to see a big clump of hair sticking out of it. And to think this film came out at the same time as Douglas Sirk was making his films, in which women are as carefully painted and polished as china dolls.The true test of a great film is how well it stands up to the test of time, and whether or not you can revisit it and find something new in it each time you do so. By that measure, 'Psycho' is truly one of the greats.Grade: A+",10,4,7,31 October 2005
The Witch," Pilgrims Going Bonkers
","Up until its hard sell, literal ending, 'The Witch' proves that it knows better than most horror offerings these days how much scarier stories are when audiences are left to fill in the blanks with their own imaginations. It creates and builds a creepy sense of foreboding and dread, and is precisely scary because it creates horror out of happenings that anyone could relate to: loneliness, isolation, male inadequacy, religious extremism, disintegrating family dynamics, mental illness, the death of a child. You don't need supernatural oogie boogies to make any of these things scary. Up to a certain point in the film, and despite the fact that we see the witch herself, the film allows its audience to interpret the story as not having a supernatural element at all, and instead be the physical manifestations of the internal mental anguish of its characters. But not content with that, the filmmakers have to make the Satanic spin literal, which immediately makes the film less scary, since I don't believe in God, Satan, Heaven, or Hell, so there's very little in any of that mumbo jumbo for me to be afraid of.What does scare me is religious fanaticism, and that's where I think this film is most effective. It shows what happens when a group of people who have nothing but faith on which to rely begin to lose that faith, and the lengths people will go to to explain random events as not being random at all but rather the conscious design of a higher being. The mother and father in this film would rather see their own children branded as witches and likely killed than admit that cruel things sometimes just happen, not because humans are being tested or humbled by an all-powerful God, but rather because sh*t just happens. When you've got parents who are willing to offer up their children for sacrifice to prove to themselves that their belief in a fairy tale is justified, you've got an allegory, whether intended by the filmmaker or not, for the kind of religious extremism plaguing the world now, let alone 400 years ago. Now THAT's a horror movie.Grade: A-",8,2,4,18 October 2016
Rosemary's Baby," Eat Your Liver, Rosemary
","Quite simply, one of the best horror movies ever made.'Rosemary's Baby' is terrifying, and it remains terrifying every time I see it. I watch this, and then I watch what passes today for horror movies ('The Hills Have Eyes' remake is an example), and I simply shake my head in awe and dismay at how far the horror film has fallen.Everything about this movie hits the right notes. The acting is expert, especially Mia Farrow's hugely underrated performance as the impressionable Rosemary. Roman Polanski's direction is perfect; he eschews the shock horror approach used by directors like William Friedkin and instead creates a subtly creepy atmosphere, ratcheting up the tension gradually until you're ready to jump out of your skin. The production design and cinematography are off-kilter in ways you can't quite define. And the musical score, all plucked strings and jangling piano chords (except for the sinister lullaby that opens the film), is nerve-wracking.Because every element of the film comes together so well, this supernatural tale feels as realistic as it could possibly be, and one feels that if there is indeed such a thing as the coming of an Anti-Christ, it would happen something like this.With John Cassavetes, superbly slimy as the sell-out husband; Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer, as the Jewish grandma and grandpa from Hell (literally); Ralph Bellamy as a crooked doctor; and, most effectively, Maurice Evans, poor Rosemary's only ally.Any number of scenes could qualify as creepiest, but my personal favorite is the one in which Rosemary uses a Scrabble game set to make sense of an anagram. I get shivers just writing about it.Grade: A+",10,4,6,31 January 2007
The Holiday," A Holiday Soufflé
","'The Holiday' (as the name implies) is that unique animal: the holiday film. You know, the one that comes out a few weeks before Christmas, intended to counter program against all of the serious (read 'depressing') Oscar contenders. The one that takes not an ounce of concentration to follow, that goes down as smoothly as a cup of hot chocolate, and is as quickly forgotten.Well, there's a time and place for movies like that, and if December isn't exactly that time and place, I don't know where or when is. All I know is that my wife and I ended up at this on opening weekend because our other two choices for new movies were 'Apocalypto' and 'Blood Diamond.' 'Nuf said.As for the movie? Oh, what's the point. It's too long, the pacing is all over the place, it has some good moments and a lot of flat ones. But the cast is gorgeous, the settings are fun, the conclusion is warm and fuzzy. I could be a Scrooge and say 'bah humbug' to the whole thing, or I could just sit back and enjoy it for what it is, which is what I did.And let's face it -- no movie with Kate Winslet, a superb actress who makes anything she's in better by virtue of her sheer talent alone -- can be entirely bad (well, except for maybe 'Titanic.')

Zero Dark Thirty," The Hunt for Bin Laden
","Another tense nail-biter from Kathryn Bigelow, who is easily one of the top, say, three directors working when it comes to filming combat action sequences.'Zero Dark Thirty' isn't quite as visceral as 'The Hurt Locker,' Bigelow's break-out film from a few years ago, but it's not meant to be. This story about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden takes primarily in makeshift offices, where various people comb over CIA intelligence in an attempt to track down clues as to Bin Laden's whereabouts. The film is anchored by a no-frills performance by Jessica Chastain, playing a somewhat odd and unsympathetic character, a young woman who's so obsessed with finding Bin Laden that she comes a bit unhinged when he's found and she realizes she had nothing else in her life but the manhunt for him. Bigelow makes some of the smartest action movies ever put to screen, completely lacking in bombast or audience manipulation. She directs with an objective, journalistic approach, and lets her audience do its own thinking, a rare treat in movies these days.The last twenty minutes or so are given over to a breathless sequence detailing the raid on Bin Laden's compound and his death, and I was sweating bullets by the time the whole thing was over even though I already knew the outcome.Grade: A",9,4,10,25 January 2013
Steve Jobs," Sorkin's Screenplay Sizzles
","A crackerjack screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and good performances by a talented cast led by Michael Fassbender are the biggest assets of 'Steve Jobs.' Danny Boyle, one of my least favorite directors, shows an unusual amount of restraint in telling this biographical story about Steve Jobs' firing and subsequent return to Apple. The film is not a standard biopic, for which I was eternally grateful. This is not the life story of Jobs, but rather selected episodes from his meteoric rise, fall, and rise again set against the backdrop of various product launches. The film isn't based on a play, but it wouldn't have surprised me if it had been. It takes place in few locations, most of them cramped interiors, and consists of verbal showdown after showdown, usually involving no more than two or three people. Indeed, the film does teeter on the brink of monotony at times -- the viewer feels like he's hearing the same argument for the third and fourth time by the film's end. But Sorkin's rapid fire, witty dialogue makes up adequately for any dramatic inertness in the screenplay, and the witty one-liners fly with the abandon of a screwball comedy, making the viewer pay attention if he wants to hear all the jokes. Sorkin reminds me of a modern-day Paddy Chayefsky. When Beatrice Straight accepted her Oscar for 'Network,' she thanked Chayefsky for writing thoughts that people always feel but can never articulate (I'm paraphrasing). That's what Sorkin does. He has his characters say the things you would want to be able to say if you were in the same situation.Fassbender was justly Oscar-nominated for his performance, and now that I've actually seen all of the nominees in that category for that year, I think he should have won. Winslet also received her seventh nomination for playing Jobs' marketing director and his girl Friday.Boyle resists the urge to direct the film to within an inch of its life, his predominant directorial style, and instead sits back and lets the screenplay and his actors do the heavy lifting. A wise decision.Grade: A-",8,0,1,20 September 2016
Crazy Heart," Not So Crazy About 'Crazy Heart'
","Somebody put in an order for a fresh batch of movie clichés, please, because 'Crazy Heart' has used up the inventory.This film must have been the personal pet project of Scott Cooper, as he served as writer, director and producer, so I can only assume that the story was too close to his heart for him to be able to see what a lame retread it was. But I can't imagine what drew good actors like Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal to such warmed over material.Every country cliché is present and accounted for: Bridges plays a washed up music star who's lost the ability to write songs until he's inspired by his muse. There's your movie. Gyllenhaal is said muse, and there's a considerable ick factor in seeing her paired with Bridges -- not only is she about, what?, 30 years younger than him, but he looks so disgusting for so much of the film that you can't imagine any woman falling into bed with him. She's got a little boy who she allows Bridges to get close to. If you think that means that we have to endure a scene of the drunk Bridges accidentally putting the little boy in possible danger and then enduring the wrath of his mom, you'd be right. In fact, there's a good chance you're right about everything, since you can call this entire film's plot, virtually scene by scene, far in advance.Bridges won an Oscar for looking like hell and doing his own singing -- he's been much better in a hundred other things.Grade: C",4,2,6,13 September 2010
War of the Worlds," Huge Disappointment
","For all of its nonstop action set pieces and narrow escapes, 'War of the Worlds' is a strangely inert piece of film-making. There's absolutely nothing in the film to retain your interest. Tom Cruise plays a completely anonymous character who you learn nothing about, and his kids serve little purpose beyond being mere plot devices and giving Tom Cruise something to do besides save himself. Steven Spielberg directs this film with a grim relentlessness; there are scenes to frighten and disturb, but there is absolutely no sense of fun. It's as if he brought the same sensibility he did to 'Saving Private Ryan' to this film, but here the approach and the material don't match. 'Private Ryan' was about an actual event, and there was some value in depicting it as realistically and disturbingly as possible so that those of us who've never lived through something similar might be less inclined to treat the subject casually. But come on--this is an alien-invasion flick, the stuff of pure fantasy. Spielberg's obvious efforts to take advantage of the movie-going public's post-9/11 jumpiness seems calculated and rather tasteless.There's no point to talk about the acting, since there isn't any. But I do have to mention Tim Robbins, who gives a ghastly performance in a pointless role. His minimal storyline should have been left on the cutting room floor, with much of the rest of this film.This is one of those movies that doesn't even follow its own logic; the kind where all electronic devices stop working, until someone needs to be able to use a cell phone for the convenience of the plot, and then miraculously their phone works. I was actually quite surprised at how bad this movie was. It's shoddy storytelling, which is not what I've come to expect from Spielberg. He's never been one of my favorite directors, but I've always given him credit for being far more capable than he is here. Maybe he was just directing this film to pass the time before 'Munich' (his Oscar-bait movie of the year) was ready to start filming. Whatever the reason, his heart was obviously not in this one.Grade: D (some splashy visual effects prevent it from receiving an F rating)",3,7,14,5 July 2005
Mudbound," Much of It Is Good but None of It Is Great
","You can practically hear the gears grinding as 'Mudbound' attempts to add a relevant voice to the current troubled conversation surrounding race in America. Nothing wrong with relevancy, and I hope other filmmakers continue to bring stories to the screen that place minorities front and center and make people uncomfortable by forcing them to confront unpleasant truths. I just wish 'Mudbound' was a better movie. Don't get me wrong; it's a good movie. I thoroughly liked it while I was watching it, but it didn't resonate with me, and it didn't linger in my mind the way the some of the best and most troubling films do.Set in World War II era Mississippi, 'Mudbound' tells the story of a white family that takes over a farm and becomes the new employer of a family of black tenant farmers. World War II then intervenes and sees a slew of young men, white and black, go off to fight. When they come back, they find themselves having trouble acclimating back to a world so rigidly defined in terms of race. 'Mudbound' more than anything tries to be fair, which I guess is a valiant ambition and probably a needed one when we have social media hectoring us day and night and telling us we're either entirely right or entirely wrong. The movie shows us the worst of white racism in the character of a repellent patriarch who borders on caricature and rounds up the local chapter of the KKK to teach a young black man a lesson. But it also gives us white characters who are understanding and willing to forget about racial differences when faced with trials that seem far more important. One of those white characters is played by Carey Mulligan, whose dependence on the wife and mother of the tenant family (Mary J. Blige), first when her children are sick with whooping cough and then later when she miscarriages, is the catalyst for a tenuous bond to form between the two women. The other white character is played by Garrett Hedlund, whose PTSD leads him to the son of the tenant family, who also went to war and is one of the only people he feels can understand him.I have a feeling 'Mudbound' will be largely ignored come awards season, and I have to admit that I will agree if it is. Much of it is good, but little of it is good enough. No doubt when it is passed over, we will have to endure another uproar over how white Hollywood is and how black actors and stories never get nominated. God knows Hollywood does need to give us more black stories and, while 'Mudbound' is not the movie upon which to hang that particular argument, I do hope filmmakers keep trying.Grade: B+",7,4,11,27 November 2017

Since there seems to be some rule on file that every single Disney movie ever made must have one of its songs nominated for an Oscar, the Academy nominated Michael Bolton's ballad 'Go the Distance,' but it's the title song, with the line 'Who put the 'glad' back in gladiator?' that I remember most.Grade: B-",5,3,8,17 July 2009
All Quiet on the Western Front," The Beauty of a Butterfly
","There are few moments in film history as moving as the last shot of this film, when a soldier fighting in the trenches of World War I is able to shut out the carnage around him to focus on the unlikely beauty of a butterfly that has landed only inches in front of him. The power of this image is an example of what set this film apart from all of the movies that had preceded it and ushered in a new era of sophistication in the art form.'All Quiet on the Western Front' is one of the first movies to feel like a movie. The camera takes part in the action: it moves in and out, frames people in close up. Some of the most memorable images come when the camera tracks along with the soldiers as they charge the enemy trenches. And though sound in cinema was in its infancy, this movie makes terrific use of it.Compare this movie's version of combat to the films that would come out ten years later with the outbreak of WWII, and it almost takes your breath away with how ahead of its time it seems. Easily one of the best war movies ever made, and one of the best movies ever made, period.Grade: A+",10,41,49,10 November 2005
Love Actually," Tries a Bit Too Hard to Be Quirky
","Overall this movie works, though there is much about it that is awkward. It helps greatly that the director, Richard Curtis, keeps his movie self-aware and old fashioned on purpose--when it becomes just too cute and quirky to tolerate, it at least has the decency to know it.As happens all too frequently with these episodic ensemble films, there are some story lines that are simply more interesting than others, so the movie feels unbalanced. On a second viewing, it was much more difficult to have patience with the English-lad-in-Wisconsin sequences, or those involving the adult movie stand-ins -- which could have been left on the cutting room floor -- when there were such rich and affecting moments delivered by, for example, Emma Thompson, when she realizes the necklace her husband bought and wrapped as a Christmas present isn't for her, or by Laura Linney, in a brief scene of her visiting her mentally ill brother for the holiday. Bill Nighy, as an aging musician fed up with just about everything, is also a standout, and gets many of the movie's choicest and funniest lines.I very much liked this movie when I saw it in the theatre, but liked it somewhat less when I watched it again after it came out on DVD. I suspect it may be one of those movies that doesn't in the end hold up very well, though it's harmless enough. And it's got a great soundtrack.Grade: B",7,0,1,2 June 2006
12 Years a Slave," 2 Hours of Feeling Bad
","There is so much badness in our modern world and, because of the non-stop flood of digital information, it's coming at us ALL the time. Therefore, if I'm going to see a film about a horrible subject (which I'm not opposed to), I want to feel like I'm being subjected to it for a reason. I want to feel that the filmmaker has something to add to the conversation about it, draws some conclusions, makes a point that hasn't already been made. Otherwise, I feel like that much more badness has been added to my life for little purpose.That is my problem with '12 Years a Slave,' a formally accomplished film but one which left me cold. It's two hours of watching the absolute worst humanity can inflict on itself, and beyond the fairly obvious point that slavery was a horrible dark stain on American history, there isn't much point to be made and certainly no sense of enlightenment on the subject. It's a film executed to make its audience feel bad, and it succeeds tremendously on those terms. But it fails in most other ways that make great movies truly great. I felt terrible for the slaves depicted in the film in the abstract, but the individual characters are never fully developed enough to feel bad about them as actual people. It's a hectoring film, one scene after another of hateful, brutal violence (physical, sexual, emotional) inflicted on one set of human beings by another, and the problem is that the people who will actually go to see this movie don't need to be told how terrible this kind of human evil is, while those who might serve to be enlightened on that subject wouldn't see a movie like this in a million years.Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a solid performance in the central role of a free black man who's kidnapped and sold into slavery for a dozen years. But his character never really came alive for me, and that limited the impact of Ejiofor's performance. Michael Fassbender is just asked to play crazy as a villainous plantation owner, while Brad Pitt shows up toward the film's conclusion and makes a speech about the evils of slavery right before our main character is rescued. This scene and Pitt's appearance as pretty much the only white person in the movie who's not either evil or indifferent seems a bit convenient given that he's a producer of the film.Sarah Paulson is memorable as Fassbender's equally villainous wife, while Alfre Woodard has a tiny role that teases us with the more complex issues about black and white relations in the slavery-era South that this film could have addressed had it been more interested in something other than the literalness of human suffering.Grade: C",5,89,171,24 November 2013
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," A Movie Not Much Worth Caring About
","'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' doesn't add up to much of a movie. It's a moderately diverting tween romance about two soul mates who venture out into the New York night and figure out they're meant for one another only after a series of incidents keep them from reaching that conclusion sooner. The incidents aren't of much note; I appreciated that the film resisted the urge to descend into the outrageous scenarios films like this are prone to, but at the same time I wouldn't have minded if something, ANYTHING, had happened to our two protagonists.Michael Cera plays Nick the way he plays every character in every film. There's something obviously appealing about Cera (after all, he keeps getting cast in roles like this), but he's only ever as good as the movie he's in, and this movie doesn't give him much to do besides look dopey and cute the way that a bedraggled puppy would look cute. Kat Dennings plays Norah, and there's something vaguely unlikable about the way she does it. She tries to give Norah an air of awkward and aloof bravado, obviously hiding the usual batch of teen insecurities, but doesn't pull it off in a way that makes her winning. If you're going to name your characters Nick and Norah in an homage to William Powell and Myrna Loy of 'The Thin Man' series, you damn well better make sure they have chemistry. It's not that Cera and Dennings don't have any, they just don't have enough to make them or the movie worth caring about.Mostly, the film just made me feel old. Is 'straight edge' what kids are saying these days to describe good kids? And can a bunch of high schoolers really drive around New York City getting into any and every club they want to?

Wedding Crashers," The Unfunniest Comedy of the Year
","'Wedding Crashers' just isn't that funny, though I think it wants to be. After a dazzling, energetic initial fifteen minutes or so, the movie settles into a hum-drum, routine comedy formula and never recovers. Owen Wilson is low-key and pleasant enough to carry it through, but Vince Vaughan creates a grotesque caricature that ceases to be funny early on. There are lots of subplots that could have made the movie a cut above average, but none of them go anywhere, and an actor like Christopher Walken is utterly wasted in a disposable part. Come on, if you have someone like Walken in your movie and you can't find anything funny for him to do, you've got serious problems.The film goes on far too long, and its final quarter gets downright depressing before everything resolves itself predictably in a corny finale.I thought this was supposed to be the funniest movie of the year--must have been an unusually unfunny year.Grade: C",4,2,4,17 January 2006
There Will Be Blood," The Only American Masterpiece of 2007
","Once in a very rare while (all too rarely, alas) I leave a film instantly convinced that I just experienced an enduring classic in real time, and that's how I felt after watching 'There Will Be Blood.' It is an amazing film with a performance at its center that defies description, and I haven't been as energized or excited over a new release since last year's 'Children of Men.' I've always liked Paul Thomas Anderson, even at his most over indulgent ('Magnolia'), but he's never seemed as mature a filmmaker as he does here. Where other Anderson films have sustained one long fevered pitch and burnt themselves out in exhaustion, this film is restrained and disciplined; it builds slowly and inexorably to a powerhouse conclusion. Like nearly every Anderson film, it's a love it or hate it movie. It's virtually impossible to have an indifferent reaction to it. And I imagine the ending will be one of the most divisive aspects of the film. I, for one, thought it ended perfectly, and suspect it will be a long time before I get the film's final image and line out of my head.No review of this film is complete without mentioning Daniel Day-Lewis, who is nothing less than a force of nature at its center. His performance is so good it's scary; what he does in this film can't even be called acting. I've seen other performances this year that I greatly admired: Tommy Lee Jones in 'In the Valley of Elah,' Ryan Gosling in 'Lars and the Real Girl,' Viggo Mortensen in 'Eastern Promises.' But Day-Lewis seems to be working in a completely different stratosphere than these others. In Daniel Plainview, the oilman who's eaten from within by greed and a lust for power, he has created a villain that's one-dimensional yet extremely complex all at the same time. Plainview should be a boring character, because he's so single minded in purpose, yet Day-Lewis makes him endlessly fascinating. And was I the only person who actually liked him a little bit? In a world full of hypocrisy and men telling one another what they want to hear the better to take advantage, Plainview is refreshingly honest and straightforward, no matter how abominable he may be. He's like the American system of free enterprise taken to its monstrous extreme.Though set in the past, the film is one of the most relevant I've seen this year. The battle over economic and religious domination is obviously one that rages today. Religious and corporate institutions differ only in their methods -- both are driven by a lust for power and control.And to top it all off, Johnny Greenwood provides one of the most unique and sensational scores to grace a movie screen in a long time.I can't say enough good things about this movie.Grade: A+",10,6,18,9 January 2008
Joker," Deeply Unsettling
","It's been a long time since I've been as unsettled by a movie as I was by 'Joker.' The last one I can think of that comes close was 'First Reformed' from last year, another film that taps into some very dark and disturbing feelings about the state of our modern world. But that movie at least offered the possibility of hope if you were willing to interpret it a certain way, whereas 'Joker' is about as damn near nihilistic as you can get.I didn't really even want to see this movie, because I'm sick to death of the whole superhero craze and our country's obsession with it. The Joker is one of the most overexposed of all villains, and I didn't give a rat's ass about his origin story. But the thing is, this is barely a movie about the Batman Joker. It's pretty clear that director Todd Phillips and actor Joaquin Phoenix can barely muster up the energy to tie this story into any greater mythology, and the few meager attempts to do so are the only times during the movie when my brain hit snooze and my attention drifted. The rest of the film is a deeply disturbing character study of a lone man who's so tired of trying to play by the rules of a system that has no place for him that he decides to make his own. I won't call Phoenix a revelation, because we all knew he could act, but holy cow does he do something special in this movie. This is Daniel Day-Lewis in 'There Will Be Blood' territory we're talking about here, where the word 'acting' seems inadequate to describe what's happening on screen.There's a lot of controversy swirling around 'Joker.' Is it irresponsible to make a movie that basically gives lonely, angry white men a justification to carry out violent acts? Is the film just an empty, soulless, and cynical attempt to cash in on people's love of Batman and the series' villains? Is the film just ripping off of other, better movies, like 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy?' I think people will see what they want to see in 'Joker.' Some will see a hero figure in Arthur Fleck, and will either love or hate the movie because of it. Some will think the film is deep and profound while others will think it has nothing to say. I personally don't know that the film has anything to say, but the history of movies is full of great films that haven't necessarily 'said' anything. 'Joker' is a reaction to our very troubled times, and I was able to empathize with the character of Arthur Fleck to a certain point without condoning all of his actions. He's a mentally ill man who wants to get help but doesn't know how, or who's the victim of a system that doesn't care about mentally ill people. Meanwhile, the system is run by a bunch of fat cats who only care about making themselves and their cronies richer, while life for the average American gets harder and harder. Toss in our country's obsession with violence in general and guns in particular, and people like Arthur Fleck will be the inevitable result. I didn't interpret the movie as a rallying cry for incels, and I don't think it glamorized violence at all. Leave it to the 'Mission: Impossible' movies (just as one example) to do that, yet no one ever holds movies like that to task. But I do think that more people than not may find someone to relate to in Arthur Fleck, and maybe that's what's so unsettling. Like him, and like Howard Beale, another famous movie character who's fed up with the system, I'm mad as hell, and I don't want to take it anymore. Of course I will, because I'm a rational adult who understands that progressive change moves forward in fits and starts. But wouldn't it feel just a little bit good to say screw it all and burn down the whole mess?It will be interesting to see how my reactions to 'Joker' change over time and after we've passed this specific cultural moment. Who knows, maybe I'll think it's silly and juvenile twenty years from now when I think back on the Best Actor Oscar Joaquin Phoenix is almost certain to win. But right now, there's not a movie I've seen recently that feels more relevant or urgent than this one, and the balls this film has makes everything else currently playing look like a made-for-T.V. movie by comparison.Grade: A",9,22,47,11 October 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," A Fine Screen Adaptation of a Beloved Book
","'To Kill a Mockinbird' is one of those movies that is bound to fail on a first viewing, because it has to of course compete with the book on which it is based, which has captivated readers ever since it was written.But when you revisit the film after the initial 'it's not as good as the book' reaction, you find that it's a wonderful piece of art in its own right, and if it sacrifices much of the texture and detail that makes the book so compelling, it keeps the tone and the book's humanist message intact.Gregory Peck was perhaps born to play Atticus Finch. I most admire him and the screenwriter and director for keeping the role of Atticus true to the book and not allowing a certain cloying brand of sentimentality typical of Hollywood films to creep into the performance. Atticus is a noble and good man, and a reliable father, but he's rather cold and formidable. Scout and Jem love him, but they're also slightly scared of him, and he keeps them at a distance. The very traits that count as deficiencies as a father are what make him a good lawyer. This aspect of Atticus's character always fascinated me, and Peck gets it just right.My biggest lament is that the filmmakers could not include the story of Jem and Mrs. Dubose, the mean old lady who lives in the Finches' neighborhood, that provides perhaps the single most beautiful moment in the novel. As punishment for destroying her flowers, Jem must read to Mrs. Dubose every day after school, for increasingly longer periods of time. When she dies, Jem receives a box containing the petals of a flower, the kind that Jem destroyed. He thinks she's haunting him from the grave, but Atticus explains to him that Jem was unknowingly helping Mrs. Dubose kick a morphine addiction. Jem's reading distracted her through her periods of withdrawal, and enabled the proud woman to leave the earth without taking the shameful secret with her. Sending the flower to Jem was her way of thanking him. What a wonderful moment in 20th Century literature.Grade: A",8,0,2,6 November 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A Beautiful Film About the Delicacy of Humanity
","With 'The Bridge on the River Kwai,' David Lean launched the string of 'epics-with-a-soul' that would dominate the remainder of his career.In 'Kwai,' Lean deftly juggles what seem like two entirely different movies to create one strong indictment of war's ability to strip men of their humanity. In one plot line, Alec Guinness, a British officer being held in a Japanese prison camp, locks horns with the commander of the camp (Sessue Hayakawa), who puts Guinness and the other British soldiers in charge of constructing a bridge that will help the Japanese in their struggle to win the war. In the other dominant plot line, William Holden plays the leader of a platoon of men charged with blowing up said bridge. This plot line plays out like an exciting but fairly standard action film. It's the fascinating story of Guinness's transformation, not to mention his spectacular performance, that gives the film its status as a classic. The same quality of British perseverance that made Guinness such a loyal officer for the Allies works in Japanese favor as he becomes committed to building as fine a bridge as possible, forgetting its ultimate purpose. The film very eloquently communicates how noble attributes like loyalty and honor can be manipulated to satisfy what in certain circumstances can be perceived to be dubious ends, which, when you think about it (though few people want to) characterizes the basis of military recruitment everywhere.'Kwai' joined a batch of other 1957 releases -- like '12 Angry Men,' 'Paths of Glory' and 'Sweet Smell of Success' -- in introducing a grittier and at the same time more poetic style of film-making that looked forward to the art-house style that would come into its own throughout the 1960s.Grade: A",9,0,2,5 September 2006
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One of the Last Anti-Establishment Films of the 1970s
","'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' is about the triumph of the human spirit, but it's depressing as hell.Jack Nicholson gave the last of his great performances before he started playing parodies of himself, and Louise Fletcher plays one of the screen's greatest villains, the only role this forgotten actress was really ever known for. Their battle of wills in a mental institution symbolizes the battle of humanity against oppressive authoritarianism, and if Nicholson's character happens to lose this particular battle, the movie implies, humanity is determined to win the war.Looked at now in historical context, this film was one of the last gasps of anti-establishment film making. Vietnam was ending, American political corruption was starting to fade into memory, and the boom years of the 1980s were not far away. 'Cuckoo's Nest' stands as one of the supreme examples of what made 1970s film making great.Grade: A+",10,1,2,8 August 2007
Downfall," A Not Horrible Enough Telling of a Horrible Story
","This ensemble film about the last days of Hitler and his Nazi regime should have left me chilled and disturbed, but I found it oddly soft.Bruno Ganz is terrific as Hitler, but he feels like a supporting character in his own drama. The film focuses on too many people, blunting the tautness and drama of what took place in that famed bunker during those dark days in April 1945. The movie feels overly scripted; there are too many scenes that smacked of a soap operatic melodrama. And it's too tasteful or cautious to confront the most horrific moments head on. I'm not one to advocate for gratuitous violence in films, but Steven Spielberg showed in 'Schindler's List' that graphic violence is sometimes a necessity when telling a story as horrible as any of the numerous stories about what the Nazis did to the world.The whole time I was watching this film, I wondered what it would have been like if it had been in the black and white, stark style of Michael Haneke's 'The White Ribbon.' That movie, which I saw nearly a year ago, still haunts me, while 'Downfall,' which I saw a couple of weeks ago, I've already nearly forgotten.Grade: B",6,1,2,8 October 2011
Whiplash," A Portrait of the Artist as a Crazy Young Man
","I work with a guy who studied music in school and had friends who went the music conservatory route, and according to him 'Whiplash' is authentic. To which I say...Oh my God! Because this film is a nightmare.Miles Teller gives an under-appreciated performance as a drummer following his passion who is lucky enough (if lucky is the right word) to be chosen by a psycho jazz teacher (J.K. Simmons) to join his class. What follows is a battle of wills, as Simmons tries to grind his students to stumps of their former selves while Teller proves that he won't be so easily dominated. 'Whiplash' goes in a very dark direction and completely defies expectations, which is what I liked most about it. I was expecting a kind of 'Devil Wears Prada' set in a music school, where the eager pupil first wants to give up, then rises to the challenge, earns the respect of a tough teacher but ultimately decides his worth doesn't depend on proving himself to anybody. But that is most decidedly NOT the direction this film goes, instead turning into a contest to see how much crazier and more obsessed one maestro can be over another. Simmons shouts and blusters his way through a one-note role. He's good in context of what he's asked to do, but it's the kind of showy performance that wins Oscars, not a subtle and complex characterization. Teller is the heart and soul of the film, and he's tremendous. The film is like watching a car accident in slow motion and being unable to do anything to prevent it, and just as unable to look away.Winner of three Academy Awards (Supporting Actor for Simmons, Film Editing and Sound Mixing) and nominated for two others, including Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay.Grade: A",9,3,7,23 March 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Excess Is Boring, Especially When It's Three Hours Long
","Martin Scorsese at his undisciplined worst.'The Wolf of Wall Street' is 90 minutes of glib satire stretched over an interminable 180 minute film. I get it, I get it -- the excess of the film itself matches the excess of the Wall Street world depicted in it. But excess, both as a subject matter and as a style, is boring after a while. The first hour or so of the film blows the roof off the joint, and I was sure I was experiencing a film that would go down as one of Scorsese's best. But as it went on and on, and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance became more and more histrionic, and the film made the same point over and over, I had that depressing feeling that comes when a movie you're really enjoying makes a wrong turn and becomes one you really dislike.'The Wolf of Wall Street' is of course critic proof. Anyone who doesn't like it is instantly categorized by its fan boys as stodgy and unable to handle the subject matter, as if it's an impossibility that someone could dislike the film simply because they don't think it's any good. Whatever. It's an overblown mess, stupid when it's trying to be funny (the Quaalude scene, for example) and in desperate need of someone who had the balls to tell one of America's greatest directors that he was letting his material run away with itself.Grade: C",5,24,46,9 January 2014
The Last King of Scotland," A Hugely Exciting African-Set Thriller
","With 'The Last King of Scotland,' Kevin MacDonald has created a bracing, exciting and totally satisfying thriller.Forest Whitaker gives a titanic performance as Idi Amin, Ugandan dictator who rose to power in the 1970s. James McAvoy plays Nicholas Garrigan, a Scottish physician who travels to Uganda for the adventure and wins Amin's affections, becoming his personal doctor. Garrigan enters into a moral crisis as he begins to realize the kind of man Amin is, and begins to fear for his own life as events spiral more and more out of his control.Whitaker seizes the chance to play this larger than life character and runs with it -- I've never seen Whitaker give so convincing and transforming a performance. However, as good as he is, McAvoy impressed me more. His performance as Garrigan is not as showy, but it's much more textured and subtle, and his character has the bigger arc from start to finish. Gillian Anderson also does terrific work in a small role as a fellow doctor, who understands things about Amin and the African culture that Garrigan does not.Unlike other recent thrillers set in African nations ('The Constant Gardener,' 'Hotel Rwanda'), 'The Last King of Scotland' is not greatly concerned with the geo-political implications of Amin's reign. The atrocities he committed against Ugandans are given only the barest of mentions, and the film sticks almost exclusively to Garrigan and the danger he himself faces. Some may think the film is irresponsible for this reason -- that the plight of one man pales in comparison to the plight of thousands, and I can see where a criticism like that is justified. But the movie packs a powerful wallop regardless, and complaints like this seem like quibbles when up against such an entertaining movie.Grade: A",9,177,219,21 October 2006
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Just When Did Francis Ford Coppola Become Incapable of Making a Good Movie?
","Francis Ford Coppola's atrocious version of the Bram Stoker classic is updated for the MTV generation.Coppola eschews everything that made the novel scary -- atmosphere, creepiness, subtlety, things fluttering in the shadows -- and replaces it with gore, busy camera-work, shock editing and a relentlessly frantic pace. Oh, and did I also mention Keanu Reeves? Coppola's film claimed to be faithful to the original novel, and it is in terms of plot, but in every other regard one wonders if Coppola ever read it.Cheesy and creaky as the old Universal classic is, I'd take that any day over this abomination.Grade: F",1,51,97,6 January 2009

","In the grand tradition of actors who win Oscars and then proceed to ruin the Academy's credibility by starring in terrible movies, Nicolas Cage made quick work of his career boost by appearing in this horrible action movie and has been on a downward spiral ever since.This film is downright unpleasant, but I guess there's not much room for a film about a bunch of escaped maximum security inmates to be anything else. Cage looks, sounds and acts ridiculous, and John Malkovich is typically unbearable as the sardonic and monotone ringleader.Only two things make the film watchable at all: John Cusack and the pleasant theme song.Grade: D",2,1,5,17 July 2009
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Surprised at the Low Rating
","I thought 'Anchorman' was hilarious, so I was surprised at the low rating it received here. Well written, well acted, and well directed, this is a very funny adult comedy with some classic scenes and lines. I will not soon forget the 'West Side Story' rumble between five rival news teams, that includes a man on fire and another man being speared with a trident. Or the verbal abuse Will Ferrell and Christina Applegate throw back and forth at each other while the credits for their news show are rolling ('I'm proud of my pubic mane' is one of my favorite lines, which Ferrell says in response to Applegate telling him he has too much pubic hair). Ferrell of course is funny, and Applegate makes a good straight man (or woman). Steve Carell and Paul Rudd are also terrific as well. And I had a blast with the impressive list of cameos, my favorite being Tim Robbins as the lead anchor at the local public television station.This movie really satisfies the need for good comedy that you don't have to think very much about, but that still manages to be more clever than usual and doesn't rely on bathroom humour for all of its laughs. Watch and have a great time.Grade: A-",8,0,1,3 January 2006
American Gangster," Ridley Scott Knocks One Out of the Park
","Director Ridley Scott has surprised me: he's finally made a movie I liked. Since the last one was 'Alien' back in 1979, I'd pretty much given up on him.'American Gangster' is a kinetic, dazzlingly entertaining crime film. It features two strong performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, but this wasn't a movie that left me remembering the performances. Rather, it's the great writing and assured directing that left me most impressed.Washington plays Frank Lucas, a drug dealer in 1960s Harlem who applies the principal of the American dream and capitalism to his drug trade: make something better and sell it for less, and pretty soon your product will be the one to beat. Crowe plays perhaps the only honest cop in New York City, who's appointed the leader of a narcotics unit whose mission is to bring an end (or at least curb) New York's rampant drug market. All of this is based on a true story, but who knows how accurate it all is. And frankly, with a movie as entertaining as this, who cares? The film only slows down toward the end, when Washington and Crowe finally meet, and the screenplay decides it must tidy things up in a 'here's-the-moral-of-the-story' kind of way. The rest is energetic and highly accomplished. The film doesn't join the ranks of 'The Godfather' as one of the best American films about organized crime, but I'm not sure it tries to, and that's one of its best qualities.A host of other actors appear in supporting roles, including Cuba Gooding, Jr., Chiwetel Ejiofor, Ruby Dee (memorable as Washington's mother), Ted Levine (who I'll never be able to see as anyone other than Buffalo Bill from 'The Silence of the Lambs'), Josh Brolin (who has now officially appeared in every movie released this year) and, chewing the scenery, Armand Assante doing his best Marlon Brando impersonation.Like him or not, there's no denying that Scott does know his way around a movie set, and with 'American Gangster' he's given us one of the best and one of the most entertaining films of the year.Grade: A",9,0,2,27 November 2007
The Mission," Feast for the Eyes and Ears
","Roland Joffe's period film is breathtaking to look at and listen to, but it's directed with a heavier hand than his breakout film from two years earlier, 'The Killing Fields.' I had trouble with the casting too. Jeremy Irons feels right for his role, but it's tough to accept Robert DeNiro in period films -- he's such a remarkable contemporary actor, and he's created such iconic representations of modern urban life, that he feels out of place in something like this.The film is a feast for the eyes and ears though, with Chris Menges, who had won an Oscar for photographing 'The Killing Fields', adding a second trophy to his mantle for his work here; and Ennio Morricone providing an instantly classic score.Grade: A-",7,2,3,6 May 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," A Creative and New Examination of Old Questions
","Harold Crick lives a boring life of dull routine and never seems to entertain the notion that any other kind of life is a possibility. He quietly gets up every morning, catches the same bus to work, spends his day auditing people who hate him (he's an IRS agent), comes home, goes to bed and repeats everything the next day. His life is carefully synchronized by his trusty wristwatch, possibly and sadly Harold's best friend. His daily comings and goings are narrated to us by the pleasant, British accented voice of God, or at least of Emma Thompson. But one day, a seemingly ordinary Wednesday, Harold begins to hear the same narration that we hear, including a passing mention of his impending death. Harold's the main character in a novel, you see, and Emma Thompson is not an omniscient god, but rather the author of the novel. Though, as the movie hints, perhaps they're the same thing.I went into 'Stranger Than Fiction' with significant reservations. The movie belongs to the same genre as films like 'Adaptation,' 'Being John Malkovich' and 'The Truman Show,' metaphysical musings on subjects like free will, the act of creation and such, all films which I found to be a bit too clever for their own good and which ultimately could not deliver on the promise of their imaginative concepts. But 'Stranger Than Fiction' handles its topic quite well, and it's a very good movie. Once Harold realizes that his creator intends for him to die, he sets out to change the course of events of his life, not sure whether or not such a thing is even possible. He's helped by the fact that he's found something worth living for, that something being a feisty baker played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who brings a tremendous amount to the film through her nimble performance and engaging screen presence, and he enlists the help of a university literature professor cum therapist played by Dustin Hoffman, who helps Harold unravel the mystery of who's writing the book about him. Meanwhile, Thompson enters into a crisis of her own. She can't figure out how to kill off Harold Crick, and just as she comes up with a perfect and poetic way for him to die, she discovers that Harold knows who she is and that she's in control, and suddenly the act of killing him off becomes infinitely complicated by the fact that a real human life is in her hands.There's much about this film that doesn't make a whole lot of sense if you think about it for too long. For example, if Harold is a fictional character living in a fictional universe created by an author, then why isn't everyone else he interacts with fictional too? Also, the death Thompson devises for Harold isn't that original, so one wonders why exactly she had so much trouble coming up with it in the first place. But the questions about the moral responsibility of creators for their creations, and the reverse questions about the freedom of creations to determine their own fate, though not exactly new, are at least given a fresh coating of paint here, and the slick direction by Marc Forster helps the film and its ideas go down easily. It's not as intellectually ambitious as movies like 'Adaptation' or 'Being John Malkovich,' but in spite of that, or maybe because of it, I enjoyed this film more.Grade: A-",7,1,2,7 April 2007
The Green Mile," Ponderous Adaptation of King's Serial Novel
","Stephen King's pulpy serial novel was a fun read; writer/director Frank Darabont turned it into a bloated, self-important and self-righteous movie.He did the same thing, though to a lesser extent, to 'The Shawshank Redemption,' another adaptation of a King story. Why in the world this man keeps turning to Stephen King for tales of philosophical import I don't know, because the material just isn't there. On paper, 'The Green Mile' was an effective little story about a man with mystical powers waiting out his life on Death Row. The usual King touches -- including dips into the macabre and supernatural -- are there, but the most interesting parts of the book are the details about Depression-era prison life. Darabont amps up the religious overtones and smothers the story in hokey sentimentality.My favorite Darabont film to date is 'The Mist,' a nasty little bit of work that could fit inside 'The Green Mile' with about an hour to spare.Grade: C",5,1,3,28 June 2010
The Reader," The Kind of Film to Admire Rather Than Fall in Love With
","'The Reader' is full of interesting ideas, but it suffers from lacklustre execution.The central question at the heart of the story is whether or not we'll ever be able to distance ourselves enough from the Holocaust to understand how it was allowed to happen. Categorizing every person who played a role in it as a monster is easy and it provides an emotional catharsis, but it also prevents us from learning from history. After all, not every person who worked in a concentration camp was evil -- many of them were just people doing their jobs without any of the historical context we now have. And if we disregard them as something inhuman, we won't be able to know how to prevent something similar from happening again.This question plays out in the story of Hannah, a former concentration camp guard (played by Kate Winslet), and Michael, played as a young man by David Kross and as an older man by Ralph Fiennes. Hannah and David have an affair before David knows of Hannah's past, and comes across her again years later when he's a law student and she's on trial as a war criminal. David must reconcile his loathing of what Hannah did with the fact that he knows she's not a monster. Hannah's real shame are not her crimes, but rather the fact that she never learned to read, and the film's best moments come in the third act when Michael, as a way of expiating some of the guilt he feels at not coming to Hannah's defense when he knew information that would have helped her case, records himself reading some of Hannah's favorite stories and sends them to her in prison.'The Reader' is a solid piece of film-making, but it has that ever-so-slightly-embalmed quality that comes when a director and writer feel the need to be too respectful to the source material. It's sombre and tactful and always feels more like a filmed book than a movie. It never comes cinematically alive. It boasts good performances, especially from Winslet and Lena Olin, who has brief dual roles as mother and daughter concentration camp survivors. And it has one all-too-brief thrilling sequence in which Winslet's character decides to spend her time in prison learning to read -- just watch Winslet's face as Hannah recognizes the word 'the' for the first time. Otherwise, it's the kind of movie to admire rather than fall in love with.Grade: B+",7,11,19,29 December 2008
Jaws," You Know the Thing About a Shark, Chief?......
","I can barely relax in a swimming pool to this day because of Steven Spielberg's ultimate shark movie.I've become a detractor of Spielberg in his more recent years as a director, but 'Jaws' represents him doing what he does best: putting fun popcorn movies on screen and using his shameless powers of manipulation to thrill us rather than wrench tears from us. Give me 'Jaws' and 'Raiders' over 'Schindler's List' or 'Saving Private Ryan' any day.Acting in movies like this gets overlooked, but I think 'Jaws' would not be the classic we remember it as today without the marvelous trio of actors who play the men on the hunt of that pesky great white: Roy Scheider, as police chief Brody, whose sense of duty and obligation outweighs his morbid fear of water and the unknown; Richard Dreyfuss, as a cocky scientist mesmerized by the beauty and the majesty of the creature they're hunting; and Robert Shaw, in an off-his-rocker performance as Quint, loony shark hunter, the Captain Ahab of Amity. These three together deliver one of the best depictions of male bonding ever put on screen.Peter Benchley greatly improved his own book for the screen. The book is full of boring subplots and lengthy passages told from the shark's point of view. The screenplay, on the other hand, is streamlined and crisp, not pushing the story beyond its modest bounds, and reducing it to a basic man against nature -- or man against his own worst fears -- tall tale. It's like 'Deliverance' lite.And that John Williams score.....oh, that score......Grade: A",9,0,2,8 August 2007
The Wrestler," Great Film Only Slightly Marred by Hokey Ending
","In 'The Wrestler,' Mickey Rourke finds himself matched with the perfect role at the perfect moment in his career, and gives a performance that makes you wonder why he waited this long to show the world how good an actor he can be.Rourke plays Randy the Ram Robinson (real name Robin, but don't call him that), a professional wrestling has-been, relegated to third-tier matches in out-of-the-way towns, attended by a smattering of fans who still remember who he is. After a particularly brutal and gimmicky match involving barbed wire, glass and a nail gun, he suffers a heart attack and undergoes bypass surgery. Faced with the prospect of not ever being able to wrestle again (which to that point has been his whole life), he decides to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood, effective in a few brief scenes) and makes romantic overtures to a woman who works at his favorite strip joint (Marisa Tomei).Much of 'The Wrestler' feels like a documentary about the behind-the-scenes workings of professional wrestling, or more accurately, about what happens to professional wrestlers after they're spit out of the entertainment mill. We see Randy locked out of his trailer when he can't muster the rent and begging for more hours at the supermarket where he works. He's the Norma Desmond of the wrestling world, waiting patiently at autograph signings barely attended by anybody, carting around VHS tapes of his professional highlights to sell to anyone who might still actually own a VCR. He's a relic from the 1980s, as illustrated in a wonderful scene in which he and Tomei discuss those good 'ol days and the great bands they produced, until Kurt Cobain came along and ruined everything. Rourke plays Randy as a gentle giant, whose tender and warm way with people belies his fierce professional persona. He gives a marvelous performance, achingly sad but not maudlin. This is pretty much his movie entirely; Tomei and Wood each get a few moments to shine, but Rourke holds the screen and doesn't let it go.The only thing that marred this movie for me was its ending. Most of the movie is completely lacking any of the phony Hollywood trappings that mar so many other movies. Therefore, the 'Rocky'-style ending, with Randy's true love racing the clock to get to his match on time, and us left wondering whether or not he's going to drop dead of a heart attack right in the middle of his big moment, felt like a cheat.But otherwise, this is one of the better movies I've seen this year.Grade: A-",8,1,4,2 January 2009
Hancock," Original Ideas Stranded by Chaotic Script
","'Hancock' may be many things, but it's certainly not a traditional superhero movie. That's either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view.I appreciated the many original ideas swirling around the perimeter of this movie, but it's a shame that no one idea ever fully takes hold. The script feels like the product of a brainstorming session before anyone has had a chance to make sense of the notes. And not only is the script somewhat of a mess, but the tone veers all over the place as well. The movie gives the impression of having been directed by several different people.About an hour into 'Hancock,' the script throws in a surprise twist that director Peter Berg handles deftly, and the movie, that had already been ticking along pretty enjoyably, gets an extra jolt of energy and fun. But that sense of fun drains immediately from the film as the entire tone turns nasty, unpleasant and extremely violent. Bad guys come from nowhere, plot developments don't make a lot of sense and back story is apparently made up as the film moves along. The movie itself is only 90 minutes, so I don't know why the filmmakers felt compelled to rush through to an ending without tying things together in a way that made sense, but on the other hand, I'm glad it wasn't any longer because I was tired of the arbitrariness of the whole thing.It's hard to talk about what could have been without revealing the plot twist, but let's just say that the film could have gone in any number of interesting directions that it chooses to ignore. Due to what it reveals about one of the major characters, the script could have given Hancock either an ally or a compelling villain, but it does neither, and all of the actors -- charismatic as they are -- feel somewhat stranded. Jason Bateman alone keeps things buoyant for as long as he can on the strengths of his goofy charm and comic timing.Grade: B-",6,2,2,7 July 2008

Reilly, who pops up mid-way through the movie as a crazy island recluse, who steals the show.Or should I say it's the Oscar nominated visual effects that steal the show. Kong is an impressive CGI creation, as are the mean chicken lizards he's constantly fighting.A post-credits sequence hints at a sequel.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas Finally Gets It Right
","Third time is apparently the charm for Mr. Lucas, because 'Revenge of the Sith' finally, FINALLY, feels like a 'Star Wars' movie. 'Attack of the Clones' was tons better than 'The Phantom Menace,' and even 'Menace' improves as part of the entire series when it doesn't have to stand alone, but 'Sith' is the only installment in the new trilogy that deserves the 'Star Wars' brand.With 'Sith,' events start to feel like they actually matter, and the elaborate but hopelessly dry plot lines that dominate the first two movies begin to coalesce into something resembling a story with resonance. The Emperor's rise to power and the way he creates a dictatorship while giving the impression that he's preserving democracy feels right, and there's an intense momentum to this film as the dark powers insidiously take over that the previous two films seriously lack.The acting is still woeful, with the exception of Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid, both able to make George Lucas's terrible dialogue sound better by virtue of their British accents alone. Hayden Christiansen continues to play Anakin as a petulant teenager; he's at times embarrassing in his attempts to convey a demented mind spiraling downward. But in a way, it makes sense that Anakin would be an immature brat at his most impressionable, easily influenced by Palpatine while his still young mind is transparent. So in effect, Christiansen's poor performance accidentally ends up working for the character. And nothing can be said about Samuel L. Jackson's performance, other than that a great drinking game could be made out of it: everyone has to take a shot each time Jackson looks like he'd rather be doing anything other than appearing in a 'Star Wars' movie.'Revenge of the Sith' makes the entire prequel trilogy, whatever its faults (and there are many), worth the time it takes to watch them.Grade: A",9,0,3,27 September 2006

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Longing for the Days of Hand-Drawn Animation
","Watching this first feature length Disney film is a reminder that today's slick computer-generated Pixar movies come at the expense of hand-drawn artistry. 'Snow White' is horribly dated in some ways, especially apparent whenever Snow White herself breaks into that piercing, warbly soprano to sing some very familiar songs, but there are moments in this film that will take your breath away with their sheer beauty of animation. I especially liked the wicked queen, who's really scary, and not a jokey villain like those of Disney's more modern animated films. O.k. so a single attractive female shacking up with seven smitten men would make many an eyebrow raise today, but get your minds out of the gutter, people.I can accept that technology changes, and today's animation offers many treats in its own right, but that doesn't mean I don't lament an art that has become by and large obsolete.Grade: A",9,4,5,19 January 2006
The Lion King," The Last Great Hand-Drawn Animated Film from Disney
","Throughout the early 1990s, Disney animation appeared to be unstoppable. 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King' in quick succession had set a new standard for animation. Unfortunately for Disney, 'The Lion King' would be its last hurrah for a while, or really for good. Pixar would soon pick up the torch, and now Pixar is king of the jungle.But as for 'The Lion King'.......'Beauty and the Beast' is probably my favorite Disney animated film, but this one is a close second. It's the darkest and most ambitious and it's got superb animation. The song score by Elton John is the weakest in the above-mentioned string of films, but the orchestral score by Hans Zimmer is the best. The film doesn't shy away from the savagery of the natural world, or the difficult emotions surrounding life and death, and for that I applaud it.Grade: A",9,3,4,17 March 2009
Inception," Inception? More Like Insipid
","'Inception' might have been a better movie -- and would certainly have been more entertaining -- had writer/director Christopher Nolan not made his premise so complicated that the film had to spend its entire 2:25 running time explaining itself to its audience.Seriously, the exposition Never. Stops. There were literally moments during action sequences where one character would pause and explain what was going on to another character, which of course was a ham-fisted way of explaining it to us. But even with all of that aggressive exposition, the movie never does make a lot of sense. The result is a lot of busyness -- oh, there's always plenty of stuff going on -- that's nevertheless pretty boring because it's never clear what all of the busyness is for.Nolan has done this to us before. Who the hell came out of 'The Prestige' with any clue what that movie was about? And even his more narratively coherent films (like 'The Dark Knight') suffer from a lack of humor and a burden of philosophical pondering that the premises can't support. 'Inception' is no exception (ha!). The movie is junk trying to disguise itself as something important and significant. How much more fun it would have been if it had just been content to be junk.Grade: C-",5,22,37,11 January 2011
The Secret Life of Pets," Lazy and Uninspired
","One doesn't fully appreciate a really good animated film until one sees a mediocre one.It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that animated films don't need to be kept to the same standard as movies for adults, because kids will be happy with so much less. But compare 'The Secret Life of Pets,' a serviceable but lackluster film, to something from Pixar, say, or the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series, and one is less inclined to forgive the creators of 'Pets' for being so lazy.The idea of the social life that pets carry on with each other while their owners are away is a good one and could provide plenty of material for a wonderful film, but this movie instead goes for the hard sell approach and creates an overly-complicated plot mostly lacking in wit, giving us too many characters doing too many things, none of which we care much about. The voice work is adequate and uninspired, like the rest of the film, and it's a real liability that the voices of the two main characters (Louis C.K. and Eric Stonestreet) who start off as rivals and end up as pals, sound too much alike.Grade: C",5,5,11,9 August 2016
WALL·E," One Little Robot with One Gigantic Heart
","Mesmerizing.This little film about a little robot has one of the biggest hearts I've ever seen in a movie, and its message, about the responsibility humans must accept in changing their own lives and the life of their planet for the better, is perhaps the single most important message film as an art form can be communicating right now.'Wall-E' did for me what so few films are able to do: it transported me to a place where, for the hour and a half that I was watching it, nothing existed for me but this movie. It made me feel like a kid again, and recreated the feelings I had watching 'Star Wars' or 'E.T.' for the very first time, which would account for the countless scenes that made me tear up for vaguely nostalgic reasons.Despite the fact that we spend most of our time with mechanical robots, a love of humanity and of the earth pulses from every frame of 'Wall-E'. Movies, television and the news media spend so much time trying to convince us that the world is a terrible place to live, that one rickety little robot with big eyes telling us otherwise comes as a revelation.Grade: A+",10,3,6,1 July 2008
The Good Shepherd," A Complete Snoozer of a Movie
","Who knew the story of the early days of the CIA was such a boring one? Or at least, it is in the hands of Robert DeNiro, who directed this film that I sincerely wanted to like and instead was utterly bored to death by.And please understand me -- I don't use the word 'boring' lightly. I don't like it when other people use it, and I think it's usually too easy and lazy to do so. But in some cases, it just simply fits, and this is one of them.'The Good Shepherd' is boring because the pacing is as monotone as the color scheme (which is all browns and grays by the way). It's boring because the script is a muddled mess and leaves one unable to make sense of anything going on. It's boring because it's peopled with characters who aren't in the least compelling. By the time the movie was reaching its conclusion (a long, LONG nearly 3 hours after I took my seat), it was coming at me as a series of disconnected scenes with no relation to one another, and I couldn't have cared less how it ended.Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, an early CIA operative who dedicates his life to the service and sees his personal life go to hell for his efforts. There's nothing necessarily wrong with Damon's performance -- I believe he plays the character exactly as called for by the script and director. But he's fighting a losing battle, for what makes Wilson such a perfect CIA agent -- his elusiveness, his opacity, his withdrawnness -- are the same characteristics that make him such a blank slate of a main character. With this vacuum at the movie's center, there's simply no chance for it to ever come alive.'The Good Shepherd' is an admirable effort, I guess. You can tell that DeNiro has a passion for the story he's telling. But it's been a long time since I've been so disengaged during a film. The movie is all whispers, shadowy silhouettes lurking in doorways, portentous looks; one character gets killed, another is thrown out of a plane; there's domestic drama, sex and drunk scenes -- and nothing ever heats up to more than a low simmer.Billy Crudup and Michael Gambon deliver the film's best performances; unfortunately, they also have two of the smallest roles. Angelina Jolie, looking incredibly too perfect as Wilson's long-suffering wife, is utterly wasted in a clichéd role, in which she pops up every fifteen minutes or so to yell shrilly at her husband. Other actors include William Hurt, Alec Baldwin and DeNiro himself, none of whom registers in the least.Pass this one by.Grade: D+",4,2,6,31 December 2006
Stalag 17," Holden Won His Oscar for the Wrong Movie
","'Stalag 17' is about 30 minutes of compelling film starring William Holden padded out with about 90 minutes of strained 'comedy.' Holden plays an inmate in a German prison camp during WWII who comes under suspicion by his fellow prisoners of being a spy because of his 'every man for himself' attitude. For about an hour and a half, scenes of the prisoners being grumpy with him are interspersed with long segments of superfluous antics which make being an inmate of a German POW prison seem about as serious as being away at summer camp. Then, in the film's last half hour, Holden decides to find out who the spy really is, and does so without breaking a sweat.Holden's entire performance consists of attitude, which is exactly what the character calls for, but it's not the stuff of an Oscar-winning performance, especially because he seems very much like a supporting character. I wasn't timing things with a stopwatch, but it felt like Robert Strauss, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor as the lunkhead Animal, had more screen time. He's one of the actors included for comic relief, but man does he wear out his welcome early on, as do all of the other actors who are there only to provide what we are supposed to think are hysterical hijinks. The film would feel like an inferior knock off of 'MASH' if it hadn't come out first. Billy Wilder joined Holden and Strauss at the 1953 Oscars as a nominee for Best Director.

Arrival," Sci-Fi Film Had Me Bawling Like a Baby
","Some of the best science fiction films are those that aren't actually what they appear to be about, but rather use a sci-fi premise to explore the human condition right here on Earth. 'Arrival' is one such film. Though an encounter with aliens and humankind's reaction to it sets off the action in this film and comprises the bulk of its story, it's the human characters that we learn and care about.Amy Adams is one of those human characters, and she gives an absolutely lovely performance, one that totally carries the film. She gets no histrionics or big Oscar scenes, yet days after the movie I was still thinking about her and the journey her character goes on. It's hard to discuss the plot of 'Arrival' without giving too much away to those who haven't seen it, and this is one movie that will be most effective if you know very little about it. It's got what I suppose would be considered a plot twist, but it's not one in the traditional, gimmicky sense. It grows organically from the plot, and by the time it comes you realize that it's not actually a twist but really what the movie's been about the whole time.The question 'Arrival' asks is: 'If you had your life to do over again, good and bad, and didn't have the option of changing anything, would you?' The ending, and Adams' character's answer to that question, had me crying like a baby in the movie theater.Grade: A",9,3,10,29 November 2016
The Blind Side," Sassy, Sassy, Sassy
","The only thing separating 'The Blind Side' from a made-for-TV movie on the Hallmark channel is the fact that Sandra Bullock is probably too expensive for Hallmark.I know this film is based on the true story about an affluent white family who take in a homeless black youth and raise him as their own. But even though its origins are grounded in fact, the film felt like a congratulatory fantasy conjured out of white guilt. The film is so anxious to be family-friendly and palatable to the least sophisticated film goer that it almost avoids dramatic conflict altogether. Conflicts are there, but most of them are resolved within the next scene or two, never building to any kind of suspense or emotional payoff.Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for the same reason Julia Roberts did -- Hollywood loves to recognize appealing actresses for being sharp and sassy. But Roberts had much better material to work with in 'Erin Brockovich.' The material in 'The Blind Side' is usually just shy of gag-inducing, and at one point -- when Bullock's character confronts a group of gang-bangers with a 'you go girl' attitude and actually succeeds in intimidating them -- downright ludicrous. At the very least, she would have been laughed at in that situation, and quite possibly would have been lucky to escape without physical harm.The film also stars Kathy Bates as a sassy tutor, and uses the character of Bullock's younger son for...you guessed it...sassy and damn near intolerable 'comic' relief.The success of 'The Blind Side' with middle America is clearly attributed to its religious and wholesome message and values. Fair enough. But it's precisely simplistic and dumbed down movies like 'The Blind Side' that make me leery of anything geared toward the Christian community. However, I will say that it's refreshing for once for a film to have actually been seen by the audience who needs to hear its message. And it's also nice, in the wake of 'The Passion of the Christ' and other movies embraced by the religious community, to see Christianity associated with productivity and goodness rather than with pain and guilt.

The Shawshank Redemption," Entertaining Prison Movie Isn't Nearly as Good as Its Rabid Fan Base Would Lead You to Believe
","I'm utterly mystified at the cult of idolatry that has developed around this solid but not overly memorable prison film based on a Stephen King short story.'The Shawshank Redemption' came out of nowhere in 1994 to be nominated for 7 Academy Awards, and I have to believe that it's the film's underdog story that has helped it to develop such a following over the years as much as it is the quality of the film itself. There's nothing egregiously wrong with it, but it's overly-sentimental and obvious film-making from a director who has done nothing but make too serious film adaptations of Stephen King novels. I think it's become apparent over the years that Morgan Freeman is a one-trick pony when it comes to acting, but at the time he wasn't quite as well known, so the wise sage role he plays here seemed good enough to get him an Oscar nomination. However, it's Tim Robbins who really deserves the most praise as the man wrongly imprisoned. The less said about the actors who play the various prison personnel, the better -- they're all played as horrorshow goons.The original Stephen King story was an entertaining bit of pulp, but Frank Darabont tries to turn it into something that the story just isn't -- namely, an epic story about one man's struggle to free his soul. As a result, where the story felt sleek and satisfying, the film feels sanctimonious and bloated.Grade: B",7,2,7,17 March 2009
Parasite," Fiercely Original
","One of the things I liked about the film '12 Years a Slave' was that it punctured the idea of the 'happy slave.' Some slaves had the luck to experience better living conditions than others, but none of them was ever allowed to forget that they were property. If they had a 'nice' master, they might smile and exchange pleasantries, but the seething resentment of having a master in the first place never went away.A variation on the 'happy slave' concept still exists in the world of today, I think, but it's been transferred to the serving class. There's this pervasive notion that those who struggle economically are happy just to be employed by those who have more. Maids, nannies, chauffeurs, doormen -- what do they exist for but to make life more convenient for the wealthy, and as long as they're well treated and paid for their efforts, what do they have to complain about?This dynamic is explored explosively in 'Parasite.' It's almost impossible to talk about the film without revealing its secrets, and this is one film that works best the less you know about it. It's funny, scary, suspenseful, sad, sometimes all at the same time. It's playful, yet serious. Director Bong Joon Ho clearly has a ball playing with genres and constantly upending our expectations. The fun of this movie is never knowing where it's going to go next. It creates a metaphor for the increasing divide between the haves and have nots in Korea specifically but the world in general by presenting us with a filthy rich family that remains blithely unaware of those who, in their eyes, exist to do things for them, even when those people are (literally) right under their feet. There aren't good guys or bad guys, heroes or villains. At times you despise everyone in the movie, at other times you feel compassion for almost all of them. It's a movie that is many things at once and refuses to be categorized, and as a result it looks much like our modern world.Grade: A",9,3,13,23 October 2019
Music and Lyrics," Fairly Lame and Pretty Dull
","The word 'innocuous' was invented to describe movies like this.Hugh Grant plays an 80s pop star has-been who has the chance to write a song for a hip young music star and perform it with her at an upcoming concert at Madison Square Garden. The thing is, you see, he can only write catchy music, but he sucks at writing lyrics. If only someone could drop into his life out of nowhere with a knack for song-writing, all would be hunky-dory. Lo and behold, Drew Barrymore drops in, in the guise of a neurotic disaster who shows up to take care of his plants, and an unlikely song-writing duo is born.'Music and Lyrics' is so formulaic that even the actors seem bored with it. Of course Barrymore must be persuaded that she can write lyrics even though she swears that she can't. Of course the two must get in a fight and go their separate ways, only to get back together in time for a big finale. Of course, Grant must declare his love for Barrymore by writing a song -- lyrics and all -- for her, proving to her how much she means to him. Meanwhile, nothing about the movie is especially funny, yet neither is anything egregiously bad. It's just THERE, and I guess that's one of my biggest complaints about it.And is anyone but me weirded out by the age difference between Grant and Barrymore? Couldn't a funny, interesting movie have been made from the same premise without making them romantically involved? But that would have taken a bit more imagination on the part of the screenwriters, and really, who can be bothered when there's money to be made off of something we've seen ad nauseum before? The best parts of the movie are the opening and closing credits, that feature a mock music video from Grant's 80s band. It's hilarious, and proves that the 80s can't really be parodied because they were a parody to begin with.Don't spend $10 on this. Rent it instead.Grade: C",5,2,5,26 February 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The Theatah, the Theatah, What Happened to the Theatah?
","While watching 'Birdman,' the latest from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ('Babel,' 'Amores Perros,' '21 Grams') I felt an admiration and respect for it that never bubbled over into emotional involvement. The acting is superb, and Inarritu chooses to film his story in what appears to be one fluid shot; there are no cuts in the film, and instead master cinematographer Emanuel Lubezki (currently the best one in the business as far as I'm concerned) sends his camera swooping around the rooms and hallways of New York's St. James Theatre, where most of the action of the film is set. So I noticed and admired the formal aspects of the film, but didn't connect with it on any meaningful level.But as time has passed since I saw it, the film has lingered in my head and gathered a richness I didn't feel like it had when I first left the theatre. I'm still not sure it will be one of my favorite movies of the year, but I can say I really really liked it, and I certainly liked it much more than any of Inarritu's previous movies.In 'Birdman,' Michael Keaton gives a just-shy-of-excellent performance as a washed up actor best known for a superhero series who's trying to prove something to himself and everyone else by mounting a Broadway play. The fiction of the play blends in with the facts of life, and the seamlessness of the actual filmmaking adds to the ambiguity of the story. I've always liked Keaton, and I'm not surprised to find that he has dramatic abilities as an actor that haven't been tapped before (or at least not frequently; he did expand his range in 'Clean and Sober'). But he's still somewhat limited as an actor, and I can't help but feel that a better actor, someone like Christian Bale, say, who could lose himself so completely into a character, would have made 'Birdman' overall a richer experience. After all, we're with Keaton's character almost non-stop for the entire film, so he has to be played not only by an actor who you want to be with for that much time (which Keaton is) but also who can keep you interested for the entire time (which Keaton does only partly successfully). The problem is, and this is a huge compliment to the casting director, the actors around Keaton are so good that they overwhelm him, and I found myself wanting to follow them rather than stay with Keaton. Particularly good are Edward Norton as a cocky actor, and Emma Stone as Keaton's surly daughter. Naomi Watts is always good, even if she's underused here as another member of the acting company, while Amy Ryan is excellent as usual in a couple of scenes as Keaton's ex-wife.'Birdman' explores some interesting themes, chiefly the need in humans to feel relevant and how social media has changed the way people go about doing that; and more specifically to the entertainment industry the dynamic between Hollywood and the legitimate stage. But neither theme is as developed as I would have liked.Still, if I don't end the year thinking that 'Birdman' is one of my favorites, I will at least probably think it's one of the most original.Grade: A-",9,4,11,7 December 2014
The Big Short," Irritating Movie That Thinks Its Audience Is Dumb
","'The Big Short' takes a fascinating subject (the collapse of the real estate market that instigated the global economic collapse and recession in 2008) and then spends its entire running time apologizing for boring its audience. It tells the viewer early on that ordinary folk like us (the audience) and the bros who made the movie don't understand any of that stuff anyway, so they're going to make it interesting. Interesting means we get shots of Margot Robbie sipping champagne in a hot tub while she explains some economic term to us. Despite the filmmakers' attempts to make themselves one with the audience, the tone of the movie is ingratiating and condescending, and the whole thing is annoying to the extreme.It's not like this subject matter hasn't been addressed before. The film 'Margin Call' was about something very similar, but it managed to present the material straight and as if it really mattered without making its audience feel like dunces. 'The Big Short' tells us here and there that the economic collapse was devastating to average people around the world, but it treats it mostly like a joke. It's like 'Wolf of Wall Street' lite. And it commits what for me is the ultimate movie sin -- it telegraphs to us in flashing neon every emotion we're supposed to be filling at any given moment, never once giving us the opportunity to react ourselves.The cast is pretty good, but they're asked to do things like pause and speak directly into the camera, the effectiveness of their performances hampered by poor directorial choices. Steve Carrell and Christian Bale are the standouts. Ryan Gosling suffers the most from the film's jokey tone. And Brad Pitt once again uses his producer credentials to insert himself into a film as the character who gets to lecture someone in the movie (and by extension the audience) about the moral ramifications of whatever the film's topic happens to be.I would rather have just watched a documentary about the housing collapse. It might have given me more credit for having a brain in my head.Grade: B-",6,0,0,24 January 2016
The Conjuring," When Too Much Hype Happens to a Decent Movie
","The nearly rapturous reviews from critics who I normally trust touting this as one of the scariest movies they'd ever seen had my expectations high. What a let down it was, then, when I actually saw the film.'The Conjuring' does have some satisfyingly creepy moments, especially in its first half hour when we start to get only inklings of something evil lurking in a haunted house. But director James Wan, whose claim to fame is launching the 'Saw' franchise, is far too literal and gives his audience far too little credit for having imaginations to sustain that creepiness across the length of the entire film. Instead, he decides to go all out, resorting to shock scares, special effects and histrionics, resulting in a climax that's more chaotic than it is scary. An exorcism that comprises most of the film's final moments is especially silly.Vera Farmiga, as a paranormal expert, stands out as the film's best asset, using her considerable talents as an actress to make far more out of a stock horror movie role than the film probably deserves.Grade: B-",6,3,8,4 December 2013
Platoon," The First of Many Oliver Stone Onslaughts
","So began the string of films with which Oliver Stone would assault our senses and earn him some of the most undeserved accolades in film history.'Platoon' is probably one of his stronger films, but it doesn't hold up well. At the time, it was notable for its authenticity in depicting the life of a Vietnam grunt, and I certainly want to be sensitive to anyone who served in Vietnam and has an appreciation for this movie because of it. But the movie itself is hopelessly overwrought and reeks of Stone's sledgehammer style of film-making. He can't allow emotions to speak for themselves, so he asks slow motion shots and thundering music to do the work instead. And there was enough material for a movie about Vietnam already without his having to concoct the ridiculous rivalry plot he cooks up for Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe to play out, both of them seemingly transplanted straight from the jungles of 'Apocalypse Now'.Every time I hear that classical composition that plays over and over and over in this film I want to jab a fork into my eye.Grade: C+",5,11,24,6 May 2008
Prometheus," Don't Let Fanboys Convince You That You're Stupid if You Don't Like This Movie
","Wow, over 1300 user comments makes it seem almost pointless to add one more, but here are my thoughts (I'll keep them brief).To anyone who's a fan of the 'Alien' series, 'Prometheus' will probably supply some at least modest fun, as there are enough tie-ins to the earlier films to keep you engaged. To others, it might seem like an esoteric and obscure sci-fi film that fades instantly from memory after it's over.The slavering fanboys will have you believe this is the most profound movie ever made. It's not. The fact that it tries to be and fails is only one of its problems. It would have been much better if it had not tried quite so hard; the beauty of the first two 'Alien' movies is that neither had great ambitions to be anything other than fiendishly entertaining horror/action movies, and they both succeed tremendously on their terms. 'Prometheus' wants to be something more, but it plays like something conceived in great detail in Ridley Scott's head but only put down on film in vague outlines. There are all sorts of questions the movie raises that it doesn't answer. Fanboys will tell you that that's the sign of a brilliant movie and that you're a dolt if you can't answer the questions on your own. But there's a difference between purposeful ambiguity that serves a narrative purpose and ambiguity that results from bad writing. When you ask the audience to fill in too many blanks on their own, you're just being lazy.'Prometheus' seems like a good movie while you're watching it (though even then it really starts to fall apart in its second half), but the more you think about it later, the worse and worse it seems.Grade: B",6,129,235,27 June 2012
Halloween," THE Slasher Movie -- There's Never Been a Greater

This is the granddaddy of every slasher film made since, and there's never been another one to equal it (though the original 'Nightmare on Elm Street' comes close). Compared to its kissing cousin, 'Friday the 13th,' 'Halloween' practically looks like 'Citizen Kane.' The film is a testament to how much a limited budget can work to the advantage of the finished product, and how much can be accomplished through creative camera work, lighting and imagination, not to mention one of the most memorable film scores ever written.The current breed of horror directors that equate gory carnage with scares should watch 'Halloween' and take note -- there's barely a drop of blood in the entire movie, yet it's scary as hell.Grade: A+",10,2,5,30 October 2007
Paths of Glory," A Brilliant Indictment of the Military Institution
","Before indulging in the ponderousness that could mar his otherwise exceptional later films, Stanley Kubrick directed this terse, no-nonsense account of a group of men tried for mutiny during the horrific trench warfare of World War I.'Paths of Glory' exists mainly as a scathing indictment of the bureaucracy behind the world's wars. The accused men in this film are scapegoats for commanders who failed at their own duties, but in the military, as in the world outside the military, the power resides with a few, and the masses have little power against them.Kirk Douglas delivers a fierce performance as an officer who sees the injustice and refuses to tolerate it. There's a throbbing human passion in the way he attacks the character, as there is throughout the entire film, somewhat rare for Kubrick, whose later movies would tend toward the emotionally detached.A surprisingly candid film for its time, 'Paths of Glory' would be tough medicine for people to swallow today, when everyone wants to believe that the military establishment has nothing but our best interests at heart. The film suggests that soldiers have as much to fear from their allies within as they do their enemies without.Grade: A+",10,0,0,5 September 2006

Carrie," Stephen King's First Novel Makes It to the Big Screen
","Brian De Palma's assured adaptation of Stephen King's first novel does the book justice, but it falls short of a horror classic for me.Actually, this is one of those movies that maybe really wouldn't even be remembered today if it had not had the luck of casting an actress as good as Sissy Spacek in the title role, who finds things to do with the character that a lesser actress wouldn't have. It's also notable for showcasing John Travolta on the cusp of stardom. And Piper Laurie, who hadn't been seen by movie audiences since her appearance in 'The Hustler' fifteen years earlier, pops up as a whacked out religious nutjob who would give Faye Dunaway's Joan Crawford a run for her money as worst movie mom ever.De Palma uses funky split screens to stage the film's big set piece, the prom in which Carrie lets her telekinetic powers loose on her tormentors. The device looks hopelessly dated today, but yet somehow works well in context and makes the scene more disturbing than it otherwise might have been.Grade: B",6,0,6,28 August 2007
Marriage Story," Career Best
","Writer/director Noah Baumbach delivers a career best in this funny, sad, infuriating, heartbreaking story about the dissolution of a marriage. Adam Driver is proving himself to be one of the best actors of his generation, and I've long thought that Scarlett Johansson was underappreciated. Both get a chance to shine in this film, along with supporting players Laura Dern, Alan Alda, and Ray Liotta, all three playing divorce attorneys of varying stripes. The film is about how the machine of divorce tramples over those who have the best intentions, and about the near impossibility of remaining civil when the system benefits from people acting like savages.I wasn't prepared for the film to be as funny as it is at times, which makes its poignant moments all the more affecting by comparison. The script is full of memorable set pieces, all of them brilliantly acted. Such as the miserably depressing one that finds Driver's dad determined to take his son trick-or-treating in L.A. Or a jaw dropping argument between Driver and Johansson that ends in both saying the kinds of things that would alter a relationship forever. Or the incredibly cringey scene where a case worker visits Driver's apartment to observe his parenting skills and ends with him blood soaked and fainting on the kitchen floor. Or the moment toward the end when Driver breaks into an impromptu performance of the song 'Being Alive' at a New York bar, and which confirmed my belief that there's a Stephen Sondheim song for literally every life event that perfectly articulates what it's like to go through it.'Marriage Story' is easily one of the best movies of the year.Grade: A+",10,5,10,17 December 2019
The Queen," A Tour de Force for Helen Mirren in a Film That Deserves Her
","I was in college when Princess Diana died in a sensational car accident, brought about by a flock of determined paparazzi. To be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to the events going on across the pond. I was really no more than a child for much of the time that Diana was capturing the imagination of the American people, so I didn't fully understand her allure, and I certainly didn't understand, or care much, about the politics of the royal family.So watching 'The Queen,' Stephen Frears' wonderfully fluid account of the few days following the death of Di and its impact on the royal family, I had the uneasy feeling one gets when he realizes that something of extreme cultural importance has happened right under his nose without his realizing it. I had much the same feeling during 'Hotel Rwanda.' It's the 'I didn't realize all of THAT was going on' experience.I don't know how accurate 'The Queen' is, and I don't know that anyone save Her Majesty herself could know for sure. Certainly it's an awfully one-sided movie. In Frears' version of events, Tony Blair single-handedly saves the monarchy from the vitriol of the British people. It's only through his dogged determination that Elizabeth grudgingly lets go of her royal principles and gives the people what they need -- that is, a sign that the royal family is comprised of a group of people with actual blood in their veins and feelings in their hearts. Michael Sheen, an unfamiliar actor to me, plays Blair beautifully; his performance goes beyond mere mimicry and conveys both the exhilaration and overwhelming sense of responsibility felt by a man who happens to find himself in a job for which he happens to be perfectly suited at one of the most critical moments in his country's history.But though everything is greatly slanted toward Blair, the film does a good job of cluing us in to Elizabeth's point of view as well. Here's a lady who inherited a job she did not choose, and who by the very nature of that job is turned into a media spectacle against her will. It's important to remember that during the moments when her and her family's callousness toward Diana and her death borders on the inhuman; in their minds, Diana played a large role in her own death, and payed a fair price for the stardom she received in return. In Elizabeth's mind, the way the British people behave smacks of hypocrisy; they cry out for blood for the media that caused Diana's death, yet want to hang the royal family for not putting themselves and their grief on display.Navigating the tricky waters of this tricky part is one of our greatest living actresses, Helen Mirren. Because I like her so much, it gives me great pleasure to say that her performance lives up to its hype. She gives what is so rare in films these days -- a tour de force of expert acting. Just watch her face and gestures throughout this film for the tiny nuances that speak volumes. Mirren has been buzzed about as the front-runner for this year's Oscar race since this movie opened, and for once I find the buzz completely justified. The Academy has a chance to show the world that it can, against all appearances to the contrary, recognize true art and talent when it sees it, so of course they'll probably botch things and give the award instead to a glamour puss who will look better on the cover of 'People' magazine. But Mirren I'm sure will be the winner in many people's hearts regardless.Frears keeps things moving along with quick editing and a fantastic, staccato score whose effectiveness rests on its judicial use. There's something disorienting yet exciting about watching a movie about people who are alive and well, and still serving in the same roles as their fictional selves on screen. In some ways, 'The Queen' feels like it should have come out last year, when a number of other relevant, terse and immensely engrossing films flooded the screens. Though if it had, it would have been one great film among many, whereas this year is has quickly risen to the cream of the crop. Grade: A",9,3,6,13 November 2006
1408," Now THAT's One Haunted Hotel
","This competent but ultimately overblown chiller stars John Cusack as an arrogant author who writes books about haunted hotels even though he doesn't believe in spooks. All of that changes when he spends a night in room 1408 in some upscale New York hotel and is confronted with the ghosts (literal and figurative) of a life he's tried hard to forget.Like much of Stephen King's stories, this one starts out effective and creepy, but it doesn't know when to quit, and the supernatural overwhelms the suspense. The scenes building up to the moment when Cusack actually enters the room are quite unnerving, especially a scene in which Cusack's character talks to the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson), who shares the hotel's history with him and begs him not to spend the night in that room. And even the first inklings of something amiss once he's in the room and his vigil has begun are creepy, precisely because of their banality: pictures that tilt on their own, a radio that won't stop playing a Carpenters song. But as the night progresses, the director and screenwriter feel obligated to pile one horror on top of the next, each more outrageous than the one before, so that the film devolves into nothing more than a marvel of effects and production design.John Cusack deserves a lot of credit, though, for his performance. He's in the movie virtually by himself, and most of the time has nothing but a set to interact with. It's a performance that really belongs in a better film.Grade: B-",6,1,1,23 October 2007
Raging Bull," Excellent Film? Yes. Scorsese's Masterpiece? No.
","I'm resistant to the many claims that 'Raging Bull' is Scorsese's masterpiece. It's certainly excellent, but I think at least two of Scorsese's films on either side of this one -- 'Taxi Driver' and 'King of Comedy' -- are better.Robert De Niro is truly impressive as Jake LaMotta, but, as so often happens with these biopics, the character he's given to play isn't all that interesting. Once he establishes that LaMotta was a boorish, abusive lout, the character has nowhere to go, and when I hear people praise De Niro's performance now, I almost always hear them talking about the weight he gained to play the role, not the performance itself. Joe Pesci gives the performance to watch in this film as La Motta's bullied little brother. He brings the film whatever emotional center it has. And Scorsese, who can sometimes do wonders with female characters, doesn't do so here; Cathy Moriarty's put-upon wife is window dressing.What the movie does do well is provide a pitch-perfect illustration of what the American dream is to some people and what they're willing to sacrifice on the way to attaining it, and it does so with sterling black and white cinematography and cracker jack editing from Scorsese's long-time collaborator, Thelma Schoonmaker.Grade: A-",8,2,5,5 December 2007
Shrek," The Fact That It's Been Copied Ad Nauseum Doesn't Diminish Its Freshness
","The fact that pretty much every animated film released now has a slangy and tongue-in-cheek sense of humor threatens to diminish somewhat the luster of 'Shrek,' but people should remember how fresh and inventive this film seemed at the time of its release. It offered a new kind of animated film for adults that even Pixar hadn't yet mastered (though Pixar's level of sophistication would soon skyrocket and leave the 'Shrek' films in the dust).Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and especially John Lithgow do terrific voice work, and the animation itself is stellar. 'Shrek' won the first ever Academy Award given specifically for an animated feature, besting Pixar's 'Monsters Inc.' Grade: A",8,1,2,27 July 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," Join an Old Friend for Dinner
","The FBI thriller to end all FBI thrillers.We can probably thank 'The Silence of the Lambs' for the plethora of CSI shows bombarding our T.V. screens today, but don't hold that against it. This is one of those films that I never tire of seeing, and I can't come across it on cable without stopping whatever it is I'm doing to watch it.'Lambs' came out of nowhere in 1991 as the big film of the year, and the fact that it won the top five Academy Awards has given it prestige. But to look back, it's amazing that this film was taken seriously enough to win big. It's brutal, violent and traffics in all manner of psychopathic nastiness, from cannibalism to sexual deviation. Jonathan Demme's direction is tight but by-the-book -- it's first and foremost a plot driven movie. But the film's ace card is the performance by Anthony Hopkins, who chose to play Hannibal Lecter as a suave and polite Englishman rather than a raving lunatic. His scenes with Jodie Foster, as FBI trainee Clarice Starling, are mesmerizing, and it was a brilliant choice on the part of the screenwriter (and this probably came from the book, though I haven't read it) to make the film, under its grisly surface, essentially about a love story.Foster's performance doesn't hold up well all these years later. She's mannered and unconvincing, especially later in the film as her character becomes more frantic. But Hopkins' creation remains one of the most memorable ever committed to the screen.Grade: A",9,1,2,18 November 2008
Vanilla Sky," You're Out of Your League, Cameron Crowe
","Writer/director Cameron Crowe let the Oscar he won the previous year for 'Almost Famous' go to his head and dives headlong into this narratively ambitious but mostly incomprehensible dream film.Crowe is out of his element, and in any case he would have needed better actors than Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz to pull this story off. About the best thing that can be said of it is that it has a pretty good title song, which brought Paul McCartney an Oscar nomination.Diaz generated quite a bit of Oscar buzz herself at the time, but for once the Academy made a wise decision and left her off the short list.Grade: C-",4,1,3,28 July 2010
Win Win," 'Win Win' Is a Winner
","An appealing film that manages to be feel-good while still allowing its audience to respect itself in the morning.Paul Giamatti plays a down-on-his-luck lawyer who takes under his wing the grandson of a mentally incompetent man (Burt Young) for whom he's become legal guardian. The grandson happens to be a great wrestler, much to Giamatti's happiness, since he coaches a high-school wrestling team on the side. But after initially winning the boy's affection, Giamatti must own up to some unpleasant truths, like the fact that he took guardianship of the boy's grandfather for the financial stipend he would receive while ignoring the grandfather's wishes to live in his own home instead of the senior care facility in which Giamatti places him. He becomes yet one more adult in the boy's life (his mother, who comes calling to claim him after being absentee, being another) who have disappointed him and made adulthood seem like something he should be reluctant to achieve himself.'Win Win' ends more patly and tidily than a situation like the one portrayed actually would in real life, but it's easy to forgive, because I'm a sucker for any movie about a person manning up and doing what is right when it would be so much easier to do what is wrong. The movie is casual and laid back, and the performances, from Giamatti, but also from Bobby Cannavale as Giamatti's friend and especially Amy Ryan, a scene stealer as Giamatti's wife, relaxed and charming. Writer and director Tom McCarthy, who made the equally fine 'The Station Agent' and 'The Visitor,' adds another quality notch to his belt.Grade: A",8,1,1,28 January 2012
Black Panther," Yep, Just Another Super Hero Movie
","I violated my own embargo on super hero movies in order to finally see what all the fuss was about.You see, I had decided never to watch another super hero movie because....well, because they all suck. But praise for 'Black Panther' was over the moon, and people were specifically saying that it broke the super hero mold and gave us something unique and reflective of our times. To which I say....'Nope.' This is just another super hero movie, and it follows all of the safe, bland super hero movie conventions.I do appreciate that the film is driven by African American characters and themes, because Lord knows if any genre needed a dose of color (or estrogen for that matter), the super hero genre was it. And I also appreciate how the film uses a super hero movie setting to explore questions of black identity in the larger world. But folks are giving it way too much credit. I was actually shocked by how poorly directed the film was, especially the climactic battle scenes, a hot mess if ever there was one, and how terrible the visual effects were. The film looks incredibly cheap.And it's all just so silly, which is how I feel about all super hero movies. In super hero world, everyone wears ridiculous costumes and speaks in formal, portentous accents, and says things like 'vibranium' with a straight face. This movie, like others of its ilk, would do well to plant its tongue a bit more firmly in cheek. No, 'Black Panther' benefited from timing. It was the movie people needed in the cultural moment, and I think audiences were seeing what they wanted to see in it whether it was really there or not. But divorced from that specific cultural moment, the film doesn't seem like anything special. Grade: B",7,3,5,20 September 2018
Iron Man," Downey, Jr. Creates an Inspired Superhero
","In much the same way that Ron Perlman's inspired performance made 'Hellboy' better than it would otherwise have been, Robert Downey, Jr. helps 'Iron Man' be something beyond the standard superhero junk fests that become popular every year around this time. Downey is perfectly cast, though I never would have thought of him for the character he plays here, tycoon of a weapons manufacturing company who suffers pangs of conscience after seeing what his terrible weapons can do, and turns himself into the ultimate weapon so that he can stop others from using them.Gwyneth Paltrow is Downey's assistant and love interest, and it's a bit of a shame to see such a smart actress stuck with such a dud role as this. She stands around in heels and looks worried while Downey tries to save her.Jeff Bridges, shaved bald and sporting a bushy beard, is the movie's villain, and if the movie has a major failing, it's him. Bridges is fine in the role, but the villain himself isn't particularly menacing, and the final showdown is anticlimactic.Be sure to sit through the end credits for a brief scene that promises a sequel.Grade: A-",7,1,2,13 May 2008
Mother!," Hot Mess
","Apparently I'm a moron, because I was supposed to see in 'Mother!', Darren Aronofsky's latest exercise in hysteria, a Biblical parable taking us from Adam and Eve all the way through the apocalypse, with some commentary about climate change and Man's destruction of the Earth thrown in for good measure. I of course got the general Biblical vibe because it's pretty hard to miss, but I didn't take it quite so literally as a retelling of the Bible from A to Z, because how boring. Like what we really need is yet another retelling of a Biblical anything.Though it shouldn't have surprised me, because this is the man who gave us a whackadoodle version of Noah's ark. I liked that one, because who doesn't want to think that the orcs from 'Lord of the Rings' made an appearance in the Bible? But 'Mother!' is a big pile of hooey, and a deeply unpleasant one to experience at that. I wanted to like 'Mother!', because it's been so divisive and it's way more fun to see brilliance where other people miss the point. But I was left feeling like this movie is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying......well, we all know how that line ends don't we?The formidable talents of Jennifer Lawrence are wasted on a role that requires her to do nothing but run around getting increasingly annoyed that people are trashing her house. It's a repetitive performance in a repetitive movie that moves in fits and starts. Aronofsky runs out of ideas early on and decides that the way to add variety is to ratchet up the volume one notch at a time until everything crashes down in a flaming pile of carnage.So I missed the Adam and Eve thing, but I did have some other interpretations of the film. One of the most straightforward examines the subservient role a woman plays in a marriage, especially when married to an artist. Another seems to explore the futility in our troubled times of trying to keep the world out of our perfect and idealized versions of home and family. But really the movie exhausted me too much to put effort into following any of these interpretations through to their conclusions.Grade: D",3,5,7,21 January 2018
Mr. Holland's Opus," Saved By Richard Dreyfuss
","Long, soggy gag fest that is nevertheless watchable thanks to the Herculean efforts of Richard Dreyfuss in the title role to make the rampant sentimentality bearable.Dreyfuss plays a music teacher who has a son and then acts like an ass toward him because he was born deaf. Much mucusy Hallmark soul searching follows, with father and son of course reconciling before the movie's over. And boy does it take forever for the movie to be over; director Stephen Herek takes what should have been a small character study and expands it to bloated epic proportions.Much to do is made about the magnificent opus of the film's title, supposedly Mr. Holland's masterpiece. Needless to say, by the time you hear it at the movie's conclusion, you can't help but be hopelessly befuddled at how ordinary it sounds after the relentless build up.Grade: C+",5,2,5,12 May 2009
Monsters University," Not Classic Pixar, But Good for Kids
","'Monsters University' won't go down as a Pixar classic, but it's cute and diverting enough. Actually, I wasn't that big a fan of 'Monsters, Inc.,' so maybe I wasn't the target audience for this in the first place.Billy Crystal and John Goodman return as the voices of Mike and Sully, and this origins story explains how they meet, first hate each other, and then end up as the scaring duo at the center of the earlier film. Of the new characters, Helen Mirren makes the biggest impression as the dragon lady dean of the college, though I couldn't place her voice and had to wait until the end credits to see who it was.My one complaint with the film is that it goes on too long, long past the point where it feels like the story should be resolving itself. But this movie will always have a special place in my heart because it's the first movie I took my four-year-old boy to.Grade: B",6,0,0,28 June 2013
Ben-Hur," A Nearly Unwatchable Hollywood 'Classic'
","Hopeless.If you can endure Charlton Heston's painful attempts at 'serious' acting for nearly four(!) hours, you will ultimately be done in anyway by the film's sheer unwieldy clunkiness. It lumbers along under William Wyler's direction like a crippled elephant, coming alive in only a couple of places (the lauded chariot race scene, the sea battle sequence), only to ultimately collapse under its own self-important piety.I'm sure the creators of this film thought they were doing their audiences all sorts of favors by dazzling them with gigantic sets and crowd scenes. But really, their efforts backfire, because they make it futile for the actors to try and compete with the film's sheer physical size. Who can give a compelling performance when he/she's never filmed in anything more than medium close up? Watching this film is like watching a stage production from the eighteenth row.Movies like 'Ben-Hur' are the reason why people roll their eyes at the thought of watching a biblical epic. I'm not religious, but it's not the religious subject matter that turns me off from this film -- it's the way it's presented, the way it's performed and virtually everything else about it.Grade: D",2,27,82,20 September 2006
Casino Royale," A Bloody Good Show, Mr. Craig
","The charm of James Bond films have mostly eluded me over the course of my 31 years. In fact, I've only seen one other as far as I can recall ('Octopussy' -- and by the way, how did that movie ever get released with THAT title?) and I remember virtually nothing about it. I don't think I'm missing much. From the isolated moments I've been able to catch on T.V. here and there, Bond movies look pretty awful -- not, mind you, awful in the tongue-and-cheek, isn't-this-fun kind of way, but awful in the I-wonder-what-else-is-on-T.V.-right-now kind of way.Well, Daniel Craig may make me a Bond convert, at least for the next few films. 'Casino Royale' is a blast -- it's an action-packed adrenaline jolt of a movie, full of beautiful people and beautiful locales, and it's a testament to its ability to entertain that I didn't once look at my watch during its 144 minute running time.Daniel Craig looks like a bulldog, runs like the terminator, and has steely blue eyes that usually match the color of whatever body of water he happens to be standing in front of at the moment. The moment he appears on screen, you get the sense that he's out to quash once and for all all of the naysayers out there who assume that he'll make a lousy Bond. And boy does he. He could take on Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan at the same time with both hands tied behind his back. Sean Connery maybe would give him a run for his money, but I suspect Craig would still pummel him severely. As for his sex appeal, I'll leave that to the ladies to assess, but if my wife's reaction to Craig's entrance half way through the film in a tuxedo is any indication, he's not lacking in that department either.It's almost laughable how regressive these movies are. Women are treated as nothing more than objects to either seduce or save, and Bond usually refers to the lead female in this as nothing more than 'the girl.' I bet feminists hate James Bond.Grade: A-",8,4,10,27 November 2006
Toy Story 3," It's No Fun to Grow Up
","This delightful entry in the Pixar trilogy finds our familiar troupe of toys (led of course by Woody and Buzz Lightyear) despondent and adrift when they are donated to a day care facility instead of accompanying their friend and owner (Andy) to college. Most of the film details the toys' efforts to escape, but it's bookended by one of the most hilarious openings in film history and one of the most poignant and bittersweet endings.Our friends at Pixar as usual have their finger directly on the pulse of cultural currents, and it's not hard to read the toys' plight as an allegory for the very real jobless plight affecting so many Americans right now. But more than that, the film captures the happy/sad feeling of growing up and that sense you have when you're an adult that the world contains much less wonder than it did when you were a kid. The ending of this film nearly had me bawling, and I feel like bawling right now just writing about it.Grade: A",9,0,1,7 February 2011
Trainspotting," The First in a Long Line of Juvenile Films from a Juvenile Director
","Ugh.The first film that brought Danny Boyle to my attention, and I've been reeling ever since. Now that 'Slumdog Millionaire' is such a sensation, I'm afraid we have more Boyle to look forward to, even though every movie the man has made has been crap ('Sunshine' anyone?)'Trainspotting' is an unpleasant film about unpleasant people doing drugs, being criminals, trying to avoid the responsibilities that come with growing up and being an adult. It's not the movie's content that bothered me, since good movies can and have been made out of similar material; no, it's Boyle's directorial style, the belief that fast and flashy is good enough, and that substance isn't necessary if you've got nauseating scenes of people sticking their heads in toilets.Boyle is a juvenile director, so I'm not surprised he could relate to the characters in this film.Grade: D",3,7,18,16 June 2009
La Vie En Rose," Standard Biopic with a French Flair
","A fair biopic about French singer Edith Piaf.The film is more creative than the usual biopic, taking a nonlinear approach to the narrative and a stylized approach to the visual look, both characteristics I admired. However, it's also a rather confusing film at times, because the director doesn't always make it clear where we are in Piaf's life, and characters come and go without being properly introduced to the audience. Marion Cotillard does an admirable job with the role she's given, which is standard biopic stuff: abusive alcoholic, unlikable person, brilliant artist. The film looks stunning, but that somehow feels wrong for such a gritty story; you come away remembering costumes and sets more than any details about Piaf's life.Kudos to the makeup artist, who works miracles with Cotillard's physical appearance as Piaf physically disintegrates.Perfectly entertaining but nothing special.Grade: B+",7,2,6,22 January 2008

Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Speaking Catalan with Woody Allen
","Woody Allen's on a roll again.Three years ago he gave us 'Match Point,' a nearly perfect thriller that was unlike anything he'd done before, and last year he directed the under-appreciated 'Cassandra's Dream.' With 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona,' he's proved that this new artistic reawakening is more than a passing phase.Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) travel to Barcelona for a summer adventure. Vicky is treading water until she marries her fiancé. Cristina, a wilder spirit, is looking for love, or at least lust. Both become involved with a dashing Spanish artist (Javier Bardem) and find that the things they took for granted about themselves may not be true after all, and each leaves Barcelona a little less grounded than she was when she arrived.What makes so many Woody Allen films good is the same for this one. He understands both the dynamics of human emotions and the needs of effective drama, so if he's got even half-way decent actors in his movies the material is bound to succeed. In 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona,' he's got better than half-way decent actors. Rebecca Hall is probably the least known of the cast, but she makes one of the biggest impressions, and the movie is 'about' Vicky more than it is anyone. Johansson and Bardem are well cast and they act their parts well. But it's Penelope Cruz, who storms into the film at about the mid-way point as Bardem's unhinged ex-wife, who you'll most remember.'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' explores the differences between the way different people approach relationships. It's about the difference between those who are artists and those who are not, and it's also about the difference between Americans and Europeans. But it's never judgemental and it doesn't generalize. Every single character, even those with little screen time, is fully developed and respected by both Allen and the actors who play them. This one's a winner.Grade: A",9,4,12,9 September 2008
Sweet and Lowdown," Decent Woody Allen Film, But Not One of My Favorites
","Woody Allen's fictionalized 'documentary' about a famous jazz guitarist's rise and fall in Depression-era America.This plays out like one of those biopics about famous musicians that all blend into one another because of their sameness ('Ray,' 'Walk the Line'), the difference here being that Sean Penn's Emmet Ray is a fictional creation, and Allen is lampooning the very conventions that make those other movies so boring.Penn displays a gift for comedy he hadn't exercised since 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High,' while Samantha Morton made her first major appearance in front of movie audiences as his mute, long-suffering and ever-dependable wife.This isn't one of my favorite Allen comedies, but it's a pretty good movie.Grade: B",7,1,2,29 June 2010
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," All Hail Queen Blanchett
","A history lesson dumbed down so much that 7-year-olds could understand what's going on, 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' is nevertheless a wholeheartedly entertaining film. It reminded me of the fluffy, goofy historical epics Hollywood used to make back in the 1930s, when the emphasis was on romantic swooning rather than historical accuracy.Cate Blanchett could play a milk pail and keep me riveted, and she's dynamite once again as Elizabeth I, leading her country against the onslaught of the invading Spanish, who are intent on bringing the Inquisition to England. Blanchett is too good for material like this, but she gives it her all like a pro, and no amount of production design (and believe me, there's plenty to spare in this movie), could induce me to take my eyes off of her. Geoffrey Rush reprises his role as Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's right-hand man, but he's mostly relegated to the sidelines. Stepping up to front and center this time around is Clive Owen, who plays either explorer Walter Raleigh or Errol Flynn, I'm still not sure which. All I know is that by the end he's swinging on ropes like Douglas Fairbanks, carefully groomed chest hair blowing in the breeze, as the English navy takes its stand against the Spanish armada. Actually, the silent film reference could apply to the Spaniards as well -- they're so deliciously evil that you half expect them to start twirling their villainous mustaches. I hope all the Catholics out there have a good sense of humour.By the end, all attempts at realism have been swept aside, and the movie has descended into pure camp, Elizabeth practically calling down God's wrath to defeat the Spanish. And you know, Blanchett is such a good actress, I almost believe she COULD call down God's wrath if she wanted to. All I know is that when she shouts out the film's best line, 'My bitches wear my collars!' I sure as hell sat up and took notice.Grade: B+",7,0,2,6 November 2007
The Deer Hunter," A Superb, Sprawling Epic About the Psychological Toll of Vietnam
","Michael Cimino's Vietnam classic, a blistering, deeply disturbing epic about a small community of friends in a Pennsylvania factory town before, during and after serving in Vietnam.The film is structured as a sort of three-act tragedy: act one shows the group of friends (Robert De Niro, John Savage, Christopher Walken, John Cazale, George Dzundza) celebrating the wedding of one of their number (Savage) and then the hunting expedition they go on as a last hurrah before a few of them head off to Vietnam; act two shows De Niro, Walken and Savage struggling for survival in a Vietnamese prison camp, and includes the notorious scenes of forced Russian roulette that many remember the film for; act three follows up on the stories of these men as they return from war -- De Niro is haunted but able to get his life back together; Savage is a paraplegic; and Walken stays behind, a hollowed out zombie who disappears into the crime-ridden maze of post-war Saigon.Cimino films all of this with a meticulous eye for detail and arresting images -- indeed, much of the story is told through images alone, with long passages containing virtually no significant dialogue. It's a gut-wrenching and supremely affecting film, with one of the most quiet yet shattering endings I've ever seen.Also with Meryl Streep in an early role as the girlfriend Walken leaves behind.Grade: A+",10,0,1,18 October 2007
Jojo Rabbit," Succumbed to This Film's Charms
","So I didn't even really want to see 'Jojo Rabbit' that much based on the reviews, the kind of movie the reviews confirmed it to be, and my past experience with Taika Waititi's style. I thought it would be another Wes Anderson rip-off, and I wasn't in the mood for another 'aren't Nazis goofy?' comedy that tries to make light of the Holocaust by making Nazis look like buffoons (no thank you, 'Life Is Beautiful.')But the movie buff in me hates not having an opinion about movies that strike a chord with the public, and the Academy Award completist in me wasn't sure I could live with myself if I didn't see every movie nominated for Best Picture this year. So I sucked it up and bought a ticket.My 10 year old son is studying the Holocaust in school, and his class had recently gone to a Holocaust museum in the Chicago area, so I asked him if he wanted to see this movie with me. It was his first time attending a 'grown up' movie ('Star Wars' films aside, if those are considered to be grown up movies). He was clearly very proud to be attending a PG-13 movie with his dad, and the experience was made sweeter for him by the fact that his younger brother had to stay home (I couldn't tell from the parental advisory whether or not it would be appropriate for an 8 year old). So there I am watching a movie about a 10 year old boy sitting next to my 10 year old boy, and man did I get the feels. Everything people have criticized this movie for is true. It paints a very sanitized picture of Nazi Germany and downplays how awful it would have been to live it. The Holocaust is a vague spectre somewhere in the background, never overtly shown and never feeling like a serious threat. The message is big and obvious, the emotional manipulation rampant.But what the hell. I kind of fell in love with this movie because of who I was seeing it with, and I loved that it was about learning to differentiate between the world as certain people (relatives, the media, our government, you name it) want you to perceive it and the world as you actually experience it. Yes, I knew my heartstrings were being tugged, and me in a different mood would have had none of it. But me in the mood I was in was all 'oh, let my heartstrings be tugged.'I also have never picked a worse time to go to the bathroom during a movie in my entire movie watching career. I can't go into details without throwing in a major spoiler, but let's just say my son had to tell me what happened when I got back and I had to wonder if my absence during that critical moment would traumatize my son forever. But he was fine.Grade: A",8,0,2,27 January 2020
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Fantastic, Mr. Anderson
","This delightful animated film has Wes Anderson's fingerprints all over it, which is a great thing if you like his movies as much as I do.Present are the vague melancholy and yearning for something bigger and better that so many of Anderson's characters feel in so many of his movies. They're never completely happy, because they never know exactly what it is that will make them happy, a conundrum supremely identifiable for his audiences. But what might feel like tedious existential angst in the hands of some colder and more cerebral director never does with Anderson, because he fills his movies with warmth and wit.'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is beautiful to look at and has terrific voice work from big stars like George Clooney and Meryl Streep. But the standout is Anderson regular Jason Schwartzmann, as a young fox with serious inadequacy issues.'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is the best animated film I saw last year -- yes, better than 'Coraline' and 'Up.' Anderson has proved that Pixar need not claim a monopoly on worthy screen animation.Grade: A+",10,1,3,5 May 2010
Speed," One Bus That Doesn't Make Any of Its Stops
","Keanu Reeves has the uncanny ability to pop up in a legitimately good movie just often enough to keep people convinced that he may not be a completely worthless actor after all. 'Speed' became a big hit in 1994 against all expectations. It was meant to be a disposable genre film and instead became a blockbuster.It's the ultimate high-concept movie: a bus will blow up if it's not kept moving above a certain speed. You can imagine the results. Reeves is fine, as is Dennis Hopper, hamming it up as the villain, but the reason for the film's success is mostly due to Sandra Bullock (this may have been her debut?) as the plucky bus driver. Bullock is such a pleasing presence on film that even if the movie around her sucks, you keep watching just for her. Fortunately for us, the movie around her is pretty good too.Grade: A-",7,1,2,17 March 2009
Son of Saul," Brings Home the Waking Nightmare That Was Life in a Concentration Camp
","The sheer and utter depression of the Holocaust was not fully brought home to me until I read William Styron's 'Sophie's Choice.' Up to then, I had recognized the horror of it, the disbelief that humanity could sink to such depraved levels, the anger and sorrow inspired by stories of the victims. But more than anything while reading Styron's book, I was struck by how demoralizing the Holocaust was. It just may be the most singularly depressing event in human history, and what brought it home in that particular book is that Styron elaborated on the mechanization of it. These mass murders weren't being carried out in moments of anger, they weren't personal, they weren't the sick fantasy of one insane person's fevered brain. They were industrialized to the point that the humans being cycled through the camps were no different than cattle, and the people working the camps didn't think of them as anything different.'Son of Saul' is the first film about the Holocaust I've seen that captures that same sense of hopeless depression I found in Styron's book. The camera sticks close to the film's protagonist, Saul, as he wanders through the waking nightmare that is life inside the prison camps, numb to the human carnage that takes place around him as he persists in his singular obsession with finding a rabbi to bless the dead young boy he has convinced himself is his son and give him a proper burial. The futility of Saul's task asks the audience to consider: Is it a noble gesture of humanity to be respected, one small attempt to retain a grip on humanity in the absence of anything resembling it; or is it a selfish, self-centered obsession with the impractical when Saul could have been providing real assistance to the living who needed it? The film doesn't make judgements, and I certainly found as a viewer that I couldn't either. How on earth could anyone who hasn't himself lived through the same thing even begin to think he would know how he would act in a similar situation? Unlike the most high profile and famous films about the Holocaust ('Schindler's List,' 'The Pianist'), 'Son of Saul' doesn't even attempt to find a strain of hope or redemption in this story. It acknowledges what other artists who have tackled the Holocaust can't seem to bring themselves to admit, which is that there isn't even the slightest fragment of a happy ending to be found in an unspeakable moment of human history. I know why other artists can't acknowledge this -- it makes the senseless pain and human waste even that much more unbearable to contemplate. But it feels much more honest than those other films.This is a tough but excellent movie.Grade: A",9,0,4,17 May 2016
Amélie," A Parisian Fairy Tale
","A whimsical and -- yes -- delightful love letter to love and Paris.I should hate this movie, because it's always hyper aware of its own cutesiness and cleverness, but somehow it just works. It's visually stunning -- the production design and cinematography alone make it worth watching. But it benefits from lovable actors and a charming score, and much of it is very funny when it's not being sweet and poignant.Nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Foreign Language Film, but rather astoundingly won none of them.A real charmer.Grade: A",9,1,5,23 July 2010
Moonrise Kingdom," Oh to Be 11 Years Old Again (Would You Really Want To?)
","A delicate, effervescent and, above all, sweet film from the formidable cinematic imagination of Wes Anderson.A group of adults played by the likes of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton join forces (when they're not bickering with one another) to track down a pair of kids who have run off to be together. The film is about the pangs of adolescence and particularly the pangs of being labeled a 'troubled' adolescent by an adult world that seems to have forgotten that it was once young too. But it's also about the struggles of being an adult role model, wanting to give kids a good example but not always being sure how. The movie illustrates how exhilarating, rewarding, exhausting and -- let's face it -- outright terrifying it is to be a parent or a guardian.It's a beautiful film, one that anchors its facetious and sarcastic style with genuine and honest emotion. There are a couple of quite lovely moments, especially one between Frances McDormand and her daughter and another between Edward Norton's scout leader and one of the boys under his charge, that are tear inducing, but in a sweet, quiet way, not an obvious, shameless one.And it's amazing to both look at and listen to, with some knock your socks off music scored by Alexandre Desplat.Grade: A",9,1,3,28 November 2012
The Sixth Sense," A Movie to Watch Once
","'The Sixth Sense' is really a film to only be enjoyed once. It's an effective little ghost story with one of the most famous twist endings in history, but the film relies too much on that gimmick, and without it, it doesn't hold up all that well.The movie is a cut above others in its genre because it devotes a healthy amount of time to developing its characters, and Toni Collette, who plays the frazzled mother of a troubled little boy, invests the film with a tremendous amount of warmth and emotion it would otherwise lack.It's far and away M. Night Shyamalan's best movie, as his dependence on gimmicky storytelling and his inflated ego have resulted in progressively worse clunkers.Grade: B+",7,1,2,28 June 2010
The Producers," Don't Be Stupid, Be a Smarty, Come and Join the Nazi Party
","Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder aim Mel Brooks' bawdy jokes at the third balcony, and the result is one of the funniest movies ever made. As anyone who doesn't live under a rock by now knows, Mostel and Wilder play Max Bialystock, failing Broadway producer, and his hysterical accountant, Leo Bloom, respectively. When the two realize that they can make more money off a Broadway flop than they can with a hit, they set out to make the worst show ever made, and 'Springtime for Hitler' is born.The fun in 'The Producers' is watching Max and Leo assemble their team of show-biz disasters. Not since Dorothy skipped down the yellow brick road on the way to Oz has a more colorful assortment of characters been added one by one to a film's cast. There's the play's author Franz Liebkind, who spontaneously bursts into the Nazi anthem and whose plans include world domination; Ulla, the Swedish tease, whose hips move independently from her torso and who Max meets in the public library; Roger DeBris, who thinks the third act of the play 'has got to go' because the Nazis are losing the war; his 'assistant' Carmen Ghia, who slinks around wearing a pointy beard and a monocle and who enjoys (maybe too much) his ride in the elevator with Max and Leo; and last but not least, Lorenzo St. DuBois, also known as LSD, who sings perhaps the film's funniest song, 'Love Power,' while wearing furry thigh boots and finger cymbals and which ends with him breaking a banana in half and sticking his thumb in his mouth.The high point of the movie, of course, is the 'Springtime for Hitler' production number, that includes dancing girls dressed as pretzels and beer tankards and includes lines like 'We're marching to a faster pace/Look out, here comes the master race.' Just the shot of the audience watching the show, their mouths hanging open in dumbstruck shock at its awfulness, is alone worth sitting through the movie for.My only complaint with 'The Producers' is really a compliment, and it's that there's not enough of it. The whole movie has a sketch-comedy feel, and each supporting character gets really no more than a big scene or two. I really wanted more of Roger and Carmen, and more of LSD. And of course it would have been great if Brooks had filled out 'Springtime for Hitler' even more. Indeed, that number is such a show stopper that the movie deflates a bit after it's over and never quite recovers.This is easily Brooks' best film, and it's wonderful to see such an unapologetically in-your-face comedy work so well. It's crass and crude and silly, yet remarkably intelligent all at the same time. If you don't come away with at least a dozen lines to quote, you weren't paying attention.Grade: A+",10,0,1,21 December 2005
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," This Next Generation 'Star Wars' Can Be Proud of What It Is
","When 'The Phantom Menace' came out back in 1999, I had to deal with the dismal and sinking feeling of disappointment that hit me about ten minutes into the movie when I realized that my expectations were not going to be realized and that the movie was not going to come close to recreating 'Star Wars.' With time, I've learned to like the prequel movies for what they are, mostly because I think it's fun to see the story begun by George Lucas in 1977 come full circle. And also with time, I've made peace with the fact that nothing will ever recreate the experience of the original 'Star Wars' movies and nothing needs to; I will always have the originals and can watch then any time I want to, so I don't need substitutes.Therefore I went into 'The Force Awakens' with extremely low expectations, and as a result had a blast with it. It's laughable how much it rips off of 'A New Hope,' and now that the hype has died down it's easy to pick it apart, because in many ways it doesn't hold up to scrutiny. But I don't feel like picking it apart. I want to just enjoy it because it's part of the 'Star Wars' universe, and that universe is something I enjoy visiting from time to time. The film is really more of a reboot than a sequel, made for a generation of younger audiences who didn't grow up with 'Star Wars,' with plenty of bones thrown to the audience who did. And I have to admit, the fun in the movie for me was watching the original characters and ships make their entrances throughout the movie -- I'm not sure how compelling the movie featuring the new generation of actors would have been for me on its own terms, even though I like Oscar Isaac (underused) and thought Daisy Ridley did a fantastic job. That perhaps does not bode well for my enjoyment of the next movie in the series, since the novelty will be gone. But for now, there's a new 'Star Wars' movie, it's not bad, and that's good enough for me.Grade: A",8,7,40,3 January 2016
Cinderella," A Dull But Still Popular Disney Effort
","This bland, tepid Disney cartoon remains one of the most popular animated films produced by the studio, but it has none of the visual artistry that distinguished the Disney style in its early days in films like 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' 'Pinocchio' and 'Fantasia.' 'Cinderella' acts as more of a transition to the family-oriented Disney of today, that sacrifices artistry and content for popularity and merchandising opportunities.And, to top it all off, 'Cinderella' has one of the most annoying soundtracks of any Disney film.

Flight," Recommended on the Basis of Denzel Washington's Performance Alone
","Based on the trailers for 'Flight,' I was expecting a investigative procedural film. Denzel Washington plays a pilot who manages to crash land a plane with a minimal loss of lives, a feat everyone agrees no other pilot could probably accomplish. But evidence that he was intoxicated while flying the plane emerges and instead of a hero who saved lives, he becomes a possible felon who caused the crash in the first place.But the film isn't interested in the investigation. Instead, this is a film about an alcoholic and the rock-bottom journey he goes on that leads him to face his addictive demons. I've never been a huge Washington fan, but he does pretty tremendous work here. This also feels like surprisingly grown-up material for director Robert Zemeckis, who's most known for treacly stuff like 'Forrest Gump.' My major complaint about the film is that it's far too long. An entire subplot that gives Washington a nominal love interest in the form of a fellow addict could have been cut from the film entirely -- and a good half hour with it -- without any significant impact.I don't know that I would heartily recommend this film for any reason other than the excellent performance of Washington.Grade: B+",7,4,7,19 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," It All Ends -- And Not a Horcrux Too Soon
","So the whole damn 'Harry Potter' thing finally ends, only to leave me wondering: if Professor McGonagall could shoot fire out of her wand and muster up a whole army of suited knights all along, why didn't she do it a whole hell of a lot sooner? And there lies my problem with the entire movie series. If you didn't read the books, which I didn't, you don't understand the story's logic half the time. Apparently it's all well explained by J.K. Rowling, but if so, the filmmakers did a bad job of transferring her explanations to the screen.All of the movies suffer from laziness, and 'Deathly Hallows Part 2,' while much better, almost by default, than 'Deathly Hallows Part 1,' is no exception. It assumes that the series' die-hard fans will fill in the blanks the filmmakers are too bored to fill in for us, so key moments, like the standoff between McGonagall and Snape, or the one between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix LeStrange, just sit there on the screen instead of causing us to leap to our feet in excitement.Let's just say I'm looking forward to reading the books with my sons when they're old enough. Maybe then the whole story will make more sense.Grade: B",6,1,1,6 December 2011
Rear Window," THE Ultimate Hitchcock Movie
","'Rear Window' represents Alfred Hitchcock at his most playful.This is Hitchcock's most fully realized comment about the obsession with voyeurism that reared its head repeatedly throughout his ouvre, an obsession not only of his, but one shared by the characters in his films and the audience watching them -- for without the delight that comes in watching other people, who would filmmakers be making films for? 'Rear Window' is a nearly perfect movie: perfectly plotted, perfectly directed, perfectly acted. James Stewart could play characters like this in his sleep, but that fact does not make his performance any less entertaining. Some of the ice melts off of Grace Kelly's facade, and she gives the wittiest and sexiest performance of her career. And who can say enough about Thelma Ritter? A truly unique character actor in the history of cinema, Ritter always played the audience's id, thinking and saying all of the things all of the other characters in the film were too polite or nervous to think and say themselves. She could recite a weather forecast in that sardonic, world-weary monotone of hers, and it would still be funny.Hitchcock was always able to blend suspense, romance and social commentary to varying degrees of success, but almost always better than most other directors could manage. 'Rear Window' stands as an example of what happened when he struck a perfect balance between all three.Grade: A+",10,1,4,19 July 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Oh for God's Sake, End Already!
","Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy is a monumental achievement, I won't argue with that. The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration.But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there.After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough. I think it says something about your endeavor when the most interesting character in the film is the one who's computer animated.The person who really deserves the most credit for this trilogy is its editor(s), who had to take god knows how many hours of footage and shape it into something resembling a movie.Grade: B",7,3,5,23 July 2010
Munich," Obvious Drama with Very Little Impact
","At the beginning of his career, Steven Spielberg had an almost perverse desire to entertain his audiences. As a result, we were spellbound by his movies. Then he decided that he was going to make movies that were 'good' for people, and he produced dreadful stuff like 'Amistad.' Lately, he's been trying to merge the two approaches to storytelling, and his movies have suffered for it. His pure entertainments, like 'War of the Worlds,' haven't been particularly entertaining, and his message movies, like 'Saving Private Ryan,' have been short on message.'Munich' is further proof that Spielberg is just not an especially intelligent director. He wants to thrill us with a cloak and dagger story even while he's preaching to us. The problem is this: the thriller parts of 'Munich' undercut the seriousness of the topic, yet they're the only really entertaining moments of the film. Tony Kushner has written a clunky screenplay that jars to a halt every twenty minutes or so to discuss the moral crisis at the center of the movie as if we've been invited to sit in on a civics class, rather than letting the crisis evolve naturally from the material or allowing the audience to do any of the work for itself, which it is entirely capable of doing. And the action movie sections, while admittedly exciting, are manipulative and reek of classic Spielberg. He just can't resist the pull of emotional bombast and resorts to cheap tricks in order to build suspense. For instance, in a scene in which the team of Israeli assassins has rigged one of their target's phones to blow up when it is answered, he goes out of his way to introduce a child into the scene to heighten the tension; however, Spielberg is so predictable that we know a child will never die so aimlessly in one of his films. A truly original director would have made that scene suspenseful without pandering to our base emotions. And late in the film, during a scene in which Avner, the lead assassin, is making love to his wife while images of what happened to the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics flash through his head, Spielberg's histrionics derail the movie altogether into pure camp. Never mind that Avner couldn't possibly be remembering what happened since he never actually witnessed the events in the first place--at a moment when the film should be gripping, it's instead ridiculous.The movie has a terrific look, and reminded me of those gritty paranoid films from the early seventies, like 'The French Connection' and 'The Conversation.' Indeed, the look of the film and the skill with which it's put together will give people the illusion that's it a more important film than it really is, and will likely get it nominated for a buttload of Oscars. But in a year of such great movies that have already covered much of the same ground, 'Munich' seems even further away from being an important film than it might in a more mediocre year. 'A History of Violence' pretty much had the final word on the cyclical nature of violence and how it eventually degrades human morality; and Steven Gaghan showed with 'Syriana' that a political thriller can be intelligent and exciting all at the same time.I was impressed with Eric Bana, mostly because I've only seen him in 'Hulk' and 'Troy' and since those two movies don't comprise the world's most stunning acting resume, I was pleasantly surprised that he has quite a bit of skill. One senses that he didn't need Spielberg and company to stop the proceedings for the periodic lectures they wedge into the film; he could have done just fine on his own. And no other actors really get much of a chance to develop characters we care about, which has always been and probably always will be a weakness in any Spielberg movie.I'm not Jewish or Palestinian, so I think I can speak pretty objectively to the fairness with which Spielberg approaches the topic. He makes an admirable attempt to address both sides, but the film's sympathies obviously lie with the Jews, and there a few moments when it takes on a self-righteous tone that threatens to tip the balance. However, Spielberg is Jewish, so I could easily excuse this.There's a haunting, powerful film to be made from the events detailed in this film, but 'Munich' isn't it.Grade: B-",6,3,9,2 January 2006
Pitch Perfect," Anna Kendrick Is My New Crush
","'Pitch Perfect' may not be the kind of movie that will change anyone's life, but it did push me a little bit further into falling in love with Anna Kendrick.She plays a bit of a loner who gets involved in her college's acapella group (the members put 'aca' in front of all their adjectives, like 'acamazing' and 'acaxcuseme?') and has to fight the group's uptight leader to freshen up their act in the hopes of winning a big annual tournament. The screenplay is completely by the numbers, and you can call out the film's plot developments three scenes before they happen. But if it's lazy in the categories of character development and dramatic tension, it does have a knack for one-liners, and the jokes come fast and furious, keeping things moving along nicely. Kendrick is an absolutely winning and adorable presence, and the film ably pokes fun at acapella groups while paying tribute to them at the same time. It does for acapella what 'Miss Congeniality' did for beauty pageants.Grade: A-",7,1,3,10 September 2013
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Still Very Frightening
","Wes Craven's horror classic holds up remarkably well, and remains a truly scary movie.Freddy was always a more chilling villain than Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees. Whereas the other two went about their ritualistic killings like zoned-out zombies, Freddy delights in his, and enjoys the fear his victims feel as he toys with them before he murders them as much as he enjoys the murders themselves. And he's just physically scarier as well: he runs, darts around, can pop up anywhere as anything.Wes Craven's genius in this entire series was the plot hook that has Freddy only able to murder in his victims' dreams. This allows Craven fantastic, surreal set pieces, that really do manage to capture the feelings that nightmares have in actuality.One of the best in the horror genre.Grade: A-",7,0,1,14 April 2006

Director Peter Weir finds a way to use Carrey's exaggerated comedic mannerisms in context of a real character rather than a caricature, and Carrey does well with the material. It's not hard to read 'The Truman Show' as an allegory for the fate that befalls famous people when their private lives become public domain.The film also stars Ed Harris as a god figure (in other words, a director) and Laura Linney in one of the first roles that began to establish her as a recognizable face.Grade: A-",8,1,2,21 June 2010

'The Matrix' is like 'Pulp Fiction' -- in many ways, it defined the culture of its time and has had a major impact on everything since. And it's also in the same league as films like '2001: A Space Odyssey,' 'Terminator 2' and 'Jurassic Park' that redefined what movie special effects could do.The first sequel was incomprehensible and I haven't (and probably won't) see the third film, but I like this one.Grade: A",9,0,1,30 June 2010
Looper," Strong Message Was Enough to Make Me Overlook Numerous Plot Weaknesses
","This time travel sci-fi thriller is one of those movies that instantly begins to unravel if you start pulling at its plot strings, but if you're willing to just accept certain things as presented without questioning them too much, it provides a lot of entertainment and a welcome message about the role strong parenting can play in helping children navigate the journey into adulthood.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of the best young actors currently working, and he gives a terrific performance here even under heaps of makeup designed to make him look like a young Bruce Willis. Willis is the adult version come back from the future to be bumped off by himself, in some strange system of hit men established and run by a mysterious crime lord living in a near-future world. Why on earth the system would have people sent back to be killed by themselves in the first place is only one of the first wonky plot devices that it's best not to think too hard about. The wrinkle in this particular plan is that Gordon-Levitt can't kill himself, his older self gets away, and Gordon-Levitt must track him down before he kills the child who will grow up to become the aforementioned crime lord who will ultimately be responsible for his (Willis's, and by extension, Gordon-Levitt's) death and the death of his beloved future wife. Are you following? If not, don't worry. It all makes sense, or mostly does, while watching the movie. The best storyline in the film is that of Emily Blunt's, who plays the mother of the kid who will turn into the evil crime lord responsible for the bleakness of the future world. It's her character that understands the need to intervene as a parent and that with strong guidance someone who might have tendencies to turn into something bad need not necessarily take that path. Gordon-Levitt's character comes to that realization too, and takes action to stop the endless cycle of violence and destruction that this looping system has created. The ending provides an emotional payoff that makes the grimness and violence of what precedes it worth sitting through.A strong film for its genre.Grade: A-",8,0,1,10 February 2013
Casino," Maybe It's Warmed Over 'GoodFellas,' But Left Overs Can Be Good Too
","At the time, people largely dismissed 'Casino' as a re-tread of 'GoodFellas.' Consensus was that Martin Scorsese had done it all before and done it better.There may be some truth to that claim, but 'Casino' is still one hell of a wild ride, and it's impulsively watchable.Just as 'GoodFellas' had nearly documentary-like segments devoted to the details of Mafia life, 'Casino' takes the viewer behind the scenes of the gambling industry, and it's fascinating.The cast is uniformly fine. Sure, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are good in typical Scorsese-movie roles, but the standouts are Sharon Stone and James Woods as a loose cannon wife and a sleazy lover, respectively.Grade: A",8,1,2,12 May 2009
Life," Solidly Entertaining Horror Sci-Fi
","Had I not seen 'Life' the same weekend that I also watched 'Alien: Covenant,' I might have dismissed it as a cheap 'Alien' rip-off. But because 'Alien: Covenant' was such a dirty piece of cinematic toilet paper, I ironically ended up liking 'Life' more than I might otherwise have for coming much closer to giving me the experience of watching an 'Alien' movie than an actual 'Alien' movie did.'Life' has modest ambitions and meets them admirably, thanks to competent direction, a pretty decent set of actors, and a system of internal logic that follows its own rules. I have no idea how realistically scientific the movie is and don't much care, but the things that happen make sense within the context of the movie, and that's what matters to me. There are some truly disturbing moments -- like one where the alien life form kills off a major character early on by eating him from the inside, or another in which a crew member drowns in her own space helmet -- and the film is paced well. Its twist ending is handled a bit awkwardly and doesn't have as much impact as the filmmaker I think wanted it to have, but overall this is a solidly entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.Grade: B+",7,2,3,7 September 2017

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The Boy Who Loved 'Star Wars'
","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original 'Star Wars' film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first 'Star Wars' themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review 'Star Wars' as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to 'Star Wars' and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Trek' but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+",10,0,2,2 December 2005
50_50," 50/50 Is a Pretty Good Way to Describe My Reaction to This Movie -- Half Liked It, Half Didn't
","'50/50' was marketed as a buddy movie, but those going into it with that expectation are bound to be disappointed.Seth Rogen does play best friend to Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a young man who's diagnosed with a rare and vicious type of cancer, but he has relatively little screen time and the film isn't about their relationship. Rather, it's about Gordon-Levitt's life and attitudes in general post-diagnosis, and the effect the possibility of his impending mortality has on his love life, relationship with his mother (Anjelica Huston), etc. I'm actually glad it steered clear of many of the 'young-person-dying' clichés that can make movies like this so dreary. But it's not an entirely successful movie either, aiming for a black comedy that the screenplay doesn't pull off. In fact, the writing is the film's biggest problem; too many scenes feel too implausible, and while I don't necessarily relish wallowing in grimness for grimness' sake, the ending felt entirely too happy and pat to be believable.On the other hand, the movie has some strong things to recommend it, notably the performances of Gordon-Levitt, one of the most talented and underrated young actors currently working, and Anna Kendrick, who delivers a sparkling turn as Gordon-Levitt's therapist.Grade: B",6,0,0,2 May 2012
Deadpool," A Gun Fetishist's Wet Dream
","'Deadpool' was billed as a superhero movie for adults. I was skeptical about that claim, because I'm still not convinced that those two terms aren't mutually exclusive. I've seen it now, and as near as I can tell, 'adult' really means that it's got a dirtier mouth and more graphic violence, which makes me despair a bit about the state of adulthood in America. But I will say that I enjoyed it much more than any superhero movie in recent memory, because it's actually funny and doesn't take itself seriously. But that's also fairly faint praise, because I've pretty much given up on superhero movies and can't even remember the last one I saw.Ryan Reynolds can be very funny, but he can also be very annoying, and he's about equal parts both in this film. The movie has a potty mouth that is mostly used to clever and witty effect, and some gratuitous nudity is always a-OK with me. But what kept me from really enjoying this film was the casual violence, much of it played for laughs. I guess this is where the 'adult' thing comes in, because I just can't find myself enjoying the gun fetishism in a movie like this. The actual gun problems in the real world are too immediate and too concerning to me to be able to relax into the fantasy of a movie like this, and my stomach curdles at the thought of the whooping and hollering that I have no doubt went on in audiences of this film as the bullets and the blood flew.And though there was talk, however brief, about this film actually getting some Oscar attention, that talk was ridiculous. Nothing about this movie was that good.Grade: B-",6,3,7,6 February 2017

Several stories set over different time periods -- the oldest set in the mid-19th century, the latest set in an apocalyptic future -- are connected through works of art, mostly of the written word, created in each that are then consumed by characters in the other stories. For those of you who remember freshman English, the plot is much more important than the story. This is a book about big themes, not individual characters. It's a grand thing to read, and one of the best books I've read in recent memory.The movie boldly tries to be faithful to the book, which is an admirable ambition but also is its failing. There's simply too much to get through, and the film spends more time on telling the stories than developing the themes. It makes a valiant effort to include all the connections the book does, and I actually quite liked the end, which does bring everything together rather nicely, but I'd given up on the movie by then, which comes at you like a never-ending assortment of random scenes.A conceit the movie explores which wasn't available as an option for the book is having the same actors play various characters throughout the film. It's a good way to literally link the stories to one another. However, it just doesn't work. It's like a variation on 'Around the World in 80 Days,' where you're so distracted by trying to identify the actors that you forget to pay attention to the movie. It doesn't help that the makeup is rather awful, and actors like Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant and Halle Berry look noticeably uncomfortable under the heaps of prosthetics they're asked to wear. Some of Hanks' makeup looks as outrageous as that to be found in the 'Austin Powers' movies, with the major difference being that the makeup in those films was played for gags, whereas we're supposed to take the 'Cloud Atlas' makeup straight.I'm fairly curmudgeonly when it comes to giving movies kudos for ambition alone. If you're going to take on something as exceptional as 'Cloud Atlas,' do it right or all you've succeeded in doing is ruining it.Grade: C",4,5,14,28 June 2013
300," Gird Your Loins, Men!
","It's amazing to me that '300' is being taken seriously enough to stir up so much controversy. Some say it's homoerotic, others that it's homophobic. Some say it's an indictment of the Bush Administration's attitudes about war, others that it's a right-wing, pro-war diatribe. Iranians are apparently offended by the portrayal of Persians in the film. There are at least three reasons that all of these people need to chill out about this movie: 1.) It's based on a graphic novel, and when was the last time we expected subtlety, realism or political correctness from a graphic novel? 2.) Since it's a virtual recreation of a previously existing graphic novel, the blame for its offensiveness should rest on Frank Miller, not the film. 3.) The movie isn't nearly intelligent enough or important enough to be offended by.'300' is one long, witless, sustained shout of a movie. Sadly, the filmmakers take their purpose very seriously, so this has none of the knowing humour or kitsch value of 'Sin City,' the 2005 masterpiece that also recreated a Frank Miller world on the big screen. The creators of '300' seem to think they have an important story to tell, and they tell it with deadly earnestness. Therefore, every single line of dialogue, every gesture, every sound effect, is pitched at the same over-emphatic level, with the results being a poundingly monotonous movie.After all the talk of the striking visual style, '300' ended up not being stylized enough for my taste. 'Sin City' truly created a whole other world on screen; realism was not only ignored -- it was completely shunned. In '300,' the artists try to create a realistic universe for their characters to move and fight in, so what we basically get in the end is an imitation of films like 'Gladiator' and 'Troy,' with even less brains.Not surprisingly, the movie is at its best when it's fighting. There are a couple of dazzling sequences, like the one in which our feisty band of Spartans sends a horde of Persians hurtling over a cliff; or a montage that shows an extended series of battles including charging rhinos and elephants. But any time it slows down for plot exposition or scenes of dialogue, you might as well hit snooze, because you're not going to miss anything important. None of the actors really makes much impression, though they probably deserve credit for even doing as well as they do, considering they had nothing but blue screens to interact with. Gerard Butler is o.k. as King Leonidas, but his mush-mouthed line delivery was a constant distraction. Rodrigo Santoro gets stuck with a humiliating role as Xerxes, king of the Persians. The costume designer bedecks him in jewels and piercings, and the sound team give him an electronically fake voice that sounds ridiculous coming from such a fruit loop of a character. But no matter. The only thing you really notice about any of the actors are their sculpted abs and pecs, which are on constant and prominent display. Indeed, by the end of the film, I was identifying the characters by their torsos rather than by any distinguishing personality traits, since there aren't any.I was in the mood for a film like '300' and wanted desperately to like it, but it wore me down. Now I know how those Persians must have felt.Grade: B-",6,6,13,27 March 2007
Ran," Grand Kurosawa Film Still Falls Short of 'Seven Samurai' and 'Throne of Blood'
","Director Akira Kurosawa takes Shakespeare's 'King Lear' and sets it in feudal Japan.What I love about Kurosawa films is true about 'Ran' as well: he was capable of making popcorn entertainments that were infused with an art-house intellectualism. He made thinking man's action movies. 'Ran' is right up there with some of his best work, but to me it falls short of what remains my favorite Kurosawa film, 'Seven Samurai,' and even as his Shakespeare adaptations go, I was more wowed by 'Throne of Blood,' his visceral re-telling of 'Macbeth.' Incidentally, 'Ran' brought Kurosawa his only Academy Award nomination for Best Director, and as it has done with so many tremendous film artists, the Academy had to admit that they'd botched things and handed him an honorary award as a consolation prize a few years later.Grade: A-",8,1,4,8 April 2008
Easy A," Mr. Hawthorne, Meet Mr. Hughes
","A film that answers the question: what would you get if you crossed Nathaniel Hawthorne with John Hughes? 'Easy A' is a perky riff on 'The Scarlet Letter' done up as a 1980s teeny-bopper movie. Emma Stone is adorable as a nerdy high school girl who gets a reputation for being a slut when a tiny lie goes viral, and then realizes that she kind of likes the attention notoriety wins her, even if it's all based on false rumor.Though mostly lightweight and funny, 'Easy A' does convey some serious messages about the power of words, and it confirms the very real truth that what is true isn't nearly as important as what is perceived to be true (all you kids out there who think you can post whatever you want on Facebook without any consequences, take note).The adult cast features Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Stone's impossibly laid back parents (their characters are a total fantasy, but with those two actors playing them, who cares?), Thomas Haden Church as a favorite teacher and Lisa Kudrow as an unhinged guidance counselor who makes a big mistake.Grade: A-",8,0,0,17 February 2011
Apollo 13," By-the-Numbers Movie Is Still One of Ron Howard's Better Efforts
","A taut and polished studio film from Ron Howard that manages to be quite suspenseful even though we all know the ending from the start.The film is a lean recreation of the Apollo 13 space mission that met with disaster and almost didn't make it back home. Tom Hanks gives one of his many appealing performances as leader of the mission, while Ed Harris gives a muscular, intense performance as head of mission control. Kathleen Quinlan was inexplicably nominated for an Oscar for playing Hanks' anxious wife -- her role consists of nothing but sitting around looking worried.As by-the-numbers and mainstream as they come, but still one of Howard's better efforts.Grade: A-",8,2,3,8 May 2009
The Thin Red Line," Malick's Stunning Masterpiece
","A glorious and achingly beautiful movie about the psychological toll war takes on the men who fight it.Released the same year as Steven Spielberg's WWII combat film 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'The Thin Red Line' exists on a different and higher plane of film-making from Spielberg's. 'Private Ryan' is an exercise in technical meticulousness but has a giant zero at its center. 'The Thin Red Line' gets into the heads of the characters involved and tells us what being in a war means to them and what it's forcing them to leave behind. Malick's film is haunting, ambiguous and stunning, but no wonder Spielberg's in your face patriotic anthem won all of the attention and all of the awards -- ambiguity has never been a big seller.Grade: A+",10,0,1,21 June 2010
Green Book," Patronizing
","Just.....no.'Green Book' is the kind of movie my mom likes, and trust me, that's not a compliment. It's for people who are willing to watch a movie about racism as long as the black character who's the victim of it is whiter than any of the white characters. It's for people who want to pat themselves on the back for being open to a 'serious' movie that doesn't challenge a single belief or make them the slightest bit uncomfortable. It's for people who like music cues that tell them exactly what they're supposed to be feeling at every single moment. It's for people who think the answer to racial problems is for whites and blacks to compromise and find some middle ground where they can agree to overcome their differences, as if black people have any responsibility in the fact that they have been marginalized ever since the very first one set foot on American soil. No one who is the slightest bit tuned in to racial problems in contemporary America could possibly stomach this movie.Personally, I found it to be patronizing and damn near insulting. It consists of scene after scene of our black protagonist getting himself in trouble, only to be saved from the situation by the white guy. By the end, the white guy has taught him how to be more black and embrace his own culture, which in this movie is defined by liking fried chicken, listening to Little Richard and Aretha Franklin, and playing some funky piano. Oh but wait, defenders will say. The white guy learns something too, like how to be less racist and how to write really good love letters to his wife. In fact, the entire guys' racist family learns to not be racist by the end and welcomes the black guy to their Christmas dinner. They're just casually racist, you see, but not racist in ways that really matter. Barf.Seriously, this is the Sesame Street version of racism. In a year that gave us 'BlackkKlansman,' 'Blindspotting,' 'The Hate U Give,' and 'Sorry to Bother You,' all movies made by minorities about the black experience in America, it's pretty telling of where we are as culture right now that the race movie mainstream America glommed on to was this piece of feel-good hoo-hah. Mainstream America doesn't want to have its beliefs challenged, and it certainly doesn't want to be told it's part of the problem. Instead, it wants a hallmark movie that makes it feel good about itself.One thing saves 'Green Book' from being an utter waste of time, and that is the performance of Viggo Mortensen.Grade: D",3,16,32,10 April 2019
Fantastic Four," Fantastic May Be Stretching It (Get It?) But These Films Are a Lot of Fun
","I'm used to being in the minority when it comes to movies. But usually, I hate movies that everyone else seems to love. It's much rarer that there will be a movie almost universally disliked, but which I actually enjoyed. 'Fantastic Four' is one of those.Maybe by the time I saw this I was just sick of all the brooding, psychologically complex superheroes out there and found a good old-fashioned cheesy comic book movie refreshing. What I like about this story is that the Fantastic Four have their superpowers foisted on them, and then have to figure out how to use them. They have a regular Joe quality to them that makes them easier to relate to. They don't have sinister back stories full of murdered parents, ugly childhoods, seething feelings of revenge. They're just geeky scientists who can do pretty cool things.People seem to be responding to the second installment, 'Rise of the Silver Surfer,' marginally better than they did the first, but I like both of them. After the overblown mess that was the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy and all of the dithery angst that filled Sam Raimi's 'Spiderman' series, it's nice to sit back and let 90 minutes of fun, worry free action adventure cleanse the palate.Grade: A-",7,1,2,25 June 2007
The Great Escape," A Simply Terrific Movie
","Sorry ladies, but 'The Great Escape' is the ultimate GUY movie.I'll never forget watching this movie when I was about ten or eleven, with my then super-cool brother-in-law, who I realize now was a bit of a slimeball but who at the time I looked up to for the very things that made him a slimeball. But lest you think my fondness for this movie rests only on its associations in my mind and not on its quality, I have seen it since and it holds up remarkably well.Who can forget the iconic image of Steve McQueen taking off across that field on his motorcycle? We can look back now and see that that image served as an announcement of a new and radical shakeup taking place in film and popular culture, and that the next decade or so would be ruled by the renegade and the bad boy. 'Easy Rider,' 'Bonnie and Clyde,' 'The Graduate,' 'The Wild Bunch' would all come later. 'The Great Escape' came first.Grade: A",9,1,2,17 November 2006
Pineapple Express," A Minor Classic Is Buried Beneath a Lot of Big Budget Hollywood Garbage
","How much you enjoy 'Pineapple Express' may depend largely on how funny you think Seth Rogen is and/or how high you happen to be when you watch it. I wasn't high, and I think Seth Rogen has eked about as much mileage as he can out of his doofus schlub routine, so needless to say I didn't find this film to be an instant comedy classic.There were plenty of moments that made me laugh, but usually they were the result of some minor and silly throw-away line of dialogue that felt improvised, making me want more of that. Which is why I was frustrated and rather depressed that most of the film consisted of hard-sell, aggressive gun/fistfights, car chases and other stock material normally found in buddy action movies. There's a hilarious and potentially classic addition to the stoner comedy buried somewhere within this bloated film that occasionally makes its appearance. But only occasionally.And I wasn't prepared for how graphically violent the film was going to be. It tries to play all of this awful violence for laughs but doesn't succeed. The humor just feels queasy and uncomfortable instead of outrageous. Though I did receive quite a bit of catharsis from seeing Rosie Perez crushed by a car.Grade: B",6,2,4,9 February 2009
Annihilation," What a Mess
","A convoluted, murky screenplay and poor execution dulls any effectiveness this cerebral sci-fi horror movie might otherwise have had. Natalie Portman plays perhaps the most morose character ever put on screen, who joins a bunch of other volunteers to go exploring in a sort of radioactive bubble that has already brought insanity and death to others who've entered it. Okay, so she has a pretty good reason to be morose, but still. Would it have killed the filmmakers to give us a joke or two? What they find in this bubble cannot be explained by anyone who is telling you the truth about their experiences watching this movie, though one thing that I can tell you with certainty is that the visual effects used to conjure them are awful. The ending I suppose is meant to make us gasp in surprise, but my attention was diverted by the paint drying on my walls so I unfortunately wasn't able to give the makers of this movie the reaction they wanted.'Annihilation' evokes 'Avatar' in its production design (except for a late scene that rips off the look of 'Alien' wholesale) and 'Apocalypse Now' in its 'venturing into the heart of darkness' psychology. It would have done better to avoid evoking any of those movies, because it made me just want to watch one of those instead of finishing this one.Grade: D",3,2,7,20 September 2018
Jackie Brown," Foxy Grier
","'Jackie Brown' was widely received as a disappointing follow-up to Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction,' but I think it's actually a better movie, if less obviously so. It's hard not to be blown away by 'Fiction' because of it's sheer audacity; 'Jackie Brown' is a quieter film that shows Tarantino has the potential to become a mature and sophisticated director. It's somewhat ironic that Tarantino, associated with the young hipster audience, made this film, because at the basic level 'Jackie Brown' is about getting old. All of Jackie's motivations spring from the fact that starting over will soon become impossible for her. That the options available to a a middle-aged, lower income level, black woman in modern America are severely limited. Tarantino shows an amazing prowess for getting into the head of this woman. His sensitive direction coupled with Pam Grier's top-notch performance combine to make Jackie one of the most compelling and honest female characters to hit the movie screen in recent years. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent too. Robert Forster stands out as bail bondsman Max Cherry, who becomes Jackie's partner in crime, as it were. Samuel L. Jackson does well with the kind of part he seems born to play, but his character is not as interesting as the others and so makes less of an impression. Bridget Fonda is a scene stealer as a California beach bunny, and the contrast between her and Pam Grier is used quite effectively.It's interesting to note that in the book this movie was based on, 'Rum Punch' by Elmore Leonard, Jackie was white. Changing the race of the title character to black adds a whole other dimension to the film that the book lacks. This is one case where the movie greatly improves on its source material.'Jackie Brown' will take some commitment on behalf of the viewer. It's leisurely paced and more reliant on character study than Tarantino's other films, but these aren't detriments. They merely illustrate that Tarantino has some range as a director, and I hope he continues to explore that range.",10,1,3,29 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Boy Who Loves 'Star Wars'
","A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original 'Star Wars' film was released. He doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. He does remember the first 'Star Wars' themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a Northern Illinois University thing).I can't review 'Star Wars' as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to 'Star Wars' and I think people either just understand that or they don't. I don't get the appeal of 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Star Trek' but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas's films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+",10,0,1,2 December 2005
Aladdin," Robin Williams Was Born to Be a Cartoon
","A fantastic animated film from Disney's early-1990s animated renaissance.Following closely on the heels of 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Aladdin' doesn't have that film's amazing storytelling and strong emotional pull, but it makes up for it with dazzling animation and a terrific score. Robin Williams was born to play an animated genie, apparently, and his performance is inspired. You can almost see the animators sweating to keep up with Williams' dizzying improvisation.And Jafar, the droll sorcerer that serves as this film's bad guy, is perhaps my favorite Disney villain ever.Grade: A",9,1,2,6 January 2009
Incredibles 2," Father Doesn't Always Know Best
","It was probably inevitable given the wait that Pixar put us through for this sequel to its 2004 masterpiece that expectations would be somewhat disappointed. 'Incredibles 2,' while a lot of fun, never reaches the dizzying snap of the original and it didn't leave me panting for a third installment in the series.This time around, the focus shifts to Elastigirl and the business proposal offered her by a brother/sister team to use her celebrity as a way to bring superheroes out of hiding and back into the mainstream. This means that Mr. Incredible gets left at home with the kids and his feeling of inadequacy at being overshadowed by his wife. In this current climate of extreme 'wokeness,' the screenplay could have done a lot with this idea of threatened middle-class white male masculinity, but it instead decides to take the predictable and rather tired route of showing how hard it is to be a stay-at-home parent. Is there really a lot more humor to be wrung from the premise that 1950s dads had no idea how to run a household?The plot involving Elastigirl, meanwhile, thickens, as such plots do, but not in the most compelling of ways. The villain of the film is weak and uninspired, and the plot becomes muddled and messy by the film's end. When the movie was over I found myself wishing it had just been about the Parrs fighting the Underminer rather than any of the things the movie was actually about.The best part of the film, and the one that I think has the most room for exploration if Pixar decides to make more sequels, was watching Dash and Violet begin their growth into independent superheros in their own right. That's what the third film should be about, if there is one.Grade: B+",7,1,4,24 July 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," A Gorgeous Elegy from the Coen Brothers
","For every Bob Dylan out there, there are hundreds, probably thousands, of musicians who don't make it. Many of them are even very talented, but they're lacking whatever it is they need to break out and become a star.Meet Llewyn Davis, one of the thousands. Navigating the Greenwich Village folk scene of the 1960s, Davis is a good singer of good songs, but he's stuck on an endless treadmill of existence of his own making. We don't feel sorry for him, because he's a jerk. But we, or at least I, feel compassion for him, because every time he opens his mouth to sing, he expresses the vulnerability and warm humanity that he's not able to express in any other way.The Coen brothers have created a vibrant, unsettling, marvelous movie with 'Inside Llewyn Davis,' a dark night of the soul journey led by the actor Oscar Isaac, who plays the title character flawlessly. In this overcrowded movie awards season, it's criminal that this film got lost in the shuffle and that virtually no one seems to think it's worthy of serious awards attention. But then again, when I see the films that do win awards, it makes me think that maybe 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is in better company with things as they are.Grade: A+",10,2,5,22 January 2014
Sin City," Sick but Sensational
","I feel guilty for loving this film, but there you have it. 'Sin City' is 'Pulp Fiction' with even less redeeming moral value. If you're easily offended (pretty much by anything), stay far away. Otherwise, sit back and revel in this movie's noir-soaked atmosphere.I've not read the Frank Miller graphic novels upon which this film is based, but I've seen the illustrations, and I have to say that 'Sin City' triumphs in bringing the look of the comics to the screen. I'm not usually a fan of style over substance (I seem to be one of the few that thought last year's 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' a dismal failure), but I could have watched Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's stunning monochrome compositions all day. Not since Dorothy opened the door of her house on to a Technicolor Munchkinland has black and white cinematography been juxtaposed to color more effectively. The CGI effects are flawless, and a terrific and audacious pulpy score pulses throughout the entire film.Three equally bizarre stories are interlinked, again a la 'Pulp Fiction,' and brought to life by a cast of not-quite-above the title stars: Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood (creepy as hell!), Michael Clark Duncan. The only box office actor is Bruce Willis, who plays a role that fits him like a glove, that of the melancholy hero past his prime who wants to prove he's got one more knockout punch in him before he's KO'd for good.The only reason this film rises above cheap titillation is that everyone involved with it commits 100% to a common vision of what the film should be. There's something admirable about the way the filmmakers refuse to compromise their (admittedly) disgusting visions to appease the moral conservatives, or to get a lesser rating, or to make more money at the box office. 'Sin City' is a movie for adults that appeals to the thirteen-year-old in all of us, and what fun it is.Grade: A+",10,1,3,26 April 2005
Saboteur," Somebody Sabotaged This Film's Screenplay
","I don't hear 'Saboteur' talked about much in conversations about Hitchcock's films, and I can see why. It feels more like a product of a second-tier director filming in the style of Alfred Hitchcock than a movie directed by the master himself.Robert Cummings is the wronged man in this story, accused of sabotaging a war munitions plant. He takes off to find the real culprits, running into Priscilla Lane along the way and reenacting some scenes that felt stolen directly from Hitchcock's own 'The 39 Steps.' The only thing resembling a Hitchcockian set piece is the film's climax that finds our hero and his nemesis dangling from the torch of the Statue of Liberty.What relegates this film to the Hitchcock bargain bin and renders it forgettable is its ridiculously implausible screenplay. It feels sloppy and frequently makes no sense whatsoever. And the film ends so abruptly that you're not even sure what happens to the main character, but in a way that doesn't feel intentional.I've yet to see a Hitchcock film that isn't at least entertaining, and this one is that, but it's certainly not among his classics.Grade: B-",5,8,16,9 February 2009
Gangs of New York," Scorsese Missed the Mark
","Martin Scorsese is working with a subject that suits him to a tee -- gang warfare in the streets of New York -- and the film's got his trademark kinetic style -- something's always happening on screen. So why does the whole film feel so leaden and uninvolving? 'Gangs of New York' should have been kick ass. Instead, the most it got out of me was a shrug of the shoulders and a 'meh.' Daniel Day-Lewis acts up a storm and is certainly something to see as Bill 'The Butcher,' the vicious leader of one of the film's eponymous gangs. But unfortunately, the story takes place through the perspective of Leonardo DiCaprio's character, and DiCaprio, usually a fine actor, simply isn't up to the task here. Cameron Diaz, meanwhile, shouldn't be let within 100 feet of a period piece.The film's period look is detailed and authentic -- there's an awful lot of mud in those 19th Century New York streets. But the overall impression is that Scorsese missed the mark with this one.Grade: B-",6,0,1,4 August 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," Don't Go in the Cellar! Or the Elevator, for That Matter. Or the Janitor's Closet. Or the....
","A pretty insanely entertaining horror comedy that is far more interested in deconstructing the genre than it is in providing its audience with any legitimate scares.Five obligatory college kids go off to a cabin that looks an awful lot like the one from 'The Evil Dead,' only to accidentally awaken from slumber a family of deranged hillbilly zombies. We then are treated to all of the typical conversations and actions that college kids in these kinds of movies would seem perpetually forced to go through and that we've seen a hundred times before, until the movie reveals that these kids ARE being forced through their paces and that we've seen this a hundred times before because someone WANTS us to see it a hundred times.The big reveal in this movie isn't that much of a reveal. The film is way too well written to overly rely on a gimmick. It sets the stage in its first scene, and develops its conceit through funny writing and clever plotting, not through major twists and 'gotcha!' moments.In our age of instant gratification, it's probably pointless to try to keep movie secrets secret. Discussions with spoilers are started on message boards before the audience has even left the theatre. But if you're interested in 'The Cabin in the Woods,' try to go into it knowing as little about it as possible. Knowing the general premise won't ruin your enjoyment of the movie, but it's still a film best experienced fresh.Grade: A",8,3,7,2 October 2012

","Mel Gibson directed and starred in this 1995 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, a 'historical' epic about Scottish freedom fighter William Wallace set during medieval times.Gibson of course plays Wallace, decked out in war paint and dreadlocks. Like all of Gibson's work, it shows an almost fetishistic obsession with the story's violence without seeming to care a whit about its characters, and it's capped with one big corny ending that finds Wallace leading a rousing volley of cheers while being drawn and quartered.This is obvious and silly film-making.Grade: C",5,6,11,8 May 2009
Joy," No Joy to Be Had
","An example of what happens when absolutely nothing about a film works.David O. Russell is the inexplicable director/writer of this dreadful movie, which aside from the cast of usual suspects that have appeared recently in his films, bears no resemblance to the Russell films ('I Heart Huckabees,' 'Three Kings,' 'The Fighter,' 'American Hustle') that have turned out to be some of the best of the last decade or so. Russell muse Jennifer Lawrence plays the titular character, a screen version of Joy Mangano, who as portrayed in this film is a struggling working-class mom and daughter whose invention of a self-wringing mop launches a successful career as an inventor of household products despite a despicable family who treat her like dirt and various business colleagues who try to take advantage of her. I think Russell is so enamored of Lawrence that he's lost the ability to direct her objectively. She shows not an ounce of the charisma and screen presence I know she has, because I've seen it in other films, even in other Russell films. The whole thing is an exercise in frustration for its audience, as we're forced to watch the main character be treated like a doormat by a collection of grotesque cartoon characters, and then receive only the barest pay off in the film's final moments when we're told, not actually shown, how well things eventually turn out for her. Robert De Niro, Isabella Rossellini, Virginia Madsen, Diane Ladd and others play Joy's family members, and they're all terrible, both as characters and as actors. The film can't decide on a tone, so bizarre, zany comedic moments are crammed up against dramatic ones we're supposed to be taking seriously. The whole thing feels interminable and made me quite grumpy, the exact opposite reaction I presume a film called 'Joy' is supposed to have on me.Lawrence received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, apparently for just turning up on set.Grade: F",2,1,3,28 September 2016
Her," Lonelier Than Ever
","A delicate, lovely film about a lonely man who falls in love with his computer operating system.Set in a near future, 'Her' captures better than any movie in recent memory the paradox of the modern technological age: with gadgets that allow us the instant gratification of connecting with other people whenever we want to, we're somehow lonelier as a race than ever.With all of the awards season chatter about best this and best that, I can't believe more people aren't talking about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in this film, and I don't even really like him usually as an actor. He carries 'Her' virtually single-handedly, his only company for most of the movie the voice of Scarlett Johansson, who plays his operating system so well you forget this is a movie about the relationship between man and machine. The film may be too quiet and slow moving for some, and I admit I very much liked it without exactly loving it, but it's certainly one of the best and most original movies I've seen this year.The film also stars Amy Adams, wonderful as ever in a role very different from the one she's concurrently playing in 'American Hustle,' and Rooney Mara, who I could easily fall in love with myself.Grade: A",8,1,4,9 January 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," The Final Answer Is: Fake
","'Slumdog Millionaire' is the kind of film that many people will probably rabidly adore, because it's energetic, invigorating and, at first glance at least, feels like something we haven't seen before. But a whole other group of movie goers may find themselves resistant to its questionable charms, as I did. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a fake. An accomplished fake, to be sure, but a fake nonetheless.The film tells the story of Jamal, who grows up in the slums of Mumbai, India, only to find himself in the hot seat on the popular Indian television version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.' Each question he's asked during the game show triggers a flashback sequence that fills in a little bit more of his story -- we see him become estranged from his brother, who gives himself over to the life of a gangster, and we see him stay true through all of his adversity to his one love, a girl named Latika.It's fairly clear that director Danny Boyle intends this film to be a fairy tale, with the love story providing the film its heart. But much of the film is nasty and unpleasant, reveling in every distasteful detail about Jamal's childhood. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, we've seen Jamal tortured with electricity, Jamal jumping into a vile pit of human excrement in order to get an autograph from his favorite Bollywood star (this scene is played for laughs, because isn't someone covered in sh*t always good for a laugh?) and we see his mother bludgeoned to death by anti-Muslim extremists right before Jamal's and his brother's eyes. Later, we see small children getting their eyes burned out with hot spoons in order to make them more effective beggars. Everyone in the movie but Jamal and Latika, who remain blank slates as characters, is hateful and repellent. Boyle heaps calamity on top of calamity for so much of the film that its facile, simplistic conclusion wrings impossibly false. You can't have it both ways. You can't have your film be both a gritty, slice-of-life indictment and a frothy romantic soufflé. The end product is like 'City of God' meets 'Moulin Rouge!' This isn't the first time I've felt this way about Danny Boyle movies. He frequently strikes me as a director who's not in control of his own films. His brand of film-making mistakes the fast and furious for interesting and compelling, and he gets in the way of his own narratives, distracting us when he should be drawing us in.A lot of people might mistake this for a great film. And who knows? -- maybe it is. After all, greatness is a matter of opinion. But my opinion is that this film falls very short of greatness.Grade: B-",6,100,167,17 November 2008
Mad Max: Fury Road," A Visceral and Wonderfully Cinematic Experience
","The only exposure to the Mad Max franchise I had before this one was 'Thunderdome,' that piece of 80s hoo-hah that was all big hair and snarly performances. So I came into 'Fury Road' fresh, with no expectations and no comparisons to make.'Mad Max: Fury Road' is one of the most beautiful films I've seen in a long time. A strange claim to make about a film with such a dirty, grungy setting, peopled with characters out of a post-apocalyptic nightmare. But it is absolutely visually stunning and a reminder that beauty in film is about much more than pretty scenery and cinematography. George Miller and company turn this action film into a ballet that left me almost ecstatic with excitement and reminded me how infrequently I see a film that's truly cinematic and how much I love it when I do. The film is mostly one long sustained set piece that in the hands of a different director would become monotonous and boring, but not here. Stunt actors tumble, fly, crash, and swoop in and out of the frame while vehicular carnage is filmed with all the love of a romantic dance. There are narrative themes that tempt one to take the film more seriously than is probably wise -- beyond the obvious one of environmental crisis, the film evokes thoughts of the religious fundamentalism and tribal warfare plaguing the Middle East. But this movie is more about movement than anything else, and I was happy to sit back and enjoy the ride.Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are great at what they're asked to do, which is mostly grunt and kick butt. And if the makeup artists do not at least get nominated for an Academy Award for their work, there is no justice in Hollywood.Grade: A",9,2,9,27 October 2015
Gladiator," Ridley Scott at His Most Laughably Serious
","Absolutely ridiculous bit of sword and sandal nonsense that wouldn't have been so objectionable had not director Ridley Scott and his cast taken the damn thing so seriously. It didn't help matters any that it went on to win the Best Picture Oscar, the dumbest pick since perhaps 'The Greatest Show on Earth' back in 1952 (though that film is far more entertaining).I guess the Academy felt they had shafted Russell Crowe the year before when he didn't win for 'The Insider.' That's the only reasonable explanation I can offer for how he managed to take the Best Actor prize for this. If you're dying to see Crowe in a loin cloth, run don't walk to your Netflix queue to add this one. But if not, just rent 'Spartacus' and be done with it.Grade: C",5,2,5,12 July 2010
Donnie Darko," Disturbing and Unsettling, But for Certain Tastes, Exquisite
","Even if you don't like 'Donnie Darko' (and I'm sure there are many people who hate it, if they've ever even seen it), you're not likely to forget it quickly. This film lingers in the mind in a very unsettling way. It left me feeling creepy, and it's actually a fairly nihilistic film, but at the same time I was weirdly exhilarated by it, mostly because it's just so damn good.It's got an expert cast, including the Gyllenhaals (Jake and Maggie), both of whom are two of the best young actors currently working, Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze (yes, Patrick Swayze) and Jena Malone. All the actors are top-notch and make so much of their characters that they prevent the film from falling into too-quirky-for-its-own-good territory, a fate that befalls many 'independent' films. But praise must go to the writing and directing in this regard as well. At first it may seem that events and scenes are thrown in arbitrarily just for the sake of being weird, but everything comes together logically and powerfully.'Donnie Darko' is a movie for people who think too much. For those of us (and I include myself) who can never understand how, for example, religious people are so easily able to have a pat answer for everything that's complicated about the world in which we live, this movie gives us something to relate to. It doesn't provide answers, unfortunately, but there's something comforting about knowing other people out there are struggling with the same problems. Donnie almost can't live a functional life because of the anxiety caused by all of the unknowns about existence, and he sees the bland, self-help answers offered by so much of middle-class American society for what they are: shams to hide behind rather than to really help. He wants to be able to live without fear, without having to be convinced that there's a point to it all, but he can't, and watching him struggle with that is poignant and heart-breaking.This is a terrific film that deserves to be seen. I haven't seen the original version, so can't make comparison to the director's cut, but I have no complaints with it as is.Grade: A",9,1,5,16 September 2005
Born on the Fourth of July," Yet One More Oliver Stone Film I Can't Tolerate
","'Born on the Fourth of July' is one of those movies that no one feels comfortable criticizing, because it's based on the true story of one man's experiences in Vietnam that left him a paraplegic, and to criticize the movie is to be unsympathetic to the story behind it. People treat Oliver Stone's other Vietnam film from the 1980s, 'Platoon,' the same way. Well, I'll be the first to say that I don't think either film is very good.'Born on the Fourth of July' is about as subtle as you would expect it to be, which means it's not subtle at all. Stone is one of those directors who wants us all to feel bad about events that other people have lived through, and his way of ensuring that is to beat us over the heads with his films. It's a condescending attitude for a filmmaker to take, and it's responsible for pretty much making me shun Stone films to this day.Star Tom Cruise had proved to the world he could act the year before in 'Rain Man,' and the Academy dutifully acknowledged that fact by handing him a Best Actor nomination for this film. He's actually a perfect match with Stone, as both men approach their respective crafts in the same way: aggressively and over earnestly.Grade: C",4,24,41,29 August 2008
The Social Network," Seems Like Most People Are More Interested in Using Facebook Than Seeing Movies About It
","Though I think 'The Social Network' is a blisteringly good film, I can see why it seems to have landed with a thud with audiences. I'm fascinated by David Fincher's filmmaking when he's at his best (this film, 'Zodiac'), but it wouldn't surprise me to find that others think his style is cold and clinical. He's obsessed with facts and details, and though 'The Social Network' doesn't stint on things like characterizations and thematic richness, it's just as full of tiny details about computer code, business deals and legalese.Jesse Eisenberg is perfectly cast as Mark Zuckerberg, at least as Zuckerberg is portrayed in this film. Eisenberg is an inherently unlikable actor, in that condescending way common to pompous techies and bookish intellectuals. He's surrounded by a terrific cast, most notably Andrew Garfield, who plays his best friend and business partner and who later becomes one of his chief enemies when the beast that is Facebook is unleashed on the world. Fincher is a pro at building mood and atmosphere (I can't think of a more atmospheric film than 'Zodiac'), and most of 'The Social Network' is infused with a sense of impending doom that would feel incongruous in the context of something as trivial as social networking if social networking had not become a force so strong as to change the entire profile (pun intended) of our culture.Grade: A",9,1,2,17 November 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Far Behind 'Raiders' and 'Temple of Doom'
","This third installment of the Indiana Jones saga has never done it for me, though I have to say it looks like a masterpiece compared to 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.' There just aren't the fabulous set pieces in this one to distinguish it from the others, and the ending veers too far into hocus-pocus supernatural terrain for my taste. I know I'm supposed to be tickled to death by Sean Connery's fussy curmudgeon, but I just found him to be tedious instead. I do, however, like the opening scene, that shows River Phoenix playing a young Indiana Jones at the beginning of his adventurous career.Grade: B-",6,1,6,4 September 2008
Back to the Future," I'm Not a Big Fan of the Series, But This One Is Harmless Enough
","The kind of comedy/adventure/sci-fi hybrid that the 1980s did very well, and which you just don't see anymore.'Back to the Future' solidified Michael J. Fox as a bona fide movie star, and featured a deliriously wacky Christopher Lloyd playing a scientist who invents a time travel machine. Robert Zemeckis keeps things light and playful -- he's one of many directors (like Ron Howard, Steven Spielberg, etc.) who started out making enjoyable romps until he felt the need to become 'serious' and started making movie crap like 'Forrest Gump.' I didn't fall in love with the 'Back to the Future' series, but I see its appeal.Grade: B+",7,2,7,8 April 2008
Goodfellas," One of the Ultimate Mobster Movies
","When Martin Scorsese is at his best, no one can do a gangster movie like him, and 'Goodfellas' is him at his best.Mind you, I don't think it's his best film (for me, that title belongs to 'Taxi Driver'), but it's a hugely entertaining and rollicking film that spends its first half making the world of mobsters look like an enticing fantasy and its second half making it look like a living hell. There are fierce performances from everyone, but though Joe Pesci was singled out for his outrageous depiction of the ultimate hot head, the film would not hold together without Ray Liotta's commanding performance at its center. Lorraine Bracco's performance as a naive dense wife who turns into an enraged shrew of a wife is like nails on a chalkboard, but I'm guessing she delivered exactly what was asked of her.The film features rapid fire editing and a soundtrack that won't quit, but in the hands of Scorsese, elements like this feel like more than empty stylistics.Grade: A",9,0,0,17 October 2008
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne's Back in Business
","Bourne is back.Jason Bourne, contentedly hiding out with his girl (again played by Franka Potente), dives back into action when a hit-man comes calling. Turns out Bourne has been framed in the killing of two CIA operatives, and getting rid of him would mean the CIA would be left with no suspects. But of course Bourne can't be brought down by a mere assassin, and the rest of the movie is another virtually non-stop string of action set pieces, culminating in perhaps the most amazing car chase sequence I've ever seen.Director Paul Greengrass could film a bar mitzvah and make it exciting -- his films are edited to within an inch of their lives, but somehow his herky-jerky camera-work and lightspeed cutting never become distracting, as they would in the hands of someone else. He has a nearly genius ability to choreograph action so that we're always seeing whatever we need to see when we need to see it, despite whatever else is going on at the same time. The Bourne movies maybe aren't lasting masterpieces, but they're small classics in their genre.Since Chris Cooper copped out at the end of the last one, Joan Allen steps in as the lead CIA agent on Bourne's trail, and she does a good job of looking hot and pensive at the same time.Grade: A",8,3,4,27 August 2007
The Proposal," It's a Movie Verson of a Magazine, Which Isn't Always a Bad Thing
","This lightweight romantic comedy mostly lands its jokes, thanks to the considerable comedic chemistry of its stars, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds.Bullock and Reynolds have zero sexual chemistry, but they make a good comedy team, and for this film that matters more. The premise is pure sitcom -- boss forces assistant to marry her so that she can stay in the country -- but it's executed well. It's the film equivalent of a magazine: everything, including the people in it, is shiny, glossy and attractive, and you can zone out and enjoy it without flexing one single brain muscle.God knows Hollywood doesn't get romantic comedies right very often anymore, so this film came across as a pleasant surprise.The cast also includes Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson as Reynolds' parents, and Betty White as his grandma, and whose little-old-lady-cute-as-a-button appeal is forced on us a little too strenuously.Grade: A",7,0,1,16 November 2009
Hustle & Flow," As Believable as the Bush Administration's Reasons for Invading Iraq
","Not to be outdone by Julia Roberts, Craig Brewer and his earnest cast led by Terrence Howard set out to prove that pimps, as well as whores, can have hearts of gold too. And despite the gritty 70s movie finish they spray over their film, 'Hustle & Flow' is about as grounded in reality as 'Pretty Woman.' Howard does a decent job, and anyone who's seen him in person knows how different he is, at least in his mannerisms and voice, from the character of DJ in the film. But he didn't really stand a chance when up against the ridiculous screenplay he and everyone else were forced to slog their way through. Howard's character, a small-time pimp stagnating in some Tennessee back water, who dreams of breaking out into the hip-hop world, felt about as authentic as the cartoon blacks Steven Spielberg created for 'The Color Purple.' There are some involving scenes built around DJ and his motley assortment of fellow music lovers creating their songs, and it's easy to be swept along in the funky rhythm of these moments. But the ghastly plot twists toward the end of the film that find DJ going to jail for injuring a thug in a shooting, and then finding stardom on the airwaves while he sits behind bars, surpassed mere over-earnestness and sailed headlong into plain stupidity. Are we really supposed to believe that just because DJ's hooker sidekick dropped some demos off at a couple of local radio stations that suddenly the whole world knows who he is? Or that prison guards are going to be handing him their own demos and seek his help in breaking into the music biz? Even Spielberg isn't that corny.And not since 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' assaulted our ears has a movie's theme song more quickly worn itself thin due to its sheer catchy repetitiveness.Grade: C",5,1,3,6 March 2006
The Birds," Apocalypse Now
","'Psycho' may have been the scariest Hitchcock film, but there is no film by the master of suspense more unsettling than 'The Birds.' This enigmatic revenge-of-nature fable makes no effort to explain away its mysteries, and that's the most unsettling thing about it. What is nature seeking revenge for? Why is the birds' uprising timed to begin with the appearance in a sleepy little coastal town of an icy blonde from the city? Why is everyone so antagonistic toward said blonde? Is it only because she appears to have designs on the resident golden boy stud, or is there more to it? Ultimately, these questions end up not mattering much. Three-fourths of the film concern itself with the tensions (sexual and otherwise) between Tippi Hedren's Melanie and the townspeople; then all hell breaks loose in the last quarter and these tensions are completely forgotten. The genius of the film lies in its ability to make horror out of the mundane. At the apocalyptic end, as the rag-tag group of survivors drive off into the distance, watched by a bird army that covers the ground as far as the eye can see, the effect on the viewer is as powerful as if the survivors had awakened the morning after a nuclear holocaust.And perhaps most unsettling of all is Hitchcock's refusal to use any kind of incidental scoring in his film. You don't realize how much we rely on film music to tell us how we should feel until it's no longer there to do so.With Rod Taylor as the stud, who keeps that famous hairy chest under wraps (sorry ladies); Suzanne Pleshette, as the butch and sexually repressed school marm; Jessica Tandy, in the film's best performance as a mother who relies a little too much on her son; and Veronica Cartwright, whose presence in any film is like nails on a chalkboard.A strange masterpiece, and Hitchcock's last great film.Grade: A",9,2,3,17 November 2006
Cinderella Man," Haven't Rocky and De Niro Pretty Much Said All There Is to Say About Boxing?
","Ron Howard has carved a niche for himself as creator of treacly populist hokum, and it seems pointless to criticize his movies again and again for being maudlin, manipulative and pandering. To his credit, he knows how to put a movie together, and by now everyone should know what to expect from a Howard film and not complain when that's exactly what they get.For the first two-thirds of 'Cinderella Man,' Howard appears to be bucking his own trend. It's quite respectable, fairly reserved and well acted. O.k., so Howard's version of Depression-era America still looks as glossy as a home decorating magazine, but I'll let that go. Russell Crowe is an actor who can make any movie better than it has any right to be, and Renee Zellweger is nowhere nearly as squinty and mealy as I thought she would be playing this character. And then we entered the final third of the film, and....Oh my. Watch out 'Seabiscuit,' there's another huge piece of corn coming up fast on your tail.In case you're not sure which boxer you should be rooting for in this movie, we get lots of closeup shots of big-eyed kids looking pleadingly at Russell Crowe like a bunch of little Oliver Twists. We get a scene in a church on the night of the big obligatory show-down match that all boxing movies must have, in which every pew is filled with people praying for Jim Braddock to win his fight, and we get a priest delivering the following subtle line to wife Renee Zellweger: 'In a way, he's (Braddock) fighting for them (the lowly downtrodden).' If you're still not sure who to root for, Braddock's arch nemesis, Max Baer (played campily by Craig Bierko), makes lewd comments about Braddock's wife in a nightclub a few weeks before the match. And in the ring, he continues to make nasty comments in between slow-mo shots of him leering like a sadistic psycho. And if you're STILL not sure who to root for, Baer punches Braddock in the balls a couple of times during their match for good measure. Not since Rocky Balboa faced off against Drago (or whatever that big heap of Russian was called in 'Rocky IV'--or was it 'V?') has a more cartoonish boxing villain stepped foot in a make-believe ring.There's some scary talk here and there about Braddock possibly dying during the big fight, because he's old and past his prime. But since his kids are listening to the fight at home, and since this is a Ron Howard movie, we're pretty sure that he's not going to die. In fact, we're pretty sure he's probably going to win, or there would be no purpose for the film's existence. Howard dutifully connects all the dots, stealing from every other boxing movie ever made, throwing in lots of rapid-fire editing and thundering sound effects to make the fight scenes exciting.It's sad and yet typical that Paul Giamatti, who gave two of the greatest film performances in the last few years ('American Splendor' and 'Sideways') would only be recognized by the mainstream Hollywood constituency for the hammy, dreadful role he's saddled with here. I only hope he was given a hefty paycheck to offset all the scenery he was forced to chew as Joe Gould, Braddock's wise-cracking manager.It figures that in a year that gave us hard-hitting film after hard-hitting film that took critical and thought-provoking looks at current trends in American culture, Ron Howard would deliver a product as sanitized, safe and bland as this piece of instantly forgettable 'entertainment.' It looks good and has a solid performance from Crowe--I can't recommend it for any other reasons.Grade: C-",4,3,7,20 March 2006
Jurassic Park," Landmark Film for the Art of Visual Effects
","Steven Spielberg's 'what if' movie set in a theme park where dinosaurs have come back to life holds up remarkably well today.This is Spielberg at his best, taking us on a fun house ride and making us feel like we're eight years old again. The visual effects in this movie were absolutely AMAZING at the time, and still look great today. 'Jurassic Park' is one of those landmark films -- there were visual effects before it and there are visual effects after it, and it's clear that this film changed the course of the art form forever.'Jurassic Park' is also the movie that inspired a short-lived crush on Laura Dern for me.

Valkyrie," Tom Cruise Plays One Hotsy-Totsy Nazi
","Had a better actor than Tom Cruise been cast in the lead role, 'Valkyrie' might have gone in some interesting directions. But it's Tom Cruise we get, and so 'Valkyrie' ends up being a modestly exciting action film that staunchly resists the impulse to be anything special.Cruise plays a German officer with anti-Hitler sentiments, who leads a covert operation to assassinate the dictator and stage a coup in the last days of WWII. The film is based on a true story, but take that for whatever it's worth. Director Bryan Singer, of 'The Usual Suspects' fame, keeps things moving along at a clip, but all of the period detail and pretensions to historical accuracy can't obscure the fact that this is just routine Hollywood action fare. Any potential the screenplay might have afforded to draw parallels between the ruthless Fuhrer and Cruise's single-minded idealist are tossed aside, and the film decides instead to treat Cruise unambiguously as a fallen hero. Makes the film go down smoother perhaps, but also makes it much less interesting.The supporting cast is a who's who of British actors that includes Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Wilkinson.Grade: B",7,0,0,13 July 2009
Alien: Covenant," Why Did Ridley Scott Choose to Make This Movie So Relentlessly Terrible?
","So much is wrong with 'Alien: Covenant' that I don't really know where to start.So let's start with Ridley Scott, shall we? Seriously, what the f**k? How could the man who invented the Alien franchise screw it up this badly? The first Alien movie had no pretensions to be anything more than a really scary movie, and as a result it scared the sh*t out of everyone. But now Scott feels the need to fill in the saga with all of this backstory, explaining the origins of the alien species and making the whole thing the plot of a rogue android to do away with the human race (or something). Aaargh!! The aliens are scary precisely because they're mysterious. The first film seemed to suggest that if you poke around in the vast regions of space long enough, you're going to find some icky things there. Telling us too much about them ruins their mystique.But not only is the story convoluted and dumb, the direction sucks as well, and this is perhaps the most surprising problem with 'Alien: Covenant.' Ridley Scott has never been one of my favorite directors, but the man usually knows how to direct a movie. Not so here. The movie begins with Michael Fassbender's android character roaming around an enormous ship all by his lonesome, and then after a run in with some sort of solar flare or something, BAM, there are suddenly other people running around as well. Who are these people, you ask? Oh hell if I know, since we're never introduced to them. They come out of malfunctioning sleeping pods, but we don't actually see them coming out of them, so the effect is disorienting. From then on, the rest of the movie follows suit, setting up set piece after set piece so quickly that we've barely grasped what is happening in one before we're being whisked away to another. What was the freaking hurry? Even the gestation period of the alien in this one is ridiculously short. A face hugger attaches itself to one character, and literally 30 seconds later a xenomorph is bursting out of his chest. Come on, at least stick to the rules you invented in the first place, crappy Alien movie. The characters might have names. I honestly can't remember. I do know that almost all of them are married to each other, but you don't know who's married to who until one of them dies and the other one looks a little more sad than the rest of the crew. But everyone is killed off so quickly that no one really has to mourn for very long. During all of this, there is an alien running around, but you might miss it, since it's treated almost as an afterthought, a strange choice given that this movie is named....you know....ALIEN.God, what a lousy movie. Much as I hate reboots, I would have preferred a simple re-do of the original with some new people and some spiffier special effects to this steaming pile.Grade: F (You have no idea how much it pains me to give an Alien movie that score)",1,8,12,6 September 2017
All the President's Men," A Thrilling Movie About How Fun It Is to Be a Journalist
","'All the President's Men' was one of two big releases in 1976 that examined the power of the American media ('Network' being the other). 'Network' took a cerebral, arty approach to its subject and created a blistering satire. 'All the President's Men' is a much more straightforward thriller, along the lines of this year's 'Zodiac.' It's perhaps less ambitious than 'Network,' but having seen Sidney Lumet's film recently I think 'President's Men' has aged better.Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman play Woodward and Bernstein, the two reporters for the Washington Post who investigated and uncovered the secrets surrounding Watergate. This movie makes the job of a journalist look intolerably exciting, and indeed I've read reports that applications to journalism schools actually spiked after this movie hit theatres. There's not anything really stylistically distinguished about the movie, but it's smashingly entertaining, and director Alan J. Pakula proved once again how good he was at putting urban paranoia on screen (as he had done with 'Klute' five years earlier).An Oscar went to Jason Robards, playing Ben Bradlee, editor of the Post, as a craggy sage, and a nomination went out to Jane Alexander, in a small but effective role as a reluctant informant. Hal Holbrook received the dubious honor (thank you Linda Lovelace) of playing Deep Throat.Grade: A",8,2,3,27 August 2007
The Wizard of Oz," This One Takes Me Back
","It's nearly impossible for me to write objectively about the quality of 'The Wizard of Oz,' so bundled up is it with associations from my childhood. It's like trying to do a critical analysis of 'Star Wars.' Sorry, can't be done---at least, not by me. 'Oz' is such a strange movie, in some ways so creaky and old-fashioned, in other ways so incredibly ahead of its time. Few films I've seen during my lifetime have such a complete vision as 'Oz' does---such painstaking care went into the look and design of the film; it's as if the filmmakers really did create a whole other world for this film to take place in. It's odd that during a time in American film history, when movies were being cranked out like cars on an assembly line, a film could feel like such an auteurish product (increasingly odd, since the credited director, Victor Fleming, actually shared directing duties with several others. The same is true for 'Gone with the Wind,' released in the same year and also bearing Fleming's name as sole director. He was quite a lucky guy in 1939).The plot and feeling of 'Oz' veers quite a bit from that of the book on which it is based. The book is much nastier and darker, but the film manages its fair share of grimness for all that. The Wicked Witch is spectacularly scary (Margaret Hamilton admits to regretting the intensity with which she approached this character) as are the Flying Monkeys. There's such a feeling of ominous dread under-laying this entire film. As if the land of Oz is a bit too beautiful and perfect, like a perfectly ripe piece of fruit that at any moment can begin to rot at the edges.Really, despite her scariness, the Witch is the most fun character in the film---it's really a riot to watch this film as an adult and enjoy her sarcasm and nastiness; it's refreshing as juxtaposed to the goody goodiness of the other characters. Frank Morgan in a variety of roles is also great.A cloud of darkness has come to surround this film over the last couple of decades, due to the urban legends about the stagehand supposedly caught on film hanging himself and the truly bizarre stories about the arduous process of making the film (and the many accidents and tragedies that occurred along the way). This reputation may be responsible for the cult status that has arisen around this film and perhaps even for elevating it to the level of admiration it has received.On a side note, an excellent book by Gregory Maguire called 'Wicked' offers back story to the events leading up to 'The Wizard of Oz,' and most particularly focuses on the early life of the Wicked Witch of the West. It's an outstanding book, and I venture that you won't be able to watch 'Oz' in quite the same way again after reading it.Grade: A-",10,2,3,29 April 2005
The Martian," What It Would Be Like to Be Stranded on Mars with a Frat Boy
","I seem to be perhaps the only person in the world who didn't fall in love with Andy Weir's novel 'The Martian.' In fact, I didn't make it through. Partially I was undone by the heaps of technical detail about how to make dirt, breathable air, etc. on Mars. I appreciated the research that went into it, but it felt more like reading a technical paper than a compelling story. But I was equally turned off by the book's tone, which is really the same thing as the narrator's tone since the part of the book I read is comprised completely of his journal entries. It had that painful quality writing has when the author thinks he's funnier than he is, and the whole cocky 'bro' attitude might have been realistic in a character like this (after all, he does have to have the fortitude and the balls to want to eek out an existence on Mars) but doesn't make him any more pleasant to spend time with.For the film, director Ridley Scott, writer Drew Goddard, and actor Matt Damon unfortunately for me but fortunately for the millions of others who enjoyed this story as it was told retain that tone. There's a jokey frat boy quality to virtually every scene that's like nails on a chalkboard, and the detailed realism of the books early chapters gives way to increasingly improbable set pieces that end with one character or another working in a witty quip while the director practically winks at his audience. I can imagine fans of this movie giving each other chest bumps as the credits roll.The film looks marvelous, though, I'll give it that. The effects (at least those on Mars itself) are so seamless that you almost forget they're effects.Grade: B-",6,2,3,8 March 2016
The Fighter," Best Cast of the Year?
","A terrific underdog story brought to the screen by David O. Russell ('Three Kings,' 'I Heart Huckabees') and acted by one of the best ensembles assembled for a movie this year.Mark Wahlberg plays Micky Ward, a young man from working-class Lowell, MA who rose from humble beginnings and a suffocatingly dysfunctional family to become a professional boxing champ. Christian Bale gives one of the performances of the year as Micky's brother, Dicky, a one-time champ himself (known for knocking down Muhammed Ali), wasting away as a crack addict and reliving his glory days through his brother. Amy Adams and Melissa Leo play two of the women in Micky's life, one his girlfriend and the other his overly-involved mother, and a bevy of unknown but realistic-looking actresses play Micky's big-haired and big-mouthed sisters.Add 'The Fighter' to the list of movies that have made working-class Boston and its environs look like one of the worst places on earth to live, full of crass, stupid people whose favorite pastimes are brawling and poking their noses into everyone's business. But though the environment brought to life by 'The Fighter' is depressing, the movie is anything but. It's a very different movie from Russell's 'Huckabees,' a film I adored, but yet his fingerprints are all over it, and its cast gels in the same exhilarating way that the cast of 'Huckabees' did, sending you out on a high on the strength of the sheer talent on display.Certainly one of the best movies I've seen this year.Grade: A",8,3,5,6 January 2011
Up in the Air," Whatever Else It Is, It's Relevant
","'Up in the Air,' director Jason Reitman's follow up to his break-out hit 'Juno,' is easily the most topical film I've seen this year. No other movie has been so in tune with current events and the cultural anxiety brought about by the recent economic crisis.George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, whose job it is to do companies' dirty work for them and fire employees. He's a transient being, living out of suitcases and hotel rooms, and that's just the way he likes it. But then he meets Alex, a fellow transient being (Vera Farmiga) for whom he develops real feelings, and Natalie (Anna Kendrick), a spunky go-getter who's assigned to trail him and learn from him but who instead wakes him up a bit to the emptiness of a life devoid of meaningful emotional connections.'Up in the Air' is a very solid bit of movie-making, never less than entertaining and extremely well acted. But it's a movie that doesn't hold together very well when you step back and start thinking about it. Vera Farmiga gives a lovely performance as Alex, but her character is the weakest written and doesn't make a lot of sense. She prides herself on being as detached from emotional baggage as Ryan is, and something we learn about her late in the movie proves that she means what she says, but would someone who really wants to keep emotional attachments to a minimum decide to be a man's weekend date for his sister's wedding? And after he crossed the boundaries she explicitly erected, wouldn't she call things off rather than leave open the opportunity to continue on with their relationship? Would there really be an audience for the kind of 'motivational' speaking engagements Bingham delivers? Would anyone in his right mind even think of building a presentation from the concept of getting rid of everything in your life that has meaning? Too much of this felt like it serviced the plot without ringing true on its own terms.You can call these things quibbles, and maybe they are. Like I said, much of 'Up in the Air' works very well. But the script calls too many things about itself into question for the movie to be completely satisfying.Grade: B+",7,8,14,26 January 2010
From Here to Eternity," A Serious Sudser, But a Sudser Nonetheless
","No amount of black and white art-house tastefulness can hide the fact that 'From Here to Eternity' is one big splashy soap opera of a movie. I've not read the James Jones book on which it is based, but it wouldn't surprise me to find that the romantic subplots that dominate the film are only a part of a much larger and intricate narrative in the book. 'A Place in the Sun' did much the same thing to 'An American Tragedy.' I've grown to like Burt Lancaster as I've seen him in more and more movies, and I think he got better as he got older, but he's at his hammy worst in roles like this. Though he's a big, rugged looking man, I can't take him seriously in these macho, stud roles. He overacts and never once convinces. Montgomery Clift does much better with his role as the sensitive and moony Pruitt; these were exactly the kinds of roles Clift was born to play. Frank Sinatra, again, could be a fine actor, but his role here is boiled down to a couple of aw-shucks moments before he kicks off in a sentimental death scene. Deborah Kerr and Donna Reed are largely wasted; they're definitely women adrift in a male-dominated film.I don't know about Fred Zinneman. I used to think he was a good director who made socially relevant films at a time when Hollywood would have been content churning out widescreen Technicolor junk, and he did do that. But his films during the 1950s all feel very pompous, like he was aware that he was making ART while everyone else was making MOVIES. I have the same feeling to an extent about George Stevens, though I think overall his films are more fascinating than Zinneman's.'From Here to Eternity' is certainly no where near the worst that the 1950s had to offer, but it has been overpraised. The fact that Pearl Harbor was still a very distinct memory for so many people probably had much to do with its popular and critical reception at the time, and for its lasting appeal. Watching it now, one kind of wonders what the big deal is.Grade: B",6,14,20,6 July 2006
Atonement," One Third of 'Atonement' Is Brilliant
","The first third of 'Atonement' is superb. We are introduced to a group of affluent English aristocrats whiling away their summer hours at a massive estate. One of them, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is nursing a raging case of sexual attraction to her childhood friend and now family gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), while another, Cecilia's young sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), spends her day writing a play which she plans to perform for a family gathering later that evening. Everyone is bored and listless in the summer heat. Briony, prey to an overactive imagination, keeps witnessing a series of increasingly serious moments of intimacy between Cecilia and Robbie that she isn't old enough to fully understand, and finally a false accusation by her is responsible for sending Robbie away from the estate in handcuffs. Everything about this part of the film is brilliant. The director Joe Wright ratchets the sexual tension to an almost unbearable pitch, and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen.But then the story and movie switched gears, and it lost some of that narrative momentum it had been so wonderfully building. The second and third acts of the film, while accomplished, do not deliver on the promise set up in the film's first part, and the movie never really succeeded in sucking me back in. When we next see Robbie, he's wandering through the desolate battlefields of WWII France, pining for Cecilia and nursing a chest wound. Wright shows off mightily in this part of the film; there's an astounding ten-minute tracking shot that depicts the allied forces on the beach of Dunkirk that will have cineastes slobbering. But like Robbie's mind, this part of the film starts to wander aimlessly, and even while I was admiring the sheer planning that went into this amazing shot, I couldn't help but wish that Wright would just get on with it already.Finally, the film circles back to Briony, four years older and working as a nurse tending to the wounded. She's suffering a tremendous amount of guilt for the wrongs she's only now beginning to understand and wants to reach out to Cecilia (from whom she's now estranged) and Robbie to offer her apologies. I've not read the Iam McEwan novel on which this film is based, but even I could tell that this is where the screenwriter, Christopher Hampton, had the most trouble adapting the novel to the screen. Much of what 'Atonement' is about becomes clear in this last act, as Briony ages into Vanessa Redgrave, a successful novelist who has finally written a novel that works as an outlet for her devastating feelings of guilt. We begin to realize here that 'Atonement' isn't as much about the love affair between Cecilia and Robbie as it is about the act of writing and the power of words. Briony learns as a little girl how difficult words are to take back once they've been said; as an adult, she learns the ability of words to help us deal with regret. One particular scene that takes place between Cecilia, Robbie and Briony is a fiction inserted into their story by Briony the novelist; it's the story as she wishes it had been rather than as it actually was. Briony the woman can't change the past, but Briony the novelist can.This is a wonderful idea, but unfortunately the screenplay doesn't quite know how to communicate this in cinematic terms, so it's told directly to the audience by Redgrave in a monologue at the film's conclusion. Redgrave is a luminous actress, but her soliloquy feels awkwardly inserted into the film. As for the other actors, they all do fine work. The young actress Saoirse Ronan is especially good, and James McAvoy proves further that he's becoming one of the finest young actors working today. But the screenplay sort of abandons him and Knightley after its first half hour or so to a warmed over version of 'The English Patient,' and the strong impact they both make early on dissipates gradually.I admired 'Atonement' for how it looked and the ideas it had to express, but I think it's an uneven film that doesn't entirely work.Grade: B+",7,254,353,17 December 2007
V for Vendetta," Should Send Far-Right Conservatives Running for the Exit (Hee Hee)
","Graphic novels have lately been providing cinema with some of its best source material. Two of my favorite movies from last year -- 'Sin City' and 'A History of Violence' -- both started as graphic novels, as did 'V for Vendetta,' a pyrotechnic dystopian fantasy that manages to make government oppression and radical terrorism brilliantly (and perhaps irresponsibly, depending on your point of view) entertaining.Since this film currently has over 1,000 comments here at IMDb, there is no need for a plot summary, or even the need for a lengthy comment from me. Both the film's detractors and supporters have adequately had their say. To those who claim that the film is morally dubious in its justification of terrorism, I can only reply that I completely see your point. However, I admittedly didn't take its message all that seriously, and instead took it for what it was -- a fantasist's impression of what a worst-case scenario near future will look like, and a rabble rouser's cry to people asking them not to forget that they should control their governments, not the reverse. If it's full of post-9/11 trappings to make its message more resonant, all the better. There's no harm done in remembering that governments (even democratic ones) are not always interested in what's best for the people it governs.This movie is fluid, rousing, and it looks spectacular. In a weak year for truly cinematic films, it's refreshing to see stylish film-making put to the service of a good story.Grade: A-",7,1,4,28 December 2006
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Brother, the Coens Are in Their Grotesque Comedy Mode
","George Clooney plays the ringleader of a batch of escaped convicts in the Depression-era South in this, one of the Coen Brothers most obnoxious and least entertaining films.It's a jokey, folksy retelling of Homer's 'Odyssey,' which is intriguing as an idea, but it's done in that grotesque comedic style the Coens brush off every once in a while -- yes, the same one used for films like 'Burn After Reading' and 'Barton Fink' -- and which I find intolerable.Nevertheless, the film brought the Coens an Oscar nomination for its adapted screenplay, and it won frequent Coens collaborator Roger Deakins a nomination for its cinematography.Grade: D",3,0,7,14 July 2010
The Godfather," Oh, Those Corleones....
","No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two 'Godfather' films, 'The Conversation,' and 'Apocalypse Now') and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another ('Peggy Sue Got Married,' 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', the third 'Godfather') earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before 'Jack' there was 'The Godfather.' While I feel the whole 'Godfather' trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think 'The Conversation' and 'Apocalypse Now' are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire 'Godfather' trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. 'The Godfather' doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, 'The Godfather' offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-",9,13,24,29 April 2005
