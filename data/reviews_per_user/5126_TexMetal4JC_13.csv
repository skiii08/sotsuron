Ali," Sorry, no can do.
","Ali tried hard, and you can really tell that Michael Mann poured his heart into the making of this epic film. The directing is fantastic. Likewise, Will Smith, who said he 'didn't want to be known as the guy who messed up the Ali film', doesn't. Jamie Fox and Jon Voight are also fantastic.But Ali - the film - doesn't match up. As someone below said: It's 'self-consciously artistic.' Very accurate. Mann tries too hard to make this an artistic film about a man and world events that weren't very artistic.Civil rights and racism are not matters that can be told with slow motion, native songs and obscure flashbacks. Likewise, they should not be told through the eyes of someone who cavorted with extremists and racists. The fight for civil rights in the 1960's was too important to be cheapened by the radical views of those who replace their names with X-es to make a pointless statement.Likewise, the attempt to show Ali's life as one governed by care for the black man was muddled by his contempt for the black woman - perhaps an accurate reflection of Ali's life and personality, but this film was obviously not trying to be biographical. And this is the worst part. At times it's about Ali's boxing, spending close to an hour's time on the three defining fights of Clay/Ali's career. At times it's about Ali's personal life, focusing on two of his wives and a girlfriend. So the film purports to be a biography.But then it veers off into thinly veiled social commentary, focusing not on Ali, but rather on Malcolm X and the radical Muslims he and Ali belonged to. No mention of Ali's younger days except for a brief flashback. And nothing after his third major fight. A biographical film that spends almost three hours focusing on a 15-year period of a man's life, and usually spends more time focusing on the issues surrounding his life than on his life itself.All this turns Mann's deft artistry into shambles, creating nothing more than a muddled version of a life at its peak, leaving a civil rights and sports legend looking like an extremist, a racist and a womanizer.4/10",Null,0,0,9 January 2002
Unbreakable," Fantastic and subtle
","Unbreakable is yet another movie that seems to have polarized the audiences who have watched it. Some love the movie, others abhor it. Having seen it, I believe there is nothing here that is abhorrent at all.M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent director, first of all. His touches with the camera are near genius, a true director in the classy, manipulative style of Hitchcock and Welles. His drab, depressing colors mark easily the monotony and misery that mark David Dunn's life. As for Bruce Willis, who plays Dunn - a security guard who has never gotten sick or injured in his life: Willis is excellent in his now typical understated way, insecure and nervous. He pulls off the modern-day version of the resistent hero-to-be in fine fashion. Samuel L. Jackson -- Elijah, a fragile man with a disease that makes his bones exceptionally brittle -- is excellent in his role as the man who discovers and tries to persuade Dunn that he is the real-life version of a comicbook superhero.
Unbreakable is slow on action and long on plot. And this is by no means a derogatory comment. Although the dialogue is predominant, it adds to the story and is interesting, making this one of the few post-computer revolution movies not to use gun battles or explosions as a mainstay of its plot. Indeed, Shyamalan seems to purposely avoid such distractions by not even showing the opening train crash, instead using the TV news to describe it. The twist ending is wonderful and delightfully Hitchcockian. Indeed, the pace and mood of this movie rings of 40s and 50s-era Hitchcock. The only potential problem is that Shyamalan is now typecast as a suspence/thriller director who throws in absurd and shocking plot twists at the end of his movies (sound familiar?). Will this be able to last, or will Shyamalan break the mold before it gets set? After all, even Hitchcock made an occasional 'Juno and the Paycock'.10/10",10,0,0,18 July 2001
Fight Club," An amazing sibling to American Beauty
","Fight Club is, in short, an amazing movie.It is amazing that it has such popularity, yet the real nature of the plot is still a mystery to someone watching the film for the first time.It is amazing that it can produce such polarized views from a populace, yet still garner such high rankings to be in the Top 40 of all time.But not only that, Fight Club is amazing because it combines terrific directing (David Filchner - Se7en, The Game) with terrific acting (Brad Pitt - Se7en, 12 Monkeys, Interview With a Vampire; Ed Norton - American History X), a great plot and social commentary that rivals American Beauty for its satirism and black humor.Indeed, American Beauty and Fight Club are like siblings. Both movies intertwine commentaries throughout a basically goofy and funny plot and turn potential comedies into something far deeper and thought-provoking.And just like American Beauty, Fight Club has its haters, the people who cannot stand the movie, the people who think it has no point, the people who refuse or are unable to grasp the underlying condemnation of their materialistic world.And that commentary is exactly what makes American Beauty and Fight Club a pair of instant classics. When society looks back at the turn of the 2d/3d millennium, these two movies will tell them volumes about our decadence, our shallowness and our misguided priorities.Overall Fight Club is not a cinematic classic, in the true Citizen Kane/Casablanca sense of the word. But it IS a classic, one of several movies that society of the future will look to to grasp our understanding of life. Fight Club is an excellent movie, with only minor flaws (the plot twist towards the end does leave some plot holes unfortunately: mainly the car crash scene). It is well-acted, well-directed, well-thought out, and it joins American Beauty and American Psycho as being one of the finest examples of contemporary black satire ever made.And did anyone else notice that Papa Roach took lines from this movie and used it in their song, 'Between Angels and Insects'?9/10 (With a possible 10 after a 2d viewing)",10,0,1,12 July 2001
The Others," Clearing up some misconceptions.
","The Others is 'obviously based on The Sixth Sense'? Because it's a ghost story? Please. Has anyone seen The Changeling? Not that it matters, because The Others is just like any horror movie: it feeds off the movies that came before it and attempts to make them better. It succeeds.The Others not only succeeds in weaving the classic Hollywood ghost story (music, atmosphere, sudden shocking scenes, scenes of dawning horror), but it also succeeds in creating a very good movie. Nicole Kidman is absolutely fantastic, as are the two children, and the direction of the movie is absolutely stunning.Classic atmospheric horror seemed to be a lost art, relegated to be remembered through replays of Vincent Price movies. But then came The Sixth Sense, bringing back the classic ghost story with a wrenching twist.Then came What Lies Beneath, adding more terror to a more realistic plot, with another stunning finish.And now we have The Others, a truly beautifully haunting ghost story. A truly terrifying horror movie, one of the scariest in years. And it is much, much better than its modern-day ancestors.10/10",10,1,1,18 August 2001
Scary Movie 2," Badly good.
","Summing up Scary Movie 2 really depends on what you thought of Scary Movie. If you liked the original gross-out horror spoof, you'll probably like this one. If you thought that the first was horribly disgusting and gross and needlessly graphic, then don't go see the sequel. Simple as that.Overall, Scary Movie 2 packed more parodies (do we dare try to list all the movies? The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, The Haunting, 13 Ghosts, a Nike commercial, The Weakest Link, Poltergeist, Hollow Man, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Mission Impossible 2, Charlie's Angels, What Lies Beneath, Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs, Save the Last Dance, is that all? Probably not.) Heck, Scary Movie even parodied itself! Well, at least I sure hope the complete excess of genital humor was self-parody. At least we weren't 'treated' to the sight of REAL male genitalia in this one.But anyway, Scary Movie 2 packed more parodies into less of a plot (is that possible?) than the original. True, the gags aren't as funny, generally. But the movie does indeed contain some classic satirical moments: The Exorcist opening is classic. The Hollow Man cooler parody scene is also excellent. Also nice is the way the Wayans unexpectedly throw in parodies out of nowhere. Sometimes this works (Save the Last Dance), sometimes it doesn't (Nike). But that's the whole point of a parody movie. Completely random satires of a movie or movies from the genre in question.
But what exactly was the movie/genre in question? In the first we had an idea that it was Scream. Heck, we KNEW it was Scream. But this one seemed to just be a haunted house movie filled with every sort of parody possible - part Poltergeist, part Hollow Man, part ???. So the movie suffers as a result.Oh the laughs are great, and if you don't mind the juvenile humor, they're even better. But hey, it's not as good as the original, which really was a classic parody movie, even if it was disgusting at points.

The Fast and the Furious," Good for the genre
","Going in to see The Fast and the Furious, you shouldn't expect to see a plot as engaging or complex as Citizen Kane. Or heck, even one as deep as M:I-2. You shouldn't expect to see great scenes of dialogue or tear-jerking romance.If you expect any of these things, you will be disappointed.
But if you expect a fast-paced, choppy movie with lots of revving cars, gorgeous women, testosterone and chase scenes, you will be thrilled with the latest summer popcorn movie to hit the screens.For an action movie with lots of cars, this rates well, on a par with Gone in 60 Seconds. Fast and the Furious is not supposed to be the sit down and discuss movie. It is supposed to be the sit back and relax movie.And it pulls off what it attempts quite well. In the world of action: 7/10. In the world of movies: 5/10.",Null,0,1,24 June 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Most Overhyped Movie of the Year!
","I keep seeing people posting these raving reviews of Crouching Tiger, and watch it get as high as the Top 10 on the Best 250 list... I'm sorry, am I missing something?If a movie had great special effects, but terrible acting and a paper-thin plot, the average 2000/01 moviegoer would scream about how terrible Hollywood was getting. But because this is a movie about fighting and kung fu and ninjas and what-have-you, we're supposed to love this?Crouching Tiger is an excellently-directed and cinematographed movie, and certainly deserved its Oscar nominations. But a movie should not live on special effects alone, and it disturbs me to see so many 'serious' movie fans warping the weakness of this movie, let alone ranking it high enough to place above movies like Rear Window, Pulp Fiction, North by Northwest, Silence of the Lambs, It's a Wonderful Life, Goodfellas, 12 Angry Men, Saving Private Ryan, Vertigo, The Sixth Sense or The Matrix (among MANY others)!",5,0,0,27 May 2001
From Hell," Absolutely incredible
","From Hell is quite the work of art. When the ideas of infusing artinto cinema were produced, From Hell is obviously what wasthought of. But the question is whether From Hell's grandiosebeauty translates into the genius of Salvador Dali or the overblownfluff of Jackson Pollock.On the one hand, the photography is simply stunning. The realismis amazing. The depiction of the London of Jack the Ripper,Charles Dickens and Sherlock Holmes is stunningly realistic. Thesociety created by the film makers is amazing to watch in of itself.Also, Johnny Depp shows that he is one of the best actors of ourtime. Granted, his role as the police inspector trying to find theRipper is not dissimilar from his role in Sleepy Hollow, but whyshould that matter? From Hell is an excellent movie to watchimmediately after taking in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas andBlow to realize what an incredible actor he is.The movie contains vast amounts of violence, yet it is portrayedtastefully and seems necessary to the movie, even if it's not all thatimportant to show the blood and guts. It almost strips From Hell ofits horror label because the brothers Hughes found ways to showgutted prostitutes and still raise the movie above the slasher-goregenre.The plot works like a modern-day version of an Agatha Christiebook. We're given the parts fairly soon, and we watch the inspectortry to figure it out. This is much different from the other intelligentcrime-horror flicks of late: Se7en, Kiss the Girls and In Dreamsfeatured loonies we never met until late in the movie. The Watchertold us who it was the whole time. But From Hell shows us thekiller, as well as several clues throughout the movie, but theending is still a surprise when Depp reveals it. How refreshing!The plot also runs on several levels, adding in seeminglydisjointed pieces (Anne and the Masons, for example) yet putting itall together at the end.The ending of the movie is probably the most non-climactic endingto a horror movie the last ten years. Strange that this movie buildstoward a climax that never happens, yet the ending still leavesviewers satisfied.But not all is well with From Hell:Heather Graham isn't dirty enough. If she's a prostitute, then sheshould be a dirty whore. But she's not. She's the clean-faced,red-haired, smiling one that stays out of the fray while her friendsare slaughtered in unspeakable ways. After all the effort to makethe surroundings realistic, would a little charcoal on the cheekshave been too much to ask?Besides which, Heather Graham couldn't even act in AustinPowers, what ever made the film makers believe she could act ina horror-thriller based on semi-historical events and acontroversial novel? Sorry. Heather Graham joins Mira Sorvino infailing the 'first major serious role' test.Someone in the editing room got a little too happy at the beginningof the movie. At some point in the middle of a string of murders,did someone not think to stop and say, 'Hey but do you thinkanyone would mind if we showed more than two uninterruptedseconds of a single viewpoint?' In some cases, the splicing anddicing of the film works, but it gets old pretty fast, and horror fansmay be wishing they could play some scenes in slow motion.
The ending is also a potential weak point. The nega-climacticending leaves the possibility for the audience to walk out of thetheatre with no lasting impression of the film, except a lot of dark.This is dangerous. Bold and gutsy, and I subtract no points for itsince I found it appealing, but it is dangerous, none the less.Overall, From Hell is the third excellent horror movie released thisyear (Hannibal, The Others, sorry haven't seen Joy Ride orJeepers Creepers yet). It is dark and disturbing. The horror doesn'twork on a shock/scare factor, but rather on a psychological/fundamental level. Audiences won't scream in terror,but many will find the movie horrifying. And in that  sense, theHughes Brothers have created a rousing success.9/10",9,0,1,22 October 2001
Psycho," If anyone has ever made a perfect movie, this is it.
","Made with the crew from his popular TV show, Alfred Hitchcock filmed PSYCHO in B/W in the midst of the height of his color classics -- REAR WINDOW, VERTIGO, DIAL M FOR MURDER, TO CATCH A THIEF and THE BIRDS. But it is PSYCHO that has become synonymous with Hitchcock. It is PSYCHO that has become synonymous with screaming and blood and knives and schizophrenia and horror.If ever anybody has made a perfect movie, PSYCHO is it. It is the penultimate in shocking horror, a directorial masterpiece supported by acting that will never be surpassed. The stars aligned for this movie, and it is doubtful if a movie can ever surpass the greatness of this film.The points have been hashed and rehashed over and over again: Perkins' incredible acting, the plot twists, the sheer twistedness of the movie, the place it holds as the father of the modern horror movie. All of it amazing.
No scene has been more popular in the annals of film than the shower scene (Oh sure, GONE WITH THE WIND and CASABLANCA and CITIZEN KANE have memorable lines, but what movie has a minutes-long scene that is internationally famous?). Unfortunately, its notoriety makes it somewhat of a disappointment to watch now, but repeat viewings reinforce the technical beauty of the scene where the original horror was lost.But enough, as anything said will only add more hype to a movie that does not need it. PSYCHO is quite simply the perfect movie, a film that could possibly stand forever as the best ever made.",10,1,4,10 July 2001
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Fantastic atmospheric horror
","Of all the mythological scary creatures, none might be as popular as the erotic and malevolent 'vampyr' especially when Hollywood comes into play (11 vampiric movies come to mind right away: Nosferatu, Dracula, Phantom of the Night, Salem's Lot, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Interview With the Vampire, Night Flier, John Carpenter's Vampires, Blade, Dracula 2000 and Shadow of the Vampire). Hollywood doesn't always make good vampire movies, but they sure do give it the ole college try. And Bram Stoker's Dracula, starring Anthony Hopkins, Winona Rider, Gary Oldman and *shudder* Keanu Reeves, is one of the best.This version of Dracula tells the story of Prince Vlad Dracul (Oldman), who renounces God after his fiancee commits suicide and drinks her blood as a replacement for holy life. The result is eternal undeath, and the story picks up at the turn of the 19th/20th century. Here it is the same old story. Dracula entertains real estate agent (Reeves) and falls in love with agent's fiancee (Rider). Lots of sex, lots of violence. Dracula is tracked by obsessive doctor with extensive knowledge of diseases of the blood (Hopkins). Lots of Latin, lots of crucifixes, lots of decapitations. Climax between Dracula and the fiancee and his pursuers. End. Credits.
This is not to undercredit the plot, for it is indeed wonderful. It is excellently-paced and atmospheric to the core - this is definitely one of the best atmospheric horror movies ever. Coppola's directing is superb, using light and shadows to create a fairy-tale unreality at first, and later a brooding malevolence that culminates in the final red-tinted climactic sunset chase. Coppola also uses jerky camera movements and hectic splicing to create first-person views that are both real and dreamlike. And he uses these to perfection. Dracula is a pleasure to watch and soak in the atmosphere.The acting is fine all around. Well, almost all around. Oldman is fantastic as the many incarnations of Dracula, lending the role the vehement evil it requires while adding the melancholic longing necessary to the plot. Hopkins is not disappointing. He is a first-rate actor and provides a first-rate performance as the eccentric yet intelligent Dr. Van Helsing. Rider proves herself capable to stand beside Bette Davis and Ingrid Bergman as one of the greatest actresses of all time. Her portrayal of Mina Murray, the fiancee torn between the suave and handsome Prince Dracula and her true love Jonathan Harker, is heart-wrenching and pity-inducing. Unfortunately that leads to Harker, played by the abominable Keanu Reeves.
Reeves is a hack actor, incapable of playing even the least demanding role (and this one was not very demanding). His stone-faced, surfer-boy acting in the face of the greatest evil he has ever come in contact with is deplorable. The fact that someone dared cast an actor this terrible in such an excellent movie is disturbing (the same should be said for The Devil's Advocate and The Matrix, as well). Reeves is the lone blemish on this movie, and while he doesn't ruin it altogether, his presence on the same set with actors such as Hopkins, Oldman and Rider is ludicrous and unfortunate. The only thing Reeves does well in Bram Stoker's Dracula is narrate Harker's diary, which is not surprising considering how narration is generally monotone anyway.But -- with the exception of Reeves (and everything good about Dracula must be used in this context) -- 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' is not only one of the best vampire movies ever, it is one of the best movies period. Fine acting, perfect directing, interesting plot. And enough violence to make even the generally brainless modern-slasher fans happy.10/10",10,1,3,26 July 2001
Vanilla Sky," Incredible!
","The trick with movies like this (THIS: Vanilla Sky, Fight Club, The Sixth Sense to a lesser extent) is to watch it twice. After first watching Vanilla Sky, I came away impressed, both with the artistic merits of the film, and with the plot itself. But upon second viewing, knowing the ending ahead of time, I was blown away by all the subtle intricacies that are right under the audience's noses but seemingly unapparent.Enough people have debated it on here already. Suffice it to say that Tom Cruise proves himself yet again as a spectacular actor and Cameron Crowe creates a monumental movie, a masterpiece. This is not only one of the best movies of the year, but one of the best of all time. An intelligent romantic thriller not seen since the days of Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock...10/10",10,1,2,3 January 2002
Final Destination," One of the funniest movies ever
","Some very minor spoilers hereinFinal Destination is def. one of the funniest movies of all time. Aftera slew of teen slasher movies, it's refreshing to see a movie takeitself so seriously and still be so funny...Having seen so many people give this movie rave reviews, I mustconclude that they are reviewing in the sarcastic, self-parodicnature of the film. This movie contains middling acting, a terriblescript and absolutely awful realism.I understand that we shouldn't expect an awful lot of reality, butwhen a movie takes its premise so seriously, one would expect itsdeath scenes to be a little better than 'coffee mug cracks, leaks oncomputer, causes electrical shortage, computer explodes, glassimpales woman wo runs into kitchen. Flames follow trail of leakedalcohol after her, where she collapses and the flames cause thekitchen to catch fire, while she reaches for a towel and succeedsin dropping a set of knives onto her, and one of the knives dropsdirectly onto her chest, point down. Sorry folks. If death reallywanted to knock em off, the bus idea was a smarter way to go.To see so many people praise this movie is revolting. Even amongthe long line of slasher movies, this is not very high. Starting withPsycho, there is a fine list of horror movies that involve serialkillers with knives and other sharp or unusual objects. FinalDestination does not contain the originality of Psycho orHalloween, the plot of Candyman, nor the self-satire of Scream. Itcontains NOTHING.Most of the death scenes are laughable to any fan of horror moviesthat actually knows the horror genre started long before 1978. Sowhat do you say about a movie that offers nothing but ahalf-original ripoff of an overdone genre quickly in decline and notworth keeping up with?Well to answer the final lines of the movie: 'Who's next?'Who cares?3/10 for some shock value and the creative decapitation",Null,1,2,15 September 2001
The Godfather," A victim to its hype.
","When a movie is listed at No. 1 on the IMDb, and when this same movie is ranked No. 3 by the AFI, it has got to be a good film. And no one doubts that is what The Godfather is. Indeed, the acting is incredible, the directing awesome, the plot good and the climax shocking and beautiful.Overall the movie is great, surely deserving a place in the Top 100, Top 20, maybe even the Top 10 (although not mine personally). But I truly do not see No. 1 or No. 3. I really can't place my finger on it, and perhaps another viewing on a better-quality tape will help, but it seems to me that The Godfather's hype has gotten to the point where enjoyment of the movie is starting to be flawed because of it. 9.5/10",6,10,23,1 August 2001
