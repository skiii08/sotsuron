The Devil's Advocate," Challenging film
","Reeves is hotshot southern lawyer recruited by Manhattan firm.  Pacino is managing partner with, shall we say, unusual powers.  Reeves is presented with moral issues in a way that seems pretty appropriate, that is to say, entirely unusual for Hollywood which normally has its own unfounded moral agenda.  This is one of a small handful of lawyer movies I can stand to watch.  It's a good show.",9,2,2,18 June 2003
Ford v Ferrari," v Shelby v Miles
","Automotive geniuses sell their soul to corporate bureaucracy in effort to develop killer endurance race car. Carroll Shelby, the most beloved car designer in American history, faces the music when it comes to dealing with the Big Boys. His desire for endurance race success coincides with Ford's corporate decision to get racier, inspired by Lee Iacocco (the father of the Mustang). After that it's all individualism vs. corporate bullxxxx. I think Damon is the most reliable star out there, and it's a stretch but not too much of a stretch for him to play country outlaw Shelby. Bale is also stretch but a workable stretch for the equally individualistic Miles, a Brit racer and car designer. Henry Ford II is also magnificently played. The CGI was under control, the movie ran long but not unpleasantly so, the wrap up was a tad awkward but that happens. Appears to have captured the basic facts and feelings of the true life events, for which it deserves kudos. Could be enjoyed by non-racing fans.",9,8,16,21 November 2019
The Mask," Great Carrey vehicle
","Fantasy star vehicle is good clean fun, as meek Carrey finds mask that gives him extraordinary abilities.  Cameron Diaz (in her first movie) is an absolute babe.  Carrey getting to act wild and Diaz at her finest is good enough for me.",8,0,0,21 May 2000
Moneyball," A great GREAT baseball movie
","Brad Pitt portrays Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane in a semi-accurate rendition of the A's 2002 season. The A's have lost three key players from a 102 win season and Pitt challenges his manager and scouting staff by using statistical analysis, rather than traditional scouting, to select his new players. Pitt's portrayal of Beane, a one-time top prospect as a player who failed miserably in the big show, is Oscar winning stuff. The rest of the cast is equally good - there is top flight acting throughout this movie, including a truly engaging performance by Kerris Dorsey as Beane's daughter. Beane himself is portrayed as part recluse, part prick, part realist, but always committed to winning despite his small budget. Not that this movie is without concerns. Doing something like this with characters from real life raises a real issue - this is not a completely accurate portrayal of the 2002 Oakland A's. The movie ignores the stars on the A's at that time and makes it look like Beane did it all with smoke and mirrors. In fact, he had two of the best young pitchers in baseball and current or future all-stars at shortstop, third, and in the outfield. So sit back, enjoy the movie but accept that there's some Hollywood mixed in there.",10,0,1,27 July 2013
The Avengers," It all fits together
","The most recent Marvel comics film efforts have had several things in common - excellent casting, just spot on casting; great characters developed for years through the Marvel comics; good dialogue; but often muddled and/or derivative plots, and usually overlong. For example, Spiderman 3 had chunks of useless segments and a plot shamelessly recycled from earlier Spiderman movies, interspersed with some gorgeous moments of action. This one is interesting. It wouldn't have been as effective without all the introductory movies for many of the characters, including Captain America, Iron Man and Thor, which actually set the table for this main course. The collection of heroes make this movie greater than the sum of the individual works, it just fits like a glove. There are so many good performances - Evans is good again as Capt. A; Downey has made Iron Man his own, and he's got most of the best lines; Ruffalo is amazing as The Hulk; Johannson is solid as the Widow; Jackson and Gregg fit as Nick Fury and his top agent; and just maybe Renner trumps them all as the unflappable Hawkeye. I saw this with my youngest in 3-D, the next night I went back with both my kids and saw it again in 3-D and enjoyed it just as much. Hiddleston does an admirable Jaye Davidson-esque turn as the bad guy, with some help from an other-worldly invasion force. The CGI stuff works, interspersed with some eye-opening live action. The best moment comes when the camera does a slow 360 degree circuit of the Avengers circling the wagons in NYC. There's a lot going on here, and there still is some fat mixed in with the meat, but as a whole this thing just works grandly. Very highly recommended.",10,6,13,22 June 2012
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Pretty and uninvolving
","Well-filmed but stuffy version of acclaimed book about mystical caddy who assists has-been golfer in the match of his life.  Similar alot to The Natural - scenery and characters are good (who would have thought D-Day would grow up to be Walter Hagen?), overall effect is stilted and almost gothic, and Vance's pearls of wisdom are unbelievably banal.  No better than a wash.",7,1,3,20 June 2003
Vertigo," Been thinking a lot about Kim ...
","At least that's what Jimmy has been doing. Our boy is a former detective with an understandable case of trauma-induced vertigo whose weakness gets him played as the sap in a murder scheme. Along the way he gets sucked in by Novak, looking even better than she normally does (which is always fantastic). Fascinating study of obsession with a woman, in this case with a woman Stewart mistakenly believes is dead. Or does he? I didn't originally like this film as much as some of the more mainstream Hitchcock, Jimmy sure seemed to be wound uncomfortably tight. But I've come to slowly appreciate it through piecemeal viewings over the years, and NOBODY plays the unfathomable beauty better than Kim. At least to me there's some unanswered questions in this one, including when Jimmy is consciously or subconsciously on to the game. Great stuff with fantastic scenery.",9,2,3,18 June 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Howard Stern Syndrome
","It's really a shame that most of America will never realize what a comic genius Howard Stern was (and may still be). From about 1984 to 1988 Stern was the funniest man in America. From that point on he spiraled down, caught up in a self-destructive obsession with garbage and pushing the envelope on common decency. Plus Howard just got lazy. I see a little of the same phenomenon with Cohen. There's no disputing that portions of this movie are very inspired & outrageously funny. But Cohen goes over the decency line so many times it eventually became unwatchable. I have other problems with this movie - are we supposed to believe the other 'actors' think this is a valid documentary? If they're not in on the joke it all seems pretty mean-spirited and makes me uncomfortable. If they're in on the joke then what's the point? I understand that 'tasteless' in itself has its own mindless, Wet Hot American Summer market, but this is one movie I think might have benefited from some responsible studio oversight.",4,5,10,1 January 2007
Gremlins," Good movie gone bad
","Like the little furry guys themselves, this is a movie with a very promising start that ends up nowhere fun.  Axton picks up meek creature, unaware of consequences if simple handling instructions are ignored.  End result is a bunch of little monsters that terrorize small town.  The intro is fine, Phoebe Cates looks spectacular, and some of the initial monster action is amusing.  But like too many in the Spielberg/Lucas action-fantasy genre, film is gory, unpleasant and mean-spirited when the going gets tough. Not recommended.",7,0,1,25 December 2002
Miracle," Maybe it's just me
","There's a but coming up. Well-filmed story of the 1980 U.S. Men's Ice Hockey team's gold medal performance, long before the dreadful 'Dream Teams' and corporate over-sponsorship, and probably what was and will be America's greatest Olympic moment in my lifetime. I'm the first guy to bitch when they 'Hollywood-ize' a movie, you know, they take the basic story and then add so much fake stuff. And I think Kurt Russell is just tops, I mean, if they made Remo Hightower football shoes I'd go out and buy two pairs. I'm old enough to pretty clearly remember this and the context of the political times. That's part of my problem, this movie is so close to the real thing I ended up Jonesin' for a documentary about the real thing rather than this rework. Or maybe I'm just too old. 8 out of 10",8,2,4,31 July 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You can only do this so many times
","Great special effects, cool performance by Neeson, but how many times can you run this plot out?  Would have liked to see something a little different from Lucas.  Samuel L. Jackson unconvincing as Jedi master, Jar Jar Bates cannot be excused as kid-fodder.  BUT Neeson does handle a light saber like nobody's business.  Look for Anakin to somehow be sucked into dark side by devotion to mom in sequel.",9,1,3,17 October 1999
50 First Dates," Adam & Drew together again...and again...and again
","Wedding Singer duet team again in story of commitment-phobic Sandler who meets his dream girl Barrymore. Fact that, due to freak accident, Drew can't remember anything from one day to the next makes it even cleaner for Sandler. Or maybe not? Leads have the same chemistry that made Wedding Singer work. I'm not sure about the details of Barrymore's memory problem, it doesn't seem quite right, but the stars do their best even if it does play like a backwards Groundhog Day. Moderately effective supporting spots including Drew's family and Sandler's friend Schneider. Wraps up very nicely. Docked a point for frequent, excessive and pointless vulgarity from Schneider and some elderly Hawaiian gentleman. Obscenities from old people was, I think, blase' even before Sandler was born. 8 of 10",8,0,0,22 August 2004
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best of its kind
","Spielberg's homage to mid-century serial actioners comes off flawlessly, marred only by the characteristic excessive Spielberg gore. Ford is a whip-toting archaeology professor not afraid to leave the classroom in search of artifacts. The Feds talk him into going for the Ark of the Covenant just when the Nazis are headed in the same direction. When the twain meet Ford is short on firepower but long on chutzpah and guile. A spunky Allen comes along for the ride as a once and possibly future romantic interest. Loads of action, top-notch production values, a fair share of comic relief, and very good supporting cast including Freeman as unscrupulous rival and Rhys-Davies as helpful Arab. At the time this seemed like the first of a new breed of movie, looking back this one stands alone as the only one that really worked. Followed by the unwatchable Temple of Doom and the cult classic Lost Crusade (a cult I haven't joined).",9,0,1,19 February 2005
Deja Vu," Denzel in distress
","This is good stuff even if you're not a big sci-fi fan. Crazed patriot blows up New Orleans ferry killing hundreds of people. Denzel is a federal officer investigating the explosion. In the process he identifies Patton as being intimately, if unwittingly, a piece of the crime puzzle. A little further along he stumbles upon Goldberg and his crew, who seem magically able to watch events happening four days in the past. Add some sci-fi spice and garnish and Denzel is trying to rewrite history. Patton is enchanting as the unwitting victim and Denzel is on his A game in a role made for him, as is Goldberg. I dare say this is as good as any Denzel movie out there. Lot's of good excitement with a satisfying if very unexpected wrap.",10,0,0,21 December 2016
Casablanca," Hollywood's Greatest
","As Leonard Maltin says, 'everything's right' in this movie about Vichy-occupied Casablanca in World War II. Bogie is the ambiguously ex-patriot proprietor of Rick's Cafe with Wilson as his loyal sidekick; Rains is the amoral (or is he?) local constabulary; Greenstreet is the owner of a neighboring saloon; Lorre does a stretch as a conniving weasel. Then Bogart's old flame Ingrid blows into town with resistance leader Henreid in tow and everything goes upside down. Almost every line is a gem, whether it bristles (most of them) or is so overdone as to be awesomely camp. The only arguably slow part (and it suffers only in comparison) is the extended Paris flashback. I think this is Bogart's signature performance, a notch or two above his (or pretty much anyone else's) best work. Bergman is breathtaking as his old girlfriend; and all the supporting characters shine in their own way, particularly Rains, who may actually have as many memorable lines as Bogart. Worth multiple viewings, it gets better each time. I've seen lots of great movies but never really question whether this was the best.",10,1,3,7 April 2005
Minority Report," Gross gross gross
","I would like to watch this movie.  I really would, the idea sounds interesting.  But every time I turn it on, something incredibly gross is being shown on the screen.  My congrats to those of you who survived to the end, you're a better man or woman than I.",Null,0,1,20 September 2003
Erin Brockovich," Nice people-vs-The Man drama
","We've seen it all before in one way or another, but this is a nice entry in the little-guy-triumphs genre.  Julie Roberts stars as paralegal who establishes solid toxic tort case for residents near power plant, but Albert Finney shines as the somewhat reluctant attorney who she works with.  Hard to tell what in the story really happened, and what has been Hollywood-ized, but interesting nonetheless.",8,0,0,8 April 2000
The Death of Stalin," A smashing success
","Brilliantly written and acted, Death of Stalin highlights the scramble for power in the USSR after the death of one of the most despicable leaders in world history. I often criticize historical and particularly Biblical films for taking too much license with the facts, somehow in this case the satire allowed a compression of events and played even better than the raw truth. Steve Buscemi in ordinary life looks nothing like Nikita Khrushchev, nonetheless he is outstanding in the role and the driving actor in the film. The recent spate of historical films is refreshing, and this stands right among the best.",10,1,4,7 April 2018
Meet the Parents," Spectacularly unfunny
","Stiller meets his girlfriend's parents, including former spook De Niro. To describe the humor as broad would be an understatement, but regardless of description it's not very funny.  Question - when Hollywood identifies characters as Christians why do they always make them out to be nasty dopes? Answer - I don't know, and I don't know why this movie is so bad either. 5/10",5,2,3,14 December 2003
Star Trek," Outstanding just Outstanding
","First I have to qualify myself. I'm only an original Star Trek guy (including the movies with the original cast), I'm not a Next Generation or other brand of Star Trek fan in the least.You really need four things to make these go, when the characters are so entrenched in our culture - 1) great casting, 2) good plot, 3) good dialogue, and 4) good special effects/action. The casting of the two leads Kirk and Spock are just fantastic, they are better than copies, they are just so damn good. Uhura, Scotty and Sulu, if somewhat different in appearance, are still very acceptable. The only off character is McCoy, but I never felt he was essential to the show and the new guy at least says the same sort of cranky stuff the original did.The plot of this movie is very good, the only problem I have with it (and it gets docked a point for it) is that it invalidates some important 'facts' from the original, such as the existence of Vulcan and Spock's mother being around. Seems like they could have had their cake and ate it too rather than diverging as much as they did from the original source.Dialogue is good, while part of Scotty's character was his very healthy look, the new guy besides being a skinny geek gets the brogue and the lines spot on. The special effects are also very good.Nice effort, let's see if the studios do what they usually do, drop their standards on the sequel and end up with trash for Star Trek II. But a very nice first effort.",9,0,5,4 December 2010
Fight Club," I don't think so
","*Spoiler I guess*  Violent film about manly therapy through secret fight club has good start, intriguing premise and sharp actors but founders about Round 6 and ultimately is out on a TKO.  The wrap up is about as plain stupid as it gets and essentially invalidates everything before it.  I don't mean to be harsh, but who the heck is voting on these movies on Imdb?  If this is really in the top 40 movies of all time then I'm Harry Houdini.",4,13,31,23 May 2003
As Good as It Gets," Okay I guess if you like Nich
","I think Nicholson and De Niro are similar in that if you buy their schtick - particularly at this point in their careers where their 'personna' carries their parts - you'll love their movies.  If you're in the minority like me that doesn't enjoy their act, then movies like this aren't much fun. Jack is curmudgeon who tries to break out of his shell with waitress Hunt. Not for not-Jack fans. 6/10",6,0,2,13 February 2004
Darkest Hour," Outstanding even with some minor flaws
","I cannot remember the last time I was in a movie and I said, gee I wish this movie would keep going because it's just so damn good. I don't really have to say anything more about Oldman beyond what's already been said, that was brilliant Academy Award work. Despite being a literalist on history and not enjoying Hollywood embellishments/contrivances that didn't really happen, I will repeat something I said on another movie (Patton): I am okay where a fictional event is one that could have happened (or maybe happened out of time sequence) where it is used more to show the persona of the character than to establish an historical fact. Notwithstanding this, the subway scene may have been a little much. Strong cast throughout, including the portrayers of King George VI, Chamberlain, Halifax and Churchill's lovely secretary (James). A must see for WW II buffs and appreciators of good cinema everywhere.",10,191,248,23 December 2017
Memento," This movie's upside down !
","Does your memory play tricks on you? Leonard's problem is a little bigger. Struck on the head during the murder of his wife, Leonard can't (as he says) 'make new memories' - that is, he has no short term memory after his injury. Through the use of notes and tattoos Leonard, a former insurance investigator, tries to solve his wife's murder. Problem is that his investigation restarts every 20 minutes or so, which can leave him subject to manipulation by others with their own agenda. And to make things even more interesting the movie is shown backwards from the most recent event to most remote. Pearce and Pantoliano are both excellent in the leads. The problem with these trick movies typically (I'm excepting Pulp Fiction but including movies like Wild Things) is that the story-telling is somehow dishonest. Here that doesn't seem true, as much as possible they fairly accommodate the viewer within their considerable constraints. I have a different problem - I'm not willing to accept that perception is reality, and I'm not Leonard (who would have forgotten most of this movie by the end anyway), so when I've invested a couple hours I want to have some idea of what really happened (like, is Leonard's wife really dead?). That's my knock, but I give them credit for a fantastic execution of a unique concept.",10,0,3,8 December 2005
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Caution - This is Not Star Wars 8
","Walking in I was assuming this was Star Wars 8. It is not. It is actually an independent story based upon one off-handed line delivered a long time ago in a movie theater far far away. I'm so daft that it wasn't until my 11 year old enlightened me going out of the theater that it all fell into place. The Rebel Alliance is afraid to oppose the Empire with its new rumored planet killer. In to the mix steps Jyn Erso, daughter of the unwilling weapons designer for the Empire. The Alliance receives information about a potential weakness in the planet killer, and Erso and Cassian on their own initiative set out to obtain its structural plans. They are assisted by, among others, a blind fighter and his friend, ably played by Yen and Jiang. Their primary foe is Director Krennic, the latest in a line of weasel Empire leaders. As it was I was sort of wondering throughout how this all fit in with the series, I kept seeing strangely familiar faces unexpectedly. Jones and Luna are the real deal in their starring roles, the CGI is quite fine and not herky-jerky, the running time was good and the story just kept moving. There are a lot of worlds presented, all in their visual glory. For those who like hanging at the beach the last world is the best of all, although there isn't a lot of sun-bathing going on when we see it. Highly recommended, I might have given it a 10 if I had known exactly what this was about in the big picture, but I think the uncertainty of that was supposed to be part of the fun.",9,2,8,17 December 2016
Iron Man 2," Second time not a charm
","Unlike some of the other recent Marvel titles, this sequel clearly failed to deliver on the promise of the first in the series. Which is not unusual in the least, Hollywood sequels being almost always trash (but not necessarily so with Marvel sequels).Downey is back as the tired, flaky billionaire weapons magnate, only this time around tired really is tired. Paltrow and Cheadle are thrown supporting roles which use none of their considerable talents (the guy who had Cheadle's role in the original is actually better for the part). The whole production seems entirely uninspired, much of the movie is endless talk talk talk leading up to two techno-fight scenes. Which leads us to the other problem, the fight scenes when they do occur are so computer-generated they are almost impossible to follow (like in Transformers II, another movie which bears more than casual resemblance to this one). And the 'climatic' fight is almost over before it begins, like nobody cared at the end of this. The stuffing of this movie is just sort of crammed meaninglessly together, including the SHIELD angle. I find Iron Man 2 so uninspired it's difficult to write an inspired review for it. As with Transformers 2 it was work getting my 5 year old to sit through it. Highly unrecommended.Post-script: Iron Man 3 was almost as good as this was bad, so skip this one and go directly to 3.",4,1,4,9 July 2010
Passengers," Very very nice
","I'm not going to say anything you wouldn't know from the trailer. Lawrence and Pratt, both attractive leads, are unexpectedly awake on an interstellar colony ship where all passengers and crew are supposed to be in hibernation. And it's good they're around, because Houston there's some problems. What I like best is the beautiful scenes of space and the pacing of this movie, it takes its time letting you appreciate the strange surroundings including a wonderful Sheen as Arthur the bartender. My wife says this is combination sci-fi and chick flick, and who am I to disagree with her? That's all I care to say about this at the moment except I like the wrap up. Enjoy.",9,5,9,1 January 2017
42," So Damn Good
","Y'know there is a real danger in doing this sort of movie. If it was made 40 years ago they would overplay (if that's possible) the crap that Jackie had to put up with coming to the MLB. But I checked and it appears that while some liberties may have been taken in a general sense, like in any movie about real events, it looks like the stuff that happens in the movie happened in real life and this is pretty accurate. Truth is Rickey just happened to pick the right guy at the right time. Jackie's ballfield credentials for the Hall of Fame are there even though he started in the majors at age 28, if he had started at say age 22 they might be talking about him among the greatest players of all time. BTW, I started watching this and said to my son that guy playing Branch Rickey is really good without knowing it was Harrison Ford. Great movie and a good lesson for kids (and adults) everywhere.",10,1,3,30 September 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Excellent, beats the first
","I am really enjoying the re-revival of cultural stuff from when I was a child of the 60's, particularly Star Trek and most of the Marvel movies. I have always felt a good Star Trek movie is pretty much equal parts characters, plot, dialogue and believable special effects. In the first run of six Star Trek movies - I don't consider Next Generation to be 'Star Trek' - they got thinner on the plot as the movies went along (sort of like in the original TV series). In its second revival this one is actually better than the first. I think Pine has more range than Shatner as Kirk and also can show a vulnerable side, although for a 60's TV show Shatner's bluster was effective. I can't speak as highly for Quinto, but I don't think there's a man alive who can out-Spock Nimoy. Nimoy WAS Spock so that Quinto acts like Nimoy more than he acts like Spock, if that makes sense. That said, Quinto comes across as too accessible and almost effeminate. They need to show a tougher, quieter side of Spock next time around. No one would ever call Nimoy effeminate. Urban does much better as McCoy than in the last movie. Scotty does very well despite his visual difference from the original, Uhura and Sulu are fine also. This movie starts out a little slow and over-CGI'ed -- a common major problem with current films -- but picks up speed as it goes along. I like the references to the original Star Trek stories but of course they risk credibility each time they do that in terms of series to series continuity. Admiral Marcus could have been played by Robert Lansing but he's been gone for years. Very well done, keep 'em coming!",9,4,7,18 May 2013
Stripes," Great Murray
","May be THE classic Bill Murray movie, with Murray, Ramis, Candy and other oddballs making it in the Army.  There are three general sequences - Murray pre-Army, basic training, and the mission (occurring after Murray and Ramis 'borrow' Army test vehicle with their MP girlfriends).  Each of the sequences are funny, I personally like Murray pre-Army best and the mission least.  Warren Oates as 'Sgt. Hulka' is a modern classic.  Over twenty years later and this is still the reigning service comedy.",9,39,58,29 May 2003
Happy Gilmore," More good Sandler
","Another entertaining entry in the Sandler 90's comedy catalog, this one has Sandler as a frustrated hockey player who finds his shooting skills surprisingly transferable to professional golf.  Spirited supporting cast including Weathers as 'handicapped' golf coach.  Fistfight with Bob Barker is almost classic.  Not Shakespeare but a decent way to spend a couple of hours.",9,1,1,24 May 2003
Finding Nemo," Stretched but largely enchanting
","Animated tale of clownfish dad and son's attempt to find each other after son's capture by Aussie diver. Dad has to cross miles of sea with new friend Dory in tow, while son finds himself part of an aquarium mini-culture devoted to escape. Although he overplays a tad Brooks is right as worrisome father and DeGeneres is spot-on as forgetful Dory. There are portions of this movie that are as inspired as any Disney entry, including the Dory character, the aquarium scenes and the EAC turtles. But I found some other parts tired or forced (particularly the sharks), and generally feel like they were working too hard to pad this out to a 100 minute running time. Watching this (again & again) with my son I find myself skipping through some of the scenes. The final credits are inspired and as good as any part of the movie.",9,0,1,4 October 2005
That Thing You Do!," Flawlessly Done
","Wonderful execution of familiar story - innocent teens make big music hit, this one in the mid-60's during the British Invasion. Big leap, like as in high school talent show to Billboard charts. Scott and Tyler make the film, Scott as the smart and sensitive drummer, Tyler as the radiant squeeze of the band's lead man. Always nice to see Bill Cobbs, here as 'legendary jazz great Del Paxton' - Cobbs has been in 65 films in the last 20 years, I know him as Orvis in The Color of Money ('Orvis, last time I saw you you were sweeping up in McGears'). It is nice that the group's song is catchy since you have to hear at least bits and pieces 10 or so times in the film. Watch for an early Theron as Scott's bored girlfriend. Nice resolution.",8,0,0,7 May 2005
The Mummy," Good slam-bang actioner
","The best 'Raiders'-style movie since the original Raiders, a whole lot of fun that never really lets up.  Brendan Fraser is devil-may-care adventurer returning to lost Egyptian city with attractive Weisz and her nebbish brother (Hannah) in tow, only to run into much more than he bargained for. Fraser may be limited, but his style fits what's asked for here, and Weisz is solid.  Loads of good special effects that don't detract from the plot. Definitely worth a rent.",9,0,0,4 May 2001
The Natural," Sorry, there something off here
","Filming of one of the all-time great baseball novels is a hit-and-miss affair. Redford plays phenom sidetracked, due to bizarre circumstances, from the major leagues until his mid-30s. Atmosphere is great, particularly the Knights' wonderful home park (War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, now history). The supporting cast led by Brimley is uniformly good. But there's something off and it's hard to put a finger on it. It may be that things just all seem gothically over-played. And the upbeat ending spoils the message of the original story, where the bitter climax largely defined the tale. Sort of like filming Titanic without the icebergs. If the book wasn't so inspired it might be less of a fault, but given the wonderful source material to work with this movie deserves no more than a 5 out of 10.",5,8,18,24 April 2005
Troy," Awesome
","As far a I recall, having read the Iliad twice in the past, this is a faithful rendition of the basic story, and it rocks and never lets up from beginning to end. Casting is great, Kruger is breathtaking as Helen (and Byrne equally captivating), Bloom is spot on as pretty boy Paris with some vestige of courage, Pitt and particularly Bana are rock solid as the key antagonists. This is a great story and the movie gives it all of the spectacle it deserves, it's a shame they never ran with Bean as Odysseus in the obvious follow up movie. Greek historical buff and all, it took me literally a decade to watch any portion of this and until this year to watch it from beginning to end. I figured it was just Hollywood trash but I was wrong. Just a great historical movie.",10,1,2,21 May 2017
Insomnia," Nothing like Al Pacino on no sleep
","I was having trouble getting to sleep the other night and this came up on cable, I may have missed the first couple of minutes but I think I got the gist as it went along. Al and his homicide squad partner come up from LA (where their unit is under investigation) and assist Alaskan police on a murder case in mid-summer. Al never quite adjusts to the 24 hour sunlight but that's only one of his many issues. Swank does really well as the local smart, hard-working and appreciative help. Al gives a nice textured performance, everyone sort of has shades of this or that in this movie, as things progress we learn a little more about the characters and what led to the murder. At points Al's eccentric behavior may test credibility but the story moved along well, this is a serviceable cop drama.",8,4,5,8 February 2017
The Day After Tomorrow," The Reel After the First One....
","....is when it's time to give up on this flash in the pan. Much like another 2004 entry, Van Helsing, the first 30 minutes or so are breath-takingly good and the rest is just filler. Here the disappointment is more intense if only because the initial concept is so promising. Weather expert Quaid determines that global warming is going to trigger cataclysmic (and I mean Act of God cataclysmic) weather changes. His warnings go unheeded until most of North America is a skating rink. Almost all of the fascinating special effects are loaded up front. The rest of the movie (Quaid walking to Manhattan to search for his son) seems like a (bad) made-for-TV-movie - hokey, unbelievable, disjointed and uninteresting.

","A true rarity - a big budget, overblown sci-fi movie that actually makes sense, works pretty well and doesn't bore you to death.  Taken from the Marvel Comics classic series about super-hero mutants protecting society from the bad guys (which include evil mutants).  Patrick Stewart anchors the leads as Professor X, and Anna Paquin gives a very understated, very attractive turn as one of his new finds.  Only two complaints - a pointless sub-plot involving the abduction of a congressman; and a sort of antiseptic or formula quality to the story that prevents real emotional involvement (Paquin excepted).  But the fact that it passes muster in other areas puts in well ahead of most of the genre.",9,0,0,6 June 2001
Spider-Man 3," Enuff already with the sympathetic villains
","I have to admit I watch this because my kids like the action scenes. So I've seen the action scenes 50 times and some of the plot stuff zero. Bryce Howard (Ron's daughter) is a very very appealing and talented Gwen Stacy, the rest of the cast is spot on as in all the Marvel productions. And the action scenes are well done, I find Venom a little tough to stomach but the Sandman stuff is spectacular. Now to the complaints - Sandman can't do all this evil stuff and have a heart of gold (like Doc Ock). I'm sorry, I'm just not buying it, it kills what credibility is left in these things. If they're going to do that they can't make the bad guys so evil when they're on their rampage, they have to choose. Plus they already used the killed-Peter's-uncle-theme in Spiderman 1, their attempt to recycle that one with Sandman is so painful, and by the way hasn't MJ been the hostage in every Spiderman movie climax? Isn't somebody supervising the story or script ?! On the plus side Franco does a really nice job with Greenie Jr, so good that saying goodbye to him has to be a mistake. So the characters and acting are good, the fights are good, but some of the plot stuff is just plain LAME even for this genre.",9,2,3,17 January 2009
Midnight in Paris," Great story trumps odd casting and portrayals
","Free lance writer Wilson travels with fiancee McAdams to Paris while struggling with his latest masterpiece. While there he magically travels back in time and mixes with the expatriates and others of 1920's Paris. I loved the story and the characters involved (I watched the whole thing without even knowing Woody wrote and directed it!). Marion Cotillard steals the show as the enchanting muse of Picasso and others, and Rachel McAdams is good and attractive in the thankless role of the rich ditzy fiancee. Owens does well in portraying the enthusiasm with which his character finds the 20's personalities, but he seems more like a college sophomore than a struggling adult author. Someone with a little more sophisticated aura, like a Tom Everett Scott, might have fit the role better. I thought the portrayals of Stein and Hemingway shallow and uninteresting, in contrast to Cotillard's work, but some of the other parts like Brody as Dali were effective. It's all good fun with some unusual twists and turns that may surprise you. Recommended.",8,0,0,21 September 2019
Ocean's Twelve," What did I miss?
","Other than a plot, pacing, snappy dialogue and a coherent and meaningful storyline? This is almost - but not quite - as bad as those vanity pieces that sank Burt Reynolds in the 80's. Let's rehash again some of Hollywood's worst sequels: Jurassic Park II (maybe the worst major motion picture ever made); Another 48 HRs; Back to the Future II; Godzilla; there's a bunch of others that escape me now. What were they thinking when they made this movie?!? There are a few nice little twists, but they're few and little and they come so late in the game that it just doesn't matter anymore. Terry Benedict smokes our boys out - confronts each by surprise in a series of squandered comedy opportunities - and forces them into another even bigger theft to pay him back (with interest). The plot as it unfolds (unravels) is incomprehensible, at least on the first go-round. This time it's all talk, there's no action as a saving grace. And I'm not eager for a second look to try and figure this one out, I'll leave that to someone else for now.",2,0,0,6 May 2005
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The Best Yet
","So Toby Maguire did a nice job but always looked a little too old for the title character. And there were other problems with the early Spiderman, too much slow romantic entanglement and unentanglements, plus derivative plots. E.g., Spiderman III has some great fight scenes a lot of dreary moments and a plot derivative even from its own earlier movies. I didn't like the second Spiderman, skipped II on that. This Spiderman feels quite right, the movie gets extra juice having Tony Stark involved but that's somewhat of a mixed blessing, I might have liked to see a little less Stark in the plot. Michael Keaton has always been a favorite for me, the best movie Batman, and he plays a finely textured villain in this one. Enjoyable movie, they could have cut 10-15 minutes running time without losing anything.",8,1,5,23 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Entertaining ending to what became a formula series
","Star Wars series wraps up (at least Episodes 4-6) with mildly entertaining finale.  Cast doesn't seem as loose as they did the first or even second time around, although they're willing to go through the paces one more time.  Forest planet of Endor becomes the focal point for final showdown between Empire and Rebel forces.  It's peopled (surprise) by cute little spunky, furry creatures.  By this time, story line has aged a little too much, and we're starting to see repeats of earlier plot devices.  You may or may not be able to stomach the Darth Vader-Luke connection (I never could), but at least it's resolved nicely.",8,0,1,17 October 1999
The Polar Express," I'm not buying a ticket
","Here's the problem with many feature length kid's films - they take up 90 minutes or so when they only have at best an hour's worth of material (see Finding Nemo). But instead of resulting in filler material, here the problem infects the entire movie, with everything that happens dragged out to an absurd degree. I mean, really, how many times can we see kids reaching for something fluttering maddeningly just out of reach? And how many times can we see something waft unpredictably for two or three minutes before lighting just where it should be? During editing didn't anyone say, hey, we already did that twice? I have to admit, I didn't hang around to the end (the Hanks character was bizarre and the North Pole looked pretty strange to me). My 4 year old who loves both trains and Christmas had checked out long ago. For once he had better judgment than me.",2,0,3,31 December 2005
Taxi Driver," Great movie
",Just saw this movie for the first time and it really is great.  Has more of a '60s feel to it then something from the disco era.  Great slice-of-urban-life from point of view of loner/cab driver.  Unpleasant scenes never quite become unwatchable; and film's resolution redeems earlier violence.  Killer cast and musical score.,10,0,0,27 January 2001
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Holy Cow what a Ride
","S.H.I.E.L.D. has been compromised. And by compromised I don't mean your grandfather's compromised. It's up to Cap, Black Widow and their new buddy the Falcon to address these startling developments. As usual, Marvel is right on with its casting for the main characters, the new Falcon is great and very well played; Evans and Johannsen need no further comment. Two complaints and two complaints only - 1) as with most modern CGI the sequences are herky jerky and played so fast that half the time you can't figure out what's going on; and 2) the movie is about 15-20 minutes too long. Other than that, the story frequently changes pace but moves at a good clip to a fitting apocalyptic climax, my favorite sequence being when the bad guys bother Mr. Fury. Marvel continues to amaze, this is (again) a sequel better than the original movie, a real rarity in modern cinema. As always, make sure to stay all the way through the credits.",9,3,6,4 April 2014
Life of Pi," And so it is with God ...
","Well, actually, despite going to church nearly every Sunday I don't know exactly how it is 'with God', but it was a good line towards the end of the movie. I'm giving this a qualified ten, which doesn't make much sense, but I found a lot about this movie somewhat hard to follow. On the other hand I found much of this movie very haunting and that is often a good thing. I guess the best advice is to sit back and accept the somewhat different perspective of the movie and enjoy the mind-blowing cinematography as Pi and 'his' tiger Richard Parker coexist on a lifeboat and attached raft at sea. I think it's great when something unusual (and slowly paced, in its own way) hits it big in the box office, so much of what is out now is just the same old rehashed junk from other 'popular' stuff. The beginning of the movie is too harsh for me but once we get down to just Pi and Richard things are magical. I can't embrace the universal religious philosophy but what is presented is positive and upbeat and permeates the entire movie. Nice job on a good story.",10,0,2,2 August 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," Much closer to 11 than 12
","Ocean's Eleven was about as good as it gets in this genre, once you watched it through enough times to understand the tricks. Ocean's Twelve was the worst sort of smug Hollywood sequel misfire. The very good news is that this one is much closer to Eleven than Twelve. Danny Ocean gets the crew together one more time when Pacino screws would-be partner Gould in deal to build start-of-the-art Vegas casino. When the price tag for punishing Pacino gets too high even Benedict (Garcia) gets in on the action. The plot takes a little while to get rolling and the chances Ocean takes with Pacino make him look shy in Eleven, but all that said some (but not all) of the magic from Eleven is back. They try replicating the snappy dialogue from Eleven with some mild success, where Eleven was breathtaking this has more the feel of formula work. But a nice formula it is and the makings of an entertaining evening. 9 out of 10.",9,0,1,26 January 2008
Doctor Strange," Okay with some mild complaints
","I am a Marvel reader from the 60's, my youngest son is also into the Marvel movies. We had been talking for a good 4 years or so about when they could crank out a Dr. Strange, one of my favorite titles from the 60s. So they finally did it and it wasn't a total disappointment even for a perfectionist like me. Marvel is always spot on in casting, no exception whatsoever with Cumberbatch as the charming but arrogant Dr. Strange. I wasn't as hot on their choice for the Ancient One (male , older, and more passive in the comics), that was a bust. What made Dr. Strange so great was 1) Ditko's drawing of the spells and counterspells, and 2) the strange devices and spells the sorcerers used. So to my list of issues: the first and biggest is the fighting, in the comics it was spells/counterspells, they do a little of that here but it is more ninja stuff. That was my biggest disappointment. Beyond that, my concerns were - Dormammu was one of the scariest villains in comics (flaming head), here they trotted out just another scary face; they played too many plot cards, they could have saved some stuff for the next movie (like Dormammu); and it doesn't always have to be the end of the world. Marvel seems to be gravitating towards putting the entire world at risk, that gets old when it's too often and it isn't needed. If they cleaned this up and worked on the spells more the sequel to this could be a great movie, they've set the table okay. But it could just as easily flop, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",7,3,6,12 November 2016
Interstellar," wow
","Hard to describe what this movie is other than it is definitely science fiction. All that said, as with all great sci-fi the magic is in the relationships, so maybe this is best called romantic sci-fi in the broader sense of 'romantic'. McConaughey plays pilot turned farmer when Earth's climate conditions force mankind to focus on its day-to-day existence. Ghost-like messages to McConaughey's daughter, who he adores, lead him to a hidden NASA base working towards finding other livable planets. Spurred on by his love for his daughter, McConaughey takes off for the stars to try and save those on Earth. That's as far as the trailer goes and that's as far as I will go. With any sci-fi this broad there's going to be some stuff that raises questions, in this case the connection between Matthew and daughter trumps any plot holes. This was just exceptional stuff, I wasn't much of a Matthew M guy before but I sure am on the bandwagon now. Spectacular 'cinematography' of outer space is just another great plus. Has richly earned its Oscar for Best Picture.",10,3,9,11 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Vader gave this two thumbs down
","I was only 100% in after the first Star Wars movie ('Episode 4' for millenials). My ardor waned until Episode 1, but it's been downhill steadily from there. I could ask a lot of questions, starting with why did they make this movie? But we all know the answer to that, which is megabucks and if it has a ton of explosions and CGI it's probably going to make that. Curiously, the most entertaining franchise movie by far in the past 20 years was Rogue One, not a member of the Vaunted Nine, that one actually worked the way they all should. Star Wars was never high on character development, by the time we get to this I only care (remotely) for Ridley, I couldn't care anything about anyone else because I have no reason to. And no mix of CGI, funny new worlds and redone old worlds can fix that. My 14-year-old and I left at 1:20 in and never looked back. I don't care how it ended. Enjoy.",4,4,14,22 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Non-stop action excuses other problems
","Fifth in the series (second chronologically) features attempts by the Republic & Jedis to hold off up-and coming (Trade) Federation. Focus is on the hectic exploits of Obi-Wan, Anakin & Amidala, but - like Empire - there's no real resolution, as this is just a high octane setup for the next in the series. Also, like Empire (unfortunately) no lead really shines as Alec and Liam did in other entries; Portman is very attractive but isn't quite charismatic enough to drive the story. The romantic angle is almost wooden, but that's to be expected, almost welcomed, where the emphasis is really somewhere else. On the plus side, loads of stunning special effects (Lucas claims he can do much more now with much less effort, and he seems to be right); and Jar Jar is fittingly relegated to cameo spot. On balance worth seeing.",8,0,2,26 June 2002
Forrest Gump," Simple yet elegant
","Leonard Maltin is usually right on, so I guess he can be forgiven for blowing this one (and for missing Animal House). Sound and Fury-esquire story of idiot savant Hanks, not the sharpest tool in the shed but capable of some simple observations about living. And he gets to make a lot of observations across several decades of an eventful life, in a true tour de force by Hanks. Trick photography, placing Hanks with celebrities of the times, doesn't overshadow main tale of Hank's life-long romance with troubled Wright. Solid supporting cast is highlighted by Gary Sinise as injured Vietnam war buddy; look late for Sixth Sense's child star as Forrest's son. Detractors may be taking this movie too seriously, I don't think it means to be that pretentious. Few movies in the last 50 years are so simply and beautifully told; just sit back and enjoy.",10,1,2,2 November 2002
Ant-Man," No ant was harmed in the filming of this movie
","Modest Marvel entry, we loved the posters where it was all white except for small Ant Man in the middle. Ant Man was an interesting Marvel character, for a while he had his own half-magazine, then he was with the original Avengers, then he got stuck on big size and was part of the new Avengers (this all about 50 years ago). The movie was mildly interesting through an extended build up to the final climatic showdown, but don't expect wall-to-wall action ala The Avengers. Douglas was fine as Hank Pym and Lilly and Rudd also did well in the leads. I don't know whether this has the ammo to be a Marvel staple but I would consider going to an Ant Man II down the line.",8,0,3,27 July 2015

","Renee Z plays a thirty-something deciding (I guess) to stop fooling around and get on with life after getting messed up by Grant. Hugh (the compelling bad guy) and Firth (good guy) sort of compete for Renee's affection. I personally think Renee is one very attractive actress (I actually like her heavier look, what can I say), and she is very cute here in a self-conscious, somewhat over-played fashion. Maybe I've been around too long because I hardly think this one is unusual, I mean the personalized method of telling the story is different but hardly ground-breaking. Seemed to me like nothing more than your pretty typical pleasant romantic comedy. I do like the way this plays out, nice to see the nice guy make out once in awhile. 8 out of 10",8,0,0,24 January 2003
Captain America: The First Avenger," Parts are greater than the sum
","Let's start with the good stuff first. The basic Captain America story is a good one and makes for a solid movie. Marvel ALWAYS does well with casting, and it's flawless again here. Evans, Atwell (wow), and Weaving (Elrond) are all spot on, Jackson in a limited role and Jones are also good if not at this point overused. In my opinion Stanley Tucci steals the show in his early appearances as the gentle scientist who prefers the spunky but skinny Rogers for his project. And the CG action scenes which crop up during the movie are a little more realistic than the cut-action/rock video Michael Bay style, where you can't even tell what's going on most of the time. It also does well in projecting the WWII atmosphere. That being said, this movie suffers from two major flaws shared with other Marvel entries - it's TOO DAMN LONG and it is too derivative in its story line. These movies really don't work at over 1:30, it often seems like there's filler thrown in to stretch the time for network resale (or whatever the reason is). There's very little flow from one scene to another. The plot turns are almost formula, this one has elements of Spiderman I & III along with some Star Wars and Lord of the Rings thrown in. Maybe II will be better, I'm not giving up on this yet, but they need to step it up a little. Given an 8 just because this had the potential for a 9 or 10 but didn't hit the spot.",8,1,5,23 August 2011
Predator," Tough Crowd
","Arnie leads the roughest bunch of 'good guys' you'll ever see in what he thinks is a third world rescue mission. The mission soon becomes secondary to the boys' struggle for survival in dense jungle against an alien who kills humans for sport. Several memorable Arnold lines, particularly directed at Weathers ('pushing too many pencils, Dillon?' 'you still don't understand, do you Dillon?' 'we're assets Dillon, just expendable assets') and the ensemble cast is ready for action, best of a solid bunch being Sonny Landham as the group's expert tracker ('there's something out there, and it ain't no man.......we're all gonna die'). The first hour or so is as good as it gets in this type of movie (whatever that is). I think as the crew gets picked off the movie loses steam, with the final cat and mouse between the Gov and the alien almost anti-climatic. Good score and sound effects - THE best movie for my ersatz Surround Sound.",9,1,2,30 April 2005
Bohemian Rhapsody," Good biopic
","Well done, surprisingly conventional telling of Freddie Mercury and Queen. Malik gives 110% in his portrayal of the flamboyant(!) lead singer, and the rest of the band is also very capably played. There was a little something off with this that I just couldn't identify, something that could be fairly easily corrected but wasn't. I don't know that they fully projected Freddie's enormous live presence, and honestly some of the concert scenes were so obviously CGI-enhanced it detracted from the moment. Where the sequence of events is important I'm a stickler, and I must say this film falsely presented the juxtaposition of some key events, but to avoid a spoiler I'll leave it at that. Despite all of the above, a better-than-average film.",8,2,3,18 November 2018

This group works okay for me, what makes things really special is Gadot and The Flash, they take this movie from okay to very good. I would say that I'm shamed in my aging years to side with DC against Marvel, but Disney has so warped Marvel that it's not really Marvel anymore, it's some PC contrivance. Go Flash!

The Color of Money," Worth repeated viewings
","I have watched this movie several times and it just keeps getting better each time, something I can't say about very many. Newman is exquisite as the ultra sharp, ex-pool hustler who 'gets retired' early in his career and sees Cruise as his ticket to get back in the game. Cruise is effective as a hot prospect with 'too much cojones' and not enough brains', as is Mastrantonio in the role of Cruise's street-smart girlfriend. There are so many memorable scenes and lines from this one that just rattle around in my head years after the last time I've seen it. Excellent and lasting blues score. I used to think this lost focus a little towards the end, now I'm not as sure. Either way, it still seems like a realistic (and a most entertaining) look at the world of pool hustling. 10 out of 10",10,2,4,14 January 2005

I have a natural distrust of Spielberg, most recently from the fictional War Horse, for being overly manipulative with his audiences. I have checked the basic facts behind this movie and they appear legit. If the movie was confirmed on a few other points I would give this a 10 without reservation. Sorry, for me historical movies (and particularly Biblical movies) need to be accurate - subtle deviations from the truth can (to me) create false impressions. As it is Hanks and Rylance (as Abel) are just superb, Hanks seems made for Spielberg's sort of movies. The period work is very impressive and cinematography superb. The story starts slowly but once things get going it moves along very well. This has the feel of Oscar work, just an impressive movie.",9,3,6,23 October 2015

American Beauty," Let's not go overboard
","I read the various reviews on IMDb and they made this sound like the Movie of the Decade. So I figured it was a must-see. I saw it and didn't think it was particularly exceptional. The movie is sort of a sex, lies and videotape meets I Love You Alice B Toklas. Kevin Spacey plays a harried father who decides to 'break out' of the mold. The somewhat stereo-typical supporting cast is good, but this movie is driven by Spacey's performance. Problem is, once everyone has been introduced and after about the first hour, we're all dressed with no place to go. And there's no place to go here, at least no particularly interesting place that the movie takes us. To a younger crowd this movie might seem ground-breaking and I guess it was in some ways, but not in any way I found particularly significant. What I guess was the primary message - that sex with beautiful women/girls really isn't everything in life - seems pretty obvious to me even without seeing this movie. The pop-philosophy ending did nothing to help. 7 out of 10",7,0,0,9 October 1999

Apocalypse Now," I love the smell of napalm in the morning.....
","It smells like......victory. I wasn't there in Vietnam, just a tad too young. I guess it would be possible to do a movie about that war that displays its insanity better, but I certainly haven't seen it. Martin Sheen and crew of small PBR gunboat are sent deep (and I mean DEEP) into the unclaimed jungle to terminate renegade U.S. Army officer Brando. With each mile they travel civilization moves further and further away. Surrealistic film style captures perfectly what must have been the hell of Vietnam in-country (or any other kind of) service. Duvall is memorable as arrogant air cav officer obsessed with surfing even in the midst of bloody shore assault. Sheen (who I think suffered a heart attack during the filming) is Oscar-caliber as an ordinary guy just trying to do his damn job in the midst of bedlam, and Hall does well in role of stoic gunboat chief. As much as anything this movie turned the post-war attitude of many, like myself, who thought at the time that we should have been there. When you go this far out on a limb there are going to be some hits and some misses. Brando and the movie's final episodes are pretty much of a miss (Hopper makes it bearable), but the rest of the movie is so damn good it almost doesn't matter; the trip rather than the destination is the big story. I initially had problems with the Redux version as it adds to an already mammoth running time, but I've gotten to like very much the French colonial sequence and also Duvall's surfboard search. There are few moments in cinema that top Sheen's monologue inner voice talking about his mission and Kurtz on his way into the jungle. Another of those movies I feel like I lived, in this case its unpleasantness (that I also live with) keeps me from stopping by too often.",10,3,3,27 February 2005

","Wenham: Why is it so important to kill this Dracula? Jackman: Because he's the son of the Devil. Wenham: I mean, besides that... Methinks reports of this movie's lack of quality were overstated. Jackman is a monster-hunter hired in 1880 by the Catholic Church (!!) to travel to Transylvania and take out Count Dracula. Serendipity's Beckinsale is a very attractive and very feisty Transylvanite who's been trying the same on her own without success. Wexham (Lord of the Ring's Faramir) is Jackman's assistant along for some comic relief. If you imagine Jackman as a more talky, continental Clint Eastwood you're pretty close. They have the right concept, the right characters and the right effects (AND the right weapons for Jackman, including an automatic crossbow!), they just didn't seem to have much of a clue on what to do with them after the first 30 minutes. So they just sort of mindlessly recycle confrontations after that point. It's hard to even keep up with things except to become certain that more (often hokey) action isn't always better. You do wonder how many more times Beckinsale can bounce off the walls and still be fine. But I guess it could have been worse and I give them some credit for setting the table so nicely.",7,0,1,5 February 2005

","Sometimes historical stories are best described by telling the tale from the perspective of a few individuals instead of trying to give the big picture. The Longest Day and any Michener work is an example. I think that approach works, with some slight reservations, in this one. The focus is on Rylance as the stoic (as it were) small boat captain pitching in; a couple of ordinary soldiers trying just to get out of the trap; and a Hurricane pilot protecting the retreat with developing petrol issues. As you might expect, some of their paths criss cross, which in some ways makes this a little pat, like some Spielberg concoction. It also seemed a little played out and long on time although it wasn't. But the cinematography and the action, particularly the fighter action, is just stupendous and trumps those concerns.

We have this sort of ordinary fungible dweeb in corporate world who becomes the chosen one to save all the fungible dweebs in corporate world from the evil corporate overlord who has his own bizarre plot to freeze all the dweebs for unclear reasons. Along the way we see familiar characters from other fantasy movies, in their own Lego fashion, along with some unique to this movie. The world they present is hardly new (see Cloudy II) and really very unpleasant for kids and dads alike. There are moments of sort of odd and goofy humor and the twist towards the end is sort of interesting but again it doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie. I'm glad for all of the people who enjoyed this, but me and my 8 year old don't share their opinion.",6,4,8,26 February 2014
The Fast and the Furious," Unique and very entertaining
","It's pretty hard at this point in time to call anything 'groundbreaking' in cinema, there's so much trash out there that is either eye candy, mindless or a rehash of some movie made much better years ago. I thought this one rises above other recent efforts largely because of the screen presence of Vin Diesel. Walker is undercover cop out to get behind recent truck-jackings in California. Diesel is an L.A. car hot-shot who is a prime suspect for the crimes. Walker insinuates himself into Vin's group and takes the lay of the land from there. Brewster is very attractive and effective as Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest. There's two things about this movie I think unique - Diesel's character (a strange mix of menace, indifference and personal loyalty), and the focus on the hopped-up econocar culture these guys operate in. I've seen bits and pieces of Diesel in other movies and he seems darker and less effective there, I think he worked well with the quietly upbeat Walker on this one. I'm hoping the new Fast & Furious can live up to this entry, well done!",9,3,4,10 April 2009
Now You See Me," And Now You Don't....
","As with several other movies I see, I tuned in on cable the first time part way through, saw other bits and pieces down the line and finally covered all parts of this movie about the 4th or 5th time around. I've still never seen it in one sitting from beginning to end but I think I got it all now. During staged acts the Four Horsemen, ace magicians all, appear to be invading bank vaults or bank accounts and distributing their contents to the unwashed masses. What is really going on and why? You'll have to watch and find out. Mark Ruffalo, my new favorite actor, plays the FBI agent working with an Interpol agent to break the Horseman. Add Michael Caine, wealthy owner of an insurance company/victim, and Morgan Freeman, the great debunker of magicians, to the mix. Ruffalo and, of the Horseman, Eisenberg, are just great and this is good if somewhat complicated fun. Docked a point because the audience to the big stage acts comes off strangely unreal and hokey, otherwise just grand.",9,0,1,23 April 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A Really Outstanding Movie
","There is no question that time travel can be a tricky thing, but it's used here very successfully to link the old and new X-Men characters to great effect. I have been on my soapbox for the last several years about how high tech has replaced good stories (as in computer gaming). Most of the movies now seem to be four or five high tech scenes that don't look very real involving undeveloped characters with clumsy, padded bridges from one CGI scene to the next (see, e.g., Godzilla, the Transformer movies, the latest Percy Jackson and much of what else is out there). Au contrare here, where the acting is just spectacular (my kudos to the younger Xavier and Magneto, as well as Lawrence, Jackman and others), and the story makes sense and does just fine on its own. In this situation the special effects - and they are good - are just the icing on the cake. And isn't Hugh Jackman a welcome sci-fi version of Clint Eastwood? The actors shine, the plot makes sense, when it all falls together in these Marvel masterpieces it's just a wonderful thing. Highly recommended.",9,0,1,25 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Well, my kid really liked it
","Kind of interesting, we're just off Batman vs. Superman so we've seen two takes recently on the superhero vs superhero deal. As with most else, the DC movie was the less sophisticated of the two, I would have trouble telling you why Batman and Superman were fighting each other, there wasn't much that made sense in that one. I have two (no, three) problems with this one: 1) the fight CGI (UNLIKE The Avengers) was way too fast to follow, it just looks too hokey; 2) the movie was about 20 minutes too long, there's a fair amount of chaff to get through before the civil war; and 3) the plot was just a little too complicated. Oh, and 4) Vision is too powerful to be in this mix. On the plus side Spidey was done very well, the circumstances that lead to superhero vs. superhero were believable (if a tad complicated), and as usual Marvel is spot on in their casting of the new roles. So while I wasn't wildly cheering at the end as some in the audience were it was a pleasant if a little too lengthy watch.",7,2,6,7 May 2016
Ocean's Eleven," Really well-done actioner
","I've had the opportunity to see this movie several times recently on cable and I appreciate it more with each viewing.  The cast is absolutely top-notch and works in great ensemble fashion, the plot is exciting if a little far-fetched, and the direction is excellent.  The quietly macho interplay between Cooney and Pitt is particularly good; the script in general is often memorable with few awkward lines.  The first time around things go so fast it's hard to keep up.  If you saw this once and weren't sure what to think (like me), watch it again, it's worth a second look.",10,0,0,14 March 2003
Avengers: Endgame," At a loss for words
","It's the next day after I've seen Endgame and I still don't quite know what to make of it. So I'll mention the downsides first: 1) Infinity War was a mess, there was just too much thrown at you without making much sense; to expect the audience to recall all the ins and outs of Infinity War was asking a little much; 2) they do some real interesting things here, particularly time travel, but don't overthink (or even partially think) the real complications or it will ruin it for you; 3) some of the stuff that happens either doesn't make sense or runs counter to earlier Avenger movies, and 4) the raccoon from Guardians shouldn't have had a major role. Plus a bonus complaint, how they treated Thor was stupid. On the plus side: 1) the sheer weight of the movie is spectacular, with a few exceptions the CGI doesn't get in the way of the story; 2) the logistics of the plot allows some of our favorite characters to do something magical, deserving and sometimes quite unexpected; 3) the work by nearly all of the main actors is quite good.
So to recap the Avengers book: 1 was the best superhero movie ever; 2 was a disappointing bust; 3 had too much to work with but some of it was good stuff; and 4 was enjoyable with some moderate reservations.",6,0,2,3 May 2019
Independence Day," Slam-bang sci fi
","Technologically advanced aliens descend on Earth and in this one there's no real question about their intentions. Rare combination of excellent special effects, plot, dialogue and acting delivers on repeated viewings, actually, I think this has improved some with age. Career performances by Smith as Air Force pilot, Pullman as President, Loggia as gritty general, even Goldblum as quirky scientist (in a real stretch). Only drawback is some (I think unnecessarily) unpleasant moments with the bad guys mid-way through. This is really the 90's answer to the great sci-fi classics of the 50's. I am at a total loss as to the negative comments and the lousy IMDb ratings, it must be from that crowd that thinks Wet Hot American Summer is Oscar material. I mean it, it doesn't get better than this in sci-fi.",10,2,6,1 September 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Hit and Miss
","I LOVE the concept of this movie as over-complicated as it is. Kutcher has ability to go back, as it were, and rewrite history. His focus is on beautiful neighbor Smart, with whom he was as a child a co-participant in her sick dad's kiddie porn scheme. There's a few other wackos around (more than the ordinary quota for one middle class neighborhood) that make life interesting for young Kutcher. Twist is that each time Kutcher goes back and tries to fix things, other effects from his playing with the past make things worse than they were before. I like Kutcher in the role, Smart is pretty in an intriguing way and otherwise up to the task, but there are some downsides. The movie has some extremely unpleasant scenes that I passed on, it runs too fast through certain segments, it is often (to say it mildly) very difficult to follow, and some times Kutcher's attempts to fix the past are like killing an ant with a flamethrower. But the eventual resolution of the problem, however flawed it may actually be, is satisfying and meaningful in the context of the movie and in its own way. If I could take out the really grim parts I'd give it a qualified thumbs up.",8,0,2,1 February 2006
Days of Thunder," Solid cast can't overcome silly plot
","Before this film came out, there had never been a really good stock car movie (with all apologies to Redline 7000, a pretty good stock car movie and a template for this flick).  The streak continues, as yeoman effort by able cast can't overcome the silliness of the plot.  Cruise is fine as brash newcomer to Nascar, and Duvall is great as always as his crew chief haunted by past failures.  But the Nascar advisor must have been sleeping, or ill or something when they did the actual racing scenes.  And the romantic plot-line just doesn't click.  As a stock car fan, I'm still waiting.",6,0,1,17 October 1999
Blue Crush," Pretty cool surfing
","The gals take on the Pipeline in the beginning and the end of this movie. The filler in between (our star's training focus is challenged by romance with an NFL quarterback!!) is relatively painless as these things go. However they did the action scenes with Bosworth are amazing, I would swear she was on the board with really big waves.  We were at the Pipeline when this was being filmed (with a working title of 'Surfer Girls') but sad to say we're not featured.  Bosworth is very attractive, I don't agree that it's a formula plot, and the surfing shots rival Bruce Brown's work, so the net is positive.",8,0,0,18 February 2003
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Too much CGI, otherwise okay
","I loved the Tolkien works so much as a kid that I often have mixed feelings with Jackson's work - he does a great job of casting and cinematography, but goes overboard where I don't think it's necessary. That holds true here, where the CGI just gets out of control too often in what is otherwise a fairly spectacular if overdone film. The Hobbit was more of a fairy tale than 'serious' fantasy, so I don't take Jackson to task for any plot deviations from the source work. Actually, he develops another wizard, Radagast, in a way that was unfortunately ignored by Tolkien. And he also wraps in familiar characters from the trilogy that fans of those movies will appreciate. His idea to take a book shorter than any of the trilogy and expand it into three distinct movies is also inspired. Great stuff, only marred by the excessive CGI and a way too long running time with too much filler. Unlikely that he will tone it down for the second and third parts but you can always hope... P.S. I have watched the LOR movies many times each. I have no interest in ever seeing this movie or the sequel again. I don't know what that means except it just feels really overlong and overcooked.",8,9,21,15 December 2012
The Princess Bride," Easy romp
","I came late to the party on this, I understand that it has semi-cult status with a different (younger) generation.  Wry fantasy romance sets dashing Elwes against evil Sarandon for the hand of beautiful Wright (and stunning she is).  If it was unique in its day it seems just a pleasant diversion in the post-Shrek era.  Patinkin stands out as expert swordsman on a mission.",8,1,2,17 January 2004
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Unbelievably bad
","It is astounding that, in this day and age, the sequel to one of the biggest blockbusters of film history could be this bad.  What were they thinking?  Who looked at this script before they began filming?  Absurd rehash of Jurassic Park, more implausible in every possible way.",2,1,21,12 October 1999
Avengers: Infinity War," One hot mess
","Two other titles came to mind as I watched this. 'The sum is much less than the parts', and/or 'Way too much on the plate'. As I've said in an earlier review on the Avengers, you get into this superhero escalation where the next movie has to be even more threatening and the evil even more evil than in the last one. Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get. One good thing - Doc Strange is actually using spells now, not just body throws. There's a number of good moments in this movie but it's just way too much and at its essence way too stupid.",6,30,62,9 May 2018

Frozen," Disney as it's supposed to be
","You know something's going on when there's a bunch of girls in the theater that know all the songs and also seem to know most of the lines. That's not to say that it isn't for the rest of us, my eight year old son didn't seem to like the audience sing along part but he hung through the whole movie, and he's not afraid to leave when he doesn't like what's going on. Without going into the plot, here's what's very good - 1) it isn't too long and there really isn't much filler at all, the story moves along very well, to make it go 1:40 or so they put an enjoyable Disney short before it, the way they should; 2) while sort of formula, the story didn't go quite the way I expected it to, nor did I feel particularly manipulated as in some other cartoon features; 3) the scenery was great and the characters were fun without being overplayed; 4) it is always appreciated when they don't do a lot of the smarmy, double meaning adult stuff, they kept that to a minimum; and 5) the songs are really very good, they could throw this on Broadway without much work. Has very much in common with The Beauty and the Beast, only a few notches better.",9,2,7,1 February 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Very very rewatchable
","I didn't get the original Secret Life of Walter Mitty and Danny Kaye always made me uncomfortable. This is a much different remake about a photography processing expert at the to-be-revamped Life Magazine who has to locate the negative for the shot which will cover the last published edition of the magazine. Ben Stiller is usually very accessible as an actor, we can get into his head and relate to his predicaments and his solutions. That is never more true than in this movie, maybe because Ben also directs as well as stars. Kristen Wiig is also fine in an understated manner as the girl Ben would like to get to know better. Some of the fantasy sequences (Walter has a penchant for day dreams, often at the wrong time) were a little hard to follow. But some of them worked grandly, particularly Wiig's acoustic rendition of Space Oddity at the Greenland bar, which is a magical and pivotal moment in the movie. There are many breathtaking panoramas of the places visited by Mitty, mostly filmed on location in Iceland. Each time I see this it grows a little more on me, and the enchanting musical score compliments things very well. This sort of has to be taken on its own terms but on those terms it is a very very nice work.",10,1,1,17 January 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Really good, with qualifications
","Epic filmed version of the second (and weakest) volume of the Tolkein Trilogy. The first time I watched this I got about half way through and said, this movie is so damn good I can't believe it. The acting is great and the scenery and effects are awesome. I'm not quite as excited on later watchings. What has me bothered (particularly during the second half) is when the movie strays from the source material. The original story is one of the great fantasy works ever, why go off in other directions? It's not just that the movie is unfaithful to the book, it's that there's no reason for it to go elsewhere. I'm quite sure there's no one working the script with credentials approaching Tolkien's. So I just don't get with the point of following the books 80% of the way and playing with the other 20%, but I'll reserve final judgment until Return Of The King. Post script: I should have qualified my reservations about the changes - Haldir and the elves coming to Helm's Deep is a Jackson invention and the coolest thing in the Two Towers. Enjoy.",9,1,2,29 August 2003

The Lion King," And I REALLY kept a mostly open mind too...
","Despite the fact that I've seen enough Disney now for two or three lifetimes and don't care if I never see another Disney movie again.

The Game," My disbelief can only suspend so far
","There is nothing quite like Michael Douglas in distress, it doesn't get much better in an action-psycho-drama.  But PUH-LEASE.  The story, about a man caught up in a deadly game apparently run by a big-bucks San Francisco company, makes no sense at all.  Spirited performances by the cast can't make up for plot holes big enough to coast a Mack truck through, and the finale is almost comical.  With some considerable re-structuring of the plot this could have been a good movie.",4,3,6,12 October 1999
Ghostbusters," Last of the Early Sat Night Live Alum Classics
","Hard to believe we've hit the 20th anniversary for this movie and it's as fresh as ever. Fringe educators Murray, Ackroyd and Ramis become professional 'ghostbusters' just in time to tackle horde of evil spirits descending on Manhattan. All three stars were at the peak of their game when this was made -- otherwise great script, characters and city locations. This one periodically moves in and out of my list of 10 favorite movies (I just checked, it's in right now). Followed by the inferior but still entertaining Ghostbusters II. Just about the last of the SNL/Second City alum classic comedies of the late 70's and early 80's (Vacation, Caddyshack, Stripes). Other than the first two Austin Powers movies we've been in a long drought since then.",10,0,0,4 December 2005
Coyote Ugly," Just short of being good
","The bar scenes in this movie are excellent, and the bar concept is great, but there's not quite enough of it to carry the movie.  Rest of time is filled with some of the more tired plot lines in cinema.  I guess you can't do 90 minutes straight in a bar, but I wish they would have tried, given my choices here.  Cast is good, particularly Goodman and Bello, and the bar scenes are alot of fun.",7,1,1,27 January 2001
Gran Torino," Dirty Harry grows up
","If you sort of follow the Clint Eastwood characters through the early Westerns, the Dirty Harry movies, Heartbreak Ridge, and Space Cowboys, this one completes the natural development. Blunt but gruffly caring, Eastwood is one persona I never mind seeing trotted out. Here he plays a grandfather and widower with a secret but serious medical condition who gets in a back and forth with a nasty Korean gang. Along the way he first offends and then befriends the Korean family next door, the children 'Toad' and 'Sue' being particularly exquisitely played, they in part make this movie. Clint's strategy for terminating the gang is unusual but logical in retrospect. I thought the final wrap on this movie could have been done a little better, otherwise it is top grade cinema.",9,0,3,25 April 2010
X-Men: Apocalypse," Good Stuff
","X-Men is really an unusual franchise for Marvel. As an avid reader of Marvel during its breakout period fifty years ago, X-Men was a nice magazine but I would guess not one of their top sellers. Back then the talents were a little more modest, Cyclops and X-Girl were around along with Angel, Iceman and Beast (not blue). As a movie franchise I would guess X-Men is Marvel's top seller, they have gotten a lot of mileage out of the characters and have almost flawlessly crossed over to a younger cast (but for Wolverine). I have seen two or three of the most recent entries at the movies, but even though I have enjoyed them they are not something I die to watch again on cable.Which brings us to the most recent X-Men. Right off I have to say that Marvel excels at casting and the newer X-Men are no exception, the new Prof. Xavier (McAvoy) continues to be spectacular as does Fassbender as the Magnetic One. I thought the rest of the characters are done well also, including Peters as Quicksilver and a stunningly gorgeous Munn as Psylocke. The adversary for the X-Men is an ancient Egyptian mutant who seems too much to handle, the problem with these apocalyptic show-downs is that the next time out they sometimes feel they have to top it (ala Avengers I and II). This movie was not something I would necessarily see again (maybe?) but it never let up and me and my 11 year old never thought of leaving early, well done.",8,16,27,5 June 2016
Slap Shot," As funny as it gets
","Minor league hockey team discovers that brawls and dirty play attract more fans than goals.  Tables are turned when championship-game opponents respond in spades.  Wonderful, free-spirited performance by Newman as team's player-coach.  Lindsay Crouse is also fine as confused wife of star player Ontkean, who has his own unique response to the bloodshed.  You have to watch this just to see the Hanson Brothers in action.  Message of movie has been lost on current-day NHL.",10,12,19,22 October 1999
Back to the Future Part III," Hey, an okay sequel !
","I think with Another 48 Hours I listed several classic Hollywood sequel flops, a pretty easy task. I should have included, if I didn't, BTF II which was a terrible piece of trash. This one goes in a different direction as Lloyd, Fox and DeLorean take their act to the old West. Of course Biff's ancestor is there to make life miserable if not impossible for Fox. Steenburgen provides an unexpected and very touching bit of romance for Lloyd, while Fox amuses himself by going by the name of Eastwood. It's all good fun, climaxed by a wild if somewhat overdone train run. A young Shue works well as Fox's own love interest and the wrap up is fine.",9,0,0,14 March 2006
Patton," Fascinating bio of hard-ass WWII general
","Question: when is it okay for Hollywood to make up harmless anecdotes about a real-life subject? Answer: when you've got the character down so good you can say with assurance what he would have done given the chance. This is the movie bio to end all movie bios, a perennial on my all-time top ten list, with a career performance by Scott that defined Patton as much as Patton ever did. The film takes us from Africa through Sicily to the climatic run across France towards Germany, along the way exploring the general's complex and textured character. Picks and chooses among the real general's most notable moments, passing on his celebrated potty break on the crossing of the Rhine into Germany and his ill-fated attempt to relieve a POW camp. I suspect the portrayal is a tad overdone but forgivably so - Darren McGavin's later portrayal of Patton as a whiny weasel was much further from the mark. Supporting cast-mates Malden as Bradley and Bates as Mongomery are spot-on. I can't speak for you, but this movie is long and I'd still stick around to see more of George in action.",10,26,32,26 February 2005
The Illusionist," Quite a performance
","And I mean by all four significant leads - Norton (of course), Biel, Sewell and Giamatti. In fact, while channel surfing it was Giamatti's silent realization scene at the bitter end that first drew my attention. Norton plays a stunning magician who appears in 1900's Vienna and becomes focal point for investigation into death and possible murder of evil crown prince's fiancée. Sewell does well in challenging role of prince while Norton is as always fine but perhaps a shade too obscure in lead role. Biel was always a primo looker, she's also an accomplished actress in this one. But I have to say Giamatti as the conflicted investigator steals the show. Musical score and period scenery are great. Docked a point for seeming a little too contrived in how it plays, including the (to me) unnecessary opening sequence.",9,1,2,14 January 2008
Hidden Figures," The Devil in the Details
","First I want to say nice movie. But with Biblical movies I am often upset when they deviate from the Bible, I mean what's the point? Why not just use the Bible story? To a lesser extent I feel the same way here. I felt right from the get go that this story about three really smart black women working for NASA in the days of the segregated South was being overplayed Hollywood-style. If you're going to show me discrimination, show me discrimination to these persons like it really happened, not the way it presents most effectively in a Hollywood production with an anti-discrimination agenda. The way this played was so obvious and almost cartoon style that I felt suspicious about the whole deal even where much of the story was absolutely true. So take out the manufactured racial and sexual misinformation because I'd like the real scoop on these wonderful, talented and courageous folks.As I understand it, Katherine Johnson was accepted as a peer by the other persons she worked with - so please tell me THAT story (which to me is much more interesting than the movie contrivances)? Show Katherine being a true educational and workplace genius accepted by her white male co-workers when outside the KKK has meetings and blacks are directed to the back of the bus. All you do by distorting the facts for the subjects of this movie is to give the detractors something to work with. I would have preferred, and appreciated more, a straight movie about what these women achieved along the lines of Race, which didn't seem contrived in the least. For me, dishonestly presenting the details (on which the movie focuses way too much) just denigrates the amazing true story.",8,2,7,10 February 2017
Garden State," Clerks meets The Graduate
","A mish mash that in certain ways reminded me of Clerks (the suburban slice of life stuff), The Graduate (all those close-ups of Zach befuddled by his surroundings), maybe Easy Rider (the grungy quest), and I'm sure a few others out there. Braff returns home for mom's funeral after long absence, hangs with deadbeat friends, meets Portman, tries to sort out life. As we go along layers are stripped off each main character. Slice of life is good stuff for me, but when it gets too quirky too often it becomes cute rather than real, I would vote we got close but never quite went over the line. Braff is fine in reactive role, took me a while to warm up to Portman and to buy the leads' chemistry but I was becoming a believer towards the end. There's no real good way to wrap one of these up, this finishes a little awkwardly but all is well. 8 out of 10",8,0,0,21 August 2004
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Two decent action movies sandwiching dull dull dull
","I think the Star Wars franchise moves closer to the edge of irrelevance with each entry, starting with (in the order actually made) Attack of the Clones and proceeding onward. The first portion of this movie mildly engaged me, the much too long middle portion with Luke and the girl was Star Wars at its meandering, grade school arbitrary philosophical worse, then the action kicked back in and saved my 12 year old from leaving the theater (by a hair). Ridley is attractive and effective, Driver presents fine as the young evil force, but the explanation (if there is one) as to why he went bad is even less convincing than for Anakin Skywalker, and for this to actually work that has to be done better. Star Wars was always light on believable plots or characters, more in the mode of this person is this way and that person is that way, this happens and don't ask anymore questions. No one else does much for me and the graphics are less effective than in the last movie. Add to all that, there was an intervening Star Wars movie which probably wiped the vestigial memory of Star Wars 7 from any normal person's brain, and this is more bust than blockbuster.",6,0,3,31 December 2017
Caddyshack," Flawless comedy
",Old enough to be considered a classic.  This is how the National Lampoon/SNL movies should work but rarely have.  Snapshot of a few days at exclusive country club follows several divergent story lines leading to climatic golf match.  Chevy's flaky Ty Webb and Murray's degenerate groundskeeper are unforgettable characters among a bevy of memorable parts.

Jurassic World," Amazing - this was actually pretty good
","I was a tad shocked when I got part way into this non-stop sci fi actioner and realized I liked the characters and they were believable, the plot made sense, and there wasn't the obligatory gore like when Spielberg is in charge. Pratt and Howard (a fetching Gwen from Spiderman 3) did very well as the two people most involved in handling the mayhem that results when things at your favorite dinosaur park don't go well. Unlike many recent movies, this one did have a soul and didn't just feel like plug-in formula garbage. I like Pratt, I didn't know him before, he gets my vote as a good one for any new upcoming Marvel superhero. Also nice to see geneticist BD Wong back from the original, although apparently learning nothing from his first time around. Recommended.",8,1,6,10 July 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," The Matrix meets The Graduate
","I saw the ads for this when it was out, it looked pretty good but I forgot about it until it hit cable recently. I really like Matt Damon best in quietly underplayed roles, and he works effectively in that style in this movie. Damon is politician who has chance encounter with the stunning Blunt after an embarrassing photo kills his election hopes. He becomes magnetically attracted to Blunt and her to him - with one problem - she's not part of the 'plan' for him. See, there's a group of advanced folks around making people follow the 'Plan', and making adjustments when there's a deviation from the Plan. They soon make themselves known to Damon and make it clear that 1) he isn't supposed to be with Blunt, and 2) he can't squeal on them. It's really sci fi and chick flick all in one, but it mildly worked for me including the upbeat wrap up.",8,0,0,13 January 2013
For Love of the Game," A Love/Hate Relationship
","That's how I feel about this movie. Costner (I'm NOT a Costner fan) takes it so close to schmaltz so many times in so many movies and then actually crosses the line into overdone enough times for me. But he does have a certain charm in some situations, portions of this included. I think Kelly Preston is a fine actress and beautiful in a very natural way, but I'm not buying the Costner/Preston thing in the least. Unfortunately, this movie is chick flick first with baseball a pretty close second. For me the romantic ups and downs are almost physically painful to watch. But the baseball concept is so great and so well done - the old warhorse coming out and throwing one last heroic game - that I am willing to skip or zone through the relationship dreck (it worked to DVR it and zoom through the bad stuff). Reminiscent in its own way of Seaver's 300th win, a truly great sports moment. The always urbane Vin Scully sets the mood perfectly along with a fine musical score, and there are times when I really get choked up. The last two innings of the game are about as good as it gets in sports movies, I mean it. A qualified thumbs-up, just wish they would have reordered their priorities.",7,0,1,30 June 2006
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Pretty good Marvel effort
","Seems likes its all or nothing on Ultron reviews, I would rather put this in the workmanlike Marvel category. It wasn't as outstanding as the first Avengers. On the other hand it wasn't forced or formula (yet), but it didn't seem quite as snappy and fresh the second time around. And the (intelligent) plot went in unexpected directions, which also led to a zig zag feel as we went down the road. The short version is that Hydra's experimentation with the teserak and artificial life leads, with some help from Mr. Stark, to the development of an apparently unbeatable being along with his associated minions.I want to discuss Phil Coulson. I didn't like killing him in Avengers 1, I don't like when movies kill characters off, it seems like a cheap way to develop gravity or drama. I don't need for any good guy to get killed for the movie to mean something to me or to hold my interest. And of course Coulson was such a great character that they couldn't actually keep him dead. I was trying telepathically to connect with Mr. Whedon (I actually did try to get an email address) to suggest that he bring Phil's twin brother back for the next movie, have him be just like Phil, it could be a running joke about how much alike they are and lead to an endless line of twin/triplet/quadruplet brothers if and as they got eliminated. But back to the main issue, there were some wrinkles to this (and the post-party Thor's hammer stuff was just great), but surprisingly some of this seemed a little tired even though the Avengers aren't really very old. Also, the original comic had a problem around issue 15 or so when the team got so good that it was hard to imagine a bad guy that would give them a good fight. It sounds like going forward this and the tired angle won't be as much of a problem, I will be interested in what Avengers 3 looks like. With all that's been said, I would still give this a solid 9.",8,3,8,10 May 2015
Quiz Show," Excellent cast in solid movie
","Good movies tell a plausible story with all its shadings, and leave it to us to decide who are the real heroes and villains.  Who would have thought that a movie about the quiz show scandals of early TV would appear to be accurate and also be riveting?  Not me, who turned away from it twice on a cable showing before I got sucked in.  Great performances from the three leads Turturro, Morrow and Fiennes as well as the supporting cast (including Scorsese!).  Many of the issues raised by the movie remain relevant today, including the degree to which TV can fix its programs.  Highly recommended.",10,0,0,16 January 2003
The Graduate," Ground-breaking
","And you kinda had to be around in '67 to realize just how ground-breaking this movie was.  Lots of new issues not yet addressed by a major film. Bancroft as the bored, aged manipulator and Hoffman as the innocent babe play off each other very effectively.  I think this film ages so well that if it was released today it would be accepted without missing a beat.",9,1,2,26 August 2003
This Is Spinal Tap," Outrageous rock comedy
","Hilarious rock-comedy by Reiner, featuring 'Britain's loudest band', Spinal Tap.  McKean and Guest are perfect as oblivious leaders of the band, reluctant to come to grips with their dwindling popularity and what might be their final U.S. tour.  Great comedic commentary on the rock world, with some amusing (and good) original music thrown in.",9,0,2,25 October 1999
The Mummy Returns," More inane fun
","What can you say? A return to the well with many of the same characters brings mixed results. Fraser and Weisz, now married with child, get caught up in a plot to conquer the world (what else?) involving their old friend Imotep and a new baddie, the Scorpion King, played by cult fave The Rock. If you look at it as a cartoon strip it's easier to take - while much of the dialogue and almost all of the plot are beyond mindless, the special effects and main characters are almost uniformly appealing. Weisz handles her expanded action role very nicely while doing repeated battle with a stunning Velazquez, who also gets a lot more air time. A reserved thumbs-up.",8,1,1,20 August 2002
Chariots of Fire," Awesome
","If someone told you they saw a great movie about the contrasting approaches taken by two runners for the 1924 Great Britain Olympic track team you might think they were pulling your leg. But in fact this is a titanic movie which simply exceeds the sum of its parts. Charleson plays Eric Liddell, a Scots runner who must choose between his belief in keeping the Sabbath holy and his desire for Olympic success. Cross plays Harold Abrahams, a Jewish competitor who has to decide whether to use a professional coach despite the misgivings of his prestigious university. Still doesn't sound like much? Then you just have to see the movie. As with all great movies, the moral dilemmas are presented without judgment and you get to decide. Plus the presentation is as important as the message, the feel of the 1920's permeates this movie. A very deserving Best Picture Oscar winner, far better than the ratings given it by IMDb visitors.",10,4,5,12 September 2010
Where Eagles Dare," Okay, so it's a little bit hokey
","Okay, so maybe it's not entirely believable, but it's a very watchable movie with some neat plot twists.  Richard Burton working with Clint Eastwood is about as good as it gets in a war movie.  And you'll never look at cable cars the same way again.",9,1,1,10 October 1999
Groundhog Day," It's deja vu all over again
","Pleasant comedy about cocky TV weatherman Murray sent unwillingly on Groundhog Day assignment, who has to live the same day over and over and over... Murray has never been better, in a role that requires more than just quick wit. Equal to the task is Andie MacDowell who glows as Murray's producer and possible love interest. For those interested, writer Harold Ramis estimates that Murray was stuck about 30 years on Groundhog Day. Some of Murray's lines are classics that come back to me again and again. Light touch still addresses bigger issues about how we live our lives with nice bottom-line message. Effective musical score and great supporting cast. On my all-time top ten movie list. Very rewatchable, but then again that would make sense....",10,1,3,15 November 2005
National Treasure," A treasure itself
","Every decade or so they get one of these hunt & chase movies right. Cage, Kruger and Bartha track down stupendous treasure based on clues laid out by founding fathers. Keitel threatens to arrest Cage while Bean and his cronies are on Nick's trail with more evil intentions. Most of the clues are contained in or on national landmarks which means some good action scenes in the vicinity of famous places. I'm not saying this is foolproof stuff but it's plausible enough that if I want to pretend it's real I can live with myself. And if you like American history it's a blast. I've never been much of a Cage guy but his style finds a very comfortable home in this one. The interaction between our heroes is fun to watch, including Voight as Cage's skeptical old man, and Bean does well on the dark side. A more cerebral, US-based Raiders of the Lost Ark, certainly no less believable. Highly recommended.",10,0,4,22 November 2006
Hoosiers," Okay so this one chokes me up too
","I don't think there's any question that this movie is the best basketball movie EVER (even better than the classic Teen Wolf), and certainly up there for best sports movie of all-time. I start getting choked up about 20 minutes in and it goes all the way to the end. Hackman is fabulous in sometimes understated role as embattled coach for small Indiana high school, I don't know if there's ever been a sports movie tour de force like Hackman in this one. The period stuff is spot on, the music fantastic and the supporting cast (particularly Hershey) wonderful. My favorite moment, of many moments, is when Hackman gets thrown out of at the end of a game so Hopper can coach. So they threw every sports movie cliché and some new ones into the mix, and the resemblance to the facts of the real 1954 Milan championship are stretched to say the least. It's a wonderful time, don't see how it didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture.",10,1,2,27 August 2006
Pulp Fiction," This has never been done, before or since
","I'm not sure how Tarantino pulled this off, but he did, and he came up with one of the most unusual if not outstanding movies of the 90s. Free-form movie style eschews standard plot lines (and even plot sequencing!) in largely-unconnected story of two hit men and a boxer directed to take a dive.  Samuel L. Jackson is superb as Bible-quoting killer, with a nice comeback by Travolta.  Not for weak stomachs or those seeking a formula plot.  The kind of movie that spawns substandard imitations.",9,0,0,17 October 1999
Thor," Mostly good
","Having been a reader of Marvel comics back in their 60's golden age it's nice, as it was with Tolkien's books, to see them finally coming to life on the screen. This is a serviceable entry in the growing Marvel catalog. Casting is always a strong point in Marvel pics, this being no exception with the well-sculptured Thor, Hopkins as Odin and Loki masterfully underplayed, as well as the impressive Heimdall, guardian of the Rainbow Bridge. There is one scene where we get to look from behind Heimdall on his view of the universe that was just SPECTACULAR, they should have found an excuse to drag it out longer even if it won't transfer to the smaller screen. Now for the complaints - when they do these computerized battles, I find it hard to follow what it is they're showing me - can we slow it down a little, or would that expose the magic? I found the plot muddled. Without spoiling anything, it was a little hard to figure out what Loki was doing and why he was doing it, plus the wrap was a little hard to grasp. But I would say a decent start, if it follows Iron Man II doomed to a disappointing sequel. Hey, when do we get Dr. Strange??",8,0,2,23 May 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," One-of-a-kind classic
","A lesser cast would flounder with this story, about a small-town man who suffers a setback and ponders ending it all on Christmas Eve.  But Jimmy Stewart and friends make the tale truly uplifting rather than sappy.  The rare kind of movie that can actually influence you years after you've seen it.  Supporting cast provides great backdrop for Stewart.  As good viewing the tenth time as it is the first.",10,1,4,17 October 1999
Enemy at the Gates," Beautifully stark
","It took me several tries to make it through this Graphic rendition of sniper warfare in WWII Stalingrad. Law is the prized Russian marksman, Perlman his brazen buddy, Weisz his possible love interest, Fiennes a true believer and Hoskins a solid Krushchev. On the other side Harris is the uncompromising German sharpshooter sent to end Law's run. This is done so realistically that it really doesn't matter how factually accurate it is, it is much more about atmosphere and feel so that individual facts per se are irrelevant. Everyone, including Weisz, Law and Harris are so damn good. A sometimes unpleasant but always gritty and unique look at the nastiest battle in modern warfare.",9,3,4,1 February 2016
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Glitzy junk - and not for little kids
","...and if we had stayed for the whole movie, I'd probably be saying too damn long. Took my four year old to this because he loves transformers. He could take a little over an hour and a half and that was about my limit also. Some of the computer generation is well done, BUT 1) you also need interesting plot and characters (the autobots outshine any person here), and 2) this quick-cut music-video directing style during the battle sequences makes it impossible for me to figure out in the least what is happening. I can't imagine my four year old getting it either. Maybe the quick and constant cutting is done to mask some other problem with computer-generated graphics, I don't know, but whatever its reason it really does not work. And besides which, wasn't Michael Bay the guy asking if they could take their 'brewskis' to the basement in Mystery Men?Hard to figure the target audience for this - the language is above smaller kids, but there ain't much for adults either so I guess it's whatever's in between. This movie reminds me of the decline of computer gaming in the 90s -- when better graphics became available the actual games themselves became much less compelling. This seems like a waste of a lot of people's efforts.",5,5,13,28 June 2009
The Holiday," Decent chick flick has its moments
","Winslet plays the Bridget Jones character, Diaz the Diane Lane part in story of two jilted women trading houses for the Christmas vacation. Kate finds some rewarding relationships in LA, including Black, while Diaz gets involved with Winslet's brother Law in Merry Old. I'm not buying Winslet's deal with Black, it doesn't feel right. Her friendship with Wallach is much more interesting but gets short shrift as the movie develops. Winslet's character also overdoes the victim stuff enough to turn off any regular guy, the girls might enjoy it. Diaz and Law have an interesting fling at first but there's way too many starts and stops. This worked okay for an hour or so but had no place interesting to go after that.",6,0,1,18 April 2007
War of the Worlds," This one stays with you awhile
","Perfect movie for folks who secretly hate modern society. America and the rest of civilization take several steps back towards the Stone Age when aliens appear with a vengeance, and - as in Independence Day - there's really no question in this one about whether they come in peace. The special and sound effects are spectacular. While the characters don't quite keep pace Cruise and Fanning do just fine. I'm really not sure how many leading guys other than Cruise could pull this off. The aliens are about as evil as you might want to imagine (leading to some of the traditional Spielberg excessive gore), but given their nature what they showed could have been far worse. After two hours of numbing horror I would have enjoyed savoring a few more moments when the tables are turned, but at least the tables got turned.",8,0,2,2 December 2006
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Very cool movie
","It took a little getting used to but I really enjoy this movie. Fortunately they play it so much on cable I certainly get my opportunities to check it out. Being in my fifties I have no clue as to the current youth culture, but this certainly has the right feel to it. Cera is a band member who Dennings spends some time with as a lark and then they quietly start growing on each other. The stars have some real chemistry and they are believable in their roles, I was unfamiliar with them before seeing this. I hate to keep saying this with new movies but elements of this have all been done before (Caroline is a knock off of a character in Foxes, even looks the same), but it hasn't been done in quite the same combination. Good fun.",8,0,1,28 February 2010
To Kill a Mockingbird," Breathtakingly good
","One-of-a-kind movie about modest rural lawyer Peck assigned to represent black man wrongly accused of rape.  Twist is telling of tale from the viewpoint of Peck's young children.  One of those rare movies that makes you feel like you actually lived the film, with a poignant but under-played look at Depression-era Southern blacks.  Some hard moments to swallow, but it really does not get any better than this.  A top ten all-time must-see.",10,0,1,1 March 2002
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers
","I saw the trailer for this in the theater and wanted to check it out but my 11 year old regular movie companion passed, he was probably right at least for him. Cruise is an army officer with no taste for combat who gets railroaded into active duty against, well, one really tough bunch of alien invaders. Just by chance he happens to come into contact with a strange alien substance in his first battle and finds, after being exterminated, that he wakes up one day earlier being rousted (again) for duty. When this happens several times he is a much more capable fighter and begins to enlist the aid of Blunt, the 'Angel of Verdun' who had the same thing happen to her some time before. Cruise continues his trial by error, getting further along against the aliens each day with the help of Blunt.There is a grim humor to this, along with some pretty scary scenes. Whether you like Cruise or not there are certain movies just made for him, see War of the Worlds, and this one is right in his wheelhouse. Blunt is equally fine as the no-nonsense warrior. I thought the script was very intelligent and very involving and I highly recommend this movie.",9,0,2,22 November 2016
Whiplash," So how much is too much?
","I put on a spoiler alert even though I'm not telling you how things go. There is no doubting the intensity of this film and the mano a mano between Teller and Simmons (who is flipping great). It raises the celluloid question of how much motivation for a student is too much? Simmons and Teller certainly explore the limits, as each gives up everything else in the grind towards perfection. I almost gave up several times myself because the intensity was more than I wanted to watch, but I did come back in the end. And it was a good thing I did because the ending literally makes the movie. Dare I say, the end is the only finale they could rightfully have. So hang in there because it's worth the trip.",9,1,3,19 February 2017
Kingpin," Not my cup of tea
","I don't get this movie at all, I find it plain uncomfortable to watch. Is it supposed to be a funny Color of Money?  I'm not a Woody Harrelson guy, the Amish are the world's tackiest comedy target, even the Bill Murray character is a little too bizarre to really enjoy.  Gutter ball.",4,0,3,27 May 2003
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," More appreciated the second time around
","I really like Mr. Winslow's lead comments, they pretty much sum it up for me. In retrospect The Hobbit only had two feature length movies in it (at MOST), fortunately a lot of the meat of the real story was left for this finale. I thought a lot about this - this is the tell: in the Lord of the Rings movies there were extended battle sequences but not extended personal battle sequences, which sort of exposes the attempt to fill the time; I found some of these personal battles tedious. In the LOTR movies the problem was cramming all of the material into the allotted time. Here it's the opposite (less so here than in the earlier Hobbits), so we see too many individual fight sequences which last too damn long. On the plus side the battle at Dol Guldur was excellent even though it wasn't set up very well. Dain of the dwarfs was great and Thranduil as king of the Woodelves very interesting. But the source material just isn't up to the LOTR and Jackson couldn't make up the difference. All that said, this is an impressive production and easily the best of the Hobbits, it's just that I'm such a Tolkein nut I won't live easily with less than perfection. I have to say I liked it considerably more the second time around than the first - in the first viewing I was comparing it to how I would have run the story, in the second I took it more on its terms. The Silmarilion is their last shot with that great author, we'll see if they go there.",10,9,17,20 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A delicate operation, neatly performed
","It must be pretty hard to link up 6 or so hours worth of movies with another 8 hours or so filmed 20 or 30 years ago, even if you were planning to do it when you started out. I can't say it floored me but it was a workable effort. This entry focuses on Darth Vader's conversion to the dark side. Look, I know character development isn't Lucas' strong suit, but I still think they could have done better than Christensen (sorry), and he certainly isn't helped by the story line they give him. The transition from good guy to bad guy just didn't convince me. Plus there's a whole lot of jawing at the beginning of this that didn't seem necessary. But they do a nice job of tying things together, at the very end it's like stitch, stitch, stitch. In my mind episode 4 (the first movie) will always be the huge creative breakthrough, with episode 1 a somewhat remote second. This gets a 9 just based on the enormous scope of the effort.",9,2,3,21 June 2005
Bring It On," Pleasant little romp
","Not too serious look at the gritty world of competitive cheerleading. Primo team learns that its routines are stolen from city school.  Their Broadway-style reaction is a riot.  Dunst may not have true cheerleader wheels but she certainly brings the attitude as team captain, and Dushku is charming as her buddy.  8/10",8,0,1,21 December 2003
The Shawshank Redemption," Good not great prison flick
","Interesting study of wrongly-convicted Robbins sent to jail and abused by evil warden and (initially) fellow prisoners.  As film develops, Robbins turns tables on everyone.  Understated  performance by the lead; Morgan Freeman, as a fellow prisoner, actually drives this flick.  Didn't see where this differed from half a dozen other good prison movies, but that's why they make all those flavors.  Very satisfying resolution.",8,0,0,17 October 1999
Halloween," Trend-setting horror classic
","Jamie Lee Curtis, as stalked teen, and Donald Pleasance, as doctor of escaped psycho, are flawless in this trend-setting horror classic.  Movie shocks without being too gruesome, at least in tv version.  Music adds greatly to the chills.  Followed by one of the worst major films ever made, Halloween 2, and scores of inferior wanna-bes.  In one of those mysteries of life, almost guaranteed not to be shown by any channel on October 31.",10,0,0,31 October 1999
Wonder Woman," Bravo
","So DC finally got it right, very much a Marvel-type production, actually one or two up on some recent Marvel works. Gal Gadot is one of the most strikingly beautiful actresses ever, when she's giving that head tilted down look to Pine in the hotel it's lights out. Maybe in part because of that (but only in part) she has chunks of what is known as screen presence, and she has it real big time. I wouldn't have guessed they would pick the end days of WWI for Wonder Woman's solo premier but it was all done right. Good pacing to the movie, maybe had 10 minutes more than they needed and a few of the things that happened didn't entirely make sense, but as an up close intro movie to the brunette Amazon she and it were a knockout.",9,7,15,16 July 2017
Vanilla Sky," Surprised I liked parts (at least)
","There's so many things about this movie that I don't generally like (recent Cruise, Lee, trick plots) that I'm surprised I actually enjoyed the concept and some of its execution. It gets the thrill of new love right as well as some of the angst of rejection. I confess I tuned out and was ready to write this one off when things got too weird after the accident, but I turned back later and actually enjoyed the wrap-up. If only they could have done the beginning and the end and skipped the middle... Russell is almost always a treat, here in a very underplayed role. I can understand people disliking this movie, and I'm not even sure how I am with the package as a whole, but I was still thinking about it days later.",7,0,1,29 September 2003
Any Given Sunday," Really not good
","Further proof that Hollywood has trouble figuring out how to make a decent football movie, no matter how many times it tries.  Star-studded cast flat out squandered in story of team trying to make playoffs despite quarterback controversy; lousy script &/or directing can only explain a giant like Al Pacino being this ineffective, in what should be a great fit as team's head coach.  I like football, and I found this at times unbearable to watch; I winced at each Lombardi reference.  Rent The Replacements instead - if you already saw that, rent it again instead of this.",3,0,0,14 January 2001
Tombstone," Magnificent Western
","I slowly progressed on this movie, watching bits here and there, then increasing the dose as I went along. I have never been much on Westerns, but this is my all time favorite. Wyatt Earp may not have been a saint, but he certainly exceeds the moral values of his enemies, the Cowboys. And has the gumption to stand up to them. Russell is almost always spectacular, no where more than playing Earp along with a ton of other stars, including a very effective Kilmer as the quirky Doc Holliday. I checked out the truth vs. Hollywood and was pleasantly surprised to say this is on the money in some key spots. Good from beginning to end, Russell should have been an Oscar nominee.",10,1,2,19 January 2019
Blade Runner," Pretty Awesome
","Funny thing about this movie is the first few times I watched part of it I didn't get it, it just seemed bleak and obscure. It has grown on me a little since then and I try to get at least a piece of it each time it's on. Since I've never seen this from top to bottom in one sitting forgive me for errors in the plot, but it goes something like this: Ford is savvy, gritty future cop with an ability to take a punch and trained to spot replicants (robots who appear to be human), called back to duty when a few replicants turn bad. The replicants are on what turns out to be a deadly mission of their own. Along the way Ford hooks up with Young, together they make the movie. I find most fascinating the relationship between Ford and Young and the bleak look at the future, the plot to me is sort of routine and immaterial except as a backdrop to the good stuff. Hard to understand but rewarding in its own strange way.",10,2,5,15 September 2011
Bruce Almighty," Pop religion takes a hit
","The idea of Morgan Freeman being God and loaning Jim Carrey his powers is such a neat idea. But I guess making an entertaining movie about it is harder than it looks, kind of like being The Almighty. There's about enough good scenes for an attractive trailer (which this movie happened to have). Beyond that and a couple of funny jokes from Morgan you're on your own. For the most part Jim uses his new powers to help his 'romantic life' and get ahead in the local news grind by playing cruel practical jokes on his competition. No fun there. So they squander some great comedic opportunities and deal out lousy ersatz religion all at the same time. I would get more upset about inappropriate and bad religious movies like this and Michael, 'cept they're so bad in their own right there's little danger of anyone taking them too seriously. Maybe God is more active than some people think. At least a Friend-less Aniston (the way we like her) rises marginally above the material. Morgan, on the other hand, should have been a little ashamed of some of the inane stuff he says as 'God', particularly in the wrap up.",5,0,1,11 April 2005
Monsters University," Bravo
","Many of the Disney efforts of the past several years have been hampered by too much filler in the story line, they have at best an 80 minute tale but they stretch it 110 instead (Nemo being a good example). This has a much tighter plot, largely focusing on the college experience of Mike and Sully. This has all been done before in one fashion or another but the story moves along pleasantly enough to a fair conclusion. Billy Crystal and John Goodman fill their roles as well as in the original and in fact this is a better story than the first one, the exception rather than the rule for sequels. I particularly liked the short played before this movie, the Blue Umbrella.",9,0,1,3 July 2013
X2: X-Men United," Almost Great
","Unique - a special effects extravaganza SEQUEL with fascinating, well-played characters and a truly scary plot. Professor X, the X-Men, their arch-enemy Magneto and his cronies find themselves sort of on the same team against absolutely evil mutant killer. McKellen and Stewart really fit and play off each other as well as any two actors in movies today. I was disappointed by underwritten Paquin role while Jackman continues to grow as a lead, they almost have too many good characters to spread enough around. *Spoiler* Docked two entire points (the biggest penalty ever!) for two major killings late in the movie - they occurred in the film's two hokiest sequences and proved absolutely nothing. If they felt like they had to kill the characters off they could have picked a more poignant reason and scenario than they did. There's a lot to work with here if they can just keep themselves under control. 8 of 10 (after assessment of the penalty)",8,0,0,24 September 2004
Thor: The Dark World," Elements of brilliance
","I really liked the Thor comics in the 60's. They had the same limitation of this movie, in that they were somewhat bound one way or another to Asgard (which could be a good thing in a small dose). This movie is not too long, it moves along very well, has a lot of action, is well cast (a strength with all Marvel movies), I think my only major criticism is that it often moves so fast that I never get to either enjoy the moment, or figure out where we are going. Natale Portman is beautiful if looking somewhat anorexic (not the best look for her), Kat Denning works well in occasional comic relief, Hopkins is great as Odin, more of Elba as Heimdall was also welcome. I really really like Huddleston, he is so spot on as Loki it's scary, his deceptive character plays so well against the straight-laced Thor. Looking forward to the next one.",8,1,4,10 November 2013
Midway," Problems in the 4th Quarter
","Through much of this, my title was going to be Now THAT'S a War Movie, but they stumbled at the end and lost a couple of rating stars in the process. This movie is almost the direct opposite of Midway (1976), an embarrassing soap opera which nonetheless eventually gets around to telling a slam bang story of the battle. In contrast, the lead up to the Midway showdown here was done handsomely and efficiently through a few characters. Unfortunately, once they got there the narrative got rather tangled and the CGI, to that point comfortably restrained, became comically, unbelievably overdone.
So I was very excited going into the final stretch and then pretty much disappointed. On the casting side Skrein was the rather animated and odd looking but an eventually effective star as ace Enterprise pilot. Evans was okay as the tense McClusky, although without much depth. Moore is always good and fit well as Skrein's wife, and Toyokawa as Yamamoto was exceptional. Harrelson as Nimitz was just poor casting but Quaid as Halsey was almost believable. Eckhardt as Doolittle was a better fit if a good half foot taller than his character.
So I would say very well done in many aspects. partly spoiled by overdoing the key moments in the climactic battle.",8,1,4,10 November 2019
The Sixth Sense," As good as people say it is
","Forget the talk of plot twists, this is just plain great movie making that deservedly put M. Night on the map. Not really a movie about the occult, it's more what you might call a 'psychological drama'. Bruce Willis gives the most solid performance of his career as a child psychologist attacked by one of his charges and changed forever. Haley Joel Osment is his new charge, a child who simply can't fit in with his peers with a very different way of looking at things. Toni Collette is grand as the troubled mom trying to find a way to solve Haley's problems. They really don't make movies this good very often at all, I don't know what won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2000 but I can tell you what movie should have won. A fantastic and effective score accompanies this most exceptional movie. Highly highly recommended.",Null,0,0,12 October 1999
The Producers," Must-see comedy
","For those who have never seen Zero Mostel in action, this is a must-see. Mostel and Gene Wilder are superb as the dapper con man and his mousy accountant who devise a plan to make a mint off a bad Broadway production. Success seems assured when they select the 'masterpiece' of a former Nazi, played to the hilt by Kenneth Mars.  Film gets a tad silly towards the end, but still my favorite Mel Brooks film.  Worth a good look.",10,0,1,16 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Bravo!
","When you're taking on this amount of history, or baggage depending on your point of view, you have to start modest and start small and let the story slowly tell itself and fill in the gaps. That's what happens here, as we begin (not unlike SW IV) with a small droid with an important package running into some random (or are they random?) characters. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that along the way Hans Solo and Chewy join the ride and things really start to heat up. As they do the movie pays homage to previous episodes without just redoing what they did before (with one exception). Maybe it's easier just to say what it is - 1) good plot, 2) good characters, best of them Solo, 3) good dialogue, 4) an active story that moves along well, and 5) beautiful scope to the scenery and special effects. What is one of the things that made the original Star Wars so damn good? Scenes like Luke looking wistfully over the desert grandeur of Tatooine. Just reveling for a moment in the spectacle of a foreign world. We got some of that here. What it's not is 1) too over-the-top, 2) too long, or 3) too complicated. Is Abrams to blame for why this is the best SW since Empire? I suspect he is. Real real nice job.",10,11,41,22 December 2015
Rear Window," An acquired taste
","I didn't really know much about this movie until the 90's and never made it all the way through until the last few years. Now it's a high-priority selection. Action photographer Stewart is injured and confined to the rear porch of his modest Manhattan apartment, which overlooks a courtyard and many other units. He thinks he sees a murder, or is his under-stimulated mind just imagining things? It's so good you don't even realize that the camera is (just like Jimmy) grounded on Stewart's back porch. Kelly is great as the dedicated love interest and Ritter equally so as Stewart's nurse. Stewart is about twice Kelly's age and pretty much looks it, just the same there is a certain chemistry between the two. A pre-Mason Raymond Burr is effectively scary as the suspected killer. 10 out of 10",10,3,8,15 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Kick-ass finale
","Final chapter in Tolkien trilogy returns to the standard set by fantastic first entry. Corrects it's course from the in-comparison-only lesser Towers, which suffered from two significant faults: 1) pointless deviations from the source material, the best fantasy work ever written; and 2) a tendency to make the odds against our heroes laughably impossible. Not that this one is perfect on those counts but it tries a little harder, maybe they felt Towers needed more ummmph or something. We're talking a good 500 pages or so for Return, they do about as nice a job of stuffing the material in as they can. Pretty much flawless acting, my personal favorite being Hill as Theoden King of Rohan. Real nice job on lighting the warning beacons, a dazzling combination of sight and sound (although I still would have preferred it 'by the book' while Gandalf and Pippin are on the fly to Gondor). I lived with these books so much as a kid I get choked up throughout this movie it's visualized so well. Tolkien was a master of having his characters (often Gandalf, sometimes Galadriel, but not always so) say the perfect lifetime-memorable line; somehow with all this effort they still miss some of the great ones. But I guess nobody's perfect. Great movie. 10 out of 10",10,1,2,1 January 2005
The Truman Show," Ok if you don't look too hard
","Interesting premise of television programming focused on one man (Carrey) who is unaware of his prominence.  I enjoyed the movie more the first time than the second, I'm not sure it holds up very well to scrutiny.  Plot takes itself too seriously and hits you over the head with the concept;  also, Carrey's unawareness of his situation is a little too much to swallow. Worth a shot but don't expect too much.",7,4,7,17 October 1999
The Matrix," Did I see a different movie?
","Nearly unwatchable clap-trap about 'common man' Reeves caught up in secret struggle between computer-enhanced good and bad guys.  The special effects are great, but c'mon, there should be a coherent or compelling plot somewhere.  It's ridiculous that this movie is voted (at this writing) as the 30th best film of all time;  I must have seen some other movie coincidentally called The Matrix.",4,2,4,23 April 2000
Shall We Dance," Exceptional (with one complaint)
","Spoiler alert. I think this is really an exceptional, unusual ensemble movie. I've said I'm not a Richard Gere fan but I notice more often than not I really enjoy his work. He has a very modest way and sense of humor that I appreciate. In this one he is an attorney needing a little spark in his life (without knowing it), who notices JLo in the window of a dance studio and decides to dive in. Along the way he finds that his law partner (exquisitely, as always, played by Tucci) is a wig-wearing closet dancer himself. Walters is also great as Gere's eventual dance partner. If this was ordinary stuff Gere would end up with JLo and that would be that, as it is things don't go that way. My one complaint is the way they handle Gere's contest performance, which slightly flaws an otherwise intelligent movie. Otherwise, it's as fun and upbeat as they come.",9,0,1,11 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The greatest movie of my lifetime
","And I'm really not that much of a George Lucas fan. But I had this on recently during one of the Turner station's celebrations in light of the new release, and I thought you know this was the best AND most enjoyable movie that was made during my lifetime. There was so much about this movie that was innovative and different and exciting, and the special effects for the times were just grand. I can remember being in the theater even after this was out for awhile and rising with the entire audience and applauding wildly at the end. Not to mention that this movie probably had a bigger impact on the industry than any I can remember. In some ways, although Phantom Menace had its moments, this was the real achievement that Lucas rode on through the first and second set of movies, I really wasn't that hot on some of the plot twists (such as the relation between Vader and Luke) that showed up down the line. But this one clearly stands on its own as great cinema.",10,0,0,10 December 2016
The Replacements," Easy-going fun
","Story of temporary replacements for pro football team, recruited when regulars strike during playoff drive. Keanu is cool as quarterback who has trouble getting beyond his last performance, a major melt-down in a college bowl game; Hackman is great (as always) as coach who has little time to put team together from scratch. Langton is fetching as Keanu's sometimes girlfriend. Credibility of film survives despite usual hokey Hollywood on-field action. Can't the 'technical advisers' for football movies EVER say 'Gee, that wouldn't happen in a real game'? Apparently not, but forgiven here because of the charm of the cast. This one has a certain trite moxie, and is otherwise tons better than its contemporary, the wretched 'Any Given Sunday'. 8 out of 10",9,2,3,30 January 2005
Apollo 13," Awesome
","Tom Hanks and Ed Harris lead their respective crews in riveting story of Apollo 13's life and death struggle in outer space. Considering the commanding astronaut gets the lead writing credit we have to assume the details are pretty accurate, they sure seem that way. Film never lets up, with brilliant acting, writing and direction. 10/10 That's what I wrote over ten years ago, and this movie has more than stood up since then. There are few movies that have consistently excellent writing, directing, pacing, score, cinematography and acting throughout a feature length film. If I listed the fine performances I would run out of space, but Harris and Sinise are a good start. As of 2016 James Lovell still does well-deserved speaking engagements (that's him congratulating Hanks at the end of the film). This has to be in the top twenty movies made in my lifetime.",10,0,1,19 February 2004
Fantastic Four," All the bases except for action
","I read Marvel comics within a few years of the start of their golden age, beginning in the mid- to late 60s. It's sort of amazing they haven't done real movies until now. Each of the main Marvel characters was made for movie-making, they had more depth and texture than either Batman or Superman, plus their associated characters and their powers were generally more interesting. My personal favorites in the golden era were the Fantastic Four and Thor (interestingly enough, at the time Daredevil and the X-Men - earlier movie selections - were considered two of the weaker entries for Marvel). The casting for this movie, as for all the Marvel movies, is flawless, although Susie was more reserved in the comics (like most any red-blooded guy I have no other complaints re: Alba), and Johnny considerably more responsible, neither flaws fatal in my mind. My primary complaint is not much happens action-wise in this one, the character development is fine but we're here for the bells & whistles too. I'm willing to give them another shot with Silver Surfer.",8,0,1,30 September 2006
The Great Escape," Kick-ass escape movie
","Accomplished cast in engrossing story of major break-out from German prison camp in World War II. Based on true-life story of Roger Bushell (Roger Bartlett in the movie), with some extra thrills and characters thrown in ala Hollywood. The book by Brickhill is as good as, if not better than, the movie; the book was followed by a sequel where Brickhill tried to track down the perpetrators of the post-escape massacre (some of whom, if I recall, had vanished behind the Iron Curtain). Ignore the comment above - this escape drew so many resources and caused so much disruption in Nazi Germany that Hitler personally ordered all the escapees shot, so 'how many people completed their escape' misses the point. Relatively fast pace of film and thoroughly fine acting make up for long running time. Worth watching just for the scenes involving McQueen (reportedly a handful on the set), a real-life motorcyclist who performed his own stunts and some of the Germans' as well. A solid 10, deservedly in the IMDb top 100 with a powerful Elmer Bernstein score.",10,2,5,2 June 2005
Jackie Brown," Pure Quentin
","Well, I guess actually with a good dose of Elmore thrown in. This is my favorite Quentin movie (of the ones I've seen) and in some ways it seems his most deliberately 'mainstream' type film, almost cheesy at points. Pulp Fiction is a little too bizarre for even me, I loved moments of Grindhouse and Bastards but the whole didn't work as well. Pam Grier is the stewardess mule for evil gun runner Jackson, she gets stopped by goofy fed agent Keaton and needs the services of bail bondsman Forster. Add De Niro as a recently sprung con and Fonda as Samuel's 'secretary' and you have a lot of talent to work with. Grier is appropriately tough, and the scene with De Niro and Fonda in the parking lot is hysterical in its own sick way. But I think the movie is stolen by Forster, who gives an Oscar caliber performance as the deadpan, stoic Max Cherry. This film is worth watching for his performance alone.",9,2,3,1 October 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Somewhat disappointing sequel to Star Wars classic
","Sequel to Star Wars starts out hot, becomes talky and loses steam in plot entanglements.  Was it really necessary for Darth Vader to be Luke's father to make this work?  Does that make Alec Guinness a liar (heaven forbid) in Star Wars, when he describes Luke's father?  Is there any reason to make a movie of this 'magnitude' and expect your viewers to wait two years to find out what happens?  At that point, do we care what happens?  No, yes, no, and not as much as we did before.",8,0,0,17 October 1999
Minions," Why was this movie made?
","I'm sitting in the nearly vacant theater on premiere night and thinking somewhere there must be a struggling movie maker pondering how Hollywood could pump millions into this pedestrian cartoon babble and not into his or her creation? If you feel like you have to see this movie I have four suggestions: 1) pop in any CD of Back to the Barnyard and watch 3 episodes, 2) pop in any Penguins of Madagascar CD or its variants, 3) watch the Croods, but with the sound off, or 4) bang your head against the wall with medium impact for 1 1/2 hours. The best thing about this movie was the short running time, even with the pressure these days to fill and expand movie lengths this was so spare to begin with that they had no place else to go. One other alternative is to watch the trailer 100 times. My son just barely made it through, he gave it a 6 1/2 on the way out. Most of the (unintelligible) lines are in Minion gibberish, maybe this was a good thing? I mean it when I say pass 'em by.",4,28,50,10 July 2015
Warcraft," Woof
","I have two thing to say right off. Me and my 11 year old only made it through about 15 minutes of this before we both agreed to leave. And 2) I was one of the biggest LOTR fans ever out there (books and movies), and the little I saw of this was total dreck. So PLEASE don't say gee man if you liked (the exquisitely grounded) LOTR well you're SURE to like this. NOT!! The best stories dealing with complex worlds start you out with a relatable character and go real slow, they add one piece at a time. This one throws you into an unpleasant setting and expects you to know everything right off the bat. It has the feel of manufactured substance when in fact this movie looked to me to be without much substance at all. Some of the scenes are impressive in Imax (the only way this was offered on premier, probably another tell on its quality), but that isn't nearly enough for me. I need a character I can relate to and a story I can understand and enjoy. There was a lot about this that reminded me of the dreadful Strange Magic, I think on that one we lasted about 5 minutes more than on this. I'm not saying there isn't an audience for this movie, I'm just saying I loved LOTR and liked Star Wars and I had no interest in watching another single minute of whatever this was supposed to be. Also note in the short time there there were scenes which troubled my 11 year old, and the Imax was way too loud for him. So my vote is save your hard-earned money for something else. I also must say that the chorus of positive IMDb reviews for this movie are just not believable.",2,43,85,10 June 2016
Gladiator," I can't join the crowd
","I guess this is a fun movie if you like to watch well-acted, non-stop carnage and torture for whatever the (long) length of the movie is.  I'd rather watch pretty much anything else.  As far as it goes Russell Crowe is okay as the hero, a disfavored general making an anonymous(!!) comeback as a gladiator.  Best portion of the film is the beginning, where Crowe takes on German tribesmen with his Roman legion.  That that portion is the easiest to stomach is a comment on the rest of the movie.  Enjoy.",4,0,1,14 January 2001
The Wedding Singer," Attractive leads drive film
","Adam Sandler is wedding singer stood up at the altar, Drew Barrymore is waitress engaged to dirtball.  Both leads are capable and attractive and have a certain chemistry.  Sandler shows real warmth in this one, and actual talent as a wedding singer.  Worth a shot even for Sandler non-fans.",9,1,1,16 December 2000
Sully," Hanks with just another home run
","Who else to pick to play US Airlines hero pilot Sullivan other than Tom Hanks, the theatrical Everyman of our generation? Henry Fonda did this sort of thing when I was a kid, but I was never a big Fonda guy. Hanks is fine as the modest but competent pilot excelling under extreme pressure. This was a short movie, and rightfully so. The real drama is in the reenactment of the forced water landing (don't use the 'c' word) which takes all of about 3 minutes in real time. But don't be surprised when you don't see all the excitement up front. The screenplay, artfully done, doles out the thrills throughout the movie. So Hanks and Eckhart are great as the pilots, the persons playing the NTSB officials investigating the near-crash do a nice job although their attitude is a little over the top. Even before reading a recent article about NTSB response to the movie, I was wondering if the NTSB's attitude was a bit overplayed. This movie needed a couple of important lines to express NTSB concern, including 'we are mandated to look at everything when a forced landing occurs, and discount the possibility of pilot error'; along with 'landing on the Hudson is a last choice, we have to fully explore whether the plane could have returned safely to the airport'. You don't get quite enough of that here. There is a difference between a complete and thorough investigation and a witch-hunt; and we need to look at possible pilot error not just for evaluating the pilots in question but as a learning experience for all pilots going forward. But the movie as it is plays out nicely, all the bells and whistles are out, and the scenes through the credits of the actual pilot and passengers were much appreciated.",9,0,2,12 September 2016
