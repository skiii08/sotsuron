Kill Bill: Vol. 2," bury KB vol2 (might contain spoilers)
","They had to be kidding.To consider KB2 as better than KB1 (or, for that matter, any film) cannot be more wrong.It seems that QT had run out of ideas when it came time to make part 2. The first was a thrill ride from the beginning, a feast of bright, bold colours, it was unpretentious and it was fun. The soundtrack was superb, especially the opening song (by Nancy Sinatra) and the set by the 5, 6, 7, 8s. And even though you might say that there was a bit too much red in it, it was grayed (aha) by the shift to b&w bits. And even though it was a bit hard to consider UT as a believable assassin - oh I bet she must be a good actress, but her character was weak - for its overall creativity and entertainment value, KB1 gets 4 of 5 stars.On the other hand, KB2 drags in the beginning, and keeps dragging on 45 minutes later. And then after 2 hours it still drags. I didn't think anything could have the energy to drag on for over two hours. It's not like the dialogue was a joy to listen to, to merit all of that screen time. The writing is hardly satisfying. And, can I just say, the Bride is too emotional to be an assassin. All of the stuff she used to get out of impossible predicaments seem contrived. Sure, you can say that you shouldn't pigeonhole assassins. You can't put them in a box. But oh, please. She very easily, and so often, forgets her training, panics a lot, and she's not really into calm and calculated planning, either. The obvious lack of skill was forgivable in part 1, but the mental weakness in part 2 was just unspeakable. Are we sure she can even kill a rat? Much less kill bill. The colours were gone, the inventiveness disappeared. The only good parts (agh! Not even the soundtrack!) were the very cool DH (as Elle Driver, how an assassin should be), and the end song by Shivaree. Really, they should have buried this one with Paula Schultz.",Null,0,1,13 November 2004
