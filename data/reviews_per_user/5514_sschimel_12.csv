United 93," Amazing
","I posted a message on the message board for this movie, asking that people allow it to rest on its own merits. I saw the movie this afternoon and I have to say that I haven't been as affected by a movie in years as I was by this. Occasionally, I'll see a movie that leaves me so stunned, I have to sit for a minute afterward to get my bearings. this was one of those movies (Hair, It's My Party, and Longtime Companion also come to mind). I cried, I held my breath, and I remembered exactly where I was when 9/11 happened. I was pleased to see that the theater was crowded; I was afraid that because of the controversy surrounding the trailer for the movie that no one would go see it. I also must add that the writing, direction, and acting are all Oscar-caliber, though how to decide who to nominate in the acting categories would be impossible. I think that this is a much better film than Crash was, and that won best Picture.",10,2,5,29 April 2006
Shutter Island," Awful. Horrible.
","Filmed with one of the worst screenplays of the last few years, this has been compared to Hitchcock and to Film Noir, insulting both in the process. Tag line could have been 'I See Dead People 2'. Leo has grown on me as an actor, and I think he gives an extraordinary performance, but the script does him no favors. And frankly, I guessed at the beginning of the movie what the twist was, but would have preferred being wrong. I think it would have been a bigger twist. Max von Sydow is wasted and Ben Kingsley plays Ben Kingsley. The flashbacks/dream sequences/hallucinations are ludicrous, portentous, and pretentious. I hated this movie from beginning to end.",1,16,33,7 March 2010
Watchmen," The worst superhero movie I've ever seen
","I love superhero movies. I adored the X-Men movies and like most of the Batman movies. I love Heroes. But this is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. IMO, it is way too violent for some of the audience it's aimed at (teens) and a lot of the violence is gratuitous (Rorschak's back story), misogynistic (Carla Gugino and the pool table), or both. After the dogs and the cleaver, I walked out.I have to admit that the movie was not helped at all by AMC on 42nd Street. Their projectors are dimmed to save electricity, so none of the colors or effects popped off the screen.Except, of course, for the giant, blue, obviously not Jewish, schwanz. Which may justify a rental on cable so I can free frame. :-)",1,29,54,20 March 2009
The Mist," They messed with a good thing
","I saw this last night in NYC with a packed house. I loved it and thought it was a very effective genre flick. That now makes 3 Frank Darabont/Stephen King movies and I've loved all three. I only wish they'd remake The Stand, since I thought the TV movie was horrible and badly miscast. SPOILER ALERT: Why, oh, why did they mess with the ending. I distinctly remember where the novelette ended, and it was about 5 minutes before the movie ends. I ordinarily don't like ambiguous endings, but this is one movie that I would have rated a 10, if they'd left the end alone. Mr. King has had a good year, what with Room 1408 and The Mist. I hope this bodes well for From A Buick 8.",8,0,2,2 December 2007
Guardians of the Galaxy," Hated it
","I read the reviews and they were fantastic. I've love all of the Marvel movies so far and have always preferred them over the DC comics movies. I read how funny and snarky the script is and how great Chris Pratt and Bradley Cooper are. In contrast to what I'd read, my actual reaction to the movie is that I didn't believe any of the characters (except Groot. Loved him), I didn't believe any of the relationships, and I didn't care about the quest. I generally like snark, as I can be snarky as well, but I thought the script was pretty lame. I hope the sequel will be better. I place the blame squarely on James Gunn, who directed and wrote the script. There is nothing on his resume that should have led anyone to believe he could handle a big budget, special effects laden, tentpole movie.",3,33,71,25 August 2014
Paranormal Activity," Genuinely creepy
","As someone who likes scary movie but hates torture porn, I was a little skeptical of this movie, especially since it was so hyped. I have to say that it was probably the most genuinely scary movie since The Haunting (1963). Proving that a movie doesn't need to have a huge special effects budget or the latest in CGI effects, the movie is very effective at building suspense, all the way through to the wonderful ending. My quibble with the movie is the characters seem to waffle. Katie is either scared and trusting that her husband will solve things or she's barking at him. Micah is either an insensitive jerk or a hero (and Micah the actor, who is gorgeous in a Ben Affleck sort of way, is more believable as a jerk than as a hero). Like the original The Haunting, there's a lot of suspense between the big scares. Like the over-the-top remake of The Haunting, there is room for this to be remade (which was the original plan, with this version on the DVD) really badly with lots of special effects. I hope that doesn't happen. The box office for this movie proves that there is a market for well-made, creative, low budget, and really creepy movies without all of the gore and torture of the Hostels, Saws, and Halloweens.",8,2,4,28 October 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Alice doesn't live here anymore
","I am shocked by both this movie and my visceral reaction to it. Unlike Avatar, which used the 3D technology as an integral part of the movie, 3D adds nothing to this movie. And frankly, the glasses darken the screen so much that the already dimmed image (thanks to projectors that aren't as bright as they used to be) was pretty bland. Let me state for the record, for anyone who doesn't know, the movie conflates the two books, and adds in Jabberwocky for the hell of it. And back story (19 year old Alice is about to marry the wrong man (she was too old for Lewis Carroll). The Queen of Hearts becomes the Red Queen. And the Knaves of Hearts become a cross between the clone robots for Star Wars:Clone Wars and sow bugs. 1. A bland, blond, Victorian Dorothy Gale lives in Kansas, er, England, and is about to marry a prig. She has recurring nightmares about Oz, er, Wonderland, er, Underland, and falls down the rabbit hole. Unlike The Wizard of Oz, there is really no sense of wonder when she opens the door from her black and white existence (filmed in color, which ruins the supposed effect) to Wonderland. Nor does Alice exhibit and curiosity or joy at being in Wonderland. The actress registers no emotion about anything. 2. Johnny Depp used to be a wonderful actor in quirky films. His movies now resemble the parodies that Carol Burnett used to do on her show. (Sweeney Todd being the exception). He has now ruined to wonderful movies, with a lot of help from Tim Burton: Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was excruciating in its twee-ness. And as with Alice, added too much back story and robbed the original Roald Dahl's original book of both its charm and character, while only emphasizing how amazing the original movie was. This movie adds all of the current techno bells and whistles and still can't compare to Disney's own animated version. 3. Tim Burton used to make interesting movies about interesting people with interesting actors: Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands (what happened to that Johnny Depp?) More Sweeney, less fantasy, please.4. Why do Anne Hathaway's arms not straighten? What's up with that?EVerything that makes Lewis Carroll Lewis Carroll has been leached out of this movie.",1,91,136,14 March 2010
Les Mis√©rables," Sing out, Louise
","I want to start by saying that I love the book and I love the Broadway cast album of Les Miz, so I want into this movie really hoping for the best. I was very disappointed. Mr. Hooper has managed to make a grand, episodic story and semi-operatic pop opera appear to be much smaller than it actually is. He did that by spending so much time filming in extreme close up. And having the performers sing live adds little to the proceedings except in two numbers (I Dreamed A Dream and Empty Chairs At Empty Tables). The movie is also exceptionally miscast. While Hugh Jackman acts Jean Valjean extremely well, his thin, nasal voice lacks the ringing tones to make the character as heroic as he needs to be. Russel Crowe is awful. Not only is Javert badly sung, but he's not particularly well acted. Amanda Seyfried has a whispery little voice that makes Jane Powell and Kathryn Grayson sound like Birgit Nilson. And Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen, both of whom I've loved in other projects, are a mess. The movie is inert musically and dramatically...until we arrive on the barricades more than two thirds of the way into the movie. It then comes alive. The men on the barricade are wonderful. Eddie Redmayne turns in the best performance in the movie and sings a truly heartbreaking Empty Chairs At Empty Tables. He and Anne Hathaway are really the best of the bunch. But most of the big dramatic climaxes to the musical numbers are absent because most of the music seems to be sung in whispers rather than full voice. What is so dramatic on stage becomes rather lackluster on screen. It's unfortunate that after waiting 25 years for a movie version of the musical, this is the best that we get. If you want the story, watch the version with Liam Neeson and Clare Danes.",3,10,21,26 December 2012
In Time," No time for In Time
","I find it hard to believe that this movie was directed by the same man who made Gattaca. I can see what Mr. Niccol was aiming for in In Time. Gattaca ha a chilly tone throughout, establishing a 1984-ish premise and atmosphere. Uma Thurman's character is chilly. The sets are chilly. And it works perfectly. Unlike Uma Thurman, who's best movies utilize her rather aloof persona, Amanda Seyfried has always projected a warm and sunny persona and here, playing against type, she is just out of her depth. Justin Timberlake, a likable actor, comes off as too nice to pull off the transition from protagonist to antagonist. The script is mediocre. All in all, not a great movie.",3,7,15,22 November 2011
The Happening," The Autumn Breeze
","This is easily the worst movie I've seen this year, and one of the worst I've seen in a long time. I loved Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, and liked a lot of The Village, but when a sold out theater all laughs at the so-called ominous pans across the countryside, the added gore from the R rating, and some of the most execrable dialogue in years, you know you're in trouble. I can't tell if Shyamalan is a good director who can't write, or a good writer who can't direct. Actors who have turned in decent performances in the past here turn in some of the most laughable acting (and laugh the audience did). Mark Wahlberg was terrific in The Departed, but really needs a strong director like Scorsese. I liked Zooey Deschanel in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, but she looks and acts a little schizoaffective here, certainly more neurotic than a mild flirtation would warrant. John Leguizamo was pretty good, but did his character succumb to the 'event' or did he just commit suicide because his wife might or might not be dead and he left his daughter with friends for no apparent reason? AND WHAT MOVIE IS BETTY BUCKLEY IN? Ironic that she was in Carrie (movie and flop Broadway musical, in two different characters), because she appears to be playing a more Gothic version of Piper Laurie.Sixth Sense worked because of genuine surprise at the ending.Unbreakable worked because Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson were great, and because the story was interesting.Signs worked because so much of what happened, happened off screen. The best supernatural/suspense/thriller movies work because they hint at what is going on rather than showing it. Jaws worked because the shark didn't and Spielberg had to vamp until they got it working. Alien worked because we saw so little of the actually monster. The original version of The Haunting (with Julie Harris) worked because it was subtle (as opposed to the remake which was over the top).",1,6,12,16 June 2008
The Cabin in the Woods," Don't get stranded in this cabin
","Since this movie was shot in 2009 but not released until 2012, I can only imagine that the only it was released at all was to capitalize on the success of Thor, starring Chris Hemsworth, and the impending release of The Avengers. It can't be a coincidence that both movies were directed by Mr. Whedon. Cabin In The Woods is a hodgepodge of clich√©d imperiled teens stuck in a remote location getting knocked off one by one and seemingly science fiction elements. The movie tries, and fails, to duplicate the successful combination of snark and fright that Scream pulled off so well, but the script is so poor that near the end when a slumming Sigourney Weaver makes an appearance, she utters a line so ridiculous that it's amazing she could say it with a straight face. As bad as most of the movie is, the ending is worse than anything came before. Amazingly, this movie has been receiving fairly decent reviews.",1,37,72,2 May 2012
Law Abiding Citizen," One of the worst
","... films of the year. I adore Gerard Butler, one of the manliest of men working on screen at the moment, but as critics have pointed out, he's a bit of a mush mouth. Why? Because he keeps getting asked to do an American accent. When talking with his own accent, in Rocknrolla, he's terrific. As far as I'm concerned, Jamie Fox alternates between great performances (Ray, Collateral, The Soloist) and absolute dreck. This movie falls squarely in the latter category, placing it at the same level as Stealth.I found it hard to swallow that Jamie Foxx would sanction arranging a deal for a murderer who killed someone's wife a child, but then show such a supreme lack of understanding when Gerard even vaguely threatens his family. And Jamie's character turns around and threatens to do to Gerard what Gerard has already done to his family's killer.",1,8,17,24 October 2009
