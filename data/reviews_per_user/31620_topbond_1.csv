Scarface," Scarface a Master Piece
","Just a fact about this movie it was banned in the eighties by the Bolivian government. By the time Bolivia, the country where i'm from, was under a dictatorial government and the most corrupted government of all times. The actual Bolivian government was a cocaine producer and smuggler it self. Mr. Sosa's real name is Roberto Suarez at the time Bolivia was the greatest producer of cocaine. Roberto Suarez is in jail in Bolivia and he's been in jail for the past 20 years. The former president of Bolivia at the time. Mr. Garcia Meza is still in jail too. It is nice but a shame at the same time to see such a great film with the name of my country in it. For year we have been claiming that the coca leaf is not cocaine.",10,2,4,27 March 2006
