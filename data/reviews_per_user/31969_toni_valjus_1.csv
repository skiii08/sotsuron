Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pilot for Tv-series?
","It struck me, after I finished watching the 'first' episode of Star Wars, that it reminded me of a pilot for a tv-series, although more advanced technique and better actors. It was the same kind of uninspired plot, too 'thready' if you know what I mean. It's more about learning to know the characters that show up in the 'later' episodes, than being told an interesting story. And Jar Jar Binks: I really hated him! Watchable, but mostly for Star Wars-freaks.",5,0,1,30 April 2000
