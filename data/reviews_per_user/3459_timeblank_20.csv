Ford v Ferrari," Ford: Built Tough Review
","When you see this movie, do not expect it to be high octane action or a fast and furious movie. This is about making history. Just being part of the journey. Seeing their passion about the car, speed, the feeling of it. Matt Damon And Christian Bale puts on their best performance. This is a slow burn of a movie. Learning about what works and what does not. They face challenges, setbacks, and problems. This movie is living the dream and fighting to get it. The problem of this movie, it has certain scenes where it can be cut short. Also sometimes I hear a lot of mumbling. I can't hear their words clearly. I don't know, maybe it's me. The point I am making is, it's great but I don't know if I want to watch it again. I probably forget about it in a couple days. Because it's not memorable. You may disagree. But that's my opinion.",7,0,2,24 November 2019
First Man," First Man On The Moon
","Neil Armstrong went through a lot with the death of his daughter and his friends. Mainly NASA basically wants USA to be the first country to make it to the Moon. Because Russia wasn't allies with the US. It's mainly a Space race.Seeing Neil do whatever it takes, does take a toll by putting work first and family second. His wife struggles while taking care of his sons. Neil sees the deaths of his friends because of NASA's failures. You see Neil's human side. As he struggles to cope with it.First Man has some touching moments, terrifying moments, and sometimes it's inaccurate information. Watching this movie had Interstellar, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and Apollo 13 moments. I liked one scene where his wife confronts Neil, and she has him explain what is going to happen when he doesn't come back from his mission to her sons. Those were some tense moments.The only thing I didn't like was the ending. More could of been done but for some reason it ended there. First Man was good movie. But it can have slow scenes at times.",8,2,7,14 October 2018
Rocketman," Elton John lifestyle is dislikable, Story was...
","Inspiring. Your a kid, and you have dislikable parents, you have dreams of becoming a musician.But when you cannot forgive and continue your life having resentment. It will make you pretty miserable. But at least he took action and changed from drug angry homosexual to a homosexual becoming a family man and doing something right. Story was great. Taron Egerton played Elton John perfectly.The presentation and love making scene made me feel very uncomfortable. Certain scenes were excessive, messy, and cartoonish. I like his songs but it's takes away the seriousness of the movie. I felt like watching Grease.Overall this movie is for the Elton John fans. For me it's a mixed bag.",6,3,5,16 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Mediocre marvel movie
","Captain Marvel acting was so disappointing and emotionless. What in the world happened? She felt like a Mary Sue. No conflict, no sign of weakness, and her character did not show her belief. Really wooden. Action was great and loved the post credit scene. Got me excited for Avengers: Endgame. Samuel L. Jackson was great, however one scene was super disappointing on how he got his Eye patch. I was like wow did they just did that? So stupid! One of the weakest Marvel movies ever. Sad!",3,8,13,17 March 2019
Us," Us is Unexpected Thriller with a Twist
","Us to me, made me understand it's story, and the surprising ending. It revolves around the Mom. The story in the beginning kind of drags, feels messy, sometimes doesn't flow well. That's my bad side of the movie.The good side is what went on in her past, that truly just delivers an unexpected twist that made my jaws dropped! I loved it. It was thrilling and unexpected. Jordan Peele delivers another great horror film.",10,5,14,28 March 2019
Aquaman," Visuals is Amazing! A little Anticlimactic!
",Aqua man is just beautiful in its visuals. Would be amazing in 3D. It has great action sequences. Story kind jumps from certain places at times. When characters or places are introduced felt Anticlimactic in way. Especially the war battle. Wish Black Manta has more screen time. My only gripe about is the intro on how Aqua man was born. Wish they cut that scene out! Seems dull. Especially adding love story. Did not work for me.Love the visuals and cinematography. Story was okay. But I still like the The Dark Knight more than this one. Because their is meaning behind it and Aquaman doesn't have that magical feeling. It's okay but it's amazingly beautiful in its visuals. Hands down.,8,3,5,23 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Deadpool Strikes Again
","Deadpool is the character that just breaks the forth wall in movies. Hilarious and great fun. Don't listen to the haters on these reviews. They are all aliens from another planet invading IMDB. Watch it, love it because I will say it is better than the 1st movie! Go Deadpool! Woohoo!!",10,3,10,26 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I love Star Wars But It Needs to be Remade!
","I love Star Wars. I'm sad that it had to conclude. However, Reading what was going on in Episode 8 and 9. These two episodes needs to be remade. It is inexcusable that certain characters were useless like the Knights of Ren, Captain Plasma, General Hux, Kylo Ren, Snoke, and Luke Skywalker.The writing of these characters are horrible. Rey needs to be in more Star Wars Movies. I want to see her unique lightsaber in action. Please explain more about why Ben Solo was seduced to the dark side. Was he scammed by Snoke?You bring back a dead character and didn't explain how he returns is an insult to every fan who loves Star Wars. I love the movie. But I hate the decision that Disney and the production has made. Please someone remake episode 8 and 9. Plan this better before we lose our beloved actors and actresses.",6,2,18,23 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Sony Pictures Redeemed themselves
","Have to give high credit to Sony Pictures for redeeming themselves with the new Spider-Man movie. This had awesome animation, a story that connects and relates to us, and gives us hope for future spider-man movies.Seeing the evolution of Miles Morales on how he became spider-man truly delivers. You truly can connect with his character as he grows in this movie. You feel his pain and how he has to take a leap of faith to become the spider-man we wanted.",10,2,3,31 December 2018
Shrek Forever After," Forever Shrek!
","Ah yes true love. Such a wonderful story. Shrek and Fiona are meant to have a happy ending. Also facing a jealous villain of Rumpelstiltskin who deceitfully changed Shrek's life forever with his magical contract. Donkey and Puss n Boots were amazingly fun characters that helped encourage Shrek and fought to give him hope.Only thing is, we do not know so much about the other ogres and where they came from since the last three movies. However please end this with this movie. It was a worthy conclusion to Shrek.",9,0,0,25 March 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Decimation to Epic Restoration
","After watching this twice, I understood the story of Avengers: Endgame. The Avengers failed after the Infinity War. Never in their lifetime faced an incredible and inevitable enemy like Thanos. Josh Brolin delivers a badass Thanos. He is smart, he did the unthinkable, and he made it tough for our heroes to restore the loss. Whatever it takes was the Avengers motivation. Huge sacrifices must be taken. Seeing the Avengers rise from hopelessness and failure is the most amazing feeling in this movie. The huge price was delivered and this movie hands down is the best movie of 2019. The final battle makes it epic.The Russo Brothers deliver a phenomenal film. I give them high praise for their direction and work to make this film the best. The actors and actresses are amazing, 22 movies in 10 years. All influenced into one movie. I love 3000.",10,2,5,5 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Epic WOW!!!
",The greatest villain of all...Thanos!!! Your favorite super heroes faces their greatest foe! The journey of Thanos collecting the infinity stones. Prepares them for an epic battle. Wow is a word to describe the movie! This is a definitely a must see! Josh Brolin does an excellent job as Thanos.,10,3,7,29 April 2018
Aladdin," Songs are the Best. Certain scenes are Meh!
","Aladdin is a great film. Also it's original predecessor is great as well. But why is Cave of Wonders so unoriginal? The Mouth doesn't even move when it talks. The cave itself looks so Minuscule. I mean come on, if you can do a great genie, you cannot do a great Cave of Wonders.I love Genie, Princess Jasmine, Aladdin, Abu, Magic Carpet, but Jafar was okay but not intimidating or menacing. Love his snake staff.
Honestly, I am surprised that they couldn't do justice when Jafar was a sorcerer. I mean original was right on point with the fight scenes. I know Disney could do better than that. I miss Iago being sarcastic and loud.The songs are truly amazing and brings back wonderful childhood memories. Will Smith made it original. Such as Arabian Nights, Friend Like Me, and Prince Ali. Job well done. Naomi Scott's Speechless song truly left me speechless. Very awesome song.A Whole New World was great song, but visually it didn't felt real. Truly you can tell it is Green screen and them fake flying it through the night sky.My apologies for the nitpicking. I love the original Aladdin. This movie was great too. I mean Disney has no excuse that they can make it better. I wanted to see a Giant Snake Jafar but did not see it. I am looking forward to The Return of Jafar live action remake.",8,1,4,31 May 2019
The Lion King," Wasteful and Emotionless Movie
","People here are saying it's so good, epic, and amazing! Yeah right! I can say the movie has its achievements in the visuals but for the story and the characters especially with their emotions. It truly takes away the feeling you felt from the original. It's a remake. Yeah sure but why leave out the important parts in the movie. Why destroy everything what made the Lion King so great?If you enjoy spending your money and wasting your time, I am not here to stop you. But I recommend you watch the original animated version because that is a masterpiece. Not this fake remake of a movie!",1,59,89,3 August 2019
1917," Intriguing Direction
","First of all Happy New Year to you all. This is my first movie review of 2020. Sam Mendes directed one incredible film. The one Shot throughout the whole film kept me on edge. This movie had all kinds of emotions, it had intensity, gripping, action, and very well thought of. The characters made you feel like you are in the movie. Some scenes made you feel scared for them. Their element of surprises and danger. Especially when you have to hear what is going on the background. Personally I don't think this movie is boring. I was on edge of my seat for the characters. 1917 is awesome.",10,0,2,23 January 2020
Sausage Party," Sausage Garbage!
","What was the story? Food believes that humans are Gods. That's the interesting premise of the movie. The third act makes the movie worst by killing every human who enters the grocery store. Wow! What the heck? Then a sex party happens. This movie sucks! It is not funny, their no charm, no characters to like, and the whole movie is believes it's own bs! Hate it!",2,0,1,19 May 2020
Joker," 2019 Best Movie of the Year!
","This ain't an action movie or a super hero movie either. Do not expect Heath Ledger to act in this. Rest In Peace to the best Joker in the entire world. Joaquin Phoenix portrays as Arthur Fleck, suffering from a mental disorder and truly ridicule by the terror of Gotham City society. Seeing what he goes through in his life can really bring a man down to madness. Yes, the key word is madness! It's a prequel to the Dark Knight. In this movie we slowly seeing Arthur become Joker. Don't want to spoil it, because this is a character development movie. I will give Joaquin Phoenix credit as he becomes iconic clown prince of crime. Joker is the best movie of the year!",10,4,8,6 October 2019
It Chapter Two," It's not Terrible or amazing. It's just okay
","It Chapter two wasn't great and wasn't terrible either. It felt long and the plot moves very slow. Some scenes were awkward and their were some great moments. My favorite was the cast, Pennywise, and a special guest star appearance Stephen King himself.Pennywise creates chaos as he eats and murders adults and children. I do however find the narrative story feeling messy and all over the place. Their is too much they are trying to focus on. You feel like you don't care about some of the characters. The ritual was a huge waste of time. Pennywise final form feels like a joke. The battle was sort of weak and messy. The losers gang felt like they are the new Marvel Avengers.The movie is great to watch once. After awhile you might forget about it as the years go by. It Chapter one was a better movie. You have felt the scares and emotions from Pennywise and Losers gang, but the second one you might lose interest too. I almost felt asleep during this movie.",6,1,4,8 September 2019
The Matrix," Original Badass Sci-Fi Movie
","My review is late for this movie! I don't care if it is. The Matrix is one original movie. While other movies and shows tries to copy the effects of the matrix.The world is your playground and anything becomes possible. That is so cool to hear! The computer animation is awesome. Super slow motion bullets, dodging moves, and the action scenes. Another great scene is Neo and Trinity are in a white area room, he asks the Matrix for guns and you see infinite amount of guns appear. It's cool because anything you desire can appear to you in a snap.That's what was missing in the second and third movie. The ability to ask what you want in the matrix. I love this movie! I recommend it to anyone!",10,1,1,11 September 2018
Incredibles 2," Incredibles 2: Dynamically Entertaining
",Was this movie worth the wait? Personally I say heck yeah! This movie was fun and entertaining. The beginning of the was entertaining but it a little slow after their first fight with the underminer. I didn't care it was slow because it was building up on the storyline. Character development is important in this movie. Elasti-girl is one of the best heroine ever. The action sequences were fantastic. I do however enjoy Jack-Jack because he steals the show. Him vs. the Raccoon was hilarious and great. The villain was a bit weak but truly a terrifying villain. I did like the concept of Mr. Incredible being a Dad to his kids. It was very touching. I personally enjoyed this movie. The Incredibles may not be as great as the first but it will grow on you. Can't wait for the 3rd movie to this.,9,3,11,17 June 2018
