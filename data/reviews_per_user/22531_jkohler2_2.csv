Captain Phillips," Hijack sea drama lacks original context
","Other comments, above, describe the film production as an exciting drama based on the events of a real incident. After seeing the DVD, several things have impressed me. There are appear to be three levels to this story; first, was the actual event that occurred off the Somali coast, second, was the book publication that referred to the event, and, finally, there was the film, produced from the book.Each of these levels captures less of the story. The actual event included all the crew and pirates in real life, and was proceeded by the surrounding history of the government and people of Somalia. The book version had to be a condensation of the actual event. The film version was the result of further editing, and possible revision for dramatic effect. A previous review (tieman64) above, added background and context to the actual events that were missing from the film.'But as everyone knows, to the point of being smugly annoying, that is not 'all there is'. The Somali pirates are largely a result of Western companies dumping nuclear and toxic waste off Somalia's coast, coupled to severe illegal over-fishing by foreign super trawlers (300 million dollars worth of seafood stolen from Somalia each year). The United Nations would itself release numerous reports blaming toxic waste for mutations, deaths, diseases and illnesses within Somalia. Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, the UN envoy for Somalia, would say: 'There is uranium, lead, cadmium, mercury, industrial, radioactive, hospital and chemical waste killing Somalis and completely destroying the ocean.' Why can companies do this? Because Somalia's government has all but collapsed, thanks to Western Empires deliberately destabilizing and developmentally arresting the nation, funding warlords, dictators (Siad Barre et al) and instigating proxy wars with border nations. This has been going on, uninterrupted, since the late 1950s; any local government body not beholden to Western corporate interests, and which attempts to nationalize resources, will be destroyed. 'Not knowing the book, I cannot comment on its version.The film version may have been good drama, but was deficient on history, and for this viewer, disappointing. Nobody should mistake the film for the actual history.",6,0,1,20 April 2014
Source Code," Different meaning of 'Source Code'
","In conventional usage, 'source code' is the programming language that is human readable, which is converted to 'assembly language' or 'object code,' which runs the computer. Commercial software firms never release the source code, and sell the binary object code, often at a handsome profit, think Microsoft Windows, for example. There are also Free and Open Source programs, such as Linux, Fire Fox, Open Office, and others whose source code is universally and freely available to anyone.I went to this movie, thinking I would recognize some reference in the storyline to 'Source Code,' as described above. I found none. The computer program central to the plot was probably a top secret, and heavily guarded available to no one.Otherwise, it was an exciting, gripping movie, well acted and directed, with a satisfying conclusion.",8,0,1,16 April 2011
