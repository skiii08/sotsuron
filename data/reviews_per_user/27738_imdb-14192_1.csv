","I like sci-fi, but this was just the kind of sci-fi I hate - a hopelessly unbelievable story, compounded with incomprehensible definitions of how things work, most likely compiled using random technical sounding words from scientific publications.And a totally obvious story line as well.It really was cheese central.I can't even be bothered to go into the nitty-gritty of why it was so bad but I hope what I have written saves a couple of hours of someone else's life. I'm never getting mine back and I feel robbed!!My advice is don't bother.",1,10,18,14 December 2007
