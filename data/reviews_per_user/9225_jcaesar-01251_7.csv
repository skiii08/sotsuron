The King's Speech," Kings Speech fantastic film based on historical events.
","A tale of an unlikely friendship between King and Speech therapist, and a masterclass of acting between a triumvirate of actors. Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter's performances are so entertaining and are the highlight of the film for. The interactions between the king and speech therapist, alongside the King's wife is so engaging. A clever jump for the film was the large swerve that the film takes on the story that loomed over the whole period, which was World War II. The film cleverly keeps it at a distance while zooming in on the characters and their interactions and delivers a smart, thoughtful and brilliant exploration of character interactions that bring out humanity. I highly recommend this film to those who love films about the British Monarchy, rich in detail and as Roger Ebert states: has 'meticulous class distinctions'.",9,1,2,3 March 2017
Black Swan," Black Swan riveting and grueling in equal measure.
","I understand this film may turn some people off, but the two things propelling this film to the heights people built it up onto, are director Darren Aronofsky's technical mastery alongside Natalie Portman's faultless performance. The film centers around Nina, a ballerina devoted to ballet perfecting her art as a new and young ballerina comes in. The film is great is showing how character relationships bring out a characters humanity. Nina's relationship with her mother brings out her perfectionist side, while her relationship with Lily played by Mila Kunis, brings out a confident and loose Nina, while Thomas, Nina's dance teacher brings out the tension that's building in her mind. This is a smart, trippy, melodramatic film that explores character to the point, and I enjoyed it very much.",8,0,3,3 March 2017
Logan," Logan: Third times a charm.
","Here's my spoiler-free review of the film Logan, which I was lucky enough to go to the NZ premiere to watch.Firstly, I think we need to thank Deadpool. Because if Deadpool didn't succeed in the way that it did, 20th Century Fox wouldn't have taken the risk of creating a Logan/Wolverine film the way it should be. James Mangold (director) and Hugh Jackman pulled no stops as we progressed through decapitated heads, punctured limbs, sliced off body parts, and buckets full of fake blood that gives Wolverine an animalistic savagery his comic counter-part has, but just couldn't capture in the previous PG X-Men films. We're in the dirty, dystopian, Western-like world of 2029. A world where mutants are all but gone, Logan is not the fierce warrior we've come to know, but an alcoholic driver-for-hire, whose adamantium is slowly killing him from the inside, caring for 90- year-old Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who suffers from a brain disease that causes people within a mile or so to paralyse every time he suffers a seizure. Their quiet life is quickly turned upside down with the introduction of Laura (Dafne Keen), who takes our characters on a journey running from evil scientist Dr. Rice (Richard E. Grant), cyborg-arm guy (Boyd Holbrook) and his Reavers. Special mention for Stephen Merchant as Kaliban who adds to the story, and not just comedically. This is a contained X-Men film, building on the previous 7 films mythology, but more concerned with the story at hand. There's no world to save, no city to clean-up, not even a damsel in distress to turn into a love interest, this is a family tale, told in the most adamantium way possible. It's a film about a passive, sorrowful, broken hero at the end of a long adventure trying to find peace. And the film is smart in creating unpredictability, we're unsure of what this road will cost Logan.The biggest strength of this film, is its focus on the man, not the superhero. It's in the title of the film, named after James Howlett's human alter-ego: Logan, rather than Wolverine, his superhero alias. The previous X-Men films have been about showboating their superhero powers, it's what audiences expect going into a X-Men film, and I would argue most if not all superhero films. Here, we dive in Logan's reluctance to be a hero, a complexity he's been struggling with for a couple movies, and Mangold explores these personal themes, such as Logan's reluctance but also his feelings of guilt and isolation. The character relationships here are unparalleled in superhero flicks. All the relationships add depth, emotion and a heartbeat to the film. The mentor-student/father-son dynamic between Jackman and Patrick Stewart is heart-warming. Seeing a broken, beaten and old(er) Xavier being cared for by an aging and ailing Logan is nothing short of heart-breaking. In previous films Logan uses the term 'professor' to show Xavier's standing over Logan. Here, Logan doesn't mention it once. They are now close, and we explore their bond and the mutual feelings of guilt which is incredibly engaging. Also, Logan's relationship with Kaliban is a great. The relationships aren't just about emotional depth, but they help bring out our hero's humanity. Also, these characters don't just make a team, but a family. Unlike previous X- Men films, where they tried to make us think it was family, this film takes the time to tell a story of a family.The standout is Dafne Keen, playing Logan's daughter Laura. Keen holds her own with the 2 veterans, skilfully adding to the trio's family dynamic. Keen presents a young Wolverine-like Laura whose walk between innocence and intensity is spectacular.If this is Jackman's swansong, he's exiting stage left at the top of his game, to the thunderous applause of an audience demanding an encore. This is indeed an end-of-an-era, Jackman has donned the adamantium claws a whopping 9 times in 17 years, and never has he been more nuanced in his delivery than here. His performance can be both exhilarating and tear-inducing in equal measure. Jackman's legacy can be seen through the fact that his Logan/Wolverine has survived a Brett Ratner sequel, one bad Ryan Reynolds Deadpool, a couple bad movies to still be as loved and cherished by not only the comic book geeks (you), but also the general movie-going audience (you).Logan is a sincerely moving and gritty human story, which enthusiastically abandons superhero formulaic troupes, traditions and templates, translating the antithesis of what we have come to expect superhero films to be. It has set the standard for genre defining films, but to lock it into a genre will only do it a disservice, it's not just the best Wolverine film, or one of the best superhero films, it can confidently stand alone as a cinematic experience worthy of multiple viewings, which I intend to do.",8,2,7,2 March 2017
Inception," 98 out of 10.
","This was my pick to win 2011 Best picture at the Oscars. With obvious parallels to the production of a film, 'Inception' is an intense, complex yet creative and imaginative piece of entertainment. With I heard somewhere that Christopher Nolan took almost 10 years to write the screenplay for 'Inception', and he should have been rewarded with an Oscar for Best Picture just for the idea itself, because I remember the time it came out it came out in a summer of remakes and reboots carrying on an idea, and this was just original. The performances here are fantastic, from Leonardo's Cobb who was delicate and emotionally tough, and then there was the exposition- full Arthur played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but my favorite has got to be Tom Hardy's Eames! Every played bought their A-game, and this has got to be one of the most impressive ensemble casts assembled for an original film in recent history. Overall, I loved this movie, from the trippy visual effects, to the emotional and grounded storytelling, Christopher Nolan delivered his best, and I am wholly satisfied.",10,0,2,23 February 2017
Toy Story 3," Toy Story 3 brings the emotional depth so you bring the box of tissues.
","This is a kid's movies for adults. To me, Toy Story 1 is my favorite Toy Story of them all (which is three). It was a film about the relationship between Andy and his toys, much like Toy Story 2's plot. This story focuses on the relationships but in an abstract way, the toys end up going through an evil, cuddly teddy bear and a garbage incinerator to try return to Andy, who in turns hands over his beloved toys to another young human who he knows will take care of them like he did. For me, the film lacked the humanity that the previous two films had, and tried to make up with through action and humor, though it took away from the characters and emotions. Overall I found it a befitting end to an awesome and potential genre defining animated trilogy. I love this film and hope you will too.",7,1,2,3 March 2017
The Social Network," The Social Network has well-deserved buzz.
","The Social Network is a rich, modest and hard-hitting character drama that explores the politics of one of the most beloved and most used social networking internet websites: Facebook. David Fincher (director) captures and explores the egos and personalities behind Facebook. For me, the acting the stole the show was Andrew Garfield, who deserved an Oscar nomination for his performance here. I enjoyed this film very much, and I recommend it highly.",8,0,0,3 March 2017
The Fighter," The Fighter driven only by flawless performances.
","Look, i like the film, I think it's awesome but I also think were the characters were played by less effective actors, this wouldn't be as awesome as it is. The biggest fault for me, is that the main character has less personality than most sports characters in sport films. Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) has a crackhead brother, former boxing great played flawlessly by Christian Bale, and he has manager-mom played by brilliant Melissa Leo. Mark Wahlberg has range, he is a good actor, but Mickey just fell flat for me. I wasn't invested much in Mickey so when the boxing matches came on, I didn't care much. But the performances by the backup cast are fantastic. If anything, that's worth the concession price.",7,8,8,3 March 2017
