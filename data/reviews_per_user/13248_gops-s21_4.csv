Skyfall," What's all the bloody hype?
","'Old dog, new tricks' says Eve played by Naomie Harris and the movie pretty much sticks to that. But after starting off on such a high note with the Casino Royale, does that 'old dog' and his 'new tricks' live up to the hype and expectations? 'SkyFall' directed by Sam Mendes is something that i could sum-up as a 'wanna-be-Nolan-movie'. Don't get me wrong here. The plot here is indeed dark but it never gets darker than the screen. The sense of intrigue and tension is near-to-absent and the background score makes it worse by playing the traditional bond tune that we are so used to by now thereby making it look somewhat silly at times.On the bright side, the action sequences are spectacularly choreographed especially the first 10 minutes has some of the best action sequences seen in any bond film and an action piece involving a comodo dragon was totally fun to watch.But what bothered me were the bloody boring gaps. There are way too many dry spells in between and it all could have been excused if I cared about the characters. But the screenplay just doesn't do justice to the actors.There is humor, some intentional, some unintentional and there are a few good one-liners thrown in. However, they are far and few in between and all that dialog would have made sense if there was some layer/depth to the characters or the story.In the acting department everyone's done a fair job but it's 'Javier Bardem' who stands out for making a lamely written clichéd negative character look marginally interesting.Conclusion: For me 'Skyfall' is an overrated film that comes dangerously close to being an average movie. It's an uneven piece of work that probably wouldn't disappoint if you keep your expectations as low as possible.",5,12,26,2 November 2012
Paranormal Activity," A well directed home-video
","Now, let me be straight about this movie. It's hyped. Absolutely no doubt that it's hyped. I went in the movies this Saturday expecting another 'Cloverfield' or a 'Blaire-witch' and what I got was only a few minutes of goose-bumps. I am not saying that it wasn't scary. I totally agree that it was hell scary so much so that I didn't sleep that night after returning home. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good movie. The movie's plot development is damn slow and I am not complaining about the pace either. But in such cases the director is supposed to cover that up with some 'genuine' drama and it is here that it fails miserably. The dialogs are so dull that they never come out from 'Please don't go in there Micah. You are not going in there. ' and for the most part of its 85 minutes running time nothing really happens.Another problem with the movie is the camera work. Now I am not saying that it's hand-held camera technique made me dizzy(I actually love that stuff) but it's the camera positioning. I mean the camera stays over at one place in the bedroom where you actually get all the scares. Instead the director should have used it at various places. May be it was the part of their plan to develop that sense of Deja-vu that you have been in the bedroom for quite some time but they could have used it more creatively.Another flaw that I noticed is that there are a lot of places where you would ask 'Why didn't he just.' and this isn't good for a movie especially a horror flick.On the 'up-side' this movie was genuinely scary at places. The scene where the lady stands up staring at Micah for hours and hours was damn scary and the last 15 minutes or so also provided the best goose-bumps that stay with you even after you leave the theater. It's a movie that makes you believe that there are indeed such things happening somewhere. It expects its audience to use their imagination and completely relies on it. And that is the reason why there is so much of difference of opinion towards this movie. It seriously depends upon various factors such as the place or the time or even the people with whom you are watching this flick. If you are going in a theater room fully packed with kids or teenagers shouting from every corner then the movie might turn out to be outrageously funny! It does provide you with some terrific moments that might take you by surprise BUT they only come in bits.It certainly deserves a 6/10 because it's just a well-directed home video that was 'I assume', probably shot by the director with an intention to scare his friends.Somebody told me that you need to be 'strong-hearted' to watch this movie. I agree that to some extent but to me the movie requires you to be 'strong-minded' because it tests your patience for most of the time.",6,0,1,11 January 2010
Inception," He is delivering a spectacle, but to enjoy it completely the audience must earn it
","After watching this movie a big question got raised in my mind. 'Was AVATAR really a cinematic revolution?' The answer is a BIG NO.'Inception' is a movie that sets a new standard not just for Hollywood but for movie makers from all the over the world. It's a kind of movie that can't be explained in words and can simply be experienced (of course with immense concentration) in order to fully understand the depth of the story. I have been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan after I saw 'Memento' (another masterpiece of his) and since then have been mesmerized by his direction and the way he narrates a story. 'Memento' changed the way I used to think about movies. 'The Dark Knight'(2008) was another brilliant work that changed the way I looked at comic book heroes. And now here comes 'Inception', a movie that not only changed the way I think about my brain but also 'planted a new idea in it'! (Christ sake Nolan! :-O)Now coming to the point. I had heard from many of my friends that this movie is too complicated to understand. Now let me get this straight to you. YES. The movie becomes complicated at times not because of the plot but simply because of the narration which turns out to be the best way Nolan could have unfolded the story. If you watch movies for spending some leisure time with your girlfriend and grabbing some popcorn then the whole thing might go above your head. The movie requires your full attention. In fact it challenges you to understand the various concepts explained about dreams i.e. dreams within dreams within dreams and so on. The whole first hour is spent in explaining about our subconscious mind and how it works, my personal favorite being 'The Paradox'. Sounds like an overdose of knowledge rite? Not at all. In fact you won't even realize that the movie is more than 2 hours in length. Action Love Thriller It was a perfect mixture of well. almost everything! I even witnessed a fair amount of humor.Next, about the star cast well do I need to say anything about it! Everyone I mean literally every single actor was very fitting in his/her role. Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb was topnotch. He brings genuine emotion to the scenes in which we see Cobb overwhelmed with love for his wife and children, and he is every bit as convincing in his action star avatar. But my favorite was Joseph Gordon-Levitt who creates a composed, confident character that is a clever foil to DiCaprio's Dom Cobb.Hans Zimmer's music is haunting. Seriously, it would resonate inside your head for at least a day or two after you've done watching the movie. Editing by Lee Smith is top notch.And finally that brilliant and the most debated ending. Chritopher Nolan has given us the best ending you could have ever possibly imagined. Because it's been a week since the movie got released and me & my friends are still discussing about it. Jesus Christ I never discussed so much in my life (not even for my high school project! ;-) ) I couldn't help but stand up and applaud after that one spectacular moment which just holds your attention and you literally beg for it to end the way you want it to. And when it was over and the credits rolled, a very rare thing happened in the room. The crowd inside started cheering and applauding for what they had just witnessed. And I have never ever ever ever seen the crowd behave like that in my entire life. Conclusion: With Inception, Nolan fuses the core agendas of both his previous films (Memento and The Dark Knight) – 'HE IS DELIVERING A SPECTACLE, BUT TO ENJOY IT COMPLETELY THE AUDIENCE MUST EARN IT.'",10,3,8,26 July 2010
Amélie," A treat for the eyes, ears, and of course heart!!
","I know this is crazy because i'm commenting on a movie that was released almost a decade ago. And you might find it even more crazy the fact that 'i watched it recently' but i cannot stop myself from writing about it. Once in a while there comes a movie that touches you emotionally and stays with you for your entire life. And this is it. This is a perfect example of what a movie can do to you. It does everything to you. It makes you cry,laugh,smile,feel,learn.... and so on. Its a visual delight and the music.... 'boy oh boy'... the music so beautiful that you just don't want to stop listening to it. Each and every character is impressive but its the beautiful 'Audrey Tautou' as Amelie that stays in your heart.I thank director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and the of course the entire cast for creating a gem of a movie. I would watch it again and again and again till i die.....",10,1,5,7 January 2010
