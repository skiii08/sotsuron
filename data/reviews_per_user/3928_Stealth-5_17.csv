The Blair Witch Project," Scarier than any horror movie ive seen.
","The Blair witch project was very well done,i didnt mind the amatuer video scenes,they actually seemed relevant for the film.The fact that you dont see the witch isnt a real dissapointed it adds to the mystery of the story,the ending itself wasnt highly accclaimed,but it was still quiet interesting,the movie itself was very frightening,some scenes were just heart trembling,the stupid thing i thought was all the stones on the forest,and sticks and stuff,that was quiet silly,and the movie would have been better off getting rid of those scenes,and adding something more interesting.Overall i thoroughly enjoyed the Blair Witch Project,its not a masterpiece,but its a film that you would find alot more frightening than watching a hardcore horror film.I gave the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT a 7.5 out of 10.GOOD POINTS OF FILM: Intelligent Scenes/ Intense Realism.BAD POINTS OF FILM: Dissapointing Ending.",7,0,1,7 October 2000
Spider-Man 2," It's Been Hit By The Overrated Stick!!
","Well with the recent 'wave' of comic film movies in the last couple of years (Spiderman/ Hulk/ Daredevil etc. ) I found myself fairly anticipated for the sequel of Spiderman. The first was was pretty cool and deserves its IMDb rating of 7.4...Yet Spiderman 2 being on the TOP 250 is completely out of place, there are SO many other films that deserve to be on this spot and in my own humble opinion, this doesn't belong..Spiderman 2 seems to have a fair bit of concentration on Characters 'Development'...Thats if you want to call it that, you already know that his life sucks and totally loves MJ. People need to see through the Semi- Good effects and realize that this film definitely isn't as good as its said to be. Sure there are action scenes but most of them are very short lived, then are accompanied by boring talk talk talk...! Although its basically a famous thought that Sequels never seem to work, Spiderman 2 is a fair enough example of that- get off the hype and see this film for what it is...'Just another superhero flick'!(*MINOR SPOILERS**)ACTING: The acting was was mediocre. Tobey McGuire i would say had very little lines in this film, masked or unmasked he is just quiet. Kudos for wearing that seemingly uncomfortable suit though. Kirsten Dunst is no Meryl Streep, her performance is the same as any of her other films, nothing outstanding but she is a very beautiful girl. The others did a decent job, i can't say anyone here was a BAD actor, but definitely not great.ACTORS: Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst, Alfred Molina, James Franco & more...The casting is pretty good,i cant really say anything bad on this section as the cast are pretty well known and match their characters pretty well...Especially Alfred as 'Doc Oc'SCRIPT: VERY WEAK! The script is basically what weighed down a lot of the film. All these people giving it a 8-9 really need to Watch the film again or READ the script, this is not quality work. Continuity is lacking, many conversations are entirely pointless, so many boring and yes pointless scenes that bare no relevance to anything really annoy me, some corny one liners too. Oh and one extremely lame part is when Aunt May is stuck next to a man in a bank that is being robbed by a guy with 8 robotic arms, well this dude picks up a coin he finds on the floor and Aunt Mary slaps his hand. How dumb! Other dumb parts are stupid lines like 'I was always at your doorway' or another example would be 'He died when he did the right thing' (Referring to his dad saying NO to an armed man wanting his car)...The writing is plain silly for the most part and there's barely any describing why Doc Oc had his intentions and suddenly turning him to Mr. Nice Guy, really screws it up!CINEMA: Cinematography was par good par poor. The cityscapes and Spiderman (CGI) looked pretty good. Yet there were so many errors and bloopers, continuity was so poor, them CGI helicopters looked ridiculous. In general though camera angles were fair and not overused when it came to being fancy. So some good points and some lame ones.ACTION: The action scenes had some things going for it. The train scene was pretty cool. Doc Oc was a cool, violent Villain (until he turned nice). Though it did get fairly repetitive with Spiderman doing the same things over and over again. There was quiet a lot of talk (that was pointless) that could have easily been replaced with fun action- but it never happened. All in all definitely not an Action packed flick, but i guess it hits its target audience of younger teens.MUSIC: The soundtrack is nowhere near as good as the original. There wasn't so much music used here, and some of it had the 'Batman Essence'...That didn't impress me really, but it did have the classic 'Raindrops fallin on my head'- but in general the musical score here really need looking upon as it was bland.OVERALL: Spiderman 2 is in no, way, form or shape a terrible film...But also in no way, form or shape is this a GREAT film, reading the reviews here I'm surprised as to how many people loved this flick, it was terribly flawed. All i can really say is Spiderman 2 was hit by the OVERRATED stick...BIG TIME! I found it occasionally boring, sloppy and full of errors and bloopers...For the amount wasted on this film i was expected a masterpiece, and in no section of FILM was Spiderman 2 a masterpiece.** 1/2 (2.5 stars out of 5)",Null,0,0,10 July 2004
The Others," One Of The Best Films In '01
","In terms of Movies, the year 2001 has had a shocker, yet one film named 'The Others' finally worked the so far- bad year out. The Others was a film based in the 1940's during the war, the house is haunted by 'Intruders', the mother (Nicole Kidman) resides with her son and daughter, the daughter often complains of seeing 'Ghosts' in the house. The chill factor in this film is pretty low, yet one with patience must watch this film.The Others is a ghost film after all, so dont expect blood and gore, if thats what your looking for...Jason, Freddy & Michael are all waiting at your local video store, this movie was scary, not frightening but the eerie camerawork and environment was enough for me. In terms of the plot, it was very well thought of, the script was fabulously written and the acting was flawless, what more could i say? This film deserves to be in the top 5 movies of this year, infact...Number ONE is a good number!ACTING: The acting was fabulous in 'The Others', infact it was Flawless, especially by Nicole Kidman, such beauty portrayed on film, also the kids did a good job, especially the young girl, delightful to watch!ACTORS: Good, a few new faces in this film, but definantley not to waste, Nicole Kidman doesen't chose the best movies, but this time around she made the RIGHT choice, good range of actors, and good new-comers.SCRIPT: Terrific, this movie couldn't live without its great script, everything flowed in very well with the movie, the film had a dramatic twist at the end, could be predictable, but worth the wait.CINEMA: Brilliant, the use of the fog effects was breathtaking, the mansion was fantastic, the use of lights was brilliant, the camera-work was top notch material! Awards must be won.SUSPENSE: Quiet low unfortunantley, yet it is a ghost movie, it did have a couple of jumps, yet most of the film could be said to be 'Slow Paced', yet the thrills actually make you jump they are very effective the moment they approach.MUSIC/FX: Nice, especially during the scenes where Nicole Kidman gets tormented by the ghosts, the music was used well and the music did add to the suspence, very enjoying.OVERALL: 'The Others' is definantley better than 'Sixth Sense', infact the Sixth Sense was way over-rated, this film is much better. It developed a better plot and much better twist at the end, the only complaint some would have was the pacing of the film, a slow start, yet viewers are rewarded with the MANY upsides of this gret film.**** (4 STARS)",8,0,0,10 November 2001
The Terminator," This Is Top 10 Material.
","This is defnantley a classic of a movie,and never will be forgotten,people still brag on about the movie,and still mention the famous 'ILL BE BACK' scene. The plot is brilliant and very different,its very original,and nothing was wrong with this film except the sound,it was very shaddy.Otherwise this film was great,Arnold Shwarzenegger does a very good performance,not to mention Linda Hamilton.This movie is quiet graphic,but its an attention seeker,and grabs every bit out of me,i loved this film,and never will get over it.As i said its top 10 material,definantley in my top 10 list,this movie has great action scenes,and the story only gets better with TERMINATOR 2,go see that also.Did you know Terminator 3 is coming out in the year 2002,cant waaaaaaait!In overall,i think if you didnt watch this film many years ago,your crazy it was the biggest thing,and still is big.I GIVE THE TERMINATOR 8.5 out of 10.GOOD POINTS OF FILM: Great Display/Great Plot/Full Of Suspense/Very Original.BAD POINTS OF FILM: Shoddy sound.",8,0,0,25 October 2000
Scary Movie 2," Lacks In Structure..Had Some Potential.
","Scary Movie 2....Boy wasn't this film made in a hurry? Its pretty obvious, just watch the movie, and you will think they did the whole film in one take. The film is VERY short....Thats what makes it feel very cheap, you would expect alot more, the original was GREAT this sequel had potential but it was far from great.The movie starts off with an Exorcist spoof...Wow.! Well done, that was a good job and left me laughing alot...After that though, many of the jokes just aren't funny or are simply irellevant. Many of the jokes fall flat some examples would be (The clown scene,Nike Ad, Weakest Link,Hannibal,The Haunting) they obviously weren't thinking, after seeing these scenes you would think to yourself 'How long did this really take to make'?. The acting was mediocore, the film barely had any dialogue, and it doesent have that precious relationship from the original.....Cindy is with Buddy, thy barely communicate and they're not funny together. Tori Spelling is there for nothing..I mean who is she? And the 'I LOVE DEAD PEOPLE' chick...Who is she? Sure the whole movie is a spoof, but there must be SOMTHING, the movie had no plot and it lacked in structure, it was all messed up.On the other hand there are a few jokes that were great to watch (Charlies angels,Exorcist,VITAMIN C,Guy with weird hand) they were good...Yet they dont save the film from its many downfalls. Scary Movie 2 was very sexually crude, i dont reccomend this to anyone under 15 at all....Gross Humor is good in American Pie...Gross Humor in Scary Movie 2...Well..It doesnt quite work.ACTING: The acting wasn't good at all...Acting was barely required in the whole film, it is SO short and there is barely any dialogue, and this is what furthers the gap between this and its worthy original.ACTORS: Most of the original cast is back (Even though half of them died) a few good names...Excluding Tori Spelling, i guess the casting was ok..I wasnt expecting any better.SCRIPT: Very poor, this is what made the film sink....If they spent abit more time on the script, closing pot-holes, making the movie make sense etc. etc. Infact if they re-wrote the whole thing it would have been better...Seriously, they must have written this with their eyes closed.CINEMA: Very poor, lack of locations, its like the movie was made in a few days, i wouldnt be suprised if it wasnt.The lighting was good for the Exorcist but other than that, poor Cinematography.COMEDY: Had alot of potential, didnt really reach its goal. I did expect better, sure you will laugh in the movie, but dont expect many laughs...Just a few official laughs...Not artificial laughs where you are just laughing WITH the audience even though it aint funny to you.MUSIC: Hmmm music? all i really remember is GRADUATION DAY by VITAMIN C...Oh there was 'LET ME BLOW YA MIND' by EVE and Gwen Stefani, also the music during Charlies angels was ok..Not bad!OVERALL: Scary movie 2 i recommend you watch ONLY if you liked part one, and i am not promising that you will love this film, you might end up hating it.... Yet i personally think the film had lots of potential, it tried...But not hard enough.** (2 stars)",5,0,1,21 September 2001
American Pie," Well.......Teens Only!
","This film is really funny from a teens point of view. I dont know what you adults would think though,it does have some pretty silly and disturbing scenes....But otherwise,to me,this was a hilarious crude comedy,basically about 4 dudes that really wanna score,before graduation. It starts of with a funny scene,and the acting is very acceptable,but was blatant at times by some of the cast. The love relationships were fairly unrealistic,and biased.Now,its not as easy as it sounds,this has more crude that sex scenes....now,you either find it hilarious,laughable or totally stupid thats up to you to decide.The script was pretty well developed,and had some scenes,which left you crying for more.To me,the bad point was how the film developed towards the end,it slowly begins to go downhill from there,but luckily it ends before they actually ruin anything.Well....For the sex scenes themselves,were highly un-erotic,but not stupid,and the 4 dudes really do remind you of your friends!Is it worth the rent??Certainly??But i recommend that if your,what?Over 25 NOT to watch it unless your really hip and cool cause you WILL understand it,but find it disgusting,and laugh is disgust basically...Is it a film you can watch over and over again? CERTAINLY.....This film is very addictive,and no matter how many times you've seen it,you want to invite your friends over and watch it again.!Rating of 10? Well,it might just not be a blockbuster..! But it definitey IS a great film that im extremely certain you'd enjoy!8 out of 10",8,0,0,30 March 2000
The Village," A GREAT er...Love Story?!!?!
","Sitting at home, watching a trailer for the 'Village' - i saw what seemed to be a cool horror film. I sensed atmosphere, i sensed suspense, i sensed fear, i sensed horror....I SENSED WRONG! You must question though from the same guy that bought you the fantastic 'The 6th Sense'- and seeing the trailer you'd really expect it to be on par with it- but the 6th sense does RINGS around 'The Village'.There's been a deep absence of horror in cinema recently, after the whole slasher moment (1995-2000)- i noticed a calm in all forms of horror...Oh and was i hungry for more horror. I decided to go check out the village and i cant say too much besides what a GREAT disappointment. The trailer is the most misleading thing you will lay your eyes upon. The story consists of a village in the woods that is surrounded by the myth of creatures that lurk in the woods- its simple...Don't cross their neck of the woods- and they wont cross yours. It sounds like it has premise to be something scary.M. Night Shyamalan is FAMOUS for his plot twists and turns, but oh boy was someone trying a little TOO hard here. There's trying and trying too hard! He did that right here. Although 'The Village' had a decent cast and some very good acting, you will find yourself falling asleep in no time. If you love horror and suspense- this is NOT your film. The film is more or less a soppy love story between the villages hero and a blind girl. It was so funny how about half way through the film people were getting really impatient with the film.I wont say 'The Village' was a BAD film because it wasn't. It just wasn't what it was made out to be and it WILL disappoint many people. The cinematography is truly beautiful, the acting is fine, actors are good- but it loses points for being boring, slow paced and when it came to 'revealing' the monsters that was by far hilarious. All in all 'The Village' is a film that lies to its audience- read more below.ACTORS: The actors are good. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard is a GREAT actress, Joaquin Phoenix played his part well. There were a few other famous faces- including Sigourney Weaver who in my opinion didn't match her role. The acting was fine in general and that wasn't the problem with the film.SCRIPT: Pretty poor. This film tries to rely on a 'twist' to be its saving grace, but its terrible how it just goes from one 'twist' to another, they go way too far with all these twists and turns, in the end it feels like a rushed confused film. You can see the whole quality of the film really dies down in the last 30 minutes. More mystery, more suspense would have been great, less talk and pointless nonsense such as the 'bad color' etc.CINEMA: Cinematography was in general great. The whole village looked fantastic, people were dressed in period clothing. Long sweeping grass, scary woods- i cant deny the good job on the cinematography, its an attractive film thats for sure.HORROR: A REAL lack luster here ladies and gentlemen. As i said this is more like a romantic film than a horror film. There is ONE scene which will give you a little bit of a jump and thats about it, for the other 90 minutes expect to be twitching while getting impatient and drifting off to sleep when you finally have had enough.MUSIC: The music in the film was pretty good. Atmospheric in parts, well timed. I cant really complain about the music.OVERALL: 'The Village' is something you REALLY can not judge from its cover. Although everything about it spells out 'HORROR FILM'- it could never be so wrong. I find the Village to make a great Romance film, a deep drama maybe- but in no way shape or form is this a horror film, it is not scary at all- horror fans will be totally disappointed. A misleading trailer will really rake in some good dough- but expect it to rake in some bad reviews and a loss of respect to M. Night Shyamalan.** / ***** (2 out of 5 stars)",Null,0,0,19 September 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," I loved this movie,Definatley Top Notch!
","I dont think it gets much better than this,nothing has ever or will outstand this brilliant film. Firstly the plot continuation of the brilliant part 1 takes off supurbly,its an wasy going sequel,but much much more than that. Its a top notch action film and Arnold Shwarznegger and Linda Hamilton are back,but this time their is a newbie,its John Conner (Edward Ferlong),i liked his character,many people disliked him,he did a good job,but he was kind of exaggerated and stereotyped as a troublesome teenager.Its been a long while since ive seen the film,yet i remember it so well.Its a movie that youll never forget,with memorable performances and great special effects,this was the greatest film of the 20th century.I loved it.Overall i think this is even BETTER than the classic original,and i definantley reccomend you watch it many,many times.I GIVE TERMINATOR 2 a 9 out of 10.GOOD POINTS OF FILM:Great action/excellent plot/interesting characters/top notch sequel.BAD POINTS OF FILM: It wasnt PERFECT,but was very close.",9,1,1,25 October 2000
The Fast and the Furious," Sure It's Fast...& Furious, But Wheres The Story?
","The Fast & The Furious was a great film when it came to a limited extent. That was with cars, sure the film is basically based upon Cars, Violence & Women, the film still manages to get your adrenalin puping in your system whether you are a cars fan or not.Yet Fast & The Furious in depth is deeply flawed, when you look at all of it's attributes the movie can become unpleasant because there is basically a lack of plot. Every film starts off with a plot, yet one can even tell they had a problem even working on a PLOT SUMMARY of the film, because there really isn't much more to talk about other than cars. I suppose the plot summary should have been 'POINT BREAK: ON THE ROAD'. The movie bascially copies Point Break (Keanu Reeves) and just places all the action and adrenalin on the road.The cars in the film are fantastic to look at, and the cinematography is simply magical. When you look at the acting, it is on a half-half par, the scenes with Vin Diesel & Paul Walker just weren't dramatic enough, even though the two do seem to do a good job at other times. Sure the car has fantastic cars, sexy women & a great adrenelin rush, it simply cant go passed the BORDERLINE/GOOD barrier in my ratings barrier, although a stronger plot really would have placed this in the rankings of excellence.ACTING: Acting was mediocore in total, nothing overwhelming by any of the cast, yet most of the cast do a good enough job playing their characters.Vin Deisel & Paul Walker should have intensified their scenes.ACTORS: The variety of actors in the film are good, though there were thousands of extra's in the film too, thats to be appreciated. Vin Deisel is still going strong with his career so is Paul Walker, the female leads were a good choice for their teasing roles.SCRIPT: Poor, i don't find how one can simply write a film based on cars, the plot line was very thin and quiet silly. The script wasn't well written, the cinematography did it all for the film, the script basically wasn't needed, dialogue wasn't good at all. Not a good attempt.CINEMA: The cinematography in Fast & The Furious was quiet amazing, during many of the scenes you wander 'How did they do that?' . The camera work is fantasic, the locations although not pretty, do set the atmosphere for the film, a great job that should be applauded.ACTION: I don't really know what genre this film would be calssified as, it had abit of everything in it, that doesn't mean it passed each category. The action wasn't really intense, the comedy was low, the drama was low, it wasn't very thrilling either, yet a few scenes did leave your blood pumping for more.MUSIC/SOUND: The soundtrack to Fast & Furious is great, i loved the trancey beats used during the drag scenes, excellent. The sound on the other hand was truely screeching to the ears, the cars didn't sound nice despite their looks, a good enough job though.OVERALL: Fast & The Furious is a good movie, again only in a few terms, every other term is flawed, the script is thin and lame whie the Cinematography is beautiful. The acting is good, while it was low on action. I guess this movie is for hardcore car fans, although i would think they wouldn't even realise a plot is missing, i love cars...i love girls...i love things that are Fast & Furious, but i don't love this movie as much as others do, come on people, look passed the cars and the girls, there really is no story! Hence nothing to ride home about, even though it had great potential.*** (3 STARS) out of 5.",Null,0,1,7 March 2002
Pulp Fiction," Very Intelligent Piece Of Work...
","Ok....Well not SO intelligent with all the unneccesary swearing and violence, but it was a great film divided into very exciting segments, which left you wondering what would happen next. Although some of the segments were led to the wrong direction which also make me think that the movie didn't make sense, but you WILL get it. The best part has to be,when John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson get those druggo's in their appartment. Uma Thurman was great in this film very fresh and alive, well not really alive after that encounter with the 'needle'. The film was very bloody and had a lot of swearing, but you didn't really focus on that when watching the film - it was that exciting. Well overall here are my ratings...Acting- 4 / 5 Actors- 4 / 5 Script- 3 / 5 Display-4 / 5 Plot-   4 / 5 Performance - 3.5 / 5 Overall - 4 / 5B+",8,0,0,20 March 1999
Scream 2," A BIG Disappointment
","I watched this movie for the second time 2 weeks ago, when i first watched it in the movies,i was prepared for a great sequel..Well i was wrong,Scream 2 was just so identical to scream,it was very predictable,YES it did have more death scenes,and a better cast,but that's not the point the script was poorly written or Kevin Williamson was just laughing all the way to the bank. Now i'm not saying this movie was a major bumber, but it was nowhere near as good as the original. I think watching scream 3 would be a waste of time and money.

Bring It On," Bring On The Bimbos!
","Bring It On is rather immature,i really did expect better from Kirsten Dunst,but she really failed to impress.This movie is a teen movie,me being a teen still didnt see how they can make such a plot into a movie,sure a few scenes were fun and the cheerleading looked OK,what was the whole point of the movie? Just a bunch of girls battling it out, 3/4 of the film is based on the cheerleading itself and basically a moto 'BLACK V.S WHITE' this film has a bad influence,and wasnt directed too well.The script was pretty bad too,it failed to impress on many occasions,the acting wasnt acting,because it was jolly awful,it didnt require acting,becasue acting requires talent and none was used for this movie.Maybe if youre into cheerleading you might like this,i myself found nothing in this film to really brag on about it,its an over-rated movie,deserving nothing more than 2 and a half stars.Rating out of 5 stars (*****)(*)=half a star.Acting: *(*)Actors: ***Comedy: **Script: **Cinema: **(*)Overall: **(*) 2.5 stars",Null,0,0,17 February 2001

I am also tired of people whining,such as 'I was going to walk out of the theatre'that is the most stupidist thing i have ever heard,you're really that low...??You'd even jump out of a theatre because of a movie,i mean those comments are ridiculous,grow up people and enjoy the movies.",7,1,1,27 May 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The most original horror movie ever.
","Ive always loved this movie,not only is it original,it is so damn good.This is the beggining of the Fred Kruger series,but to me only this and part 3 are the best. The acting was supurb by all actors,but especially that of Heather Langenkamp and Robert Englund as Freddy. Freddy Kruger is extremelly scary in this film,he shows absolutely no mercy,but from parts 4,5,6 the movie tends to make a joke of it all,which totally ruins in. It was also nice to see the very young Johnny Depp who does exceptionally well. The movie at first has a Halloween kind of feel to it,but as it progresses the movie has a mind of its own. This is definantley on my top 10 list,it was fantastic.The most original horror movie ever.I RATE A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 8.5/10.GOOD POINTS OF FILM:Very Original/Scary/Greatly Acted/'Different' Storyline.BAD POINTS OF FILM: Not the best with music and sound effects.",8,0,0,24 October 2000
Cube," 'The Cube' Was Designed To DISAPPOINT!
","The Cube was a movie i wasn't holding my breath for. Although the concept of the story sounded interesting i could just tell it would be a major dissapoinment. So i sat through the movie and there's one thing i will admit and give this movie. The first 30 minutes are well done, you are drawn into the creepy world of the Cube. The actors are scared, and things seem in place. Yet as time proceeds past the half an hour mark the film just collapses right there- and i was expecting it too. There are many plot holes in the film. I mean i think msot people sat through this sorry excuse of a film to actually end up with a conclusion and to find out what the deal was with this CUBE. Yet our demands are unheard of in the movie.There are many flaws. Most noticeably was the acting. These bunch of unknowns couldn't act their way out of a plastic bag. Okay sure, the script they were given was pathetic but couldn't they see how stupid this film made them look? So the film had a budget i knew that- So the film was shot using the same one set, okay i'll buy that but WHY couldn't they add 5 extra minutes of dialogue to help explain what the hell the Cube is and how they go there? WHY couldn't they have added another 5 minutes of screen time for an actual ENDING? And WHY OH WHY did one of the characters absolutely lose my mind and mess the whole plot up? I guess the only answer i have for the 'Cube' was that it was mainly designed to disappoint.Below Are my conclusive reviews.ACTING: Terrible. The entire cast flunked. Even the retard was barely retarded. I dont even remember the characters name, yet the african/canadian man in the film was appaling. The Math Genius was really bad. Maybe if they were given better scripts....Oh no forget it! Thats just an excuse they cant act.ACTORS: Sorry i don't know these bunch of so called 'Actors'. Not only did the film have BUDGET written all over it, so did the actors. I mean no character was likeable not absolutely one of them. Either they didnt play their characters right or their characters simply had nothing going for them. Bad choice. Sad fact even a BIG NAME actor wouldnt save this film.SCRIPT: Oh gosh where can i begin on this? Decent for the first 30 pages of screenplay- THEN it just falls apart right there and it hits you like a speeding bullet. There is no beginning and no end to this movie so dont expect and introduction or conclusion becase there is none. Dont expect to have the faintest idea what the Cube is and how the characters got there. Dont think you might as well sit through the whole movie for the ending because there is no ending, the film basically laughs at you at the end. Dont expect interesting characters, expect yourself to smile at their deaths. If you think you can figure out the reason for the box yourself or if the writer did it purposely for us to figure it out, not even Einstein would know this. Sorry the script is just horrid.CINEMA: Finally something DECENT about the film. I only mean decent, nothing revolutionary or special. Just thinking it was all the same set made me feel that they did put in some hard work for the sets. Yet parts of the cube and its special effects look very fake. Other times the Cube looks very eerie and almost puts you there. Yet to make it short decent Cinematography- nothing special.HORROR: Thing about 'The Cube' was that it made me think it was stealing something from the Hellraiser films i cant exactly pinpoint WHAT it was copying but i got the scent of 'Unoriginal' for parts of the film. There is good gore in the first half of the flick then they just try to leave you in suspense leaving the characters in many caught up situations, though i dont have time for that wish-wash, i didn't learn anything- so they all might as well have died in the most gruesome way possible but it didnt happen.
MUSIC/SOUND: Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm. I dont remember much music in the film, maybe it didnt need it. Only thing you will hear is annoying characters screaming at eachother, the contant sound 'TSSSSSSSSH' of the doors opening and a guy acting retarted screaming 'Aahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh' that it makes you feel like punching the screen- no pun.OVERALL: Basically there is nothing that gives this film firm structure, theres no backbone- there is nothing that keeps it standing on both of its feet and thats what sucks. After such a promising idea we are given a poorly executed film that only leaves me feeling angry. Looks like they are making a sequel too- how could there be a sequel to a film that had no ending? It's too late to explain it- theres no saving this film. Thats a fact.* 1/2 Stars (Out Of 5)",Null,5,11,14 July 2003
The Wedding Singer," A Feel Good Comedy
","The wedding singer was an enjoyable movie,i just lo-o-o-ove Drew Barrymore,Adam Sandler Is good too.But the movie flew because i was having fun,the movie felt so short.But there were its downsides,i mean it was supposed to be the 80's.It looked or felt nothing like the eighties and it didn't bring back memories other than the 'Holiday' Music. Adam Sandler really paid back for his poor role in Happy Gilmore,he is much more fresh here,Drew Barrymore is brilliant also,all other casts were great too. The plot was great too,but it wanted to make its way deep into the eighties,and it got nowhere there.But altogether the film was very good,it was a feel good comedy which kept me smiling all the way.Wedding Singer Gets....
