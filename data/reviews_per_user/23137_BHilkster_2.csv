Sucker Punch," A Wonderful Imaginative Action Packed Film
","I saw the movie at the theater last night, and.... wow. This film is truly unique. The story is difficult to talk about with out spoiling anything, but i will do my best. Our Protagonist is a young girl who finds her self put into an insane asylum by her abusive stepfather so that he may be rid of her. From there its all surprises. The main characters find themselves in a variety of situations and hostile worlds. The protagonists get their first taste of battle when they find themselves in the trenches of World War 1. Except things aren't quite the same as they were in the history books. The Germans turn out to be cyborg like figures, brought back from the dead by the genius of German engineering. What do our heroes on screen do about this alternative history situation? Kill as many of them possible. This is just one example of the insanity and epic madness of the film. Any fan of Snyder's past work or action fans are in for quite a treat.",8,5,12,26 March 2011
The Patriot," Propaganda film? I think not
","The Patriot is indeed a film that has sparked controversy among American and British viewers. I feel that it is necessary to clear some of the air that surrounds this 'propaganda' . A great deal of people have come away with the impression that this film is perhaps a unrealistic piece of trash that portrays the British soldiers as Nazis. Thats right Nazis. Viewers have settled on this opinion because the British troops in the film are seen committing evil acts like, executing wounded men, or burning down a church full of civilians. So what? Its a movie, get over it. Is every American officer an insane killer just because Colonel Kurtz is in 'Apocalypse Now'? No. Besides the antagonist, our 'Nazi' British officer who leads these evil acts, is a fictional character. I hope anybody who wants to see this movie reads this review first, and can watch it without crying fowl. I'm an American and I do realize the historical in-accuracy, and the Rambo like action. But it's simply a movie and a great one too. No one American or British should come away from this feeling insulted, remember its just a movie.",Null,1,10,30 March 2011
