Hereditary," Best horror film of the year
","A lot has been said about this film, and while I do agree that it's one of the best if not the best horror film of the year, I don't think it's a masterpiece of its genre.Ari Aster's direction here is incredible, and so is the acting. While I wasn't sure about Alex Wolff's portrayal of his character in the first act of the movie, his performance really grew on me as the story went on. From a technical standpoint, HEREDITARY is simply flawless as well.With that said, the main story of the film didn't turn out as intriguing as I wanted it to be. It ultimately doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before. Aster obviously was very inspired by ROSEMARY'S BABY - that's all I'm gonna say here.HEREDITARY is still the best horror film of 2018 for me. However, it plays it a little too safe plot-wise and doesn't have something original to say in the end, which keeps it from being a masterpiece of the horror genre.",8,0,4,5 December 2018
Passengers," Could have been so much better
","The premise of this film is actually pretty great, but the execution just comes off as frustratingly conventional because PASSENGERS chooses to play its concept safe in every respect.The story of two people being isolated in a luxurious spaceship for the rest of their lives could have made for so many interesting statements about the fulfillment and our expectations of life, but the film just briefly touches these aspects during the last ten minutes and leaves the viewer with a cheesy and, most of all, lazy ending.The character interactions also squander so much potential because the film doesn't take its time in the important moments and instead shows us Chris Pratt playing futuristic basketball by himself for the first 30 minutes. Besides, the script missed the opportunity to easily increase the suspense with not starting the film from Jennifer Lawrence's point of view, leaving it to the viewer to find out the truth about her early awakening.All in all, this concept could have made for a great low budget indie film similar to Duncan Jones' MOON, but it just comes off as a boring mess within the scope of a blockbuster movie.",5,0,1,4 January 2019
Ready Player One," The endless reference
","With READY PLAYER ONE Spielberg arguably hit a new career low. It's really baffling how unaware of its own socio-economical and cultural themes this film actually is.The whole setting couldn't be more dystopian and depressing with people basically living in a virtual reality because of their frustration with real life. But the film never adresses that, never once questions the system as a whole and instead chooses to gloss reality over with its naive celebration of nostalgic escapism where 1980s pop culture is elevated to high culture standards.READY PLAYER ONE is a mind-numbing accumulation of endless references with a very simple and formulaic story barely holding it all together. The way this film presents 'culture' is ultimately very telling. Everything is being reduced to either edgy quotes or visual appearance - the Overlook Hotel taken out of Kubrick's THE SHINING is nothing more than a cool backdrop and the Iron Giant just some powerful weapon.Spielberg probably thinks that a world where all cultural knowledge is reduced to John Hughes movies and the suit from Buckaroo Banzai is cool and somehow desirable. It's not.",3,2,4,16 March 2020
The Killing Fields," Good, but far from perfect
","After finally seeing this film, which I wanted to watch for many years now, I'm actually not entirely positive about it. On the one hand, it's based on a real story worth being told and overall a solid drama.That said, I couldn't help myself but notice some flaws that keep THE KILLING FIELDS from being a truly great film. The score in particular is just awful and mostly out of place. There are several serious scenes within the film that are suddenly accompanied by melodramatic and at times almost goofy music and thus ruined. Aside from that, I didn't find the setup for the friendship between the protagonists particularly convincing. The American journalist Schanberg treats Dith Pran like his employee for the first hour of the film. Only when they are separated emotions suddenly run wild and the viewer has to believe in this profound friendship. Besides, the infamous 'killing fields' are in the film for approximately ten minutes. Joffé could have definitely laid more focus upon this horrifying part of the story.Nevertheless, I suggest seeing THE KILLING FIELDS - not least because of it being one of only a hand full of films covering the Khmer Rouge subject.",7,1,1,9 October 2018
Cross of Iron," Somewhat superficial - more of an action movie than a war film
","This film makes the biggest mistake a war film can make in my opinion: It's directed and edited like an action movie. CROSS OF IRON jumps from shot to shot very quickly, with almost every second one showing a soldier dying theatrically in slow motion in front of an explosion.You also don't get a good sense of the geography of the various battle scenes - once characters are in a trench, in the next shot they are shown inside a building and after that they are suddenly in the woods (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN does this way better f. e.). All in all, the battle scenes move way too quickly, even if they are well done from a technical standpoint.This action-heavy tone conflicts very much with the few attempts of seriousness througout the movie - especially at the end, when the film all of a sudden decides to show us random pictures of war crimes and the Holocaust, which feels very disconnected to the film.Although the acting is generally good, the relationship between Steiner and Stransky isn't thorougly explored and the whole psychological aspect of the film falls flat and feels kind of superficial.The film isn't bad by any means, just not as good as I expected going in. It's still watchable, mainly due to its high production value with some nice sets and well done practical special effects, and I have to give Peckinpah credit for showing the German perspective of the war. But how people can call this an anti-war film is beyond me.",6,2,4,14 November 2018
The King," Neither historical nor entertaining - A rather dull effort by Michôd
","While I appreciate Netflix for still financing big budget historical epics in a time when no major studio does, I couldn't help but feel quite disappointed by David Michôd's THE KING.Once you look past its stunning visuals, there is really not much substance to the film. Being almost entirely deprived of historical markings - e.g. location informations, time specifications or even just names of historical figures - and filled with inaccuracies, THE KING basically fails as a historical film. Now, that in itself wouldn't be a problem as shown by films like BRAVEHEART, which are highly inaccurate in their depiction of historic events and figures, but nevertheless work from a cinematic perspective. Michôd however, who clearly wants his film to play out as a dramatic character study, never achieves depth, empathy or even a sense of urgency for his story to be told at all.Watching this film, its obvious flaws made me think a lot about last year's OUTLAW KING. But while Mackenzie's Netflix epic at least had an exciting core to it as well as somewhat compelling characters backed up by memorable performances, THE KING is ultimately a dull and sluggish two-and-a-half-hour drag. And who on earth thought casting Robert Pattinson as the (English-speaking!) Dauphin of France was a good idea? At a time when this man is starring in films like GOOD TIME and THE LIGHTHOUSE, Michôd's script manages to craft a role that may be good meme material but is embarassing to watch and almost an insult to Pattinson as an actor.In the end, THE KING is a very average film, potentially boosted by great visuals and an undeniably high production value. Thinking about all the talent involved though, it's definitely one of the bigger disappointments of 2019.",5,49,85,1 November 2019
The Shape of Water," A visually impressive, but ultimately formulaic and bland film
","Having finally seen this film now, I do find it to be vastly overrated, while at the same time it became perfectly clear why this won the Best Picture award last year, as it comes off as typical Oscar bait.THE SHAPE OF WATER is basically the quintessential del Toro film - beautiful on the outside and crafted with great attention to visual detail, but shallow and formulaic in terms of substance. It's a fairy tale, a narrative consistently painted in black and white with its empowerment of all possible sorts of minorities in a conservative 1950s setting.My biggest problem with the film was its lack of real emotion. The whole romance felt clumsy and unbelievable. While it might have been plausible for the female protagonist to save this merman from certain death, them falling in love was just forced. A mute woman, scared of most men, suddenly offers herself to a humanoid fish? And her work colleague doesn't think that's weird at all? These offputting scenes did nothing for me except for making me feel uncomfortable.Again, just like with CRIMSON PEAK, del Toro made a good looking, yet strangely unemotional feeling film - they also both share scenes with explicit violence that kind of interfere with the narrative's tone. Some directors seem to struggle with conveying palpably emotion in their films, and besides Christopher Nolan, del Toro appears to be one of them.",6,4,6,23 May 2019
