Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Second Half of Tarantino's Masterpiece
","This is a much more contemplative, somber, and deterministic film than Vol. 1. The tonal disparity can be attributed to the splitting of a completed film into two seemingly dichotomous parts. Critics seem to be ignoring that this is merely the second half of a saga; perceptions of Vol. 2 as being closer to a 'true' Tarantino film have abounded, with this film being considered a satisfying sequel rather than the plaintive coda it happens to be. Of course it is a tall order to solder the delirious assortment of styles and influences of the first film with the masterly pacing and reflectivity of Tarantino's denouement, but that is part of the unique challenge of Kill Bill, an unwieldy masterpiece that reflects the breakneck referentiality, the encyclopedic knowledge of genre archetypes, and the bewildering love for cinema of its creator.Tarantino's sophistication in knowing when and how to reference his pet influences—kung-fu grind-house flicks of the '70s and spaghetti westerns, most vitally The Good, the Bad and the Ugly—adds immensely to his deft handling of conflict (physical, emotional, psychological) and the mythos of the avenging hero. Occasionally it can be frivolous: I could have done without the beard-stroking of the talismanic sensei, but it was an inconsequential irritant, a jest to the B-level qualities of the source material. Those who use self-indulgence as an open-and-closed criticism of this film and its maker are missing the point: Kill Bill is a catalogue of obsessions and an indulgent pastiche, yes, but it's also deeply considerate and generous to its audience, couching the more obscurantist elements and tendencies in recognizable and skillfully rendered cinematic language. Listening to some people talk, you'd think Tarantino committed a mortal sin by opening a portal to his brain. That it's mediated by some very empathetic performances (Uma Thurman, in particular, is a marvel: she endures physical and emotional highs and lows in the most rigorous and touching ways), and his most restrained screenplay yet, proves his interest in tapping into a more challenging aesthetic beyond that of fan-boy élan (something that still rankles me about Pulp Fiction).In this latter half, themes of fatalism and penance—briefly touched on in O-Ren's dying contrition—hang over certain of The Bride's waiting victims, creating in Budd (Michael Madsen) something of a purgatorial void of guilt and regret. He works as a bouncer at a vacant saloon, enduring abuse and mockery from his obnoxious, drug-running boss; he spends the evenings pulling on a bottle of Jameson and crooning to Johnny Cash. And yet, despite his concession that the Bride 'deserves her revenge and we all deserve to die,' he doesn't exactly surrender or give in when she comes calling. Why? There is an extraordinary, digressing monologue delivered by Bill late in the film that is as effective as any high-noon showdown in elucidating the warrior's existential code of fighting even when there is nothing worth fighting for. These are tough, spirit-deadened men, acting on instinct alone. The women are a different matter entirely: Elle (Darryl Hannah), for her part, yearns for battle, desiring the Bride to 'suffer until her final breath,' but respecting her as a peerless combatant. And I don't remember Vernita or O-Ren having much empathy, despite one mothering a child of her own and the other a victim of unspeakable childhood tragedy (the maverick anime insert, which may still be Kill Bill's most disturbing sequence). These are women largely without conscience, embracing their dark natures, masculine counterparts to the apprehensive men.Overall, I believe it to be a tricky proposition to link fluidly the two volumes—the tonal disparity remarked upon earlier could just as well be the effect of re-ordering and re-cutting scenes in post-production to reflect two separate films, the first more compressed and violent to entice audiences to see the second, illuminating volume. A best-case scenario would be for Miramax and Tarantino to release the film in its original state (as a third DVD along with the two individual volumes in a box set) to reflect what it was before it had to carry the weight of two feature films. Then we would have a true rarity: a chance for filmgoers to see if marketers and bean counters truly know what's best for them.",8,1,3,23 April 2004
The Sound of Music," The opening shot
","Firstly, the opening shot is magnificent: aerially gliding over snow-capped mountains, through valleys and streams, and finally setting on an extended forward rush toward Julie Andrews twirling about the hills. It strikes a triumphant opening chord as a marriage of form to content, as we are being granted witness to a person's burgeoning awareness of the world around her. How can she and the camera help but sing? Her first moments and interactions with the Von Trapp family seem staid by comparison, but Wise's typically astute craftsmanship and the contrasting approaches of Andrews and Plummer to their roles proves quite fascinating. And I must mention the subplot of encroaching Nazism, which yields some brilliantly executed suspense sequencesit doesn't get much more nerve-wracking than squatting behind a tombstone with the Von Trapp family as they're being tracked by the dogs and searchlights.",8,1,7,29 September 2006
Beauty and the Beast," The best Disney film since 1991?
","Reportedly five years in the making, this enchanted, inspired production is perhaps not quite on the level of Disney's first-tier masterpieces (Pinocchio, Dumbo, Snow White and Fantasia), but a strong case could be made for it being the best film the studio has released since its 1991 premiere. From the design of the Beast's awesomely monolithic castle to the heart-stopping, Busby Berkley-inspired dance of china and silver in 'Be Our Guest', this is one of the most rigorously constructed animated films I've seen. Bolstered by grand, romantic themes of self-sacrifice and eternal honor in the face of persecution, this is a marvelous experience for any age.",8,1,2,6 October 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Byzantine
","Returning to the hermetic Boston neighborhoods of Mystic River, a familiar atmosphere of blight and hopelessness pervades Gone Baby Gone, which presents a morally byzantine world whose laws don't always protect the innocent, making the very idea of doing the right thing a vastly complex negotiation. The story concerns Casey Affleck as a private investigator hired by the family of an abducted child to augment the search. He's intent on cracking the case and restoring the child to her family, but the job proves much more troubling, revealing twists of motivation that severely test his steady, Catholic-informed code. Ed Harris is terrific as a passionate veteran of a child crisis unit. He and Affleck share a perfectly written scene following a bloody siege on a squalid house of horrors, in which Harris reveals unethical choices he's willingly made in the past to benefit at-risk children. This five-minute exchange unearths buried secrets and personal thresholds, forecasting on a character level the story's climactic decision. (Crucial is Affleck's rejection of Harris's moral relativism, a necessity in this ethical morass.) Although director Affleck stumbles somewhat in the third act, which employs one too many misdirecting flashbacks (and requires one to piece together some story threads almost by inference), the final 10 minutes are finely judged, including a devastating final shot. Films that approximate life's situational complexities are all too valuable, and this one is exceptional in that regard.",7,0,1,1 April 2014
The Thing," Carpenter's best
","An austere fantasy about a U.S. government research team stationed in the desolate Antarctic tundra, visited by an indestructible shape-shifting alien, John Carpenter's remake of Howard Hawks's The Thing from Another World methodically deconstruct the human psyche under stress while emphasizing the ineffectuality of solidarity when faced with a tactile existential crisis.The protean form of the eponymous 10,000 year-old extraterrestrial provides a strong ideological thrust as it assimilates the bodies of the crew at random, facilitating a convincingly febrile cocoon of paranoia, quarantine, and primitive self-preservation. Ostensibly an homage to '50s creature features, The Thing owes more to the social allegory of Romero's Dead Trilogy and the abstract techno/corporeal concerns of Cronenbergian cinema, which was coming into its own around the same time (1982). This would mark the third in a handful of starring roles for Kurt Russell in Carpenter-directed films. His portrayal of the vulnerable lone hero (the hero only inasmuch as he commands the subjective space) acting decidedly un-heroically—a staple for Carpenter, who seems to endeavor a refashioning of the Western in withered, technologically compromised dystopias—is effective and relatable.Carpenter makes masterful use of the Panavision format—often compressing the dozen or so supporting characters into the same frame—filling the space with ominous peripheral details, mounting the tension almost subliminally. Which is not to say that it is wholly reliant on silence and intimation for its impact. Rob Bottin's makeup work on the tirelessly regenerating alien has been The Thing's most enduring virtue, and not without reason: whether adding strange appendages to The Thing (the head of a victim emerging from a shoulder, attached to a long, spiraling neck) or having it suddenly burst through a carrier's tremulous visage, Bottin capitalizes on the concept of a mysterious, replicating evil in the most terrifyingly innovative ways.Not to be outdone, Ennio Morricone provides a repetitive, quietly harrowing score that sounds like the end of the world. And it is thus with The Thing, a vision of humanity scorned, burning itself bare at both ends, but in conception a work of paradoxical solidarity, craftsmen at the top of their game working toward a uniform purpose. Sometimes it's good to be at odds with the screenplay.",9,0,1,11 August 2004
Van Helsing," One of any year's worst
","As if the craven and borderline blasphemous pre-release marketing of this film weren't enoughshameless piggybacking aboard the miraculous Universal Monsters Legacy DVD set, which impudently presupposes the superiority of our modern technological strides; you can almost hear Sommers: 'if you thought that was cool'Van Helsing proves that sometimes you can judge a movie by its sh!t-stained cover. A collection of images that move, look and feel computer generated, the plot, or what there is of it, seems motivated only by the ephemeral thrill of creating pretty grotesquerie. In its widely incomprehensible visualization, it serves up the basest of thrills and it does almost nothing to comment on or even penetrate a subject rife for meta-commentary. Please don't give these people any of your money.",3,1,2,15 February 2005
I Am Legend," Satisfying blockbuster
","Despite a final act that isn't quite up to par, this is one of the most satisfying blockbusters in recent memory. A supposed miracle cure for cancer has wiped out Earth's population, except for scientist/soldier Robert Neville (Will Smith), who's immune to the virus, and a genetically mutated species of 'darkness seekers,' hairless vampire-zombies that roam free at night. The best sections of the movie simply document Smith and his German shepherd passing the time in a deserted New York City, hunting deer on the barren streets, hitting golf balls from the wings of fighter jets, and checking out videos from the local shop. The eeriness of being the last human in a city built to sustain a population of millions is acutely evoked, allowing us to absorb the situation's enormity through long takes, panoramic shots that dwarf Smith in his environment, absence of music, and the absolutely brilliant integration of production design (shot on location) and special effects to present a hollowed-out metropolis littered with empty cars, wild animals, and buildings submerged in water (seeing this in IMAX increased my appreciation tenfold). Reminiscent of the abandoned London in 28 Days Later, yet it doesn't feel derivative in the slightest. By the time the story opens, Smith has already developed a routine and familiarity with his surroundings, so we're watching a man who has fashioned a degree of normality from chaos, which is strangely more unsettling than if we were to witness him waking up to a changed world. Smith is altogether fantastic portraying a man of active intelligence whose faith in finding a cure slowly crumbles due to tragedies that consume his soul and all-consuming loneliness (his complete meltdown in a video store is a lesson in how to show turning-point despair without going over the top). The dog playing his companion Sam deserves a large degree of credit as well, essentially standing in for Smith's daughter—a metaphor completed by the daughter handing the puppy off before departing—and making the human-dog interactions touching and indelibly sad; it reminded me, in a small way, of how the adults in Children of Men kept trinkets and dolls to help them remember and to assuage their loss.However, the film isn't just a poignant character study: Lawrence delivers skillful suspense in Smith's daylight encounter with a pitch-black zombie hovel that relies more on anticipation than effect. At the beginning of this review, I mentioned that I was somewhat disappointed with the ending. The movie works so well as an isolated survivor tale that the introduction of a mother and son from a Vermont colony felt like an unwelcome intrusion (it doesn't help that their characterizations are perfunctory compared to Smith's three-dimensional one). Then, the film imparts an element of religious faith that at first appears forced, but leads to Smith's last mortal act that is more hopeless and despairing the more one reflects upon it. Although the God-fearing mother's voice-over ends the movie on an optimistic note, consider two things: the futile look Smith gives the uncomprehending, glass-bashing zombie when Smith realizes the sick don't want to be cured; and, therefore, for whom is the new vaccine intended if not for the sick? If the already immune possess the cure, then what purpose does its existence serve? Factoring in the challenges to the audience represented by the minimalist, experiential narrative, and the emphasis on observation rather than visceral force, the irony present in the seemingly clean wrap-up seems like one more challenge to look beyond the obvious. Even if not entirely successful, I'm grateful for the attempt.",7,1,2,1 April 2014
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," One of the year's best so far
","This inspired inquiry into dreams and memory—suffused, like 'Waking Life,' with certain metaphysical questions: Can we exert control over our dreams? Can our waking actions be affected?—is proficiently anchored by both Gondry's visualization of memories being ripped from the protean grasp of desire and the heart-rending account of an afflicted couple trying to outwit their own self-destructive impulses. It seems that after his ambitious but not quite satisfying attempt to climb inside the artist's head during creative constipation and compromise (Adaptation), Charlie Kaufman has found a director who can not only evoke his flighty genius in image, but who can reign in and expand his ideas. And it is a rare film that can so skillfully say opposing things about the nature of relationships: They end in suffering and misery between hopelessly incongruous people, but they still require careful consideration and a selfsame willingness to suffer despite the stacked odds. Hell of a conundrum.",8,0,1,11 August 2004
Reservoir Dogs," Sterling Debut
","Quentin Tarantino's crime thriller about an anonymous group of low-end hoods and how they deal with a diamond heist gone terribly awry still stands out as a coruscating debut, with its elliptical, jump-cutting narrative construction illuminating a vision of antisocial individuals unwittingly confined to a hell of their own making. The cavernous warehouse, a windowless, stifling structure, is where the characters eventually 'end up' after a bungled heist and where the fulcrum of this tense, sweaty battle of wills plays out. The moral linchpin of the story is the relationship between Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), an undercover cop whose unnerving, gut-wounded shrieks open the movie proper. A tough, grizzled veteran, White blasts through police cars filled with cops, while paradoxically nurturing the incognito Orange back to health, holding his head in his lap, assuring him in a sing-song voice: 'You're not gonn-aa dii-eee.' It's a wonderfully absurd dichotomy that suggests the dual natures of the other two primary hoods: Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), a cool, unflappable silver-tongue on one hand and a ruthless, inhuman monster on the other, and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), an eloquent, irritated card—as in the opening restaurant conversation, which is about as finely crafted as expository intros get—who, like a Leone anti-hero, is also an oily, amoral pragmatist, playing all sides to fulfill his ends. Tarantino's dialogue, particularly in how it seeks and finds the characters' blue-collar-rooted colloquialisms—their endless discussions of pop culture tropes, Joe's rallying call of 'Let's go to work,' their choices of music—seems uncannily effortless, despite an understandable temptation to devolve into oscillating theatrics. These characters live in a parallel universe, their dual social roles of criminal and laborer making their flash and bravado seem empty and innocuously self-contained. True pariahs, they lash out as a means of communicating, perhaps because they have no means of transcendence. Which, returning to the story's central relationship, all makes White's compassion and humanity nothing less than tragic.",8,0,2,26 April 2004
The Departed," Good, but Scorsese's least personal film
","In this, Martin Scorsese's least personal film to date, the director's typically freighted acts of ritualized violence are pared down to a simple, brutal efficiency. Gone is Travis Bickle's spiritually cathartic massacre of a compound full of pimps and dopers or Jake La Motta's masochistic bloody atonement versus Sugar Ray Robinson. The one-shot kills depicted here, shocking in their suddenness, are accompanied by the same splatter of brain fragment across pristine surface time and again. In their depersonalized sameness, these acts achieve something of a perfect uniformity to the dehumanized world in which they occur, where life is cheap and identity cheaper, each man an interchangeable cog in a bottomless existential chain game of cops and robbers. Yet this dedication to meaningless chaos saps the scenario of some of its complexity, particularly noticeable in Scorsese's relative lack of attention to moral and spiritual consequence, the rich exploration of which have solidified his legacy as a serious artist.So, what is at stake? Unlike in his best work, the answer is found in dismissed and belittled subjects. The disdainful treatment of the clergy provides a window into his methods, as he gives neither counterpoint nor context to an early scene in which two priests are accosted and verbally humiliated by a gang lord played by Jack Nicholson. The scene is treated as a blackly humorous anecdote, but the degrading treatment found here and elsewhere in the film, of a profession to which he's mostly shown unique respect throughout his oeuvre (the fact that he nearly became a priest cannot be ignored), suggests that he's in accord with Costello's coarse assessment. This denial of complexity turns up frequentlyincluding an incredibly poor final shot, the selection of which frankly puts his judgment in questionand suggests that what's truly at stake is commercial viability.If Scorsese's presentation borders on the reductive, the film is given ample weight and complexity through several fine performances and its crackerjack premise: Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), an undercover cop trying to earn his stripes, moves up a Boston gangster's (Nicholson) food chain as Nicholson's surrogate son and lieutenant (Matt Damon) infiltrates the city police department. Both moles appear at first to be sympathetic, good men. But as Costigan clings tighter to the fragments of his true identity Damon begins to relish the freedom of his adopted one, eventually resorting to irredeemable measures to protect it. The story provocatively suggests that Costigan is a better cop as a criminal and Damon a more effective instrument for evil as a protected agent, a sly insinuation that the methods and conventions of the police and the underworld are not so dissimilar.Scorsese, to his credit, crafts many fine suspense sequences. The film is at its best when Costigan and Damon are pressed to work at cross-purposes on the same task, as in a drug deal between Costello and some Japanese buyers, when the imperiled moles clandestinely use cell phones to send signals to their respective teams. This scene, and two deeply upsetting deaths, fulfills the promise of the scenario, propelling it to near-greatness. The fact that it falls short may be attributable to Scorsese's indulgence of Nicholson's worst impulses, playing a multifaceted character as a dime-store Mephistopheles, thereby softening the story's profound emotional impact and coarsening its tone. As affecting as DiCaprio and Damon are, Nicholson plays it from the outside, relying on tired gamesmanship to undermine the narrative austerity. Just as Nicholson's failure to understand age-appropriateness paints him as an old man trying vainly to be a kid again, Scorsese's comparatively grown-up attempts at striking the right balance between the sacred and the profane are infinitely preferable to this stab at postmodern chic.",7,0,0,24 October 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Intersections
","One earmark of a great work is how strongly it defies easy classification. The Bridge on the River Kwai could reasonably be called a war picture, a P.O.W. escape picture, a dark farce, an examination of leadership, or a debunking of the Great Man theory of historythese would all be correct and also fall short of describing its essence. The film is about a proud, valorous colonel and his rival, the ruthless leader of the Burmese P.O.W. camp at which he and his troops are captive. As the story progresses, the division between hero and villain gives way to a more significant consideration: under such austere conditions, who will be able to navigate the messy intersection of personal and institutional codes of honor and conscience? At first, the deck is stacked for the colonel (played with conviction and inscrutable dignity by Alec Guinness), as in an early scene when he pulls out a copy of the Geneva Convention to prevent his officers from participating in construction of the eponymous bridge to India or when he's willing to sit in a tiny enclosure ominously named 'the oven' without food or water to uphold his principles. Eventually, his unwavering integrity breaks Gen. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), whose great pride is exposed as he weeps solitarily at his failure. Providing further counterpoint is an American soldier (William Holden), whose code of pragmatic survival has kept him alive for many years in the camp, and who cautions Nicholson that they are miles away from a civilization that respects government dictates.During these early scenes of attrition, note the question marks Lean drops about the price of Col. Nicholson's fealty to exact military letter in such an environment, as when an officer drops dead from heat exhaustion, or the scores of others locked up in ovens in the blazing heat as punishment for his obdurateness. There is something of a heedless pedant lurking inside of him, of a stubborn child who will stop at nothing to win his point. These flickerings of personal investment foreshadow consuming obsessions yet to comeLean's masterstroke is to leave this story just as his hero is beginning to show cracks and intercut with Holden's escape from the camp, his recovery at a military hospital and his tepid agreement to aid an allied bombing of the bridge, his disreputable colors exposed in the process. However, for all of his insouciance, his identity is anything but fixed. Like Nicholson, he is by turns fatuous, noble, obtuse, principled or highly sympathetic, our understanding of him constantly in flux. The difference may just be Holden's lack of adherence to any rigid code in contrast to Nicholson, who permits the construction of the bridge to become an act of personal value, crucially supplanting his impersonal militarism.This changing of the internal guard is beautifully evinced in a late scene involving Nicholson as he stands quietly triumphant on the overpass contemplating his achievement. He has overtaken the project, commemorated it as evidence of Western superiority. Saito is eclipsed in these shots, pushed to the background or out of the frame altogether, curiously sullen considering the monument will likely be instrumental to the Japanese war machine. As the camera slowly zooms in past Saito's dejected mien, Nicholson's words tell a more personal story: 'you wonder, you ask yourself, what the sum total of your life representsI don't know whether that kind of thinking is very healthy; but I must admit I've had some thoughts on those lines from time to time. But tonight... tonight!' As his jubilance emerges from some buried place, his prized officer's baton falls from his fingers into the river belowpride over duty. Momentarily, personal fulfillment has trumped national glory, and he has lost sight of the bridge's real significance. As will be proved, things of meaning and value have no dominion in such a place of madness. This is a great work.",10,1,3,6 October 2006
