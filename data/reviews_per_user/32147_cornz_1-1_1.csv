Blade Runner 2049," The most over-hyped, dullest, least interesting film of 2017
","Oh we all waited so long.
The promises were made.
The final result is nothing short of a huge barrelful of boring borningness.
Look at it this way, if the ORIGINAL blade runner had never been made and this travesty was the first blade runner, we'd still say it was over 2 hours of utter tedium.
Missing the tense action, superb cinematics (no CGI back then), outstanding soundtrack and moral ethics that made the original such a genre defining film.
No, the critics will have all been paid well for singing its praises whereas those of us who can remember and still relate to the original wont fall for the hype.
An utter travesty of a film that they should have never made because they were NEVER going to better the original. Go rent the original one instead. Same story just a WAY better film.",1,4,8,27 December 2017
