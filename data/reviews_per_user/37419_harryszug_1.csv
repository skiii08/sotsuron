Sucker Punch," Pure Ten
","The most underrated movie ever. All the negative comments are understood , but if you watched this movie and you didn't like it you should watch it again.
Probably you didn't get something.
The fantasy over fantasy thing is brilliant.
When baby doll is being abused by Blue's clients she imagines that she is dancing for them. And to bare the dancing thing she is imagines fights in unreal worlds.
And the final fantasy with the doctor is just amazing.Fact : At the starting scene we see curtains opening and Baby doll is with her back on a bed. When she arrives at the asylum there is Sweet Pea in the exactly position on the stage wearing blonde hair. After it we see Sweet Pea again wearing blonde hair being lobotomised to get clients ''horny''. But I think that this is more than that. What if Sweet Pea is the same person with baby doll. Imagine.
Sweet Pea is the mind and Baby Doll is the body. Even at the end makes sense. Sweet Pea never escaped. Her mind escaped. Her body was there ( Baby Doll ) but nobody couldn't touch her because her mind was free.Food for thought.Also plenty of Easter eggs going on in this movie.
I've watched it 4-5 times and every time I'm discovering something new.",10,8,10,20 March 2020
