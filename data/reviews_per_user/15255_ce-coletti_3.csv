Lucky Number Slevin," 'There was a time...'
","'Lucky Number Slevin' it's a movie to be reason, not only seen.The plot demands of the spectator deductions of what is happening now or what happened in the past, while the director complicate the things with characters of fast talk.That's the story: Slevin (Josh Hartnett) is in a occasion of misfortune (or not) go to a friend's house (or not) and is charged of a debt by two of the greatest crime leaders in NY: The Boss (Morgan Freeman), that recently lost his son, and The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley, excellent), man that The Boss thinks that is the responsible for the crime. The Boss says to Slevin kill The Rabbi's son for revenge, while Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis) was hired for the same service.It doesn't matter if you pass all the movie without wink and find out the final surprise, the exceptional script will tie your attention, just like the pearls that the characters fire off.

World Trade Center," Oliver Stone is great when divested of politic's preoccupation.
","Releasen with 'United 93', this story shows the 'emotive' side of the 11/09 tragedy.In truth, the movie became surprising for his director: Oliver Stone ('Born on The Fourth of July'), usually very politically preoccupied. But now, he doesn't touch in the polemic matters! The script focus on a team of buried cops, gradually disbanded, until remaining just Sargent McLoughlin (Nic Cage, great) and Officer Jimeno (Michael PeÂçòa). The movie switch between the cops and their families, mainly the wives (Maggie Gyllenhaal & Maria Bello, both wonderful).An emotive story, that shows the human and fragile side of that terrible thing that shook all world. Stone shows that without the politic preoccupations, he is a great director. Thank god he find out in time.",8,1,3,14 April 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," Great!
","Marc Forster it's a versatile guy. After the drama 'Monster's Ball', Forster directed the beautiful 'Finding Neverland' and the inconceivable 'Stay'. But Forster improve yourself in 'Stranger Than Fiction'. Will Ferrell is great like Harold Crick, common and methodic man that starts to listen a stranger voice narrating his life (the most original idea of the decade). Helped by a literature teacher (Dustin Hoffman), he discover that her 'authoress' is Karen Eiffel(Emma Thompson, fantastic), that is having a creative blockade (problem that is resolved by the 'secretary' Queen Latifah) and always kill your main characters in the end. But Harold doesn't want to die now, because he finds the woman of his life (Maggie Gyllenhaal, great as always). What we see next is a screenplay lesson from master Zach Helm, and a directing lesson from Marc Forster. The philosophical end is just wonderful and all this results in a movie nothing less than perfect.",10,0,0,7 January 2008
