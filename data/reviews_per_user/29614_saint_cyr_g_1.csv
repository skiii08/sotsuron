Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette
","I first heard about Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette in early July, and ever since I have be eagerly waiting its release. I was first in line on opening day, and was not disappointed. The costumes, the music and the performances were all masterful. What is most captivating about this film is how relatable it was to the audience, (or at least me). The camera work and the sometimes slow moving plot helped to show the true extent of the boredom faced by the young queen. By making Marie a relatable character Coppola was able to create a human face on a highly misunderstood historical figure. This was greatly enhanced by Kirsten Dunst, who gave a radiant performance. She captured the spirit of a young girl trapped in a world in which she had no control. Dunst was able to make the audience care for Marie from the very first frame to the heartbreaking ending. For all of these reasons Marie Antoinette is a true work of art. Coppola's vision is both beautiful and captivating, and should be seen by all.",8,0,1,9 December 2006
