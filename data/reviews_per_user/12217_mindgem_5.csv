Deepwater Horizon," Typical American Hero story but false
","It's an interesting story but it just fall flat when they push that American hero nonsense in there just because they can't paint out America or Americans as anything but heroes even though this oil spill was really bad.spoilers coming up.So at one point one crew member wanted to push a button that would seal something, possibly preventing the spread of fire but she didn't have authority to do so so she couldn't even though it probably would have been the difference in life of others. So they drag the captain up to the bridge so they could hold his busted hands and push the button with his finger...now that's nonsense. They want to portrait these guys as heroes, no way they did that in real life. Get off it.So first I got salty about all those hero stuff but then I really got sour when they all (but 11 I think) got rescued and started praying to god. Now what the hell, there's just been a major tragedy, lives were lost, oil would contaminate the water and they uniformly decides to read bed time stories to pray to God. That takes the cake for me. Don't push your God-crap on me, that also didn't happened in real life.So great shots, good acting, interesting story but those two ingredients destroyed this picture for me.",3,62,123,11 October 2016
Us," A very very bad slasher movie
","The only good thing with this movie is the premiss.I must admit that I was already in a bad mode when the opening scene was a 3 minute slow pan out of a rabbit, completely pointless. If that would have connected to the movie later doens't matter because at that point you have no clue.The acting is meh but the dialog scripting is just aweful. The boy is suppose to be autistic I assume but does not play it at all. He plays a normal 10 year boy with stupid ideas and the parents treat him as he was 2 years old. Like the scene at the beach, if the boy is autistic the parents wouldn't let him wander off alone like that but if they were lax then why the enourmous panic when she can't see him, I mean it doesn't make sense at all, the reaction does not fit the scene at all.
Furthermore they panic when they realize he's out of sight but then they find him right next to them a milisec later so there's no time for the viewer to panic over it.Everything is super strange and boring for a long while til the action finally starts. When they have killed all the things, then the mother and children are in the house while the father is in the boat and has been gone from the rest of the family for a while.
So when he is done killing he walks back to the house and just rings the door bell, relaxed as if the killing was over. For all he know his family is slaughered in there right. So it's a super anti climax.
Okay so that's the end of the movie, they killed them all.No wait. what's this. I'm about to leave the cinema but the movie keeps going. For another 30min of something I don't even remember because they made it so it looked to be over already.This movie is so confusing, badly written, badly acted, badly scripted, they have no experience with horror. It's aweful.",4,1,3,26 March 2019
Just Go with It," Adam Sandle is a despicable man and plays himself in every roll
","It's very clear Adam Sandler had a sad youth with lots of disappointments and bullying but do he really have to bully back? In every roll he plays he picks on kids and he loves a setup joke where the banana peal is on the ground and he just sits and waits for someone to trip and hit his head and bleed all over and then he jumps out and laughs. That's the perfect setup for Sandler.Humour of a 2 year old. Adam Sandler loves slapstick to the degree he even spoils a joke for a redneck. Without Adam Sandler this movie would have been a good 7 but with him, the very best you can ever score it is a meek 3, he really draws everything he touch in the dirt.",Null,2,5,7 October 2011
Midsommar," Some great scenes but overall a Terrible movie
","Spoilers throughout!Lets start with the good parts. There are some visually beautiful scenes and the costume desings are great. There are also some great ideas and by that I mean plot points buy only for a few scenes before it all goes to crap again.So on to the bad things.
The script and plot for this movie is one of the worst I've seen.When the guys witness two suicide/murders the natural reaction is to want to get the heck out of dodge but our what do our hero gang do, walk back to their cabin and talk about what they wanna do for school work.The gang has travelled all the way to Sweden gor the midsummer festivities which Im sure their swefish friend must have mentioned to them or at least they looked it up beforehand.
But when they reach there and starts off with a bad acid trip and from that point there'ss no booze, drugs, party, laughter, food or anything fun at all. Why would these guys stay after days full of boring boring stuff.Its a terrible movie with more plot holes than a swiss cheese",3,1,3,25 October 2019
Mother!," Wonderfully strange but illogical flaws that is hard to ignore
","This movie leaves a lot of questions and the whole premiss builds around strange and bizarre events, don't expect to get answers.It's beautifully filmed, great acting, decent cgi. Those are the good points.
The bad points for me is the absolute illogical reactions the mother takes, things that you can't really let go so the movie feels very bad the first half. No spoilers in this though.If you like this movie and want some tips for other similar movies,
