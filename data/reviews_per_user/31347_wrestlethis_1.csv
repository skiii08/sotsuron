The Benchwarmers," This is the best cast on screen since 80's SNL!
","Holy cow this movie was amazing! I seriously haven't laughed that hard at a Rob Schneider performance since he did the 'Making Copies' sketch on SNL. You have Jon Lovitz who is always funny as well as John Heder who is huge right now. David Spade literally has a performance that has audiences beg for more. Why not throw in a Nick Swardson and Adam Sandler input for a movie? Everyone who had they're hands in the creation of this project knows how to make winning movies! The bottom line is, this is going to be a hit. If you think for one moment you will not like this movie than you're a traitor towards America. Baseball is America's past-time. If you say you don't like this movie than you are no longer an American!",10,9,48,30 March 2006
