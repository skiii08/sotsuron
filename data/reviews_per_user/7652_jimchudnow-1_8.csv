Sucker Punch," A MISH-MOSH, By Gosh!
","When I saw the trailers for this film, it seemed very 'STRANGE' & likely to be very 'confusing' & 'silly'... After seeing the whole movie, I must say I was RIGHT in my instincts...... I will try to give you the 'plot'-- but, be warned, it will not make much 'sense'-- which ALSO is pretty 'accurate': ... Baby Doll (EMILY BROWNING) lives in a creepy house-- with an even creepier Stepfather (GERARD PLUNKETT). He's a predator, attacks her & her sister after their mother dies, &, when she 'resists' him, he puts her in a MENTAL asylum for women...... That place is run by an evil self-centered young shark named Blue Jones (OSCAR ISAAC), who wants to sink his 'teeth' (& other areas) into Emily (& possibly other inmates there)...... He brings Emily to the 'Theater' area (named because it IS a stage-filled theater), which is run by an Eastern European woman named Dr. Vera Gorski (CARLA GUGINO). She believes she can 'rehabilitate' the women (tho, to 'what' is debatable) by the use of 'DANCE' moves-- tho almost no one truly 'dances' there...... One of the primary members of the non-dancing 'company' is Sweet Pea (ABBIE CORNISH), who dotes on her younger sister named Rocket (JENA MALONE) there... They both try to help Emily avoid a LOBOTOMY planned for her by Oscar, & they do that in part by encouraging her to join their 'DANCING' group...... Lots of people (including Oscar) are 'mesmerized' by Emily's 'dancing'-- which involves merely TALKING about dancing & just 'standing' there as she enters what the film company conveniently calls an 'ALTERNATE REALITY', supposedly as a means of 'coping' with the tribulations of the place...... In that (ahem) 'reality', she starts 'transporting' to various WARTIME scenes, always 'led' by a 'Wise Man' (SCOTT GLENN)...... First, as shown by the double-and-triple winged fighter aeroplanes, she's in WORLD WAR I with Abbie, Jena, & other of the inmate girls such as Blondie (VANESSA HUDGENS) and Amber (JAMIE CHUNG)...... In appropriately 'washed-out' colors and black & white, the women are transformed into great FIGHTERS, trying to destroy the wicked steam-powered 'zombies' of the German KAISER... They attack his troops, aeroplanes and dirigibles, sometimes 'flying' thru the air as they 'MOW-DOWN' their adversaries...... Does this sound like a 'COMIC BOOK' type story? Well, it's SUPPOSED to!-- it's a 'graphic novel' type of movie, directed (& partly written) by ZACK SNYDER, the maker of 'DAWN OF THE DEAD' (from 2004), '300' (from 2006), 'WATCHMEN' (2009), and 'LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE' (2010)!...... In 'between' the various 'wars', the girls meet various other dastardly types, such as The Cook of the asylum (MALCOLM SCOTT), the Mayor (ALAN C. PETERSON), etc. There are planes representing WORLD WAR II, then some other war (possibly Vietnam, as characterized by the helicopters) & various 'fantastical' CREATURES the girl inmates have to challenge and conquer...... In the midst of all these clearly CONFOUNDING confrontations (including facing fire-breathing DRAGONS), Emily & the other girls have to go on a 'QUEST' to try to find & recover 5 special 'objects' which (per Scott) will supposedly help them ESCAPE the asylum...... At one point, we meet a kindly 'Doctor' (JON HAMM), who doesn't like the idea of lobotomizing Emily. WHY is he there in the story?-- Well, either because he's a 'BIG NAME' TV star, or they wanted to have one 'positive' male figure (or for 'BOTH' and possibly other insignificant reasons!)...... Is one of the girls a 'double-agent' secretly working on behalf of the ASYLUM masters, & if so, who IS it?... Will any of the girls be killed in the plans to try to escape?... Will any of the 'SINFUL' characters get their 'just desserts' (or at least 'entrees')?!...... At the end of my advance screening, one person in the audience loudly yelled a hearty 'BOO!' at what he'd just seen (which caused a bunch of laughs & some cries of 'agreement') with his opinion...... Is the film ridiculous?-- ABSOLUTELY-- but, it's clearly MEANT to be!... It's 'cartoonish', makes little sense, & (as I said at the beginning), it's a 'MISH-MOSH' of ideas that are seemingly meant to LOOK 'impressive' (& that's about 'all' it achieves)....... The film is undeniably 'CREATIVE', with some quite striking SPECIAL EFFECTS (cgi & otherwise), done by a number of different special effects groups... I'm trying to 'resist' saying you're a 'SUCKER' if you let the the theater 'PUNCH' your ticket to see this...... But, because I LIKE attempts at being imaginative, I am going to 'generously' rate the film at 6.0 out of 10 stars. I can't give it more because, while the acting is OK & it's 'creative' in parts, it's got some dreadful dialogue & writing, & it is NOT what I'd call 'inspired' in what to me is any particularly 'worthwhile' way...[... One thing as a serious aside: most people left the theater when the CREDITS were just starting to play. Sit THRU the credits-- because only there will you see real DANCING, & the 5 minutes or so of musical numbers are done in a finely STYLISH way that's really the BEST part of the film, in my opinion!...]",6,5,14,25 March 2011
"I Love You, Man"," 'I LOVE YOU, MAN'  And thank you for all the BIG LAUGHS you provided!
","(Based on an advance preview:) It was a real PLEASURE, after a slew of comparatively 'mild' comedies opening recently, to see this one which provided LOADS of really HEARTY LAUGHS. Peter (wonderfully played by PAUL RUDD) is a man who has always gotten along exceptionally well with women, but who'd found it hard to do the same with most GUYS. Since he's about to marry his girlfriend (effectively played by RASHIDA JONES), he finds he needs to cultivate some good MALE friends for his wedding party. His gay personal trainer brother (comfortably played by ANDY SAMBERG) tries to help him, but things keep going wrong. He then chances to meet a shockingly-blunt but very-attuned-to-others guy named Sydney (JASON SEGEL, finely controlled compared to his 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' character, & quite funny), who shares his love of 'Rush' and helps Peter open up more to himself & the world around him. It's pretty riotous as they get to bro-mantically know each other & share experiences including Syd's efforts to help Peter with his real estate problems. Lots of FUN for those appreciating clever R-rated adult-themed humor.",9,0,2,20 March 2009
Orphan," 'ORPHAN' -- You'd better Investigate BEFORE you Adopt! =
","This movie is being sold as sort of a 'HORROR' flick-- but it's really a 'psychological' THRILLER about an Orphan named Esther (ISABELLE FUHRMAN) who turns out to BE Horrible (tho she pretends to be the opposite). Kate (VERA FARMIGA) is the frequently-dysfunctional therapy-seeking mother of 2 kids (JIMMY BENNETT & ARYANA ENGINEER as a challenged daughter) who wants to adopt another child. John (PETER SARSGAARD) is the often-oblivious husband who tends to undercut her efforts with all the kids. CCH POUNDER plays the overly-trusting nun who runs an orphanage visited by the parents. Besides sexuality, there's a lot of VIOLENCE initiated by the efforts to adopt, & it's repeatedly bloody & disturbing (tho not at the level of the gory 'slasher' movies I so dislike). To my surprise, this film is actually somewhat CLEVERLY-constructed & tension-building as 'accidents' keep happening to people involved with the various family members. The tagline is 'There's something wrong with Esther.' Actually, there's LOTS wrong with her-- but, thanks to the acting & directing, there's a lot more 'right' with this MOVIE than I'd expected. It's only recommended for those who LIKE films of this general type, tho!",7,6,16,21 July 2009
The Last Song," Writing on the 'FULL-SHELL'
","Nicholas Sparks has written a number of popular books made into movies, including 'The Notebook'. This is his first book that he himself has ADAPTED for the screen, & it also is an attempt by Miley Cyrus to break away from her 'TV-show singer' image  Miley stars as a 17-year-old called Veronica 'Ronnie' Miller, & she is usually an 'ANGRY' character thru much of the movie. That's caused by the divorce of her parents Kim (Kelly Preston) & her composer – pianist father Steve (Greg Kinnear), the fact that her mom is soon to remarry, & especially because her dad didn't 'back' her when she was accused of SHOPLIFTING in New York  As the film starts, Miley & her 12-ish kid brother Jonah (Bobby Coleman) are being brought by Kelly to spend the summer at Greg's seashore home on Tybee Island, Georgia. Jonah is very attached to his Dad (& vice versa), whereas Miley acts very cold & 'distant'  Thruout the movie, Greg (who's trying to write a song) keeps trying to get CLOSER to Miley. He's very disappointed in the way she's such a good pianist that she's been accepted into the Julliard School in New York, but she nevertheless doesn't care to GO there (or have any further schooling)  As time goes on, Miley meets various of the 'locals' in town: a love-obsessed girl named Blaze (Carly Chaikin) who wrongly thinks Miley is trying to make a 'play' for her miserable punk boyfriend Marcus (Nick Lashaway); a cute blonde-haired guy named Will Blakelee (Liam Hemsworth) who loves to play beach volleyball with his friend Scott (Hallock Beals) who works with him at a car repair place, etc  Initially, irate vegetarian Miley is put-off at the way Liam tries to get to know her, & all she really seems to care about is trying to protect some endangered loggerhead sea-turtle eggs that she has found near her dad's home  When she finds out that Liam works part time in nature-protecting activities for the Georgia Aquarium, she realizes they have something in 'common' & starts to 'WARM-UP' to him -- or, you might say, breaks out of her OWN 'shell' a bit Little-by-little, he starts to become her 'first love', despite the jealous actions of his ex-girlfriend Ashley (Melissa Ordway) & his arrogant rich mom Susan (Kate Vernon)  Miley's kid brother Bobby happily bonds with Greg, learning from him how to work with stained glass to help repair a church Greg thinks he's caused to burn down But, as time goes on, a CRISIS arises in the household which deeply affects certain family members  Will a SECRET Liam is keeping affect his relationship with Miley? Will the family CRISIS impact Miley & her future plans? Will the turtles HATCH safely and return to the sea? Will Miley get CLOSER to Greg & return to caring about her piano-playing ability? Will the 'SONG' get properly finished?  Understand, this is NOT a 'musical', & Miley is NOT playing her long-running 'Hannah Montana' character. A guy I know felt Miley did a POOR acting job in this-- but, I felt, she played the character as WRITTEN-- an upset, irritated teenager unsure of her relationships & her future, who slowly starts to 'open-up' when some love enters her life --, & she did that decently Plus, Liam & Greg do good jobs, & Bobby is very good as the kid brother  A number of women in the audience reported that they were near TEARS at times in watching the movie, & thus quite 'affected' by it. And, even a pre-teen boy in the audience (who happens to play piano) found it interesting  I feel it's true that the film in many ways doesn't have a 'wide-ranging' story, & is sort of simplistic at times (& somewhat implausible in the way Miley is invited to jump in a main pool at Atlanta's Georgia Aquarium to swim along with Liam near the whale shark & other fishes)  But, the film was 'pleasant' & 'WORKS' for the main audience it's likely 'aimed' at, namely women (particularly young ones) & those who like love stories on various levels (in family situations and with a first love) So, I'm judging & rating it accordingly (tho there might be 'protesters' marching in front of my seaside cottage as I'm scribbling in the sand)",7,10,32,29 March 2010
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," 'Fasten' yourself to a fascinating ride =
","(Based on an advance preview:) I tend to be impressed by films that effectively achieve a wide epic-type story-telling 'scope', and this is a very telling commentary on relationships over long-ranging lives. It starts out with a surfacedly- difficult premise -- a guy Benjamin (BRAD PITT) who ages in reverse and meets love interest Daisy (CATE BLANCHETT). With wonderful makeup, cgi effects and acting, it all 'WORKS', enhanced by strong efforts by the supporting cast members: TARAJI P. HENSON as the housekeeper at a rooming house who adopts him as a baby, JARED HARRIS as Captain Mike, TILDA SWINTON as someone he gets attached to, JULIA ORMOND as Daisy's daughter Caroline, and numerous people living at the rooming house. It succeeds in director David Fincher's goal of showing 'mortality and life and the way we're touched and affected by' the people 'we meet along the way'. I found this to be an often sweet and charming film that meanders successfully through the 'complicated' lives and times of its many characters.",9,21,43,5 December 2008
Limitless," Should you SACK a SLACKER, or Factor a BACKER?!...
","This movie is based on the Alan Glynn novel 'THE DARK FIELDS'  Eddie Morra (BRADLEY COOPER) is a writer. Well, that's what he's 'told' people. He'd LIKE to be writing-- especially since he's been given an 'advance' to do so. But, he keeps having a writer's 'BLOCK', & sits around accomplishing NOTHING really  Yes, he's one of those famous people you read about (from those who do write) called a 'SLACKER'. His apartment and personal appearance also express how his mind is feeling, in that they too are sadly disorganized & unkempt. His girlfriend Lindy (ABBIE CORNISH) is 'fed-up' with it all, & CALLS OFF their relationship  By chance, Bradley meets Vernon (JOHNNY WHITWORTH), the brother of Melissa (ANNA FRIEL)-- an ex-wife he'd had. Johnny was looking strangely well-to-do, & Bradley thinks it's because of the old illegal 'black market' activities he'd engaged in. But Johnny said no, it was all thanks to 'NZT'-- a supposedly soon-to-be-'approved' PILL he'd gotten an 'advance' connection with. He glowingly describes how it can help 'focus' a person's MIND so a person could use ALL his brain-power instead of the usual 20%, & he gives Brad one of the pills (to try to show him his abilities could be 'LIMITLESS')  Brad doubts Johnny's claims, but thanks him for the pill Later, he decides to try NZT-- & finds it allows him to get OVER his Writer's Block. He's stunned at what he was able to accomplish, & visits Johnny to try to get MORE of the pills  Johnny's friendly-- but, when Brad returns after doing some errands on his behalf, he finds someone has MURDERED him Brad (using his extra brain power) is able to find Johnny's 'stash' of pills, & goes back HOME Soon, he gets some ideas for making money from INVESTMENTS, & starts doing very well at that  Hoping he can extend his 'streak' at success, he goes to a Russian mobster named Gennady (ANDREW HOWARD) to get a short-term, high-interest LOAN -- which needs to be paid back promptly or Brad will be deeply 'SORRY'!... Brad is able to learn things (languages & facts) at amazing speed with exceptional understanding, and quickly makes lots more money. In time, he gets to meet big-shot financeer Carl Van Loon (ROBERT De NIRO), feeling he could be his 'backer' & provide the 'key' to a quantum LEAP in Brad's being financially and socially successful and powerful  But, everything soon starts to expand and 'SPIN' out-of-control: Andrew tries to force Brad to provide HIM with more & more of the pills, & keeps his 'GOONS' close-by to provide the 'or-else!' factor to his demands Robert is very favorably IMPRESSED by Brad's abilities-- but is also very 'demanding' in what HE expects  In the midst of all of this, Brad starts having a bunch of adverse 'SIDE-EFFECTS' from his use of NZT, & finds he's in-effect put himself on a 'treadmill' that he can't really CONTROL very well He confides a bit in Abbie & others, but that doesn't seem to truly 'SOLVE' the problems  Will Brad be able to properly MANAGE his use of NZT, or find ways to 'improve' it to make it safer and / or more useful and 'available'?... Will Brad be able to control ANDREW and his thuggish requirements?... Will he find a way to keep Robert at 'arm's length' so he can move 'forward' & yet not be under his 'THUMB'?... I was really considerably IMPRESSED with what they were able to accomplish with this film: the acting seems 'simple', but all the major characters are able to surprise & PLEASE you with what they turn out  There are lots of TWISTS & TURNS in the story: some of them, I could see 'coming' (such as about a proposed merger regarding Robert's company); but others were quite UNexpected in a quite satisfying way. The very END was especially 'fulfilling' to me  Thus, since the 'deals with the DEVIL(S)' provides such an enjoyable psychological 'thriller', I'm rating it as 9.0 out of 10 stars",9,2,7,11 March 2011
Win Win," VICTORIES Don't always come EASILY
","Nowadays, even LAWYERS have been affected by the downturn in the economy. Mike Flaherty (PAUL GIAMATTI) is one of those. He lives in a small town, and this period has gotten increasingly tough for him. His office is in a bad state of disrepair. He very much doesn't want his WIFE Jackie (AMY RYAN) to know the extent of his problems and stresses (such as declining health)  About the only current work he has is representing a client named Leo Poplar (BURT YOUNG) who's starting to suffer from dementia.The subject comes up of who to arrange as the 'GUARDIAN' for Burt & his estate (since Paul's been unable to reach Burt's daughter from whom he's been estranged for 20 or so years). As being Burt's Guardian would provide a monthly income, Paul proposes HIMSELF for that position. But, Paul wants to keep the 'source' of the money SECRET from AMY.One day, when Paul visit's Burt's house, there's a boy sitting in front of it. When Paul asks the kid who he is & why he's there, he's told his name is Kyle Timmons (ALEX SHAFFER) & he's Burt's GRANDSON!Paul takes Alex to visit Burt, who says he doesn't HAVE any grandson. Alex reveals that he's 16 years old & the son of his daughter back in Ohio who Burt hasn't seen in decades & who's in a hospital, which is why he's come to stay with Burt. Burt is quite friendly to not-very-talkative Alex, & says he'd prefer being IN his own house where Alex came to stay, but he's not allowed to be there. Without revealing everything to wife Amy, Paul proposes that Alex stay with THEM for a week or so while he tries to reach Burt's daughter.Paul has trouble TRACKING DOWN Alex's mom Cindy (MELANIE LYNSKEY), & is distressed to learn she's in a DRUG-rehab program with an indefinite 'recovery' date.Amy's not 'thrilled' at the idea of caring for someone they barely know. But, since Alex has shown himself to be polite and thoughtful (including in the way he plays with their little girls), she ACCEPTS his continued presence there for the time being.In some ways, Alex might seem a bit 'strange'-- but he's mainly just a 'QUIET' teenager, who keeps things to 'himself' unless he gets in the 'mood' to talk about some certain subjects (such as his own past life). He's also clearly CONSIDERATE (such as regularly visiting Burt in the Home) & also helpful, wanting to assist Amy in getting groceries-- & even asks to get a favorite cereal that Burt particularly likes.At one point, Alex asks if he can 'watch' as Paul 'volunteers' as a coach of the town's high school WRESTLING team, the 'Pioneers'. The team has a long 'history'-- for consistently LOSING their matches, although Paul & his assistant coach Vigman (JEFFREY TAMBOR) do the best they can with the 12 or so kids on the team.To Alex's asking if he might participate in some of the work-outs, Paul feels that'd be OK-- especially since Alex says yes, he's DONE 'some' wrestling in the past. When he works out, Paul sees Alex is VERY GOOD at the sport.Paul's best friend, Terry Delfino (BOBBY CANNAVALE), needs something to keep him 'busy', since he's very upset over his recent divorce. When he watches Alex practice, he also is amazed at how talented he is-- & 'looks him up' on the INTERNET, learning that Alex had once been an award-winning athlete back in Ohio.Bobby becomes 'GUNG-HO' in having Alex join the TEAM (after Paul works to get him enrolled in the high school) Alex has an unusually good WORK-ethic, taking it upon himself to do things to help his Training.Rather than make fun of any of the other under-achieving team members, Alex quietly works to encourage & help THEM in the sport. He becomes a good friend to their least-talented team member, Stemler (DAVID W. THOMPSON) -- a tall, uncoordinated kid who he sincerely likes as a person, partly because of their mutual interest in playing VIDEO games Thanks to Alex's presence, all the team members start to IMPROVE in their wrestling, to the point that they get along GREAT with each other & start doing really WELL in their meets. Paul & Amy grow increasingly FOND of Alex, & enjoy having him around (even if he never does initiate much in the way of verbal communications most of the time). Alex & the wrestlers continue to gain an increasing amount of NOTORIETY in the town, especially as the team has a chance of going 'ALL THE WAY' championship-wise in the area. Into that unusually 'comfortable' mix, a walking 'WRENCH' arrives-- in the form of the unexpected appearance of Alex's mom MELANIE (whom Alex has long been on the 'OUTS' with). And, we soon learn that she's gotten in contact with a woman lawyer named Shelley (MARGO MARTINDALE).Will Melanie's arrival turn out to HELP Alex in his wrestling, or hurt him?... Is Melanie in town to try to 'GET' something from Burt or Paul?... Will Amy find out about Paul's 'SECRETS' from her?... How will things 'END-UP' for all the major characters?This is an UNUSUAL movie-- both in the way Paul has a basically 'CONTENTED' family life, & how you have a satisfying sports-related film WITHOUT the usual 'PAT' type endings to the various plot lines.The acting is both 'controlled' & CREDIBLE, by the old & 'new' actors, the story is a fine one (showing how people can move forward even without moral 'perfection' inherent), & it ended with my hoping there'd be a 'CONTINUATION' of the story. Thus, I'm rating this enjoyable entertainment at 8.5 out of 10 stars.",9,1,5,4 March 2011
The Soloist," 'THE SOLOIST' – Alone on MANY different levels =
","(Per an advance preview:) JAMIE FOXX does a fantastic job playing a homeless guy in Los Angeles who was once a gifted musician at Julliard who later developed various schizophrenic & emotional problems as he wanders the rough streets. This film tells the true story of how a local newspaper columnist (finely played by ROBERT DOWNEY JR.) chances to meet Foxx, writes about his story, and his many efforts to try to make life EASIER for him-- by encouraging him to return to playing the cello, to find a safer and better place to live and to interact with other homeless people. Because of the difficulties inherent in Foxx's psyche, his ramblings & recurrent departures from reality, Downey has a frequently tricky and demanding time in dealing with him and others in his life (including his ex-wife & co-worker CATHERINE KEENER). The film effectively portrays the young Foxx, his growth and his later descent into a life filled with problems. It's not always easy to deal with, but it's uplifting seeing the progress that the homeless and otherwise disadvantaged can make.",8,5,11,21 April 2009
