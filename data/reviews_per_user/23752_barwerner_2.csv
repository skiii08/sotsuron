Ford v Ferrari," watching the move was like watching pain dry, loudly
","I don't recommend it. The drama was all about unconvincing excuses for depicting violence. Dramatic scenes and loud sounds does not in itself constitute good cinema. I had the thought that watching the move was like watching paint dry, but loudly.Techincally it was well done but there is no real story there, just famous names (both the actors and the characters depicted).",3,8,28,23 November 2019
Cold War," Disturbing and beautiful at the same time
","A beautiful and a disturbing movie in many ways. The beauty of human love and art, and the ugliness of Communism are interspersed.The doomed love-affair has some of the aspects of La La Land, but instead of the nonsense of tinsel-town keeping the lovers apart, it is the damnation of Communism that dooms them. Damnation is an applicable term to use because a destroyed church plays an important counter-point to the Communist world.Zula, the female lead, is a femme fatale who leads Wiktor, the male lead, to destruction in several ways. Near the end of the movie Wiktor's hands are crushed by the Communists (remember, he's a pianist) and at the very end, Zula leads Wiktor into a double suicide (or is it?).The question in my mind is why is Zula such a destructive and self-destructive person? I think the answer is that she is the true product of the Communist system, a fatally disturbed system produces fatally disturbed people.",9,1,3,19 January 2019
