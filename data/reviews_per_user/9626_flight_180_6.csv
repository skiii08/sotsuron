Requiem for a Dream," Oh. My. God
","I have only just finished watching this film and I feel like I've been on drugs myself. Geez...That film is amazing. I don't really know what else to say. It's so intense it's like you're there, experiencing everything the characters experience...Bloody hell. Okay I'm gonna shut up, just wanted to let everyone know that if you haven't seen this already, you have to watch it!",10,0,0,17 May 2003
Unbreakable," What a Load of....
","I like movies. I like them a lot. And I can honestly say that every movie I had seen in the past few months I have enjoyed. Except this. What a load of complete and utter rubbish. It sucked. Okay, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, the beginning was good. I liked the first half an hour of it, I thought it had set up a lot of good ideas for an interesting plot, but then it just degenerated rapidly until it had become ridiculous. *spoiler alert* DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE It started to go off the plot totally when Bruce Willis's character (forgot his name) went off to that mans house, and suddenly people were tied up and then he hit the man and- well, what? I didn't have a clue what the hell that was all about. It was just ridiculous. And then when he fell in the pool, I thought that was going to be a really good too. But no. What the hell was the point in saying that his weakness was water? They could at least have done something with the bit in the pool, but he just got out of it again. The bit about his weakness was pointless really. And the ending, it was just so rushed. It was done too quickly and it didn't give you time to make sense of it. People say it is better than the Sixth Sense, but they must be living on a different planet or something because the sixth sense was a million times better than this drivel. Good acting, but an absolutely plotless and pointless movie.",3,0,1,10 August 2001
Final Destination 2," A Falling Brick???? A falling brick?! What were they thinking???
","As a great fan of the original Final Destination and having seen it over 50 times (literally) I had nothing but the highest expectations for the long awaited sequel as I sat in the cinema this afternoon waiting for it to start. For two years I had wondered in vain whether Carter had really died and whether the sign had really hit him. For two years I wondered the fate of Alex and wondered where he'd be in the sequel. Except he wasn't in the sequel. Because....and this is a kinda minor spoiler- oh dear, he got hit by a falling brick to the head when he was walking along one day, and what's even better- Clear has a polaroid of his dead body on the sidewalk to prove it. The sequel could have been so much better, but instead it simply followed an identical structure to the original. Final Destination was unique, it had something that no film had ever had before, but Final Destination 2 was simply a copy of this structure which was why it ended up so predictable. The film literally is exactly the same. We have the girl and her friends going on a trip...except this time it's in a car instead of on a plane...Oooooh, that makes all the difference doesn't it? Then we have the premonition which you are supposed to believe is actually happening until she wakes up and realises 'Uh Oh...It's gonna come true.' She then proceeds to go crazy and blocks the road to stop any other cars entering the freeway..Sound familiar? Next comes the part where it actually happens before their very eyes, and the next thing, they're all at the police station being interviewed...Anyone else getting that strange sense of deja vu? What happens after that basically comprises of a load of people getting killed in even more ludicrous ways. At least the original Final Destination's deaths were slightly credible and realistic. This sequel just completely goes over the top, with such deaths as a boy running retardedly into a flock of pigeons to scare them only to end up completely disintegrated by a falling glass plate....And how could I forget the barbed wire fence being catapulted through the air, chopping off some poor guys arms and tearing his body in half...I mean for Christ's sake, at least give the audience some credit, we aren't that stupid. Kimberley tries so hard to be the new 'Alex' but fails miserably. There can never be any replacement for Alex, Alex was just Alex and nobody can ever replace him. Another thing is that Final Destination was so refreshing as none of the characters had a clue what was going on, they were all genuinely confused and scared and that's what made it so edgy and tense. In the sequel, they're all just like, 'Yeah yeah, so we've all gotta look out for the signs and we know it all already.' The most annoying thing about this sequel was that the characters took themselves far too seriously and couldn't even see how ridiculous and laughable the script had become. By the time they were all in the car and started going, 'Oh my god...I just remembered, I nearly died once, I was on a bus and a girl got killed by it.' I practically had my head in my hands from the sheer cringe worthyness of it all. I'm not saying this sequel is a bad movie. I guess I just felt cheated and let down by the fact that I had such high hopes for it, only for it to turn out to be nothing like I'd expected. The characters are nowhere near as likeable as those in the first and to be honest I didn't even care when they died...I was just like 'whatever'. So go and see this movie if you want a good laugh or if you haven't seen the first one. I think people who hadn't seen the original would find this a lot more interesting as they haven't seen the format before. However if like me you are a huge fan of the original be prepared to feel just a tad disappointed. I wish Alex had been in the sequel! Oh Devon Sawa, how could you? He really was the one that held the entire film together, and without him the sequel just isn't the same. Okay, so we have Clear, but this time around she just thinks shes ace and it's all a little tiresome. Oh well....",Null,0,0,8 February 2003
Pi," What the...????
","23:55: Personal note, this movie is demented. All I can say is 'what??????'...I mean I like arty films, really I do. I absolutely adore Requiem for a Dream- Darren Aronofsky's second movie, love the damn thing. But 'Pi?'...Erm, no. Can't say it had quite the same effect. Maybe because maths was my most hated subject? Who knows. Or maybe it was because it was all in black and white? And not just black and white...the whole thing just seemed dark and weird and like you never quite actually got to see clearly. And when that guy started shaving off his hair and having seizures and all that malarkey I was just like 'right....' I know some people consider this to be a masterpiece or whatever, but I think they may be delusional...Or deranged, one of the two. You'd need to be one or both to enjoy this movie. Eurgh. What the hell was this??? It had no plot...I felt like I was looking through a tunnel and only seeing part of the picture. I hate it when movies do that! Grrrrrrrr!!!!! Conclusion: Requiem for a dream: ace, Pi: Nooooooo.",Null,1,2,14 July 2003
Final Destination," The Best Movie I've ever seen.
","I have already reviewed this film once. It was absolutely full of praise and I couldn't get enough of it. That was in April I think. Well, Final Destination to me is still the best film in the world, and in my opinion it always will be, it's just that I'm not obsessed with it anymore. I bought the video two days after renting it, then watched it every day for about two weeks. Now it's December, and almost a year since I fist saw it (I saw it on Jan 13th 2001)and I'm not really bothered about it now. Yeah, it's ace. But after watching it 42 times, yes, that's right, 42 times, I've kinda got bored. I've written masses of pages of stories about the characters which if you're interested you'll find at http://www.fanfiction.net. They're all supposedly humorous stories so maybe you'll get a cheap laugh out of Tod and Alex spraying Carter with a hose, I dunno. But I'll just say this- Final Destination rocks, and is BETTER than the Matrix.",10,0,2,4 December 2001
Final Destination," I'm about to prove that it was ONLY the plane that crashed and burned...
","Final Destination is just one of those movies that in my opinion stands out completely from any other. It's a horror film, yeah, point taken, but it's just so different from all the others like Scream, I know what you did last summer, Halloween etc.You don't actually 'see' 'death' and I think that makes it really special. It makes you think about things, such as fate, and actually freaks you out a lot, as the whole scenario seems quite logical, unlike most other horror movies. It is original, chilling, and extremely entertaining. It doesn't over do it with the special effects either, and this shows that James Wong and Glen Morgan actually put a lot of thought into how to make things look as realistic as possible.The acting in Final Destination is fantastic. The first time I saw this movie I was left thinking what a great actor Devon Sawa is. You could completely empathise with his character, Alex Browning. In fact, all the actors were brilliant. They could really convince you that what was happening to the characters was real, and that was really spooky. The movie has a great ensemble cast, some of which will be instantly recognised from other popular TV shows or films, such as Kerr Smith (Dawson's Creek) Brendan Fehr (Roswell) and Seann. W. Scott (American Pie, Road Trip, Dude Where's My Car)Final Destination is full of action, and the first fifteen minutes really do get you hooked. It's not like most other movies where it gradually builds up to the action, this movie just has short sharp adrenaline pumping blasts of it, and it's great. There are some excellent 'jump' scenes aswell, which immediately re-grab your attention so your mind never wanders.The movie doesn't have much of a soundtrack, but to be quite honest it doesn't really need it. The atmosphere is pulled off fantastically by the eerie musical score composed by Shirley Walker, and totally fits in with the scenes.Some people might say that Final Destination is just over-rated and ridiculous, but I disagree. It is because it goes just far enough to make you believe, and disbelieve it at the same time. The deaths could actually happen in the home or whatever, but for them to happen is a chance in a million. Yet, they could still happen.Okay, Final Destination isn't one of the most famous box-office smash hits in the world like the Matrix or Gladiator, but I don't really care. As far as I'm concerned this movie is just an unsung hero, and people who rate this movie as being 'awful' just don't know how to appreciate a masterpiece. After all, who needs Oscars when this film is as good as I think it is already?",10,0,2,21 May 2001
