Resident Evil: Afterlife," Nearly the Best in the Series!
","Before anyone judges me on this review, I have a very deep point to make about RE: Afterlife. It had silly stuff, it didn't make sense and yes there was an overdose of CGI, Even though those elements didn't work, it was still an excellent sequel. Probably the best sequel alongside the first entry from 2002.I have heard so much negativity be thrown at this film. And for what? Come on, there are far worse Horror films than this. Surprinsgly, to me, it was one of the best Sci-Fi/Action/Horrors I have ever seen in a long time. I loved Apocalypse and Extinction, but this one just pushed it a little bit more.The thing I want to defend the film on is the cramming in of characters from the game. Yes, maybe it is a little bit over the top, but it is not a game. It was freakin 2010. Horror films made for this generation are not going to become classics anytime soon! The RE (or Biohazard) games are what they are. The films, (especially this one, since we are up to entry 4 now) are what they are. Sure the adaptations are different but they are not lame. I think the films are actually a lot better than the games.I am so sick of hearing people say, this doesn't work and zombies can't swim or dig. Once again, get with the generation of this age! It is not 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968) or 'Dawn of the Dead' (1978), even though I love those films. This is Resident Evil! Not old time zombie films.By this stage, it was bound that the Resident Evil franchise would go over the top with everything and anything.There is something to me that makes this Resident Evil sequel more special than the previous 2. I thought after watching Exticntion (which I thought was fantastic) Afterlife was not gonna have a chance in hell of beating this one. Surprinslgy, it actually beats the two sequels! Afterlife is awesome. The violence and action is chaotic and full of more mayhem. I love many of the characters because of their different personalities, the environment and look of the film which is set in a modernized today environment which is ruined because of the Apocalypse w/ the jail setting was an excellent idea to set these characters in. It was more creepier because they could not escape, they were trapped in one place instead of moving around everywhere, like the other films. The area they're stuck in leaves them in total dread and peril. Not to mention the Axeman/Executioner was disturbing looking! They made him look good here. Even though he didn't get much screen time, I still like it. It's good how they brig big menaces back to the series (like Apocalypse had done before) was a cool twist to things! The only slight few problems I would say (mentioning above) is the film is unrealistic and there is too much use of CGI happening.Overall, Resident Evil Afterlife was the most kickass sequel, siding along with the first entry.It deserves 7.5/10",8,8,15,7 June 2012
Dawn of the Dead," Intesnesly Great
","The Dawn of the Dead remake would have to be one of my favorite remakes because it is very chaotic, I love the carnage and the film's premises lie on disturbance.At many moments I found the film very, very disturbing. Zack Synder had really put a lot of effort into the remake. his remake also starts off on some happy little slope and then when we see the girl who's a zombie, then we all know that it's gonna get better from there.I like how Zack keeps the film's plot on the exact same story line where there are many survivors trapped in a Mall and that there are Zombies trying to get in. It was great to see that the elements of this great adaptation can be compared to George A. Romero's classic so well.I also like how there were more survivors this time round and it was excellent to see that we could all see what each survivor was going through. Some where determined to get out of this mess, some where stubborn and one was just an idiot. But it was great to have a variety of smart and dumb-witted characters.There were also many sad moments in this film that really left me disturbed and I'm not going to spoil it.Overall it doesn't fall short off of Romero's Classic Dawn of the Dead, having a chaotic situation, fast zombies, different varieties of characteristics & tones of weapons. It is my second favorite Remake and anyone who hasn't seen it yet, see it... 8/10",8,13,20,14 December 2010
Beauty and the Beast," Enchanting with beautiful Music, and Develpoed with an Emotional Story of Love & Darkness, this Disney Classic stands out Perfectly
","This Disney classic is truly one of the most darkest but most loving films I have every seen. I don't want to say to much cause we all know that this film is very impressive no matter what level it's on.A young prince is rude to an old lady who's trying to get out of the cold. He rejects her again and she turns into a beautiful princess (Godest) and then she transforms him into a Beast and he must have love in his heart and he must learn to love another. The other person (who is the gorgeous Belle) must love the Beast. The Beast looses all faith and keeps himself in his black, darken castle for many years.Maurice then goes to the fair and gets lost in the woods and then Belle (who is the daughter of Maurice) goes out to look for him and ends up being a prisoner instead of her father. As the film progresses on, the Beast & Belle end up falling in love and we do have a magical ending.i can't on how much I love this film. I think there where two sequels and they both sucked a lot of ass. The 1991 classic has a deep, emotional, loving story, characters are great, the settings are awesome and the music score of coarse is done well with both the themes of passion and darkness.After the Lion King, this would be my second favorite.",9,2,3,27 December 2010
Resident Evil: Extinction," A Fresh Start for the Series in a Way
","I believe that RE3 really has many good aspects going for it. I mean this one took the cake, and it showed it's true colors. It developed on little plot lines that were confusing in the 2nd film, it gave us some excellent characters again and it look upon developing the location even more this time by making every extinct: using a deserted area, along with the infected now being zombies, re-animated.The plot is still the same really, the Alice characters is roaming around, gets into trouble, escapes and then finds a group of survivors taking camp in the middle of nowhere. She decides to team up with two characters seen in the previous installment, along with some new characters. I believe this sequel is a tad better than the 2nd film, because the atmosphere of the film I feel is more scarier and creepier.Instead of taking a more modern tone like RE2 did, RE3 goes for a very isolated, deserted, scary feel where the dead become more brutal, the characters must be more smarter and the addition of the crows which was a creepy touch. The music as always was also good and Dr. Isaacs as that creature was pretty insane.I think RE3 is definitely a worthy sequel, and works on many levels. I also found it a tad better than the 2nd film because it's plot lines were less confusing. But it's installment 3, and in RE, it's all about the action-packed violence which is all good fun.I would give this undeniably bloody sequel a 7.5/10",8,1,1,12 May 2012
The Thing," This glorious film makes Alien look terrible
","I didn't like Alien (1979) and I got put off by watching another alien, fantasy, sci-fi film again. But when my godfather burned John Carpentar's The Thing, it looked strange but exciting at the same time as it was a Carpentar film.The Thing is about a couple of people who are in snow cabins, studying things and the like. Then a dog runs into the campus and a crazy man with a rifle comes in trying to shoot the dog. He ends up dying and a couple of days later we see the dog evolve into a nasty looking Alien that can take anything it touches and it can imitate that thing. It ends up getting many of the men in the campus and many of the men act out evilly because of the Alien inside them.The Thing has many psychological elements that make this film really fun to watch. It was a little scary, especially when we see that Alien with the really skinny, long neck.This also one of the best remakes that should be owned and watched many times. Even if it's not as good as Halloween, it definitely deserves it's place in the Horror genre. 8/10",8,1,3,14 January 2011
The Hills Have Eyes," This Film will leave you Disturbed
","Aka remakes Wes Craven's classic the Hills Have Eyes. I thought this was going to be another gore fest which was going to suck though I was really wrong about that.I saw the Hills Have Eyes (1977) & (2006) both on the same day and I'd have to say the Original is better, though the Remake catches on very well because I find the Remake more of a disturbing film.This remake keeps with the same plot as there is an American family riding in the desert and their car breaks down and then after that, blood-thirsty Mutants come and stalk them and then end up killing most of them.This remake did an excellent job at leaving you scared shitless, I know I was after watching it. Especially the rape scene, my god that was disturbing. Usually remakes are never scary nor Disturbing but this one did a terrific job at it.Though like always this remake has a downfall for being bloody. I'm glad that they didn't make it gory cause that would've ruined the film and most remakes with gore usually don't turn out the best.I can't really complain about this remake because it was a very creepy, stalking one. The atmosphere was chilling, the villains where different which was quite a change and entire plot does have a more darker side.I suggest you watch this film because you'll like it. This film will honestly leave you Disturbed for days and that is a great thing. That is what Horror films are meant to do. I wish that they would make some more remakes like this one because this one was (once again) DISTURBING!",8,2,3,26 August 2010
American Psycho," Christian Bale is Out-F**king Standing!
","I watched American Psycho many months ago, and sometimes it feels that I only watched it just yesterday. Christian Bale performance in this killa film is excellent.The film plots on a man who drives into madness and then he starts killing people. This is not a slasher film though this film is pretty intense and this film is nearly like an insanity that you could ever imagine running wild.I love the deaths, the film is funny at times and I like the themes revolving around it. The film also has very likable moments e.g. when he uses the Axe, makes a porn film etc. When you watch this film you will have many favorite parts. I know I do :DAmerican Psycho is truly a horrific and funny taste of viv. I suggest you watch it. 9/10",9,0,0,13 August 2010
American History X," Best film with Edward Norton
","When I came across this film and its plot, I thought that I would like it but I never thought I'd be considering it to be one of the most well filmed most beautifully written story ever. As the back cover of the DVD mentions and in many cases it's right, American History X does know how to push every raw never to it's very core. I was surprised as that throughout watching this film, I was able to analyze everything I had saw.The film digs deep into the story about a man, his bro, his family and all other people who are racial and very brutal towards are cultures. The man does a runner, killing two and spent some hard time for three years owning up for it. After the grueling period, he is released but is told and maybe convinced that his brother is going down the same track he did. Aware of his brother's unawareness of the danger that is up ahead, this man tries to prevent it.Edward Norton does a very good job at playing his role of Derek Vineyard who was a very brutal, raw and sadistic being who naturally became an honest but still unstable character. His performance was very believable and Edward Furlong as the bro Danny was a good choice for a back up and he was an emotional being. The rest of the cast did very well and I enjoyed each and every one of their performances.I believe the story was quite an impacting one because throughout we're feeling what these characters are going through. It's almost one of the saddest films I've seen recently since 'Angela's Ashes'.The use of black and white cinematography to create the flash backs and the cinematography full of color for the current moments was done very smartly, watching it the first time it almost caught me off saying, 'what's going on here?'. Overall I loved that use of filming techniques, gave it something powerful to look forward to.I think this is one of the only late 90's films which is able to stand up and rank as one of the best of it's kind, in that particular year. 9.5/10",10,0,1,17 October 2011
Resident Evil," A Different Side of Horror - Futuristic Style!
","I watched this film a few weeks ago, and I must say, I was really impressed with how this film turned out. It is truly a different look on the horror genre, in a future like style, where characters, villains and the plot itself act very different. I think that RE is one of those good ol' modern horrors which should be given a chance and for good reason.The plot is not looked upon much, and it is very simple. A virus takes over the world, once a contamination is unleashed by a corrupt corporation. Survivorsw team up to survive. Sure simple enough, with not much ground covered, but what makes RE excellent is the action, the character development, the horrific kills, the technical/futuristic music and the theme of it all.I believe all of that stuff is done quite well and it so happens that it can become quite creepy with the dogs.Although RE isn't an award-winning film, it sure has some intense action and scary scenes to keep the viewer looking at the screen as well as pumping out the blood, gore and entertainment.My Verdict is that it is the best in the series (although I do like the rest so far). 8/10",8,1,1,12 May 2012
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," So Evil's deciding to mess with Hillbillies huh?
","This film blew me out of the wind. The story, the characters, the acting, the plot, the action, the violence. Oh my god did I just love this film! It's one of those modernized films which will one day become a new classic. It's also a good film example about how to blend in the horror with the comedy. I think that was constructed together well.The story sets on some hill billies getting their vacation house, moving in, having the time of their lives until one day they spot a camper who falls into the water. They save her and help her out while her friends think they're gonna try and kill them. It all gets messy with horror, blood, gore, drama, romance, comedy, chills and thrills that come around thick and fast.I really loved the way this film unraveled itself up. I mean I was just surprised by what I saw because by the year 2010 or maybe 2008, horror directors would have stopped being creative. But this film is in no rush to get things happening on foot.The acting is superb in this film. The hillbillies and campers were realistic and developed well. I felt sorry for the hillbillies as that they didn't even mean to harm the kids while I wanted the kids to die. And what ways these kids died! It was funny to watch because it was really bizarre in how someone dodged, someone got a blade in the face, someone got cut up. It was all in good fun.I also loved how they made it creepy, with the Tucker and Dale's environment and yard looking isolated, gritty and dirty. This made us (the viewers) believe that the hillbillies were something out of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' or 'Wrong Turn'. Instead they are really nice and they made me laugh quite a bit. The director also mixes the comedy and creepy aspects in well, giving us a full on look of the atmosphere.Definitely watch it, and if it's a good price, BUY IT!!!! That's what I'm thinking of doing. It's not really scary but more funny than scary and creepy. Most likely one of the best modern horror films I have seen in a long time. Even the best horror-comedy of 2010! It's 9 bloody kills out of 10 for me on this one. SEE IT.",9,2,2,14 December 2011
Gran Torino," An Impressive Film with a lot of effort
","I remember seeing this film being advertised. I remember seeing the trailer to this film and all. But it looked so weird and I was like, maybe I'll watch this another time. Man was I DEAD wrong! I should have watched this ages ago. This Clint Eastwood Classic starring himself as a troubled, grumpy ol' war veteran is one of the most remarkable stories that I have seen in a very, very, very a LOOOOONG time. I mean the last of it's kind I saw was the 1995 Tim Robbin's Film 'Dead Man Walking'. I say this because this film like 'Dead Man Walking', 'Shawshank Redemption', 'Mystic River' and even 'American History X' gave me a lot to think about by the time it was over.This film was a joy to watch because it combined little comedy and very serious stuff together.Clint Eastwood as the veteran Walt Kowalski does a 5/5 job for his efforts. He brings life to the character straight away and we have sympathy for this character as he makes us laugh, be sad and makes us more determined to watch the film. All of the other back up actors did a marvelous job. In the acting, story, cinematography and script, it never flawed and it was epic throughout.I found the story quite intriguing and many of the moments were funny. I felt the comedy scenes with Eastwood saying something hilarious lightened the film up because if there was no comedic lines, the film might have just been deadly serious!? But any how the comedic bits of dialogue pumped the film up to it's full potential.Lastly i want to say that the ending of the film as well as the whole film itself gave me a lot to think about as it had many twists and introduced many themes to me. The themes were very important as Eastwood did not miss the mark in what he was trying to show his audience. His work was quite flawless and everything was very easy to catch because of how well made the film was.It was also good because even if there was violence, it wasn't a graphic amount because the little use of violence to me gave a little more development to all the characters because of how the violence was portrayed. It was quite real.Loved it anyway, 9.3/10",9,1,3,29 September 2011
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," A Worthy Sequel, which flows like the Original
","I was a little skeptical about this sequel since I liked the original, but after 5 minutes, I knew that this would be a worthy sequel. I don't think it is as good as part 3 or the Original itself, but I do believe that this film is top notch, going for a different style.The plot is basically the same where the same character, Alice teams up with some survivors and fights the same corrupt bimbos who let out the virus in the first place. Although the plot is still not fully developed, I think that the themes, kills and action have changed. I thought the one eyed looking creature was also awesome as well. These elements to me is what made this sequel still stand the test of time.The action scenes and kills are much more better, the themes of setting the story into the open, public cities was an excellent choice because it gave the film a different feel where anyone (infected or not) could be killed or under threat at any time, and even the elements of the nasty corporation being fleshed out more gave us these gritty feelings of really hating those characters.Overall, even if the plot of RE2 is not well-developed on any level, the film itself is still entertaining.7/10",7,2,3,12 May 2012
Evil Dead," A Gruesome Entice into Gore, Guts and Purifying Carnage
","I'd firstly like to state that this remake was neither a well-achieved turnout like other past remakes such as 'The Thing' and 'Dawn of the Dead', but it wasn't a muddled mess like past re-trends which consist of 'Black Christmas' or 'Prom Night'. For me, this remake was a brutal impact which lays its freshly coated blood in the middle of decent remakes. I don't think this one was better than the original by any means, and it ends up missing some of the point. I will talk about the positives and negatives, which I will contrast together: Positives: Overall, I'd say that the film was an enjoyable ride through many of the modern remakes we've already received constantly within a decade. I'd start with the soundtrack score because I found that it was one of the strongest highlights for this film. At times, it was very dark and soothed in with quiet, and very harsh whispers of suspense or booming sounds, and sometimes when emotional scenes were scattered about, it became symbolic and quite sympathetic which I found to be elemental and strange, but yet so intriguing as to why a remake soundtrack score would have both dark but emotional tones.I found the acting to being decent for the most part. The new cast of characters that they gave us were cool and they really rocked me back and fourth with their decision making (most of the time being quite stupid, oh well that's modernized horror for ya these days). The aspects I really loved about the remake were the practical effects and many of the death scenes we were given. I loved how these original creators adapted the stories' kill sequences, but making them improve so much in all areas. Lastly, I found there to be a few disturbing scenes where we got to know the new cast of characters on a different level to the original film which I thought was a good twist on where the story was going, as well as the parts from the start. The cinematography, whether we were in the cellar or outside in the raining forests also looked dreadfully nice which gave the film some tension.Some Negatives: Even though I thought this horror remake was sweet on how it took on the story, I still found some minor elements which bothered me, making me sometimes think about the original. This is not to say that the filmmakers didn't attempt a good job here, it's just that in these areas I'm about to focus on, I just didn't think they were strong enough or these aspects were placed here for utterly weird reasons. (WARNING SPOILERS FROM HERE ON!) Firstly, I think Mia's brother David burying her in the pit and then she comes back alive and she's newly fresh and all human again was just stupid. They should have found another way to weave those elements through, but I think that the filmmakers' didn't know how to clear this up. Even though the effects are sick for the most part, I'd say that there was some creativity lacking when it came to making Mia and some of the gang looking evil, possessed and demonized. All they had was just yellow eyes, deeply mixed voices and screeches and slow walk/crawling. They could've made them all look a little different. I also wish they had made the possessed victims fade and die in a more suspenseful and least predictable way like the original.Lastly, the one problem I had with this remake which I have with most horror remakes is that the film just wasn't scary enough for me. I laughed at some of the dialogue and I did believe that the film's atmosphere was dreadful, despicable and brutal for the majority of the time. However, I just wasn't afraid most of the time when watching it. It's just something that horror re-imaginings have struggled with. I knew it wasn't something completely knew, but by the look of the trailer, I looked frightening and disastrous.Overall, I do believe that Evil Dead (2013) is a worthy look at. Despite some mix up's and it's thing as a remake for not being as scary, I still think that the film should not be missed in the cinemas and that it was scary enough for even the least avid fan who wouldn't normally go to watch a horror film. I enjoyed it for what it was. 8/10",8,1,12,16 May 2013
Pulp Fiction," I should have watched this ages ago....
","I watched this damn straight at 12 in the morning this morning and I have to say I really enjoyed it. Bringing some of the greatest actors together: Urma Thurman, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken & Ving Rhames. Having solid actors really pushes the films to it's greatest limits.For some minor things, including the retarded rape scene with the cop and I wish Urma & Smauel L. Jackson should be in the film a bit more. i'll go through all the positive things about the film.Dialogue, 10/10: The dialogue was hilarious and at times very powerful and the swearing was over the top which I loved.Storyline, 9/10: The plot was very stylish and very easy to catch all the time and I like the flash moment back at the start. SO I think that deserves tremendous credit.Acting, 10/10: Do i need to say anymore, it was freakin fantastic.Scenes, 10/10: Everything about this film is really great and all the scenes (except for the rape scene) excellent and well executed. Most of the time I found the scenes really funny and for good reason, for e.g. I found the $5 milk shake or the story of a watch, lol. Even the action is compelling.Everything is well stable in this film and I highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't watched this yet. I'm so glad I watched this film NOW!!!!.I give it an easy 10/10",10,2,5,7 January 2011
Detroit Rock City," Best Comedy I have seen in a long time!
","I saw this film last night and I have to say, it is the best comedy I have seen since The Dictator.I love how everything is so simply put together. The story, characters, music score, scenes, actors and humor. It is all put together so well. Edward Furlong and all of the other actors were excellent in their roles.I laughed most of the time when the boys caused accidental trouble on the road or at the concert.There's really not much to say about this film because I love it so much. What I can say is that if you love the actors who portray the four boys, KISS, the plot where they are determined to get into a concert and never give up, and stereotypical kids getting high and drunk, having sex and loving to rock hard to KISS music, this film is definitely for you. I know it was for me! MEGA 10/10 film right here!",10,2,2,28 June 2012
Psycho," A Classic that should never have been touched
","Well first of all, I liked to say that the Psycho remake was a lovely piece of garbage and that Alfred Hitchcock's original should have never been touched.When Alfred Hitchcock made this film just over 30 years ago, it was a huge hit with anyone. Not my most favorite horror film ever though this was a classic masterpiece that should not have been touched afterwards.The music is greatly chilling, the surroundings that are among us in this film are just sensational and then the ending of seeing Norman Bate's dead mother really left me in suspense. There where no negatives about this film. I'm just giving everyone advice about the remake. Watch it once, and then never ever watch it again because it is full of crap. The remake has no original ideas and it just copies straight out of the Original, though with no suspense.I think this is a great horror movie and also it's a lovely display and probably Hitchcock's best film made. This film is also a good one to watch over and over again because when Alfred Hitchcock created this film, it started the Slasher Genere off really well. To me the Original Psycho later on created other great slasher flicks like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' & 'Halloween'.8/10",8,0,0,30 July 2010
Rosemary's Baby," Classic Gem ;)
","'Rosemary's Baby' is a classic example on how to make a horror film realistic and super natural, all at the same time. It's also been a really long time since I've seen an excellent classic, and 'Rosemary's Baby' did it for me. I started watching it at 12 in the morning and I was in shock, all the way till the end, wondering and thinking about what I just saw.Being brief, the film is about a woman and her husband who move to an apartment where the man becomes an actor but struggles with it, and the woman soon becomes pregnant. The apartment is also filled with crazy people and Rosemary's nightmare becomes a deranged reality. Even the husband starts going cuckoo.I really enjoyed this a lot. It is a classic and I don't think it needs to be remade. I love how we go through the perspective of Rosemary in her dreams and her wildest, darkest fantasies as she can not tell what's going on or what is happening around her. I also like the sense of dread throughout as that the neighbors become much more evil and more psychotic as we look at them more. Even the husband, Guy who suddenly goes crazy, day after day reminded me of 'The Shining' when Jack Nicolson's character went ballistic. I also like the unreal aspects like when she got pregnant, witches and demons.This is a masterpiece and possibly up there with some of my other favorite horror films. It's creepy, eerie, dramatic, horrifying and sometimes dark in every way.I also thought that the actors were excellent in their roles. Each actor was very believable. Mia Farrow as Rosemary is superb in every way possible. She makes us feel sympathy and sorrow for her. It's like we are really with her, trying to fight off all of this nasty evil which is attacking her.Another thing to give thumbs up to is the amount of violence referenced or shown throughout. There is one death, but it is never shown, nor are there are anymore deaths occurring throughout. No BLOOD or GORE is reveled which is FINALLY good because it leaves us to the mystery of how and why these strange things are happening.Even my friend told me about this film last year and I rejected the film (silly me). After people kept telling me about how classic it was, I am glad that I gave it a try. I do wish I could have believed him ages ago though.I've heard Platnuim Dunes is gonna remake this and say 'they're gonna be extra careful since it's a classic'. We'll just have to wait and see. I mean I don't mind some of PD's films but 'Rosemary's Baby' doesn't need to be touched.I'm gonna top this review down, giving Rosemary's Baby a 9.5/10",10,0,2,25 November 2011
Love Actually," Definitely Good Film for the Christmas Season
","There have been mixed reviews about Love Actually and I have to say that it's not the case that it shouldn't be mixed. This film doesn't flaw nor does it bail on anything it makes itself out to be. The actors all are really believable in their roles, the story involving Christmas was a really good idea. Blending in romance and having the use of comedic and emotional scenes to top it off were all a blast in this film. The cast are excellent, again.I do remember watching this as a kid but I only remembered a few small parts of it. Because the film was set on Christmas, setting it off, I decided to try it out again, now being older also, wanting to watch it near Christmas time. It also used to premiere on channel 10 a bit.The film sets during the Christmas season where there are mix up's of all these couples trying to get together and enjoy this joyful time of the year for what it is. The film stars some of these actors: Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Bill Nighy, Emma Thompson and Keira Knightley. There are many more but the list would go on if I mentioned all. What I will say is that 'Mr. Bean', Elishia Cuthbert and Billy Bob Thornton make small cameo appearances.I love nearly every character. They just pull of their roles really well and the casting of them was an excellent mix. I mean who could have thought that Liam Neeson would mix with Hugh Grant? I didn't know that all these actors coming together would make this film so special.I also love many of the scenes. Either emotional or comedic but either way, I found it to be enjoyable, EITHER WAY.Anyways, this is a film which deserves to be highly rated and those who don't like it too much must have cheesy films glued to their brain. This is a comedic masterpiece. Everything is put together so well, and when I was getting into it, like 'About a boy' when the title credits ended, I was already into it, loving the characters, loving the scenes and praising the story for what it was.If you watch this film, you must watch it near or during the Christmas break. That's what I did and I'm so glad I did. This film goes for just over two hours and amazing thing is that if you're hooked to this, it won't feel like two hours.This film is an easy 9.5/10",10,0,3,16 December 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Classic!
","This film is a classic and there is nothing negative about the film at all. It'a shocking, it's funny and IT's POWERFUL like everybody says it is.When I saw this film, at times I was gripping my chair as if something amazing was going to happen and then at other memorable moments I just laughed out loud.The story is inspired by the novel which was written up in the 60's (I think).Besides a true, strong plot, the film has an excellent cast. Jack Nicolson (Batman, The Shining, The Departed), Bard Dourif (Child's Play), Danny Devito (Matilda, Twins), Michael Berryman (Hills Have Eyes) and many more excellent, memorable actors.i have watched this film three times this year and I have to say it never gets boring and it never gets old.A True Masterpiecie of a Classic in my eyes. 10/10",10,0,2,28 October 2010
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Lives up to the Original Well, Accept a Few Problems
","Bram Stoker's Dracula from 1992, a remake of the original from 1931 wasn't a bad remake and ended up been quite faithful to what I liked about the original. Before I get on with the review I will say this: I have never been a massive fan of any Dracula films but I do like the original and this film for what they were. I also think that even if this remake was a nice blend and touch to the original, it was still not what I had expected. The other thing I'll say is that I didn't have many problems, and I did like this version from 1992.Dracula 1992 basically follows along the same lines as the original plot. A man is near getting married but he is called on to go to Transivania and he meets an unknown fiend named Coutn Dracula who loves blood. When Dracula gets to this man, he pursues in going to London and wishing his soon be wife away with him. A lot of trouble brews throughout England as people get hurt, Dracula gets a new look and a vampire killer/slayer named Van Helsing is on the catch to get him.The story is all round the same but there are two major differences that I found with this film: The overall atmosphere and feel of this film was really different. They took it to a whole new level as they got well known actors (being Gary Oldman playing Dracula and Anythony Hopkins as the Vampire Slayer), the music was full of dread, costumes and make up was also quite up to date style and the film followed the lines of Gothic and old times (obviously as this film is set in the 18th century). The remake (like the Halloween Remake) was much more longer than the original film itself giving us more detail, back story, and a lot of story.Gary Oldman was an excellent choice as Dracula. He made this role really creepy, dreadful, loving, romantic-like, soothing but also Gothic. I also loved how they kept the contents of how the vampire(s) must be killed and I liked in general what they did with Dracula's character here. They gave him a lot to do in this film e.g. (his over shadow moving in a direction that he wasn't, the way he can change from a cold blooded creature into a handsome young devil. Anthony Hopkins also did a top notch job on his role and he really bumped the film to it's peak. The other actors were good as well.The film does suffer with a few problems. They give us a lot of scenes of things happening to people and then the scenes has a black out and we end up seeing that the person is alive or un hurt. I don't know what the director was trying to achieve with some of those weird scenes that I did not understand. It was a little hard to understand what he was trying to get at. But most of the time I got what he was trying to do. It was just the little scenes that I think could have been better.Overall this remake is quite a faithful remake to the original. If you have seen the original 1931 film but not this. Watch this with an open mind as it is a really good remake. Not the best and it wouldn't rank up with other modern horror remakes such as Dawn of the Dead but it's still good. I just found that it was a totally different film, but worked on it's own well.Not as good as the 1931 version but I still like it and give it the same score as the 1931 film. 7.5/10",7,3,3,12 January 2012
Halloween," John Carpentar's Masterpiece of pure Fear
","When I saw Halloween, it left me in dreaded suspense and it also left me speechless on what to think of the film after seeing it.Seeing the film a couple of times has made it one of my favorite Horror films of today.The Plot is set on a young, six year old boy named Michael Myers who kills his sister Judith on Halloween night back in 1963. He is then committed to a Menatl Asylum and then 15 years later, he escapes his prison and plots on how he will kill his younger sister Laurie Strode who has been adopted by a new family for the past years. Still dangerous and psychotic at the age of 21, Michael Myers returns to Haddonfiled Illinois to avenge his destiny.At first seeing this film, it really shocked me and I actually didn't want to see the film again, though I gave it another chance and looked at it again more carefully and decided that it was a really excellent Horror film. Even if it came out back in 1978, it still has a huge impact as the film can still do it's job really well in the pointers of fear and creepiness.I also love this film because it cuts off of blood. Now I'm not saying blood isn't good, but John Carpentar had that really good effect on Halloween not to show that much blood.All in all, Halloween is a must-see Horror flick that should be watched over and over again. 10/10",10,0,3,3 August 2010
The Silence of the Lambs," I Ate his Liver with Some Fava Beans & A Nice Chianti
","Truly a masterpiece of a Horror/Thriller. Anthony Hopkins as the cunning, smart, torturing Hannibal Lector and Jodie Foster as the quick, spirited detective make a good batch up in this fine film. Ted Levine also does a gory job at the insane Buffalo Bill.Alongside with other great Horror Films such as 'Child's Play', 'Halloween' & 'Cape Fear' Remake, this has got to be one of the most creepiest, most intellect films i have ever seen in years.Anthony Hopkins especially can protract his character well onto the screen as he is only in the film for 15-20 minutes.Silence of The Lambs is an unforgettable, chilling, memorable and awesome film that I put on my top 10 List of Films. This film would instantly get a 10/10 for it excellent plot, lovable characters, creepy quotes and memorable scenes.",10,1,1,30 October 2010
The Sixth Sense," A very Underrated Thriller that plays with the Mind
","I saw the Sixth Sense two months ago, thinking it was going to be a boredom of a film from start to end but boy was i wrong here. The film was nothing that I had expected. Bruce Willis & the kid (Don't know his name) who played Cole did a sensational job at their roles besides everyone else.Besides there being an excellent plot and suspenseful effects in Cole's Sixth Sense Vision, everything was good. I could say there was nothing wrong this film.I couldn't get the ending at all but when somebody told me what really happened, i was stoked as. But i ain't giving anything away...All in all, hands down, The Sixth Sense plays with the mind and as we watch the film as the minutes tick away, we start to think and think about what's happening here... I think this is highly recommended to those who don't only love Suspesnful Horrors, but to those who will go the distance to be scared in anyway possible. 9.5/10",10,0,0,10 January 2011
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Still a Great Film and Still Wes Craven's Best Film
","When Nancy and her friends have terrible nightmares about a Burned, scarred man in a tattered, red & black shirt with a Hat and Finger Knives, hell starts breaking loose on who's going to believe them (Well more like Nancy). If Freddy Krueger kills you, there is no coming back. You die for real, it's reality.I really love how Wes Craven was able to keep the action so packed into one with this film. Besides other greats like Scream & The Hills Have Eyes, they don't come close to the capacity of scares that A Nightmare on Elm Street has. I think Wes did an excellent job on this film. I just loved the entire concept of the film.I think the dreams idea was very good. There are many things that I found well done with this film - The acting was beautiful as most of the characters where putting out there emotion whether they didn't believe in Krueger or not. The Design on the Boiler room was great, I mean I love how maze like it looked, how you had stairs and then if someone walked and Krueger jumps out from behind. I mean the Boiler room scenes where great. And as usual the music was weirdly awesome.I don't mind the new Remake (Which In fact I found my 2nd fav Remake) though it will never live up to the Original. 9/10",9,0,0,3 August 2010
Warm Bodies," A Fantastically, Well-made Zombie Dramedy Flick which Represents New Elements
","Stating from the above summary title, that pretty much sums up what I thought of Warm Bodies. It wasn't my initial thought but when I went in and then walked out of it, I found that my perspective was of something I have just mentioned in the summary. Warm Bodies which is a modern take on of the Zombie sub-genre of Horror manages to pack quite a punch with its great acting and characters alongside it's excellent story and themes whilst showing us how good some Horror films can still be in this age today.One aspect of the film that I thought stood out was the 'About a Boy' and 'Skins' actor, Nicholas Holt. He was perfect for the role and for very good reason. *SPOLIER ALERTS* (If you haven't seen the film, please don't read on). He gives the character life in all aspects of his changing form into becoming human. On the other side of the spectrum, the reason that he gives this character a true nature and great entity of life is because of how he portrays him. He portrays him as a sympathetic character who tries to live with what he's got. I really enjoyed his performance because he put much effort into it so he could make it look as realistic, sympathetic and as creepy as possible. The other actors and actresses did a stunning job as well, but I still think Holt takes the medal here.One fact to touch upon is the CGI with those skeleton like beings. I wished that they had maybe used material or non computerized technology. That was a point or element which could have been more scary, however they decided to skip it. It wasn't a major issue but it just would have been good to not use CGI there.I thought the combined sequences of action, drama, horror and comedy alongside the vividly detailed, and well paced plot helped the film greatly to stay in touch with me as a viewer so I could care about what was happening with our main protagonists and what perils and dangerous situations they got themselves into.The element I found the most interesting and fascinating however in this modern zombie flick was how they treated the sub-genre. In many zombie films of the past which consist of Shaun of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Dead Snow, the zombie genre just continued to improve entities from before and become scary. At this moment, I'd say that Warm Bodies takes that place at enclosing and expressing the full entity of the sub genre. In the film, the zombies start to slowly turn human when they either eat human brains or have personal connections with the living. Later on throughout the film, Nicholas Holt's character 'R', starts to fall asleep, have dreams and then finally bleeds. It really showed what the director was doing and where he wanted to take the direction of the zombie concepts and film in general. I believe that the aspects of a zombie slowly becoming human is a great one for the sub genre because it kicks new ideas to a whole new level now.Overall, I believe Warm Bodies is a film that shouldn't be missed in the cinemas. It's fun, it's bloody, it's beautiful, it's lovable, it's legendary in it's roots of the zombie genre and it's just damn creative. I highly recommend it. 9/10",9,2,5,25 April 2013
The Fighter," Now I know why it got Awards
","The Fighter is one of those films that you can look at say, they just don't make films like this anymore. I've seen many true stories of films back from the 70's and 80's and even 90's and I had a few little doubts since this film came out in 2010. Either way I knew it was going to be good because Mark Waulberg and Christian Bale were the leads but I had no idea that the whole film all together.The basic plot is set on a true story where there is a guy called Micky who is fighting to become world champion and he has his half brother Dicky and his whole family by his side to support him. When things start getting in a muddle and he gets a girl friend, all hell brakes loose and it goes into a rioting situation. Micky must get his brother back on the right track and get back on his feet to become world champ.I thought this story was quite powerful throughout and I think it did do many films of the year 2010 a lot of justice. It had meaning and it explains it well when they're at home, on the street or even in the ring.Mark Waulberg is outstanding as the tough, but nice boxer Micky who wants to achieve a lot in his life at becoming the world champ. Christian Bale brings life to the character of the hip-hop Dicky who always wants to be at his brother's side. I've never seen Christian Bale in a role like this before since 'American Psycho' and 'The Dark Knight' so it was a tremendous cross over to see him play a character like Dicky. The rest of the cast definitely backed them up making the entire cast as solid as hitting bricks. I've also never seen Amy Adams before and she was like a light bringing all of her energy to her roll. I was impressed I also loved the change in cinematography with when they're talking or interacting, it's a modernized look to the film while as when the fights happen in the ring, it looks so real and documentized. I loved that change because it changed the overall tone and atmosphere to the story and to the characters themselves about how they would act and think.Overall, it's a powerful film with an excellent true story, well all around casted actors and it has many messages to send out to the viewer.9/10",9,1,2,12 January 2012
