The Blair Witch Project," It was no 'Halloween'
","Well, I went into this movie scared to death.  I mean every review I read was like 'YOU WILL HAVE NIGHTMARES FOR MONTHS'... ' THE SCARIEST, MOST DISTURBING MOVIE OF ALL TIME'.  I guess I am desensitized or something because this movie did not creep me out as much as planned. Now don't get me wrong, it was a good movie, but I wish they had done a lot more.  I think the best thing about this whole movie was the charachter development.  You really care about what happens to them. As you watch Heather,Josh and Mike go from vibraint,energetic teens to starved,lonley,terrfied and curious victims, you feel for them and their families. As a true horror movie buff, I totally appreciate and respect this movie.  It seemed like everyone came out of the theather with different reviews.  One guy a few rows back threw up ... I am not sure if it was from the movie or the stale popcorn.  Then we heard a few 'That was so stupid', a couple 'That was okay' and yes we saw one person actually shaking and had to sit down while walking out.  I guess the scariest thing about it is what if it was real?",Null,1,1,31 July 1999
American Pie," Great Teen Movie
",I really thought this movie was excellent. Now all the outraged parents that can hardly believe I am saying this please hear me out.  If you want us teens to just sit around and pretend we don't know anything and all the world is just 'ducky' fine they we would be lying to you.  American Pie is a relality comedy which is very rare. It was so hysterical because it was SO true.  I had tears rolling down my face from laughing so hard. I would highly recommend it to everyone who wants a good laugh and to anyone who is not embarrassed easily. Just a note: Don't see it with the rents!!!! :),10,0,0,11 July 1999
