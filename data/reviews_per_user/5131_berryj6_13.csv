United 93," Hyper-realism and Paul Grenngrasses 'shakey camera' adds up to make one of the most powerful stories in recent years.
","The strange thing about United 93 (the name of the plane that never reached its destination) is that we know the cabin crew and their terrified passengers are tragically going to die. No matter how hard they try on-screen, we know they are doomed. This forces a strange mix of realism and hope upon the audience, and though they will exit depressed, the film has done 9/11 justice. During the entire film as it climaxes, switching between the sweating generals in the crowded, stuffy air traffic control bases and between the horrified yet defiant passengers on the plane. And the cinematography, plot, dialogue and directing all enforces this generally well, making the story of the people killed in 9/11 worthwhile and suitably strong.The shaky camera in the film is used to full. It's not sickening, buts it is c0nsistent and creates a strong, extremely realistic sense. Even the lighting is right in the film, as the colour tones and natural sense only reinforce the super-realism that drives this tragic tale. The acting is not Oscar-winning, but it is deadly serious and super-consistent. Paul Greengrass puts the icing on this creditable cake with a strong-willed and unrelentless story-telling.Though it could pack a harder punch, with a look into the evil behind the plane and the after-math",8,8,11,23 September 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A demonstration of the decline in western civilisation and culture, and the greed and excess we throw so freely around
","The third instalment of the Pirates saga has racked up costs of $300 million. That's a lot of money â€“ a lot of money down the drain, or should I say, the huge CGI whirlpool featured in Pirates 3 which serves virtually no purpose, apart from to amuse. But by now, we are not amused.I chose the word saga at the opening of this review for a reason. Because, collectively, the life-threateningly dull adventures of Gore Verbinski's characters has wasted 9 hours of my life. 9 hours I could of spent of doing anything else, watching repeats of 1980's sitcoms on unknown satellite channels, watching cricket, watching paint dry. Anything but surviving the trilogy which feels like a lifetime. You could take your newborn baby in to a screening of At World's End, and by time you leave, your baby will be a young boy. You will have skipped the nappy changing, the crying, the staying up all night. So, there is a silver lining to the very, dark looming cloud which is the son of cinema's Satan - Pirates 3.By now, we can care little for the unforgivable mess which is the plot. Ships turning upside down, pirate leagues, rocks turning into crabs, an odd, mumbling witch who talks some of the biggest fantasy drivel ever committed to film. We've had enough, and the illusion which was the charm of the first pirate's film has worn off. Jack Sparrow is just a slow, bumbling character with annoyingly awkward dialogue and Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly are so wooden they could be harvested and solve the world's problem of deforestation. The tone of the film is evidently undecided; we can go from a hanging scene involving children to a drunken Jonny Depp in a slapstick comedy scene. There's even an attempt at romance at the end of the film, but the scene is so graceless and discomforting it's like watching rhino's mating on the Discovery channel. Ugh, just ugh. That $300 million could have gone anywhere, it could fund 40 Godfather's, save African lives, anything but this.",2,4,5,14 September 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," An imaginative, 'hollywood-ised' Pans Labrinth
","Hellboy 2: The Golden Army, is a strange, beautiful beast of a story. Strange in the sense its comedy is blended strongly with captivating action sequences. Beatuful in its details and mysteriously engaging quirks, filled in with a mix of Hollywood action and fantasy.Centered around the evolution of Hellboy (Ron Pearlmen) and the government agency he works reluctantly for, the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence, Hellboy 2 is a beefed up version of Hell Boy 1, with the Russians and Nazis's from the first being mercifully replaced with a stunning array of unimaginable creatures from a world within ours. And so the man in red is set with the task of destroying what is described as by the more charismatic character Abe Sapien, as the Golden Army, an unstoppable force. Surpisigly however, the golden army does not appear until the final fifth of the film, the rest is good, solid filler, including some pretty great action sequences, including a fine blend of monsters expertly wielded and created by Guillermo del Toro (director). All manner of creatures in Hellboy 2 are so detailed and visually stimulating, the screen becomes a feast of fantasy and adventure, not too mention the occasional 'Aww Crap!' However, Hellboy 2 unfortunately fails when it comes to relationship scenes and development Hellboy 1 was so desperately setting up. Guillermo del Toro once said 'I can direct someone being killed, but I can't direct a love scene.' How right he was, the love interests and Mozart-filled scenes are far too hollow and fake it feels awfully uncomfortable to watch. Ron Pearlman also lacks in these vital scenes, where he seems to collapse on seen, his face bearing an expression that desperately seeks to hear the word 'cut.' Nonetheless, Hellboy 2 is above par and gathers all the right cogs, before putting them in the right place, creating an visual feast complimeted by the mind and fantasies of a defining director.",7,0,3,13 September 2008
Forrest Gump," 'Life is like a box of chocolates,' and Forrest Gump is the Lindt in the box of cinema
","A warning first. This is not a nice, friendly movie about a mentally retarded man, it is not a feel-good movie. It is a deep, multi-layered story about a man struggling to see the USA during some of its most controversial and famous times. Forrest Gump is surrounded by drugs, war, politics, love and labour. It is a strong-willed and ambitious movie to tell a story in a complex way, and it succeeds in a way I believe not even Tom Hanks or Robert Zemekis thought it would. It is a film about ideas, about relationships and humanity, subject which many modern films simply ignore.Forrest Gump tells the epic story of Forrest Gump, a man who sees the world in an innocent, plain way. He is the glasses for many people who have has their vision blurred by the complexity of life and politics which surround them. Gump is unknowingly pure, and not only changes and influences history, but tells a heart-warming yet strong life story. Forrest Gump is therefore a long film , but the film holds out attention for every frame. Gump is not only brilliantly played by Tom Hanks, who has a very mature and complex take on his character, but has an incredibly engaging plot and dialogue behind him. The script is like a liquid, and rolls consistently off the tongue of each and every character that adds to Gumps epic tale.A stunningly complex and engaging movie.",10,1,3,23 September 2008
Quantum of Solace," Quantum is an enjoyable piece of work, but the 'masters' behind the picture disappoint.
","There have been some pretty stupid James Bond films. A wining media mogul has tried to start WWIII so he can get 24-hour news coverage exclusivity in China, and someone has tried to make a deadly satellite out of diamonds. But beyond the stupidity of diamonds and boring villains, there is a presence, a style in every Bond films that makes a statement and provides an explanation for why Bond has lasted 22(+) films. Then, after 20 films, Casino Royale was released. Arguably one of the best bond films ever, its gritty violence and stylish brutality seemed to fuse the old, witty James Bond, with a new, revamped '00' together perfectly. This showed in the box-office results too, becoming the highest grossing bond film so for, meaning there was bound to be a sequel.So, where to go for the sequel? Nearly all the books had already been transferred on to celluloid in varying amounts of success, and a remake would seem like the bond franchise had finally ran out of steam. So EON hire Paul Haggis, writer of Best Picture winner Crash, along with 'master' director Marc Forster, responsible for Monsters Ball and Stranger than Fiction. However, does it not seem a strange choice to assemble a cast of 'character' and 'drama' directors, producers and storytellers to present a James Bond film that should be laden with style, wit, irony and action? It is a strange choice, and it has back-fired on the new Bond instalment harshly. Forster seems lost amongst the need for big explosions and pirouetting cars, his mind only having the capacity to command the cold Daniel Craig, who performs at a level Sean Connery would admire, if not feel threatened by. The story by Haggis jumps around incoherently more than James Bonds need to travel to every exotic location. The organisation of Quantum appears, then disappears, characters twiddle their thumbs and sit in the background uneasy, all because again of the action sequences. The film's narrative and direction is halted by Craig slamming into walls and punching foreigners, which fail to fuse and cohere to any aspect of the film. Perhaps these action sequences are a result of another peculiar cast member, Second Unit Director Dan Bradley, who worked on the previous two Jason Bourne instalments. Would he bring over the shaky-camera shots that Paul Greengrass (director of the two previous Bourne movies) has made a signature style that many action movies have recently imitated? Unfortunately, yes, he did, and it may work for the reclusive Bourne, but it doesn't work for Bond. In the opening action sequences (there are two really), the camera feels like it has been operated by a drunken man running away from lion, and the $200 million worth of scenes are almost wasted by frenetic, out-of-control and unnecessarily fast-cutting editing and barely watchable camera shaking.It's a shame really, but it is strange that at the end of the film you feel pleasantly happy and satisfied with Quantum of Solace. For the camera direction may be shaky, but it is immensely engaging. The Jason Bourne series was better than Quantum of Solace, so Bourne added to Bond is in some way a good connection. The plot may be a jungle of incoherence and insoluble plot threads, but it is a level up and provides a solid base for the coming films. The villain may have a dim character reminiscent of a mouse, but Daniel Craig puts on a 'true' Bond performance. Flemming actually described bond as 'cold, ironic and brutal,' and Craig is exactly that, whereas Pierce Brosnon was a slimy, grimy character whose dialogue consisted of innuendo and nothing else. Quantum of Solace may feel like a set up for a new series of Bond films, but it is a passable set up for its collection of Bourne-like action sequences and unsentimental, vicious conviction. However, may the producers heed a warning from Bond's latest outing. They have stripped Bond bare of his gadgets, one-liners, seeming invincibility and shaken-not-stirred style; but they can't forget it, and layering all that carefully and delicately back on may prove a challenge.",6,2,5,2 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Uncomfortable, yet thrillingly essential viewing
","Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (the Coen brothers), No Country for Old Men (NCFOM) is a simple story that expands itself stunningly, and unloads skip-a-heart-beat action scenes, controlled and scarily realistic acting, and some of the most tense dialogue scenes in recent years.Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it tells the story of Moss, a retired Vietnam soldier, who has a strange yet eerie lifestyle and wife (brilliantly played by Kelly MacDonald, who puts on a continuously convincing West Texas accent). However, when Moss stumbles upon $2 million, he gets himself caught in a chase against 'the devil reincarnated', Anton Chigurh. Played by Javier Bardem, who won a supporting actor Oscar for his role, Chigurh is a fate-driven phycopathic killer, who mercilessly kills anyone brutally (and graphically) in his path, except for those saved by the fate of a coin. Bardem is so spine-chillingly complexed and terrifying that not even the blisteringly hot desert landscapes can warm this film.And that's the main, if not only, problem with NCFOM. It is so unmercifully depressing and disturbingly eerie that it offers little redemption in return for the audiences pounding hearts. The kills are so graphic and violent, that your stomach scrunches up and the acid at the bottom swishes around.That said, NCFOM is so brilliantly acted and engagingly heart-thumping that it doesn't need much remorse, nor a score (only 16 minuted of minimalist music)! Superbly and patiently shot and developed NCFOM is one of the year's best thrillers/horrors.",8,3,4,13 September 2008
The Number 23," A film in which the number 23 only stands for the number of minutes you'll stay awake for.
","Jim Carrey was never made to do serious films in which he would have to play a straight, demented and tormented character. For every time he has some great line to say he does the Jim Carrey twitch and you can see the cheesy and fake smile creep out the corners of his mouth. Sure you can make his hair ruffly and jet black, add some writing on his face, but he'll still be Jim Carrey, Ace Ventura! He seemed to of approached acting The Number 23 with a deadly straight face, one facial expression and just made his role in Eternal Sunchine of the Spotless Mind more murderous. I'm afraid it doesn't really work. Then again none of the film really works. It's sole plot consists of someone making connections to the number 23 while weird, not very deep physiological occurrences happen within his very mind. This goes on for two hours. Two long, strenuous hours of grainy, barely lit settings where Jim Carrey goes; '2 and 3 make 23, interesting. It must mean I have to have flashbacks now.' No, it means that Joel Schumachaer (Director) has decided to call your dog NED (N+E+D=23!).A pointless, start, middle and end that concludes nothing apart from Jim Carrey needs a passable piece of work soon and that The Number 23 resembles more of a merri-go-round, going round in loop after loop till it destroys itself.",2,0,2,15 September 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Finally, American horror lightens up and goes back to the infamous days
","Outside the golden gates of Hollywood Sam Raimi, best known for the Spiderman trilogy, is something of a horror legend. He originally gained fame for his openly grimy and dirty video nasties, which soared into the ranks of cult status. But now, after a hiatus of 15 years, he has finally gone back to his roots with the eerily delightful Drag Me to Hell.The simple story of Christine Young, a lawyer who is cursed by a gypsy, seems somewhat formulaic, but to me I find it is purposely so. It's frank use of stereotypes and corny economic messages provide a quiet underlying chuckle throughout the film. My favourite example is in the title, as poor Christine has four days to break the curse or she will be dragged, kicking and screaming, to the red-hot bowels of hell.During her journey, every imaginable horror device is utilised magnificently, intensified by thrillingly creative visuals. One sequence depicts an eyeball lodged in cake, with the jam and cream as the blood and pus. All this supplies a rich tone and novelty to what is considered a dated and exploited genre. The traditional and overstated score is almost of parody of sorts, with harsh, sudden screeches from violins adding an extra few centimetres to that jump in your seat. Because, believe me, there are many noteworthy frights to be found in Drag Me to Hell, some straight out of the horror textbook, some unique and bizarrely humorous. Refreshing, aptly concise and damn-right original.",8,3,7,6 September 2009
There Will Be Blood," A thoughtful, dramatic horror story that grabs the audience and doesn't let go to the very end.
","It is a real shame that the music for There Will Be Blood didn't win an Oscar. Then again, it's a shame that this film didn't win more than a couple Oscars. It is so ambitious, so compelling and engaging in every cinematic aspect. From the cineamatography of the wide, desserts and foreboding landscapes, to the acting of Daniel Day-Lewis, the film hits the highs effortlessly. I have watched There Will be Blood twice now, and the second time was even better. I now don't see a visually stunning film, I see a complex tale of an oil man whose lust for the black, squelchy stuff corrupted him till be destroyed himself. It is a tale of one man, but is also a tale of religion, ambition, political parallels, lust, greed and lies. It is so unbelievably multi-layered that you forget that you are watching celluloid strips being switched 25 times every second. The film blasts nearly all of your senses thoroughly, and doesn't stop, even during the dialogue scenes.",10,1,3,15 September 2008
Blade Runner," Intruigingly detailed, tense, a great landmark in sci-fi thriller history
","THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE FINAL CUT (ON BLU-RAY ALSO) It has taken Ridley Scott 25 years of re-edits to deliver his perfect vision of the original 1980's cult phenomenon, but under the pressure of beating a world-wide marvel, delivering a better cinematic experience is a overwhelming task. The ultimate question is whether Ridley Scott's perfect vision is any good. I can emphatically say it has earned itself a place on the podium of the most extraordinary films ever.Set in a dystopian and perpetually raining Los Angeles during 2019, the story begins when five replicants escape onto the streets. Replicants are terrifying androids that are visually identical and superior to humans in every way. However, they do have a life span of four years and possess no memory, features which distinguish them from the genuine article. We then discover the lonely main protagonist of the story named Deckard, played convincingly by Harrison Ford, whose job is to eliminate these replicants.From here a dense noir thriller quickly evolves, fizzling from one visually stunning element to another. However, the best ingredient of this science fiction film is its wariness of not being too tedious by stuffing itself with sci-fi gibberish. Instead, it concentrates on absorbing themes, such as the question of identity or the value of being human. In spite of this, the thing that truly makes it a cult classic is the characters and environment, which are richly detailed and compelling.To everyone reading this, I leave you with one of the films marvellous quotations; 'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.'",10,0,1,14 September 2008
Beowulf," Laden with fantasy and stunningly real CGI, Beowulf only falls when it rises to not meet its own challenge
","When Beowulf started, and the irresistible, deep and booming soundtrack began, the first thing I said to the person next to me is was: 'are you sure this is an animated film!' (that's until Ray Winstone (Beowulf) appears).Beowulf begins as any epic tale would. It lays out the cold, Norse, setting and the characters in a plain, simple fashion. Then the battles start. In fact, Beowulf only really begins 20 minutes in, when Grendel, a hideous giant, kills many people in a food hall in the presence of the king (Antony Hopkins). The King orders that the hall be closed and sends out a message stating that anyone who can slay Grendel will get riches 'beyond their wildest dreams.' Eventually, Beowulf, a warrior with oily muscles and a London accent arrives, and claims he will 'kill your monsta'!' A battle scene between him and Grendel commences, which seems a repeat of the first battle, apart from Beowulf is naked. This is a weird and miss-fitted scene, as it falls awkwardly between the line of comedy (Beowulf has sausages, wine glasses, poles, swords blocking his private parts throughout in order to maintain a 12A (PG-13) certificate), and violent action. Beowulf eventually kills Grendel , but this angers another beast in the far mountains, his mother (Angelina Jolie).After this, the film climaxes for 40 minutes, bearing the heavy promise of deep, moving scenes and great, energetic action scenes. But it's not to be, as the film slows down instead, tediously crawling along all its CGI frames, before a quick action scene is slapped on the end.Its a real shame, after all, as Beowulf seems to miss the point in the second half. Its missing the heart that was brooding in a deep, potentially show-stopping cauldron, and settles for a film that bears nothing particularly memorable, but leaves good feeling in your heart afterwards.",6,0,0,14 September 2008
300," A stylish, gritty film that impresses the eye, but lacks the energy to pull it over the finish line
","300 is an epic story. Telling the tale of how 300 Spartan warriors fought 250,000 Persians, and lost, but also won in many ways. It was a story of honour and how each of the 300 men gave their blood and energy to protect their people. so, now Zack Synder is retelling the story, but this time, it's style over substance.There is nothing wrong with style, it may be fickle, but it is one of the most powerful and compelling weapons in a director's arsenal. This is why in 300, the picture is bleak, the enemy are half-human half-monster, and the 300 Spartans have giant 6 packs drenched in oil. So, first and foremost, 300 is really a treat for women with a strong stomach. There is nothing wrong with this, the film flows well and has a fantasy element which is undeniably strong-willed. 300 is bold and is a film with some bite. But unfortunately, not even style can save 300 from being a bitter disappointment.The fact is, 300 lacks energy. There are over 4 battles, each annoyingly similar; people in slow-mo, spearing various horrific creatures. I'm sorry, we're not 1999 where slow-mo could pass for entertainment (The Matrix). We're in an age where we expect inventive effects and set-ups, forcing upon the audience a variety of feelings and emotions. But during every battle scene in 300, with the exception of half of one, not even a nerve will tingle, your fists won't tighten, and you feel little emotion for the 300 homo-erotic men. The film feels like it was choreographed and directed by someone who played computer games for far too long and was level 100 on World of Warcraft. 300 wants to build up, climaxing for one strenuous battle after the next, but instead you get 2 hours of characterless men shouting. The Spartans have no honour in 300, they are loud posh french designers in a skin suit.The film has no tension, no character or shape. It relies wholly on style, grit, blood and dramatic effects shots. Not enough, sorry, not enough.",5,0,0,15 September 2008
Donnie Darko," Though almost impossible to completely understand on the first watch, Donnie Darko is forcefully engaging
","Donnie Darko is not a dark, scary horror film. Neither is it a bright, happy film. It is somewhere in between, and is a brooding, abstract Physcological thriller. It is so engaging a s a result, that you follow the story and their characters willingly, desperately desiring an answer to the film.Donnie Darko (DD) tells the story of a young, troubled teenager named Donnie (Darko). He is haunted by visions of Frank, a bunny rabbit who tells him when the world is going to end. From here, strange occurrences and coincidences take place, and Donnie starts to both mature, yet also lose control of himself. He is tormented, multi-layered, and played eye-catchingly by Jake Gyllenhall. All 110 minutes of DD is climaxing and superbly engaging. It is fantastic that cinema has finally aimed to challenge the audience, and though DD does seem to turn and twist a couple times to many, the plot threads are on the whole enjoyable.A well directed, ambitious and thoughtful film.",8,2,5,24 September 2008
