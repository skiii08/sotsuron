Rang De Basanti," Inconsistency
","I'm not say this movie is not good but this movie have same problem with other Aamir Khan movie project such as: 'PK', 'like stars on earth' & '3 idiots' which is inconsistency of the story. Like this movie have two totally dfferent plot. One is simple plot about bunch of guys friends helping England journalist to create her own movie about young Indian movement during England occupation and other plot is that ruin this movie exactly that about this bunch of guys friend try to overthrow corrupt government and became their character in the movie by killing the minister. Why silly?. Because its totally different thing. If these two plot is breakdown into two movies maybe it will better.",6,1,2,6 November 2018
Aquaman," It's should be titled: National Treasure - Trident of Poseidon
","Not as bad as they said but also Not as good as they said. Underwater special effect and beaches is amazing, that one good point. The fight & war scenes is better then BvS or Justice League. But that's it. The story is very poor, the titled should be 'National Treasure: Trident of Poseidon'. Not enough time to develop many of this creatures back story, even for Aquaman itself. Mamoa is so-so. Amber Heard is just pretty like she played in every of her movies, no acting skill whatsoever. Manta is copied from Power Rangers with the eyes of Cyclops from X-Men. Patrick Wilson is Loki with the Jaws army. DC still not yet have good villain with the charisma to become the good movie like Heath Ledger 'Joker' at The Dark Knight anymore. All better villain should be CGI characters. The soundtrack is so lousy and cheezy and the timing of it ruin the mood instantly.Note: having only good special effect can wow you in very short period only because in the future it will come new and better of it. The special effect will always improve. That's why if you see top movie list anywhere even at IMDB list, not many movies with only special effect on the list for long. And if they are on the list, I sure you it because they have very good story.",5,0,0,28 December 2018
