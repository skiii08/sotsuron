Skyfall," A Pro Wrestling View On Skyfall 007
","The review below is all you need.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e21Q58Gtx-QI found that Skyfall is all too similar to the previous James Bond films. So I attempted to shorten up the plot in a quick 3 minute video. I still will always love Goldeneye, but yet, I'm biased because of the N64 game with the same name. But the story itself was fantastic as I feel this film does not create anything new. It just seems to rehash the old. I enjoy the villain, and Daniel Craig opposite him adds for intriguing interaction. I have been very impressed with the Bond genre over the years and have liked to see how it progresses from Sean Connery all the way to Daniel Craig. I have found that it is not the fault of the actors but more so falls on the story tellers who have yet to create a lot of action that we have grown to expect. However, films like Casino Royale have also proved that a different take on suspense can provide a nice counterpart for Bond. Since he is supposed to be very cunning and intelligent rather than just a well trained killer. The attempts were made on both ends but I do not know which one prevailed. But again, my video will help especially if you are a fan of pro wrestling and understand the history of sports entertainment and Bond.",4,2,6,3 January 2013
