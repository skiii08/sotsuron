The Blair Witch Project," Suck-O
","I have seen a lot of movies, but this one just plain sucked.  Me and my friends left the theater in shock.  Not about how 'scary'  it was, but how STUPID.  I love witch movies, and the storyline was alright.  BUT, faint noises in the background and shaky shots of trees and sticks are not my idea of scary.  I sneak out of the house and go to the woods all the time in the middle of the night, and I continue to do that without being scared of the woods for one second.  Don't waste your money.  Really.",2,0,2,20 August 1999
