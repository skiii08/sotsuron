Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A feast of beauty
","Well, after leaving the Cinema a big smile attached on my face. This movie was far better than the first. The picture is superb and the flaws found in volume one feels like nothing anymore.The first volume feels like an introduction after seing this. You get the story explained, and the same feeling of disgust and enjoy at the same time.
I really recommend this to anyone fancy beautiful movies and violence. The fights are awsome, and you get a to laugh many times aswell. Tarantino delivers a jewel with no, or very few flaws.A warning though. If you don't enjoy violence or gore, this is nothing for you. It also contains a really scary scene inducing some real claustrophobia..",10,0,1,23 April 2004
