Scarface," Probably the best movie ever made
","Scarface is just perfect. It's feature some incredible acting, a great 80's atmosphere and some of the greatest movie quotes all time. There are so much violence, also there are some De Palma's demonstration of talent. The director shows his attributes by moving his camera in a subversive way, using all the possibilities of every piece of frame. There are some incredible scenes, sequences and one of the best ending sequences ever. The character's personalities are well developed, in a way you can't avoid feel empathic about then. Nothing but a great, classic, genius and entertaining flick. Simply awesome and great. The best Pacino's work, no doubt.",10,0,2,29 October 2012
