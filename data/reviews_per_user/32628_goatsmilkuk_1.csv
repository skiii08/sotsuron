Scarface," Terrible acting and story line
","I felt it was one I should watch, sadly it disappointed. How the main character wasn't wiped out before is ludicrous. The plot is thin, the acting is wooden and the fake blood looks like poster paint. If you haven't watched it don't bother. Several shootouts were very A Team with hundreds of bullets miraculously missing their target at times.",4,1,7,13 September 2018
