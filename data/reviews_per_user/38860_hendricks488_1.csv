Angels & Demons," Different and kind of a let down...
","As most have said, if you don't know the book, this is great...however with all of the changes and things they left out...it's just not the same....AT ALL.......but the number one thing I was MOST upset about was changing of the final brand and entirely omitting the Illuminati Diamond....Langdon spoke of it early( in the book) and then it's revealed at the end....but the chose to replace it with the crossed keys?! wtf???? As mentioned before it would have really kicked off fast had they actually had the Illuminati ambigram branded into the professor at the beginning as it should have been. I would have definitely enjoyed another 20-30 min. to have all of the correct information and storyline rather than cutting things short like that....let down in that aspect, but still a good film",6,1,5,15 May 2009
