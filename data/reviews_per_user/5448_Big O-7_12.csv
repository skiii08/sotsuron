The Blair Witch Project," A unique experience
","May contain spoilers.Well, I finally got around to seeing this summer sensation.  At first I felt like I should be hopping on the anti-BWP band wagon that inevitably follows every successful movie (FORREST GUMP is a prime example).  But I can't.  The film is nowhere near great in its execution (though kudos go to the three leads ... they are more than up to the task, and they deliver the goods). It was an odd experience for me since I just picked up Stephen King's THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, a shorter novel about getting lost in the woods. Back to BWP.  The premise works.  What does not work is some of the irritating camera work, the fact that the girl (who is 'directing' a documentary) does less directing than her crew, and the way that the BW is shown.  But the premise is strong, and the forrest turns out to be the real bad guy.  Overall rating ... a 6.  For a better scare (or a nice double or triple feature) check out Michael Rooker in HENRY:  Portrait of a Serial Killer, or Michael Powell's PEEPING TOM.",6,0,1,11 November 1999
Erin Brockovich," Leaves a bad aftertaste
","I am a big fan of Julia Roberts.  I am a big fan of Aaron Eckhart.  I am a big huge fan of Albert Finney.  So why only 4 stars?  The story is nice = 1 star.  The three leads are strong, if not great (especially Mr. Finney) >another 3 stars.  So what is wrong?  The film ultimately leaves a bad, bad aftertaste.  Even though this is a 'true' story, the way that Erin behaves in the movie is reprehensible ... she treats all of those around her like utter crap and puts words in their mouths (notice that NO ONE in the film says that they think she is stupid, yet notice how she accuses all of them of doing just that).  I mean, wouldn't it be a great world where we could all walk around and openly insult those we work for, yet demand that they pay us?  And why?  Because WE have three kids, couldn't keep a spouse around, and therefore we DESERVE to be able to do all this?  No friggin' way.  Julia, go back to NOTTING HILL.",4,12,29,24 April 2000
The 13th Warrior," Hunk o' Junk
","What a mess.  This movie is a complete, utterly stupefying bore of a movie. The script is inane.  The acting is somewhere else.  And what about those incredibly fake looking shots of that boat on the seas ... I could have filmed a toy boat in my own bath tub and made it look more realistic than this.  They need a '13th warrior'?  This movie needs a whole lot more. Avoid or perish!",1,3,11,26 April 2000
Beauty and the Beast," Simply Beautiful
","Wow ... thank you to Disney for bringing three of the best movies ever made to the screen in the past ten years (this one plus THE LION KING and TARZAN).  Few films, especially animated ones, allow the the audience to so easily escape from their dreary ordinary lives, and into a world where humanity, pure magic, and simple wonder live harmoniously side by side.  I eagerly await Disney releasing all of these glorious masterpieces on DVD.",10,0,0,24 May 2000
The Beach," Ultimately a Long, BORING day at The Beach
","This film was simply just middle ground.  Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert Carlyle, and that new french chick are all game, but the plot and the writing is definitely not.  Some of the dialogue in this mediocre film is simply banal. However, the cast is game (although you really wish that the french guy, the swedish injured guy, and most of Tilda Swinton's followers would simply just leave the film).  Danny Boyle seems to think that visual flair can be substituted for a lame script, and to a point it does.  But at the end of this torturous and lame LORD OF THE FLIES wannabe, you realize that it does not.  Do yourself a favor and rent LORD OF THE FLIES or read THE BEACH instead (the paperback probably costs less than a movie ticket anyway) ... you'll thank me for it.  If you want to see the french chick (or Leo) naked, I'm sure you can get pictures off of the internet.",Null,0,0,14 February 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," You have got to be kidding!
","Is this really all that $130 million buys these days?  This was junk.  The special effects don't even look good.  The writing?  I beg of you, Mr. Lucas, please PLEASE let someone else write the next installment.  And as for originality, could the movie have ripped off THE FIFTH ELEMENT any more (and done it worse?)? -- I sure hope they forked over some serious cash to Luc Besson, because they are HIS creatures (minus the robots that were borrowed from AI).A year before this film came out, the movie going public punished a film by Steven Spielberg called AI.  People just didn't go to see a film about a robot boy trying to become human.  I guess people would rather opt for 'entertainment' such as ATTACK OF THE CLONES or THE SCORPION KING, films where there is an abhorrent lack of original thought.  And sure, George Lucas has come out saying that measuring anything against the original three films of the STAR WARS series is unfair because of how good they really are. What does that say?  That now we should be happy enough to settle for something less than great?  That we should be happy forking over $10 so that some centillionaire out in CA can play with digital images and completely forego any script?  Well, Mr. Lucas, your plan would work if not for your friend Mr. Spielberg.  Unlike Mr. Lucas, Mr. Spielberg seems to find new and exciting ways to challenge himself and his audience -- and if one were to go by AIs box office performance, one would say that he is, unfortunately, losing the fight.  To paraphrase 'You are what you watch.'  Keep paying Mr. Lucas for utter crap like this and I'm sure he'll be more than happy to keep feeding it to you.",1,7,16,30 May 2002
Notting Hill," What can I say? JULIA is back
","This film is really quite special.  It is a film that promises only one thing, and delivers.  Not many films can actually claim that.  This one promises a funny, snuggly kind of romantic-comedy, and it does deliver. Julia Roberts is perfectly cast as a superstar trying to deal with the aspect of fame.  I have a theory that in any movie starring Ms. Roberts, the co-stars take 5th seat and back, because Ms. Roberts is a genuine superstar (one of those special people that only walk on the earth every few decades or so) in the Marilyn Monroe tradition, one who just becomes so charismatic that no mere mortal stands a chance (look what happened to Richard Gere in RUNAWAY BRIDE).  She is wonderful in this movie.  But does all this mean that the rest of the cast does not matter ... well, almost.  But the always game Mr. Grant and his co-conspirators all do add to the film, and with Ms. Roberts leading the way, they bring this one home solid.",8,6,7,11 November 1999
U-571," A water-logged shipwreck!
","A dream cast.  A great, exciting story.  So why only 3 stars?  1- Misuse of cast.  Harvey Keitel (the most serious casualty), David Keith, and Bill Paxton are all wasted, by either being given standard-issue dialogue or early departures.  Mathew McConaghey manages to hold his head above water, however.  Problem number 2 - Josh Mostow brings no sense of excitment to the material AT ALL.  There is not one sequence that does not involve major special effects that instills a sense of 'wow' in the audience.  Steven Spielberg and Terrence Malick have raised the bar (together with Oliver Stone) on war films that a run of the mill director has no chance of coming near it, much less surpassing it ... and Josh Mostow, being that he has NO sense of visual flair whatsoever, fails miserably.  Finally, the third problem - THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, DAS BOOT, RUN SILENT RUN DEEP, and CRIMSON TIDE were all done by directors and producers who were way better than the team behind this shipwreck.  So, why the three stars?  They belong to Mr. McConaghey, Mr. Paxton, Mr. Keitel, Mr. Keith, the special effects crew, and the American men who actually did this (and deserve a MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better film.",3,2,4,25 April 2000
Pearl Harbor," When the attack comes, watch out!
","Ok.  Let's be honest here.  Neither director Michael Bay nor uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer have ever been labeled as subtle.  Nor have they ever been known for script.  They are known for concept.  They are known for action. They are known for special effects.  And that, ultimately, is what PEARL HARBOR delivers.  I will agree that the film takes a while to get started, and ultimately we in the audience have to suffer through as many bad lines as bullets fired by Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).  But the film is nowhere near as bad as the critics made it out.  It is not the root of all evil.  There is far worse dreck out there occupying space on a video store shelf.  The fact is that once the movie does get going and the and the Japanese attack, the films visuals simply soar.  Some of the sequences are amazing.  And this is where the heart of the film lies.  Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have created a visual spectacle at the expense of story and character (neither Ben Affleck nor Josh Hartnett are good enough actors to elevate what little material they have been given here).",7,0,1,12 June 2002
Mission: Impossible II," A let down
","Who would have ever thought that pairing up Tom Cruise with John Woo would have ended up in a let down?  Mr. Cruise has proven time and again (see RAIN MAN, MAGNOLIA, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY) that if given the right material to work with, he is one of the best actors working today.  Mr. Woo has proven time and again that he is a master of the action film (see HARD BOILED and THE KILLERS).  So what happened here?  My guess is that the script by Robert Towne is simply not good, and so even if one brings in John Woo there is only so much he can do.  To be sure, there are some very impressive sequences in this film, but you just don't care.  You don't care about Thandie Newton's character, and you certainly don't care about Ethan Hunt.",6,0,0,31 May 2000
The Hurricane," Close, but no cigar
","Okay, here we go again.  This film is a solid film.  But it is not really that great.  Don't get me wrong, it does have a few good things about it. But first things first.  This film is yet another example of a film that fails to realize that there can be more than one strong performance in a film.  The films casting agents had the good idea of casting David Paymer, Harris Yulin, Liev Schreiber, Deborah Unger, and John Hannah in supporting roles.  The problem is that they were giving little, if anything, to do. Mr. Paymer, who proves his worth time and again in films, is reduced down to some mugging and about two lines of dialougue.  Mr. Yulin gets even less as his co-counsel.  Mr. Hannah's character is not defined at all, and he too is not given anything to do other than to fill up the screen.  Ms. Unger is given one scene of affection with Mr. Washington, but the scene is awkward and one is left feeling that there was something between her character and The Hurricane that the film makers chose to leave out (some sort of romance or something along those lines).  Mr. Schreiber is given 'stuff' to do, but it seems that this 'stuff' is in the film only to boost the film's running time.  The worst offense comes with Mr. Hedaya.  Here is a true actors actor that proves that he can chew scenery with the best of 'em (if you don't believe me, check out the much over looked and recent video release DICK). Mr. Hedaya plays the heavy, but his legs are cut from under him in the middle of the movie, for no reason, and he really looks like he pained over this for the rest of the film.  The film does not even give him the comeuppance that his character, and the audience, deserves.  The other real problem with the film is that a lot of critics have come out saying not only that the film is more fiction than fact, and that the true story would have made a more compelling film.  Now for the good stuff.  Mr. Washington's performance is a hurricane indeed. He is sheer pleasure to watch as he goes through a transformation similar to what he did in Spike Lee's MALCOLM X and in Edward Zwick's GLORY.  The many faces of pride that he manages to show us is reason enough to see the film, and he deserves every accolade that he gets for this performance (only Russell Crowe's performance as Jim Wigand in THE INSIDER stands a chance to beat him this year).  The real reason to pay to see the movie is to see what Mr. Washington and Mr. Jewison concoct in their second collaboration (first cam A SOLDIER'S STORY) inside the boxing ring.  In the boxing ring, the film is poetry in motion.  Not since Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro decided to make motion picture history in RAGING BULL has boxing looked so poetic on film.  And that is quite the compliment considering ROCKY, THE BOXER, and FIGHT CLUB are all in the same broad genre.  Unfortunately, the boxing sequences far outshine the rest of the film, crippled as mentioned above.  Where ROCKY, THE BOXER, FIGHT CLUB, and RAGING BULL managed to keep everything looking just as good, this film does not. The prison sequences are no where near as intense as in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, and no where near as menacing as in SLEEPERS. 
This film is gloomy-day entertainment, at best.",7,0,1,13 January 2000
Gladiator," B-O-R-I-N-G
","I went in with the greatest of expectations.  I left highly disappointed. This film takes forever to get going, and when it does, the going is SLOW!!! Does it have stunning visuals?  Yes.  Is the cast okay?  Yes.  Does one care?  NOPE.  The film commits the cardinal sin of action epics ... it's B-O-R-I-N-G.  My suggestion?  Save a couple of bucks and rent the Cuba Gooding, Jr. version instead.",2,0,4,9 May 2000
