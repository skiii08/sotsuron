The Blair Witch Project," Once It Gets Going, a Powerful Exploration of Fear
","It is amazing when I see an interesting movie like Blair Witch that cost under 50 thousand dollars to make. I say interesting rather than rave about it because there is about half of a very good movie here but the rest I was less impressed with.First the acting in Blair Witch is top notch, absolutely believable. I recently saw Clerks, another successful ultra cheap feature, where some of the characters weren't even acting. Instead they were simply being their strange selves. But Clerks from start to finish has something that Blair Witch does not. It is tightly paced while Blair Witch rambles for the first half hour. It is too slow and some of the townspeople are given too much air time. Now I understand this is supposed to be some quasi student documentary but it does not have to be dull. Once the actors get into the woods, the film begins to hit its stride. My only complaint about the second half hour is the lengthy time spent on reactions to piles of rocks and tied together sticks. The editing here needed to be more crisp. On a positive note the tension between the actors begins to build in a very believable way.The last third of Blair Witch was terrific. The actors slipping into madness, the running into the night is electric and the incredible speech in the tent by Heather Donahue is great. The final crazed moments in the house have a mind bending David Lynch feel, very disturbing. 
Few movies that I have seen are as up and down as Blair Witch. Considering that this is a first film and the limited budget this is understandable. But while the beginning is slow, the wait was worth it. Few films explore the depth of fear as well as Blair Witch.",5,0,1,31 October 1999
Antz," Woody Allen Animated Film for Adults
","Antz is the rare animated film like Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Lord of the Rings which is more for adults than children. The film is clever from the music, the subtle humor and of course building the movie around the Woody Allen character. In Annie Hall there is a short cartoon with Woody and Diane Keaton. No need to wonder about a full length Woody Allen animated film. Here it is.The computer animation in Antz is not overwhelmingly beautiful as it is in A Bugs Life or even Toy Story. The film's color is often limited, a muddy brown or grey. Antz is always pleasing to look at but never looks great but just mediocre.Quibbling aside, the film has laughs and with Woody Allen doing his thing very well is comfortable like a pair of old slippers.",7,0,0,15 February 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is Not Your Father's Star Wars
","I'll be blunt. This is not your father's Star Wars. Forget the hype for a moment and try to give the movie a chance. This film has something for almost everybody. Phantom Menace has three personalities. It has some fast paced action like Star Wars IV. It also has scenes that were really a Star Wars cartoon. And finally there is a long serious stretch that was more like Star Trek than Star Wars. And you know what? All of these different parts came together for me. Phantom is not great but good enough.I hear the howling out there that Phantom is not for adults! It is not made only for adults who like action pictures. This is not an action picture. But it is for adults in general. Several people have told me this is the first Star Wars movie they have enjoyed. They LIKED Liam Neeson and the 'serious scenes' with Anakin on Tatooine.I'll be blunt again. George Lucas is no longer 22. He is 55. He is a different film maker from the time he made A New Hope. The first Star Wars with its video game battles every 15 minutes, the constant arguing between its main characters and the frat party enthusiasm when things went right, it's not in Phantom. Lucas has grown up.Another thing about Lucas. He is a genius at making popular entertainment. My son's friends, 1st through 3rd graders love this picture. And why not. The computer animation is terrific and they 'get' the humor. As I said people who do not usually like  science fiction have told me they enjoyed the seriousness of the main characters. (And except for the animated character, they are all very low key.)The group that has complained the most are the action picture fans. But you know what? With all the complaints about how slow and silly the film is, they still thought the 'bad guy' was cool, that the light saber action was good and that there were enough things getting blown up to keep them going back to see the movie a second and third time.Finally, Lucas and his crew are such good artists and perfectionists and so dedicated in creating an imaginary world that no one can absorb all the imagery that Phantom gives you in one sitting. I want to see it again; if anything just to look at the awesome digital sets one more time and experience another place in a galaxy far, far away.",5,0,1,25 May 1999
As Good as It Gets," It's Sort of a Wonderful Slice of Life
","What kind of movie is As Good As It Gets? There is no easy answer. It isn't a simple romance or road picture and doesn't have clear cut heroes and villains. It is a slice of life with people trying to deal with tough breaks and for the most part As Good As It Gets does its job well.As Good As It Gets begins by showing us a bigoted, rigid novelist played by Jack Nicholson. The main object of his scorn is an artist (Greg Kinnear) who happens to be gay and the only person who can tolerate our bigot is a waitress (Helen Hunt). Now the film gets into very heavy details about the problems of the artist and the waitress and how Nicholson's character could care less. This worked well for me because the performances were good, including a supporting part by Cuba Gooding Jr (oh, and the dog is cute too). Also, the script was well written and the pace felt right.As Good As It Gets brought up many topics and presented them in interesting ways. Can a bigoted person change? Does a single mother with big financial problems take money as a main consideration when looking for a partner? For a Hollywood movie the handling of these weighty subjects leaned more toward reality than fantasy. Still, the age difference between Nicholson and Hunt as well as the final scene take some strong suspension of belief. On a positive note, the style of the picture moved from drama, to comedy, to a road picture and landed as a romance shifting smoothly from one mood to another. Appreciating As Good As It Gets depends if you are not expecting a lot of action or a straight forward story. If you are willing to give the movie a chance and enter the lives of its characters then your effort will be well rewarded.",8,0,0,5 March 2000
Shakespeare in Love," An Abundance of Riches
","A romantic comedy does not get much better than Shakespeare in Love. Here is a movie that captures the feel of England 400 years ago. It is romantic yet light. It is funny but is complex enough to provide enjoyment for fans of literature.The sets of England 400 years ago, the costumes and the character's makeup including their bad dental work were just right. You could almost smell those streets. The hero, Shakespeare, is excellently played by Joseph Fiennes. He is sympathetic but never pathetic. As for Gwyneth Paltrow, she shows her range from boyishness to radiance. This is the first film I have seen her in where I believed she could become a great actress. There is also a great supporting cast, especially Judi Dench, who all have good melodramatic and comic instincts.The film never plods. The screenplay is rich with romance, emotion and action.  The plot weaves several stories and themes. You can enjoy it as a simple love story with some action and basic suspense about producing a play or you can get much deeper into movie's complex tapestry of ideas and in jokes. But most importantly the film's mood is always light and is never overblown (unlike another recent movie about unfulfilled love, Great Expectations).Deserving of its Oscar, this is simply a great film.",Null,58,87,20 June 1999

Alien: Resurrection," Disturbingly Interesting
","Alien Resurrection bridges the gap brought about by Alien 3 which was too detached from the primal fears that the Alien series explores. The aliens of the Alien movies are more than routine scary monsters. Alien R. brings back our disgust of the alien's parasitic nature and our fear of bodily violation.I did not see this movie in a theater because I believed that the Alien franchise had run out of steam. I was wrong. This movie scared me. It left me with an upset stomach. So why do I watch?I come back to this series first because I am fascinated by good movies based on the ideas from a short story 'Who Goes There?' by John W.

In her role of Ripley she is at least the equal of any action star period. Her more hopeless attitude about the aliens in Resurrection is absolutely natural considering what she has been through and this obvious fact; these things will not die! It is not due just to the aliens but to the stupidity of human beings who cannot leave well enough alone.The other aspects of these films; the deluded scientists, the power mad bureaucrats, the tough crew members, the gloomy sets are all secondary to me. Frankly, I believe all of these elements are above average in quality for a film of this type. Even the peek a boo attacks by the aliens are not what really holds my interest.It is the fear of what abomination can get inside and emerge from us that brings me to these films and Resurrection has this in spades.",6,0,0,2 May 1999

Elizabeth," Blanchette makes a good historical film a great one
","Seeing the excellent film, Elizabeth, answered one question I had but left me with another. Elizabeth shows that a reasonably accurate historical dramatic film can be interesting and even exciting. This story in a way is a feminine contrast to Braveheart. Instead of blood and guts and nonsensical romantic situations, Elizabeth is always intelligent, subtle and clearly shows without distorting history that as a leader Queen Elizabeth was at least as capable as any man. I very much liked the director Shekhar Kapur's stylish use of having the camera look through gauze and scarves; an excellent metaphor (about people never being seen clearly for what they are) for the deception and conspiracy that surrounded the young Elizabeth. The sets, costumes and supporting cast are also top notch.My unanswered question is how could Cate Blanchette not have won the Academy Award for this role? This mystery about the Academy goes back a long time. For instance, have you ever seen a movie starring the actress Judy Holiday? I doubt it. Yet Ms. Holiday won the Academy Award in 1950 the same year as these two fantastic performances, Gloria Swanson (Sunset Boulevard) and Bette Davis (All About Eve). Incredible. Now, I have already praised Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love. Paltrow is developing her craft and may be a great actress someday but Blanchette is already there. Her acting in Elizabeth ranks with any female performance of an historical character on film.Simply, Blanchette makes a good movie a great one.",Null,0,0,2 May 1999
The Fifth Element," Great Euro Sci-fi
","Science fiction is supposed to include meeting strange creatures from other worlds and seeing events in the future but most of the characters in Sci-fi films sound and act like they live in California and just walked on the set. The Fifth Element is refreshing because it was made in Europe, with mostly European actors. Also, the costuming has a French fashion over substance look. All of this makes every scene seem out of the ordinary.
Now with this different background the plot is pretty routine, evil is going to destroy the world with a few more religious overtones added than usual. Bruce Willis turns in an expectedly good performance. Milla Jovovich plays a very off beat heroine well. Gary Oldman is an equally unusual villain. The special effects are good. There is plenty of humor throughout the movie and even though sometimes a joke misses (for instance with the mother of the Willis character) I found the movie fun. On top of all this there is plenty of shooting and explosions.  Now there is something about obnoxious characters. They don't bother me so much in a sci-fi movie. Hey, this is supposed to be different so why not weird characters. The Fifth Element has plenty of them including one named Ruby Rhod who makes over the top seem tame. I figure the circus is in town so I enjoyed the freak show. The Fifth Element shows that sci-fi can be stretched in unusual directions. I recommend it for those who truly want to go to different place and time.",9,1,2,11 November 1999
Blade," Old Blood, New Bottles
","Is there anything more ridiculous yet still fascinating than vampire movies? I cannot explain their almost 100 year old appeal but Blade is another in a long list which I enjoyed and here is why.First there is a style twist in Blade combining 40's film noir with vampire conventions. (In a much stranger way Dark City also tries for this kind of look.) Second, our vampire is the opposite of the usual sophisticated blood sucking aristocrat. Blade's central character is a Schwazenegger Terminator macho antihero except that Wesley Snipes can act. Add some martial arts, lots of shooting, vampire mumbo jumbo, gross zombies and you have an above average action film. There is a Ghostbusters apocalyptic subplot that I was able to ignore almost through the entire movie until it overwhelms the story. But soon that was finished and Snipes went on with being cool. Speaking of Snipes, he just oozes a menacing intensity. Coupled with Kris Kristofferson as the grizzled side kick and N'Bushe Wright as the damsel in distress and you have the foundation for Snipes to be his big, bad self.
Blade is basically an action film that has the right mix of movie styles to make it worth watching.",6,0,0,8 August 1999
Match Point," Woody Allen repeating plots
","I've seen many Woody Allen films and for some reason he is able almost completely rehash characters in one movie after another.In 'Manhattan' we have a character who's cheating because he can't control his passion. In 'Hannah and Her Sisters' we have a character who is cheating on his wife because he can't control his passion. In 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' we have the same thing, again a character who is cheating.So now I am supposed to be impressed with 'Match Point' because there is a character who's cheating on his wife? Well, I'm not.As for the earlier Woody Allen films, the cheating part was a subplot. There were different stories interwoven, sometimes with comedy, which made those movies more interesting. With 'Match Point', the cheating story is the entire film. I knew what was going to happen because this movie followed the pattern already set in the other films right up to the end.No other filmmaker is able to get away with this repetition. I was more than not impressed with this movie. I was frustrated.",3,3,5,7 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Return of the Jedi, the Weakest of the Star Wars Films
","It is never easy being openly critical of a Star Wars movie. So many people first saw them when they were very young which creates a do no wrong attitude. But after all of the comments putting down Phantom Menace, I felt the need to be straight about the weakest of the Star Wars movies, Return of the Jedi.The beginning of Jedi involving the rescue of Han Solo is pretty good. This is a direct continuation of the Empire Strikes Back and fits well with the other two original movies. After this Jedi falls apart. Why?1. The second half of Jedi is a straight rehash of the last half of A New Hope, in which the good guys need to blow up the evil Death Star. This direct repeat takes away from the suspense of the movie. 
2. The acting is very uneven; Han Solo may be the favorite character for many in A New Hope and Harrison Ford is probably the most talented actor with a major role in ROTJ but he often seems out of place playing this new kinder, gentler guy. When Solo finds out Leia's true relationship with Luke, Ford's acting is so bad that I laugh every time I see it. The acting between Fisher and Hamill at the end is also very weak.  3. The Ewoks are a joke; In A New Hope in scene after scene one thing that is established clearly is that the Storm Troopers are a lethal military force. The idea that 4 foot tall creatures with stone tipped spears and arrows could defeat 20 fully armored, blaster carrying Storm Troopers much less a legion of them is so incredible that it ruins the believability of the middle to the ending of the film.4. The light saber battle has a big problem; There is no way that Luke Skywalker could defeat Darth Vader the way it occurs in Jedi. Mark Hamill's slow and monotonous sword strokes are supposed to force Vader to his knees. There is no physical reason for Vader to do this. Some people try to argue that it was Luke's use of the Force that defeats Vader. But they forget that Vader's connection with the Force is so strong that he is able to defeat the power of the Emperor. Fortunately, Lucas tried to improve this film. An excellent example is how he changed the original silly ending of ROTJ with its lame music and Mark Hamill's corny smile. Lukas' redone final two minutes are powerful and have the right mood. But Lucas' real fixing of Return of the Jedi is Phantom Menace. Phantom's plot is in some ways similar to Jedi, (for instance, both films start out with a negotiation meeting) But there are variety and style changes in Phantom. The villains of Phantom Menace are always mysterious and the motives of the enemy are clouded in politics and manipulation. There are moments of deep sadness in Phantom that is not undercut by life after death plot twists. Qui-Gon Jinn and Anakin's mother are tragic characters which have no direct counterpart in the original movies. The acting in Phantom while not great, unlike Jedi, is always good. This is due to Lucas' use of established actors; Neeson, McGregor and Portman. The fact is Hamill and Fisher never were successful outside of Star Wars films. Also the young Harrison Ford in Star Wars while good, had not yet polished his acting skills. Unlike the Ewoks, the Gungans in Phantom, in spite of having cartoon elements, are very believable as fighters and as characters. First this is due to the computer animation which is very realistic. But also the Gungan technology while called primitive, their energy weapons, shields and underwater city show a group that can hold their own in Star Wars.
The sword fighting in Phantom Menace is the best I have seen in any film including Rob Roy. Every second of the light saber duels in Phantom feels like a real struggle especially when compared to the battle between Luke and Vader in Jedi.Jedi has its good points. While Phantom is a much more polished movie, it does not have the thundering climaxes of Jedi. Phantom has intrigue and sadness but it lacks the intense father and son struggle in Jedi.
Return of the Jedi has spectacular special effects. It appeals to younger children and it also tries to show a hero's story of final triumph in a fantasy, science fiction world. The beginning of the movie blends these elements well. The second half falls down due to poor acting, unbelievable characters and a routine plot.",9,0,5,29 July 1999
Notting Hill," Nice Guy Finishes First
","Notting Hill tries a few changes with the Romantic comedy formula which made things interesting. Interwoven with the romance are discussions about the pressures of fame, being a movie star and tabloid journalism. Then there is a role reversal. The woman is rich and powerful and the man is poor, acting almost like a saint. When does such a nice guy, well played by Hugh Grant, meet the girl? (Macho Alec Baldwin briefly shows up and frankly he would usually get Julia.) And Julia Roberts' character, half of the time I understood her problems and the rest of the time I thought she was a jerk. A difference from recent romantic comedies is that ending a relationship isn't just shaking hands and wishing each other luck. Part of the reason why it all works is because this is set in England. Politeness is more common there. Also the odd ball supporting characters are different just because they are English. Sometimes they didn't feel that natural but then again I don't live in London. There is some attempt to talk about our problems not being so important in the big scheme of things. I liked this but I got tired of Hugh Grant's character becoming a door mat after awhile. But then that gets straightened out too. My only complaint was that the ending (with too many close ups and songs) and its prediction of the future of our lovers, went on and on showing too much. A perfect ending is like As Good As It Gets where the couple finally kiss and go eat a pastry, leaving the rest to our imagination. Despite that complaint, I really enjoyed this film. I rooted for the nice guy, Hugh Grant, and he finished first.",8,0,0,21 November 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A Sci-fi Action Classic
","Terminator 2 has become the standard for sci-fi action films and it has not yet been surpassed. The backbone of T2 is its great script. It blends thrills and compassion better than any film I've seen. Obviously the terminators deal with most of the rough stuff but Linda Hamilton is a revelation. She is fiery, powerful and loving. The balance of action with human themes of faith, endurance, and sacrifice is almost perfect.While the special effects look a bit dated, the action scenes are still incredible. How they got trucks and helicopters to do these things still amazes me. It's inevitable with the success of The Matrix to compare these two films. The background stories of the two movies are very similar, machines take over the earth. Where T2 shines is that all of it's character's motivations make sense. The Matrix throws loads of comic book/cartoon images at you and then has characters do silly things. Lots of Matrix fans tout its Messiah themes but they are done in a very shallow way. Terminator 2 also deals with the theme of the prophet but it is more subtle and true. Linda Hamilton is just great playing this role until the end when Schwarzenegger steps in to make a final sacrifice.     While Arnold's acting limitations are well covered up, they are still there. And the cute lines like 'Hasta la vista baby' are over done. I also wish it were less violent. But I admit it seems almost mainstream compared to recent action films.  Why quibble about a few minor problems? Terminator 2 has a terrific performance by Linda Hamilton. It is amazingly an anti- war film, blending many positive values with the action. It is masterfully made and still looks incredible.",9,1,1,22 December 1999
Dark City," A Good Gothic Sci-fi Blend
","Writer, director, Alex Proyas, is in some ways like George Lucas. Proyas in Dark City borrows from 20 to 30 other films; mixes it together with style and polish and creates a very interesting science fiction experience. The foundation of Dark City is the German Expressionist films of the 1920's, Metropolis as well as early horror films from Universal Studios such as Frankenstein. All these influences give Dark City a very sharp black and white look with some terrific sets. The heart of the movie is a mystery and sometimes felt like a 1940's film noir detective story. The film also absorbs the paranoid sci-fi of the 1950's. Add a touch from Scanners and you have a plot that feels like a nightmare and yet has another interesting, deeper meaning.Dark City does not get bogged down with all of these images and ideas. The editing is sharp. The acting is often haunting. And the special effects are just right.Also like George Lucas, Proyas creates an interesting alternate world but I doubt if anyone would like to live there. Enjoying this film depends on how far you would like your mind stretched. Are you looking for a twisted experience like a David Lynch film or is the Truman Show as far as you care to go. If mentally traveling to an incredible often frightening place is what you want, then Dark City is your ticket.",8,0,1,31 May 1999
54," Studio Fifty Bore
","You would think that a movie about Studio 54 would focus on the life of Steve Rubel. But why make sense? This film is Boogie Nights meets disco. The stars are small time employees of Studio 54 who want to be famous but whose careers go nowhere. The film could have been about any famous disco club and it would not have changed the story very much. Boogie Nights did this story ten times better. In 54 the lives of our young struggling characters are not explored in any depth and the gaps in the story are huge. When a bus boy steals 10 thousand why isn't he fired? Instead Rubel's top financial assistant is fired for stealing the money but Rubel says later he knew she didn't do it. 54 seems to have half a script.As for the acting, the stars, Ryan Phillipe, Salma Hayek and Breckin Meyer just don't carry the film. Hayek is often terrible with her Elvis sneer. Phillipe and Meyer can go back to TV and won't be missed. My advice to Neve Campbell; stay away from bombs like this. The decent performances by Mike Meyers and Sela Ward give a hint that with a good script, competent actors and the same interesting sets, there could have been a good film here.
As Studio 54 plodded on, the dialogue became more ridiculous. I couldn't help but laugh at the Rubel welcome back party with Hayek in a terrible wig and Mike Meyers waving at our nobody main characters who he couldn't see 100 feet away and whom the real Rubel wouldn't have remembered. But then the best part of Studio 54 happened. This stinker ended.",3,2,4,25 November 1999
American History X," The Underbelly of America
","I was immediately struck by the power of this film, the violent images, the great performance by Edward Norton that just oozes hate. But as the rhetoric of anger and racism built up in the film, I became so uncomfortable I could not continue to watch it. So, this is not a true movie review. I did fast forward to scenes I could handle and the very gruesome ending.This is a very effective portrait of the skin head gang world. The process of how a person can change is also pretty well done considering that 3 years of prison time is compressed to a few scenes. Norton's acting is terrific in showing that transition. Also, the confusion and suffering of the Norton character's family is powerful. Avery Brooks' role is briefly allowed to be a sincere but pretty ineffective counter balance to all of the hate. With the exception of him and another African American in prison, all the African Americans in the film are grim and threatening. And this brings up a huge contradiction in the movie. The African American high school students shown are out of control and no one is really trying to stop them. But, the fact that there are a lot of African Americans in prison is clearly supported in the movie. Meaning, cops do pay attention to them and arrest them. American History X can't have it both ways. To reflect that reality there should have been a lot more police involvement with the young African American gang members. In a way American History X is an example of what it is trying to criticize. It stereotypes most young African Americans as mindless thugs, giving no solution to the gang problem partly justifying the hate that it supposedly is against.",5,0,1,11 December 1999
The Usual Suspects," A Solid but Typical Mystery/Thriller
","The Usual Suspects is a good mystery/thriller. There is fine acting, the script is clever and the film is well made. While there were not that many surprises for me because the movie was fairly mainstream, I had a good time watching it.The Usual Suspects works because of a great performance by Kevin Spacey and a script that has some good plot twists and hops around enough to different places and times which keeps the viewer off balance. Gabriel Byrne and Chazz Palminteri are also good in supporting roles.I said before that that there were not many surprises for me with this film. This is because The Usual Suspects follows some typical plot formulas for these types of movies done in the last few years. You know that the brightest person in the movie will be a criminal, the cops are corrupt and some crook will get away with the big crime. Since 1970 this has been repeated over and over. The flashbacks didn't confuse me much because of all the practice I've had watching Goodfellas, Pulp fiction and Out of Sight.
For me, I prefer the approach of The Godfather and Goodfellas with this type of film. This is mainly due to these Mafia movies being pretty well grounded in reality. While watching Usual Suspects I thought if these people were so clever, they would not be petty criminals.Overall The Usual Suspects is well worth watching. It is not great but it is certainly entertaining.",8,0,1,6 December 1999
Saving Private Ryan," A Technically Brilliant Film with a Mediocre Script
","No film in 1998 was more hyped by critics than this film. The First 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan does not disappoint. The editing, sound and camera work are so energized (combined with graphic violence) that the sense of being in battle is more real than any film I have seen. Also, Spielberg is the first director to use the grotesque violence of the Coen brothers and Tarantino  in a war movie where it actually feels more natural. All of this makes for some very thrilling moments. But while Saving P. Ryan is a technical tour de force its script is not of the high standard as the rest of the film.The main story (let's find our guy) is routine for a war film. So, the development of the characters is very important to make the movie work. In this regard Saving Private Ryan for the most part was mediocre. I did not feel connected to most of these characters. There was too little dialogue for them to be real. Many war movies deal with the squad under pressure. Eight Iron Men (1952) comes to mind as doing a better job of showing how people cope with this.Saving P. Ryan also presents us with the horrors of war. The best movie to confront this subject is Apocalypse Now. Saving P. Ryan by contrast to Apocalypse Now seems to have its morality upside down. The most interesting character in the film, the interpreter, learns that the best thing to do with prisoners is to shoot them. There is no adequate comment on this brutality in the movie.The effectiveness of a final scene is essential for a high quality film and the one in Saving P. Ryan falls apart. The emotion shown by the actors works but the dialogue makes little sense as the final message of the movie. Because the film almost ignores the big picture about why we fought World War 2, it tries to make some sense of the loss of so many lives on an individual level, by private Ryan himself. This cannot be done. The justification of war, if any, is a cause for the greater good; i.e. ending slavery or stopping the Nazis. There is no other way to make sense of war and Spielberg should have used these issues.Saving Private Ryan got what it deserved at the Oscars; the award for best direction, editing and some technical awards. It is very well made but has a script with too many flaws.",7,0,0,14 June 1999
Good Will Hunting," Abundance of interesting characters in a polished film
","I was very surprised at the variety and depth of the characters in the GWH script. (This is after all a Hollywood movie.) Several of them (Robin Williams, Minnie Driver and Affleck and his friends) could have been the center of their own movies.Also it is rare when a brat pack type of film does a good job handling adult issues, as was done with William's and Skarsgard's characters coming to terms with what is success, commitment as well as pride and jealousy.The therapist client relationship which can be so off base to be a joke as in the 'Prince of Tides' had a semblance of reality to it. The intense issue of child abuse was dealt with very briefly but in a fairly honest way.In a sense the story about the Matt Damon character being very bright was not that interesting to me. What I responded to were these characters trying to reach out and connect. This is overall a very polished package by the film makers, including fine acting - making GWH a positive experience.",7,1,4,27 December 1998
A Bug's Life," Art meets the Cartoon Again
","A few times in the history of animated movies you could say that one was a brilliant work of art. Fantasia comes to mind as best fitting that description. With A Bug's Life, the computer animation often felt like a living painting. Sometimes it was stunning. Along with the beauty, this is a fun family film. Pixar continues to capture a child's eye with this story. Things go from magical to silly very quickly. They have an excellent comic flair. This is best shown with the grasshopper bad guys. There are touching moments but always with a light touch.A Bug's Life will always be compared to Antz because they came out the same year and seem to have similar stories. But look deeper and they are very different films. Antz is Woody Allen's show surrounded by mediocre, muddy looking animation. A Bug's Life looks better. Antz's dialogue is really at an adult level. While A Bug's life continues the long Disney family tradition but updated in the Pixar way. I especially liked the circus act, Kevin Spacey as Hopper, the living scenery and the out takes at the end which are very clever. If animation appeals to you at all, see A Bug's Life.",8,0,0,19 November 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Sci-Fi work of art
","2001 is a science fiction film that does not fit into the usual sci-fi mold with predictable plots and aliens that either look human or are monsters. It begins with beauty and mystery. Kubrick's film is one of the most scientifically accurate sci-fi films I have seen. Space travel in the vacuum of space is always silent and going somewhere takes time, for instance it takes months to reach a planet.Kubrick's 2001 takes this approach and uses it to present huge themes; human evolution and contact with alien super intelligence, conflict between humans and computers. Almost all sci-fi films present human and space alien encounters as routine. Kubrick presents such contact as so strange that it is beyond our human comprehension. He puts you in several scenes with no explanation as an observer experiencing incredible events. You are left with questions. What is the monolith, the light show and the star child at the end of the film? There are answers but you have to search for them (such as by reading Arthur C. Clarke's '2001').Like all great films, Kubrick's suggests further questions; can alien intelligence reach the level of God? Will we destroy ourselves unless an alien intelligence helps us?2001 makes excellent use of symbolism. The movie's main musical theme is from Strauss's 'Also Sprach Zarathustra'. This is also the title of Nietzsche's poem about the emergence of the superman; the star child? or the monolith?. The bone rising from the violent ape-human becomes an orbiting nuclear weapon. Distrust and paranoia slowly builds between the U.S and Russians finally climaxing with the computer HAL.On top of all this the film's look is stunning. After 30 years it's sets and special effects are still up to today's standards. 2001 is one of the few films that can be called a great work of art.",10,0,2,17 January 1999
Toy Story 2," Amazingly Good
","It is very rare when an excellent movie is followed by an excellent sequel. Toy Story 2 has done just that. The blending of wonderful animation artistry, terrific writing and great voice overs continues thanks to Pixar. Lots of films claim to be appropriate for all ages and rarely are. I'd recommend this movie to adults with no children! Toy Story 2 is that clever.
Toy Story 2 has a great time making fun of itself and other movies such as Star Wars and Jurassic Park. The humor is constant and is simply right on. As Toy Story was a buddy picture, Toy Story 2 pokes fun of commando rescue films, as well as computer games and barbies. But as with Toy Story this is a film with a heart highlighting not only the friendship of the original group of toys but adding some interesting new ones too.Toy Story 2 is an escape into a rich and wonderful fantasy world. It is well worth a visit.",10,5,6,26 November 1999
There's Something About Mary," What Men Want and Then Along Comes Mary
","I am not a fan of most goofy comedies whether about teenagers or made for teenagers. But I gave Something About Mary a try at a movie theater and had a great time. There's a lot of something about what men want here. But raging hormones are not the center of the film. We have a sincere guy played well by Ben Stiller. His disasters in dating while hilarious have a sad truth too. But even better what makes it all work is the lead female character played perfectly by Cameron Diaz. She is oblivious about all the craziness around her which makes it all the more crazy.
I can handle some gross humor and the few jokes that were clearly in bad taste, I just ignored. Beyond this, everything is in the comic timing and story. Comedy is a very personal thing and to me this was a very funny film. Now I'm not saying it is great or that I would see it again. There is nothing too deep here. I had a good time and I'll leave it at that.",Null,0,0,12 November 1999
Life Is Beautiful," A Story of the Gift of Life
","Quite a debate has raged about the appropriateness of this somewhat comedic film that touches upon fascism and the Holocaust. How does a movie deal with such evil and tragedy which can easily offend an audience? The Pawnbroker (1965) touches upon such terrible experiences in a touching and yet harsh way through the pain of a Holocaust survivor. The death camp scenes in the Pawnbroker are at times not plausible but the emotion of the movie always rings true. Life is Beautiful is also centered on personal Holocaust experiences but the central character could not have been shown in the realistic way of the Pawnbroker. While the Pawnbroker deals with the anger and the trauma of a Holocaust survivor, Life is Beautiful asks the question, is there something more important than survival?Viktor Frankl, the noted psychiatrist who endured the death camps, saw those who chose to comfort others and though starving gave away their last piece of bread. While he praises these actions, Frankl also makes a chilling comment about such sacrifice. His simple statement speaks volumes, 'the best of us did not return'. This is at the heart of Life is Beautiful. How does a filmmaker even dare to touch such an explosive subject which casts such a harsh light on all of us and brings profound guilt? Roberto Benigni does the impossible by the use of fable, comedy and dream.Life is Beautiful first uses the style of the great comedian Charlie Chaplin who made the excellent film about Nazi persecution, The Great Dictator (1940). One reason why this film and Life is Beautiful are successful is that the evil of fascism is not discounted. Through the physical comic scenes we slowly see that the fascists without kindness or mercy have no heart or soul. The critics are partly right. Sometimes I felt uncomfortable with comedy in a death camp but these moments passed because this movie is more than just a comedy.The death camp story of Life is Beautiful is also a dream and a nightmare. Here Benigni often uses the style of Fellini very effectively to show the devotion between husband and wife as well as the hell of the final solution.Underneath the comedy and the dreams, in the end, this is a story of the gift of life from a father to son, a gift of life from one human being to another. In many details this is told through fantasy but as with the Pawnbroker, emotionally it rings true. The movie is a fitting tribute to those whose kindness could never be broken even in the death camps and who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Life is Beautiful is a timeless film that deserves every honor showered upon it. Bravo Roberto!",9,1,3,27 April 1999
Total Recall," Good Action Sci-fi and then there's Arnold
","Total Recall is in the tradition of several Alfred Hitchcock films about the wrongfully accused man. But it has a twist, a premise about memory and reality from the author Philip K. Dick which gives the movie a deeper message. But all of this is quickly overwhelmed by the action which is often very violent. The enjoyment of Total Recall depends upon whether you like that kind of thing. In the 90's this violent style has been copied many times. What I thought was overdone in 1990 (the violence) now feels more mainstream.Total Recall's mood is quickly set by the quick pace between scenes and powerful music. The most surprising thing is that director, Paul Verhoeven, gets a fairly decent performance out of Schwarzenegger (as long as you can put up with that accent). I actually believed that he fit into the scenes. Sharon Stone and a supporting cast of bad guys do a very nice job. As for the action, it is well choreographed and the editing is sharp. 
The first half of Total Recall which is on earth is pretty believable (except for Arnold's calm reaction after being shot at by his wife). The scenes on Mars are less convincing because the sets and some of the special effects don't look very real. Also, Arnold's acting limitations are allowed to show when he uses a hologram to play hide and seek with the bad guys.
Problems aside, Total Recall is a quality action film. It is also fairly good sci-fi (is it real or just a dream). If you enjoy this type of movie and can handle graphic violence, then I recommend it.",9,0,1,19 January 2000
Pulp Fiction," Mixed Bag
","Plenty of people love this movie. They rave about how original, cool and funny it is. I will admit that there is a lot to see in Avary and Tarantino's script including plenty of off beat cameo roles. I really liked Samuel Jackson's character. Not only was the performance excellent but the depth of what he was dealing with was very powerful. The rest of the movie I wasn't so happy with. Pulp Fiction has some original story ideas. But if you compare it to Goodfellas which also has flashbacks, slow motion and sick humor it doesn't look that original. But I will admit that the story in Pulp Fiction is done in a somewhat original way. Moving down from here we have the Bruce Willis role. It is very powerful but so graphically violent that like Blue Velvet it becomes too much after a while. Down from here we have Uma Thurman's part which I felt was filling time. I didn't think that much of Travolta either. As for the so called great humor, I did not laugh at the scene in the car which just about tells the story for me. Finally about Tarantino. If he is going to have a great career in this business, he will need to write dialogue in which every other line doesn't have the 'N' word and also where the climax of each scene isn't filled with buckets of blood. Without the shock value I wonder if he is that good. I thought Jackie Brown was only a little above average but better than Pulp Fiction.  Pulp Fiction presents a few effective, original moments and has a great performance by Samuel Jackson. Otherwise it piles on the violence, blood and racial slurs hoping to shock but turning out just to be overdone.",6,3,8,23 November 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Survival and Triumph
","A lot of The Shawshank Redemption points to one theme, never give up. We have a hero, will played by Tim Robbins, pitted against corrupt prison guards and an evil warden. We wonder how he will survive the oppressive prison system and the cruel inmates. This is pretty standard but what makes Shawshank special is the connection between the Robbins character and another inmate in the prison played by Morgan Freeman who also narrates much of the film. The relationship between these two is one of discovery not only of inner strength but also how strong a friendship can be.
Much of The Shawshank Redemption is mood and emotion. We feel terror, heat, boredom and anger. Every aspect of the movie is a quality piece of work to drive home the feelings of the story. The entire cast is very good in how they fit into this closed often horrible world. Along with this praise comes some criticism. In the middle of Shawshank I thought that the pace was too slow. I know we are supposed to see bored inmates but boring the viewer isn't the way to go. I won't give away the ending but it has a fantasy quality about it that just doesn't fit the very real nature of most of the movie. It's a Hollywood ending tacked on to a more serious film. The Shawshank Redemption is a quality effort and is a welcome change from the routine action, horror or romance junk food films that are mostly released today. It takes a hard view of life but also shows the unbending will of the human spirit.",9,0,0,24 November 1999
Blade Runner," Blade Runner (Director's Cut), My Favorite Sci-fi Film
","This review is about the Director's Cut version of Blade Runner which is superior to the original release with its muddled narration and fake ending. The Director's Cut transforms a good movie into a great one.
What are the most popular Sci-fi movies these days, Blade or The Matrix? You notice the trench coats, the dark sets and the hunting for the bad guys plot lines? In many ways these movies are pale imitations of Blade Runner. Movie fans are all excited about virtual reality plots with super intelligent machines. It's all in Blade Runner but in a much more serious way.
Underneath a classic police manhunt/detective story lies visions of the future from author Phillip K. Dick. The super intelligent future machines will be our slaves not our masters. They will be genetically based, created and sold by huge powerful corporations. The wealthy will live in luxury while most people live in dirty, over populated cities in a polluted environment. These are the basic premises of Blade Runner and frankly I think most people have trouble dealing with it because it is likely to happen. Matrix fans talk about sinister forces being in control of the world. Blade Runner makes it clear who these controllers will be.And the film goes deeper. To create synthetic human beings the creators must be able to program the 'replicant's' minds, that is control their reality. What is real or programming? The replicant does not know. It is virtual reality not in the arcade game world of The Matrix. Blade Runner predicts that science will be able to alter memories and thus reality. If a Corporation can alter a replicant's memories why not those of a naturally born human being? This issue is powerfully shown in Harrison Ford's scene at the piano which is covered in family photos, the symbol of memories.And the film goes deeper still. If 'machines' are at least as smart as us, have feelings and are self aware, do they not deserve our respect and have rights? The tortured lives of two replicants illustrate this; Roy, the leader of the small slave revolt and Rachel, the pathetic female who does not know what she is and is later emotionally crushed by the truth.
Blade Runner is more than a collection of ideas or a sharply accurate prediction of the future. It is a technical tour de force. These are the best sets (along with the many costumed extras) I have seen in a movie which truly create another world. The special effects, which are used to make this future more real, are very good. And the 'realism' continues; How many typical Sci-fi heroes get hurt? In the typical Schwazenegger and now Matrix tradition the hero can get shot at by ten thousand bullets and not get a scratch. Blade Runner rightfully ignores this nonsense. Harrison Ford has to hunt down 3 very dangerous creatures and he gets hurt doing it! What a concept!  It has been said that science fiction is mostly not about science but about fantasy. Blade Runner ignores this trend. It is very real and is masterfully crafted to create this reality and future. It is a grim prediction and is why this movie has never been a big hit, too much reality probably. I wouldn't have it any other way. Blade Runner is a brilliant film that has the depth to keep me coming back to it again and again.",10,0,0,5 November 1999
The Matrix," A Mediocre Sci-Fi Rehash
","I can understand how the Matrix was so successful. With lots of gun shots and explosions per minute, good special effects, stylish actors and a few solid sci-fi ideas what more could you ask for?Let's begin with some original plot ideas. My problem I guess is that I have seen a lot of sci-fi movies and TV shows. So, basic plot retreads do not excite me. The beginning of The Matrix starts out like Scanners (1981) introducing people who have incredible powers. Then it shifts to the virtual reality, world is illusion, phase (done at least 50 times on the various Star Trek series and Virtuosity, 1995; Strange Days, 1995, etc.). Then comes the machines take over humanity surprise (Star Trek First Contact-the Borg and Terminator 2). The rebels in the Matrix are looking for a Messianic leader (check out the original Terminator). How about showing some original style? I recommend Dark City (1998) which accomplishes this very well. The Matrix is a blend of Blade (1998) and Terminator 2. We have acrobatic actors firing machine guns in slow motion, big deal. Does the plot make sense? Sometimes, but it is very inconsistent. The idea that the machine/bad guys would fight with guns in the virtual reality world is absurd. This is a computer controlled reality after all of the 22nd century. Why limit yourself to clunky guns? How about some decent dialogue? The love interest in this film is a joke. Trinity's (Carrie-Anne Moss) lines at the end of the film are terrible. You want an excellent heroine? Try Linda Hamilton in the Terminator films. Between the posing and posturing and the fight scenes what is being said by the crew most of the time is pretty lame. You want to see good scenes of a crew under pressure? Try the first two Alien movies.What is there to like about The Matrix? The editing, sound, camera work, stunts and computer graphics are good. Lawrence Fishburne turns in a fine performance as usual. Also, all of the action and special effects are able to cover for Keanu Reeves who turns in a flat performance as usual. Briefly, in the middle of the film when the pace slowed in a scene with the 'oracle' the characters and plot became a bit more interesting. But then it was lock and load time.What really bothers me about The Matrix is that this mediocre retread is rated higher by imdb members than these great films; Blade Runner (1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 which is outrageous. The Matrix does not belong in the top 200 movies. This will take care of itself in a few years because this oracle predicts that by 2010 hardly anybody will care about this film.",9,0,0,25 September 1999
Casino," Builders and Losers of Tinsel Town
","What if you had all your wishes come true and then lost everything? Casino winds its way through a rags to riches to rags story better than any movie I have seen. It is a dream becoming a nightmare.In some ways Casino is better than Goodfellas and in others it is similar. This similarity could be seen as a drawback but for me Casino is the sequel to Goodfellas. Both are based on true stories about the mob written by Nicholas Pileggi and are an achievement that can only be compared in quality to The Godfather 1 and 2.  The magnificent opening of Casino shows Martin Scorsese using a more grand style. The wide open vistas of the desert are contrasted with the neon world of the gambler and the old neighborhood of the mob bosses. Robert De Niro is very effective in being the 'rational' one who pleads that if everybody just follows the 'rules' they would all be winners. His irrational equal (including in acting ability) is Sharon Stone who will not be tamed and helps to bring the whole house of cards down. In the Godfather films and in Goodfellas there are winners as well as losers. Casino is about losing it all.I felt Pesci's limitations were shown in the 'romantic' scenes between him and Stone. Still, I can't think of anyone else who can do a better job playing a ruthless thug. And this drawback was more than made up by the excellent James Woods as the slimy boyfriend. Great stuff.
Casino juggles success, corruption, vicious violence and farce in a broad sweep that never fails to impress. It's tale of destruction in some ways leads to sympathy. For these characters are like children who can never learn. They can never see the cause of their downfall, themselves.",9,1,1,30 November 1999
Ran," Classic Story of Betrayal
","Ran (or Chaos) is a brilliant film. For some, there are a few obstacles to its enjoyment. It takes place at the time of the Samurai and it's subtitled since it is in Japanese. If that is ok, (it was fine with me) then you can look forward to a powerful tale of intrigue and betrayal. Speaking of the story, while it is based on Shakespeare (King Lear), it contains lots of action. And unlike some movies based on his work, Ran is very easy to follow. The first thing you notice about Ran is the style of the camera work. The scenery is often beautiful and Kurosawa uses powerful telephoto lenses to interestingly compress distance. The plot begins to unfold about an arrogant Lord and his three sons. It seems like a simple family squabble but the family members are often not what they seem. Everyone believes they know what is happening but almost no one understands the danger they are all in.
The castles, battle scenes and the costumes are tremendous. I especially liked the quiet moments. For in every silence, a terrible event was beginning to unfold. The performances by the brothers are good. The Lord played by Tatsuya Nakadai is outstanding. But it is Mieko Harada playing Lady Kaede who steals the show.Ran vividly shows how fragile family and sanity are. It is a paranoid vision where anyone can do harm. Yet, it is all glossed over by the polished customs of the traditional Japanese world which increases the story's intensity. There are good people in Ran. They cling to their faith. But they are at the mercy of the arrogant, who are blind to the need to work together, to make any society work. No other film illustrates the need for cooperation at every level better than Ran.",10,1,3,26 November 1999
The Thin Red Line," Voices From the Front
","The Thin Red Line is the most ambitious war film since Apocalypse Now. It is a complex web of voices from various people involved in the Guadalcanal invasion in the Pacific during World War 2. It is brutal and beautiful. It is real and fanciful. It is a tremendous accomplishment for 2 hours but it lasts 45 minutes longer than that.  Written and directed by Terrence Malick, much of the story is poetry, dreams and beautiful photography of native peoples in gorgeous countryside. But there is a war here with the beauty and it is shown in all its horrible brutality. And under all this, the politics and ambition of the officers in charge is shown making and resisting brutal decisions. All of this flows together giving a bit of the experience of this war.Looking at all of this, The Thin Red Line is an incredible juggling act but sadly after 2 hours the story loses its way. Once a main character finds out that his wife wants to leave him, the flow of the story stops. The plot stops, we no longer know how current scenes fit with the beginning and middle of the movie. This main character who beautifully dreams of his wife, comments on war, life, humanity is the heart of the film. Without him the film limps along at the end left with disjointed thoughts and images. The movie may be a half hour too long (the thoughts of the characters become repetitive and artificial after a while) but I would not have a clue about how to end it sooner because there is no real ending, it just fades away.
The Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan both ambitiously make comments on war. Yet for my taste they do not improve on Platoon or Apocalypse Now. For a World War 2 film it may be better to see something like Midway which plays the story straight and better represents a much more simple, trusting and patriotic time. In spite of my criticisms I recommend seeing The Thin Red Line because of its comments on love, life, death and brutality. It is a filmed poem for the most part that challenges the audience and that is quite a rarity with movies these days.",8,0,0,6 November 1999
Jackie Brown," Routine crime story with good acting
","Tarantino does a good job with Jackie Brown. There is action, some plot twists with cool music, quality directing and editing. I had only one problem. I recently saw Out of Sight (another film based on an Elmore Leonard novel) which was equally good in all these areas but had a much more interesting and unusual story.With its routine plot, Jackie Brown never left me in suspense or surprised me but I still enjoyed it. I owe this to its fine performances. Pam Greer is solid in the title role as the victim calling the shots. Samuel Jackson is terrific but may I suggest please lose the strange hair (which seemed left over from Deep Space Nine). But my favorite performance is by Robert Forster. He is tough and street wise but surprisingly he is not macho at all. Other supporting roles by Michael Keaton and Bridget Fonda were just fine. The actors left me very pleased with Jackie Brown but besides that, the movie is just ok.",6,1,1,2 May 1999
Contact," Falling Short in the Imagination Department
","Contact is loaded with scenes of a heroine, an astronomer played by Jodi Foster, fighting against great odds for the 'truth' that some alien civilization is just itching to communicate with us. Foster's character is so perfect, she is revered like a priestess. There is little else in Contact that is explored in depth much beyond this holy quest of the Foster character.Besides being too perfect, I say the Foster character is holy because the rest of the world in this film is filled with spiteful, small minded and just weird people. Rival scientists lack vision. Government officials are penny pinching liars who go from disbelief to let's nuke the aliens. Religious leaders want to suppress the truth. And the general public? The public at large are portrayed as a mass of howling primates who blindly flock from one big event to another. In this mass of humanity religious followers from New Age to traditional get to be trashed in broad strokes as mindless fools singing and dancing in some trance. Finally, Contact claims there are super rich folks living in airplanes flying around the world or in outer space just waiting to meet alien species.With all of these extreme stereotyped characters and the circus atmosphere, I am reminded of a satire such as Mars Attacks or a tongue in cheek sci-fi disaster yarn like Independence Day. But Contact wants to be taken seriously. This is Carl Sagan's story after all.Well, the film briefly tries to create a meaningful relationship for Foster with the character played by Matthew MacConaughey. But soon MacConaughey's role also becomes paper thin as he becomes the comforter to the persecuted Jodi who is like Joan of Arc on trial.All of this would be forgivable if there was a serious consideration of what our involvement with an alien species would mean. Excellent films that deal with this topic include 2001 and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Here is where Contact falls flat. In an overly explained series of scenes mirroring 2001 Foster sort of meets an alien then quickly returns to earth. Foster's experience is like a dream. Who are the aliens and what would contact with them mean to us? The movie doesn't go there. There is a vacuum of ideas here as empty as space. The story simply goes back to Foster being the persecuted noble scientist.Out of all of this, the final message of Contact is that fundamental scientific research, that has little immediate practical value, requires faith. It is like a religious philosophy in a way with one difference being that we are supposed to fund it with tax dollars. Considering all of this, there is very little I can say in praise of the movie besides that Foster's acting is good as always and that technically the film is well made.The whole movie felt like a fund drive on public television, 'give money to the poor scientists'. If Contact is one big ad for astronomy research at least make alien contact more interesting. And finally, to create a noble character you do not have to belittle the rest of the world.",6,3,7,19 June 1999
