Skyfall," Back in action again, with some pleasure
","After 50 years since the first, Dr. No, everyone knew that Skyfall, wisely picked this time to be released not 2 years but 4 since the last one, was going to be an event, and by all accounts, it was. Anticipated by one of the best themes in all 007 movies, apparently made in 10 min by Adele, which seems a bit odd. But once the most famous character in cinema wore off, did the odd-job still have anything to add to the franchising? The answer is yes, Dr. Yes, with pleasure. One of the things about 007 Daniel Craig era is that the hero is no longer a superhero and the superhuman spy is after all very human. Sam Mendes, a gifted director, explored that nicely. With the addiction of 3 great actors: Ben Whishaw, Ralph Fiennes and, of course, Javier Bardem that again and again delivers the goods. Sam and his writers saw what any fan of the secret agent feels: the decay of Bond girls (anyone can recall the last greatest bond girl?) For years and years fans wanted the films to be more explicit. Make no mistake this isn't classic vintage 007 style club. That said, while this is still a 007 film, much of the credit goes for the clever way the writers tried to cover that fact, creating a virtual 007 with epic tones, an agent caught between the old-fashioned ways and the modern ones, being this interaction hugely a high point. In fact, Sam Mendes adds some splendid cinematographic details all over the place, you can tell this is a guy who spent much time, apart from his career, digging into movies. Unfortunently, the story isn't that amazing, still original in 007 catalog yet not so strong compared to the previous 2, nevertheless despite the excellent directing and solid performances, the script goes plain and simple in one way only. After 2h of quickly delivered scenes there's only one place left: Skyfall. The expanded Skyfall treatment sees some powerful imagery that will appeal too all kinds of audience. Largely held by Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig and nobody does it better. The image quality, as expected, is excellent, allowing the viewer to experience every detail of a Bond mixed into the past and the present. The dislocated island and the final set should impress those unfamiliar with 007 and surely thrill longtime fans. The famous Bond's shots are still here. The script didn't allowed more humor, that surely be welcome, but this is a very small quibble about the secret agent in our century. It's a fine testament to a timeless 007 that doesn't sound dated, on the contrary this the best era singe Roger Moore and finally back in action again, in the right place this time. This film plays great whether you're a fan of James Bond, the actors, or not. (On a minor but no less important note, John Barry should be included in the movie opening, not to mention in the ending credits. After all Thomas Newman did use Barry's music.)",7,4,8,6 January 2013
The Secret in Their Eyes," Eyes inspire a masterpiece
","Not entering in opinions or specific details about the movie itself, I believe the surprise has a key role (as happened to me) and very probably there will be enough comments about that. This movie deserves all the credit and will be so flattering to have received an Oscar (talking about the current state of things, of course )? I doubt it. The truth is that it has everything you want, either for fun (with a certain humor that often sprinkle here and there , and the inherent suspense as the events will ocurre, never dropping from beginning to end) or to approach a seriously theme and truthful to some extent (and here play two things: the real drama of the matter of the main story and the passionate romance involving it in parallel), and more than expected also. Plus the fact that it contains excellent works on all levels, from the cast and speech to backstage and makeup, from the script and adaptation to audio and beautiful classical soundtrack, from photography to camera work.. Honestly, I can not point out anything negative. It's so catchy and touching in a way that 2h will seem like half, even less. If perfection exists in modern crime/drama filmaking then El Secreto De Sus Ojos is certainly at the top or very close to it and has all the features to become a timeless film.",7,4,8,19 July 2010
