The Blair Witch Project," Overrated and avoidable
","We had a website devoted to it, trailers, magazine articles, and superfluous information about it, so when this film finally arrived on these shores it was not going to have the same effect as when it opened in America. Shot with video cameras on a minuscule budget, the film is about an asinine trio of film students who decide to go into the woods and make a documentary about the myth of the Blair Witch. Led by the bossy and foul-mouthed Heather (who seems to use the 'F' word in every sentence) along with her two geeky-type male associates, they get lost and are stalked by an unseen witch/spirit/whatever it is, notice the word unseen, we never see anything only sets of twigs made into a strange symbol and the tent moving, and we hear lots of strange noises at night. At first the amateurish camera style works but soon becomes tiresome as the trio constantly bicker. The ending is also unsatisfactory. The film has broke box office records and good luck to it, but when you have seen it you feel letdown. There was howls of derision at the cinema when I saw it, and that was from a lot of people. An overrated disappointment. Don't believe the hype.",1,2,3,9 November 1999
Requiem for a Dream," Bleak, blistering, powerful, not to be watched by those who feel depressed
","This is not an easy film to watch, even on your best of days. It is a very depressing tale of a woman Sara (Ellen Burstyn, in a brilliant performance) and her son Harry (Jared Leto). Both are addicted to drugs of some sort. Sara to diet pills, Harry to the hard stuff. Harry's girlfriend and best friend are also addicts. They all have their dreams, which are fading away. The four characters are spiraling downwards into an abyss. The film uses many different visual techniques to get its message across. The soundtrack adds a melancholic feel to the film. The last reel is painful to watch. The final scenes are intensely depressing. A crescendo of quick flash images of kick you in the face despair. This film should be watched by everyone who is thinking about taking drugs, because after watching this film, you'll think twice about it.",8,0,0,25 February 2001
Fight Club," An energetic, stylish & ambiguous journey through mayhem
","I am Jack's Fight Club movie review.When I first saw this at the cinema I liked it, but didn't quite absorb it all. After watching it several more times on DVD, I have now discovered how good it really is. The opening trip through the brain is amazing. The film quickly gathers pace and never lets up, as we listen to Jack the narrator, played by Edward Norton. He describes his life has having all the material things, a nice condo, nice furniture, he doesn't have any monetary worries. But Jack needs something different to enliven his life.After going to many health help groups to seek solace for his insomnia, he meets a bold character in Tyler Durden (played with relish by Brad Pitt), a soap salesman who becomes friendly with Jack. One night outside a bar, the two guys decide to have a fight, what the heck it's different they say. After this initial scrap, the two guys start their own underground fight club, and the membership expands rapidly. It seems there are many young men out there who want to fight. After some brutal fight scenes, Tyler starts Project Mayhem, whose purpose is to disrupt corporate buildings, and to generally cause mayhem.The other pawn in the film is Marla Singer, played by Helena Bonham Carter, who sleeps with Tyler and annoys Jack. The distrust between Jack and Tyler finally erupts into a frenzied finale, as the the surprising outcome is revealed. The film throbs with energy, style and an enigmatic spirit. After Seven and The Game, Fight Club reinforces David Fincher as a talented director.I am Jack's The End.",10,0,1,5 July 2000
Memento," An unusual thriller that will keep you guessing
","This is an odd film that is told from back to front. Leonard Shelby, or Lenny has most folks call him, is a former insurance investigator whose wife was killed during a burglary at their home (or was she?) Lenny is on the trail of the killer(s). During the burglary, Lenny was hit on the head, and now suffers from short term memory loss. He can't remember anything from minutes away even. During his investigation he comes across the suspicious Teddy, a cop (or is he?) who seems a bit over eager to help Lenny. There's Natalie, a shady woman who works in a bar, but can he trust her? And also Dodd, who wants Lenny dead. Lenny is manipulated by these characters, and it is up to him to decide who the culprit is. He uses tattoos on his body, and photographs to help him to determine this. This film will keep you guessing all the way through, and even at the end and afterwards, you'll be discussing it with others. Then you'll want to watch it again.",10,2,4,9 January 2001
American Psycho," A darkly humorous and ambiguous satire
","Patrick Bateman is a twenty seven year old wealthy businessman, who resides in a modern chic apartment. He grooms himself with skin lotions, and likes to look his best. But he is not satisfied, because he likes to kill people. An old tramp, prostitutes, and a fellow worker(or does he?) The film is laden with little clues, and the ending makes you think. Bateman can't hide his guilt, but nobody seems interested that he kills people. It is a satire on the eighties, including some good music from that decade, Bateman giving us some info on his favorite artists of the time. There are not many graphic scenes, but one where Bateman is running after a hooker in his apartment with a chainsaw stands out. Christian Bale is perfect as Bateman, suave and softly spoken, and believable as the deranged killer. It's also darkly amusing. One to watch.",8,0,2,25 April 2000
Being John Malkovich," Remarkable, extraordinary, and a refreshing diversion from the usual bland and lifeless stuff
","This is a unique and original film to watch, and not like many others. John Cusack is good as Craig Schwartz, a struggling puppeteer who gets a job on the seven and a half floor of an office building, and discovers a portal to access actor John Malkovich. Cameron Diaz plays his wife Lotte, and Catherine Keener is good as his co-worker Maxine. They decide to charge people two hundred dollars for the pleasure of visiting Mr Malkovich, but he soon finds out, and the scene when he himself goes through the portal is amazing, and the best scene in the film. The scenes when Craig and Lotte are inside Malkovich reminded me slightly of the final segment of Woody Allen's Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex....But Were Afraid To Ask, when a group of people are inside a man's body controlling him, and also the movies Fantastic Voyage and Innerspace came to mind also. But this is far better than those films. John Malkovich is also good playing himself with a soft spoken voice. Bizarre, funny, different, it's nice to see that some original and worthwhile films do appear every now and then. Watch it again and again.",8,0,0,11 April 2000
The Elephant Man," A moving and touching look at compassion and acceptance
","The film begins with a hazy scene of a woman being trampled by an elephant and a baby crying, then quickly switches to the dark and dreary location of Victorian London, and a freak-show where there is a commotion. We see all the faces of spectators, aghast and appalled by their viewing of a particular freak. A doctor passing by notices this and investigates further, and eventually sees the freakish man. That scene is one of the best not only in this film, but in all of film. The tear rolling down the cheek of the doctor, played brilliantly by Sir Anthony Hopkins, is very touching. The doctor decides to take the man to his hospital to look after him and teach him. The rest of the cast are all exemplary, with Freddy Jones as the freak-show owner and Sir John Gielgud as the head of the hospital, and John Hurt Oscar-nominated as the Elephant Man, with also the make-up effects being excellent. The Oscar-nominated direction by Lynch is perfect, too. Some of the early scenes have a feel of Eraserhead, with the film being black and white and the drab location with all the industrial steam, and the sound also being perfect. The ending is like a salvation with a look into the stars and the heavens. It is an exquisitely crafted, touching tale of human compassion. A masterpiece.",10,0,0,4 January 2000
The Game," A superb, tortuous and suspenseful thriller
","The Game is a tortuous and superb suspenseful thriller by David Fincher. The film leads the viewer down many uncertain paths, has we follow the nightmare world in which Michael Douglas' character is thrown into. Douglas is good as Nicholas Van Orton, a very wealthy businessman who has everything, except true happiness and excitement in his life. He lives alone in a large mansion, and is tended to by his trusty long-serving female maid. We soon learn his father committed suicide by jumping from the top of the mansion. Van Orton occasionally has flashbacks of the tragedy.On his 48th birthday Nicholas is paid a visit by his younger brother Conrad, played by Sean Penn. Over dinner, Conrad gives Nicholas a gift, an invitation to visit Consumer Recreation Services (CRS) to enrol for The Game, an ambiguous life-altering event that Conrad says has changed his life. He tells Nicholas that it will make his life fun. Nicholas visits CRS and is greeted by James Rebhorn. He fills in a long application form, which asks him many obscure questions. He then has to endure more examining, a medical, and sitting through some bizarre images shown on a film.
The next day Nicholas receives a phone call to inform him he has failed the test for The Game; but unknowingly to him, The Game will now begin. Things immediately start to go wrong for him. His pen leaks ink on his shirt, and his briefcase won't open. While at a restaurant, he has wine spilled on him by a waitress named Christine (sexy Deborah Kara Unger) she is then fired by her boss, and Nicholas receives a note to follow her. While with her, he finds himself locked in a lift, has to run from a police dog, and has to jump from a fire escape into a garbage skip.This is just the start of The Game for Nicholas. He will later find himself with incriminating photos and cocaine in his hotel room. He will find himself trapped in a taxi that is sinking. He will wake up in a flimsy wooden coffin in Mexico, with no money and identification on him. A man who was once powerful is now transformed into an emotional wreck. Eventually, he has to find the man who interviewed him for The Game, James Rebhorn. He enters CRS with a loaded pistol, and takes Christine hostage. The conclusion is slightly incredulous, but fittingly appropriate. The Game is a ride you'll want to take again.",10,0,2,15 December 2000
Pi," Dark & Enigmatic
","Max Cohen is a mathematical genius. He can instantly calculate any sum he is asked. He is fascinated by numbers. He is on the verge of uncovering a code related to the stock market. Others are interested in his findings; a Kabbalah sect, who think he is discovering numbers related to their holy text, and a powerful Wall Street film are on his trail. All the while, Max is being enveloped by his own paranoia and delusion with the world. Shot in black & white, this is an effective first feature from Aronofsky.",8,1,2,4 December 2000
Mulholland Drive," Mystery, abstract, arcane, sublime
","I have just returned from seeing Mulholland Drive for the first time. It's been a long wait for it to show at a cinema relatively close to me in England, and it was worth the wait. It's a film that is best watched than described (most of you will have seen it anyway), so I'll keep this as brief as I can because there's so much to discover for the first (and second)-time spectator. It's a film that is at first, and for quite a way through it, seemingly straightforward. Straight from the opening sequence there are some of the many clues in the film. A group of young people are dancing and then three whitened figures are projected onto the dancers. This is relevant. The main narrative follows a beautiful lady who we first see in the back seat of a limo at night. The car stops and a man in the car produces a gun. The limo is then hit by a speeding car. The lady stumbles from the wreckage and later finds herself at a house where she meets a budding actress who has come from Ontario, and who met an eccentric old couple on her flight. The lady from the limo is suffering from amnesia and the aspiring actress is to help her discover her identity. There are many other adjuncts - a man in a diner tells another man about a strange figure he has dreamt of who resides behind the diner (who we then see). There's a comical scene involving a hit man. A film director with an unfaithful wife is being leaned on by some executives who insist that a certain actress must appear in his film. There's a mysterious and menacing figure called the Cowboy (not dissimilar to the Mystery Man in Lost Highway). There's more, there's much more. It's during the last reel when the main narrative twists and the film delves into deeper ambiguous territory. There's an arcane box (similar to the one in Buñuel's Belle du Jour). The curtains, sparks of electricity, sound and smoke are classic Lynch. The atmospheric music by Angelo Badalamenti (who also appears in a scene involving an espresso and a napkin) is as accomplished and appropriate as ever. I don't want to say anything else except to recommend that those of you who haven't seen it do so as soon as possible. This is a treat for fans of surreal films. I'm looking forward to seeing it again soon and purchasing the DVD.",10,1,2,16 January 2002
The Evil Dead," A classic low budget horror flick tinged with humour
","This is the first feature film from Sam Raimi and was foolishly added to the original video nasties list. It was made on a low budget with great flair and includes some great animated special effects and unique camera shots. The story is about a group of young college folks who travel into the woods in Tennessee to visit a log cabin, while there they discover an old book and unleash its evil spirit. It is not long before the folks start to be possessed by the spirit and it is left to a guy named Ash (amusingly played by Bruce Campbell) to be the hero and save the day. One of the great low budget horror films.",Null,0,1,16 February 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Lucid, violent and exquisite
","This controversial film from the early seventies is still profound and effective today. Malcolm McDowell gives a good performance as Alex De Large, a sadistic and violent ruffian who leads his gang of Droogs from one violent episode to the other until he is caught. He is then sent to an institution for a radical treatment to cure him. This is a very stylish and quintessentially English film. The sets are lucid and impressive, the electro music and the classical Beethoven is good, and if you are English you will recognise most of the actors. It is a who's-who of English actors on show. It is a provoking, violent, well-made and memorable film. Essential viewing.",10,0,0,30 November 1999
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," A powerful and perturbing film that deserves to be seen
","This is a notorious and infamous film that has been unavailable in the UK for a long time. The BBFC have finally passed the film uncut. I watched the film for the first time last night and it was an experience. I've watched a lot of graphic disturbing films down the years and this is certainly one of the more indelible ones. It was director Pier Paolo Pasolini's final film before his death. The film is based on the Marquis de Sade's novel 120 Days of Sodom, and is set in the Fascist Republic of Salo, Italy in 1944. A group of young people (eight boys and eight girls) are selected by a group of perverted Fascists and taken to a secluded mansion. While there, the group of youngsters are given rules, which they must stringently abide to, otherwise the consequence is death. The group are naked most of the time in the main room. A woman reads out a perverse sexual story, which is then acted out on a member of the group. These depraved acts include rape, whippings and eating excrement. This continues until the final stages, when the group are taken into a courtyard, and we see the horrific graphic torture perpetrated on them. A powerful, perturbing film that focuses on the ugly debased side of humanity, and one that deserves to be seen.",10,1,6,10 April 2001
