Skyfall," Critics Loved ,Bond Fans fans not satisfied
","I do not want to give a huge review on this , straight to the point this movie not up to the mark I went to the theater with lot of anxiety but it did not have the expected action sequences and gripping episodes unlike the Bond films in this movie the director concentrated more on drama perhaps it have 50 years of bond film he might want to make a bond film with lot of direction values just like a classic movie, however i wont recommend this movie to the how are expecting great action episodes and romance.Come to the movie, at the opening scene with an action episode as usual but it became lot slower.YOU CAN DARE TO WATCH IT FOR ONE TIME",6,7,17,3 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," It is a re-remake of Spider Man
","'The Amazing Spider-Man' I was really excited to watch this since first look of this movie,when i watched the trailer it seems to me that it has good expectations.I just watched this movie it has very good technical crew you have to appreciate the entire team.Firstly the directed Mark Webb has done a great job regarding the script work .He comes out with an experiment to make this Spider Man though people have seen the Spider Man before.The core part of this movie is screenplay,and the treatment of Spider Man character it was very cheeky and fun mixed way not very seriously designed.Andrew Garfield did very well,and Emma Stone as well she looks very clean 'cheeks'.When you watch this in 3d it would feel you great,and very exciting also.The producers has to be admired for those selection because they believe in the script even though The Spider Man was done in the past.I would say this is much better than the first Spider Man but there should have been more thrilling in the action sequences.",6,9,20,29 June 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Best & Beautiful Animated Movie Ever..!!!
","'Most Fantabulous animated movie I have ever watched' I told myself a lot of times while I was watching the movie and could not stop myself praising the entire crew of the film. The animated locations were amazing and mouth-watering ha..ha.. This movie will take you to the dream land that you will never find even in your dreams, believe me.The characters are pretty cute and funny trust me you will not get disappointed after you watching Wreck-It Ralph.The way Rich Moore handled the script was great I am sure that he would not get any script better than Wreck-It Ralph in the future, he did not miss any emotions like Happiness, Emotional scenes and excitement in the entire movie.Finally I had a great treat with Wreck-It Ralph Thanks to the Director..",10,4,5,15 February 2013
