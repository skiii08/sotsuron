Kill Bill: Vol. 2," vol.2 the western
","Okay I admit that I loved vol.1, and that I was disappointed with vol.2 but you have to appreciate that as a separate film it is different than the first thus feeling less of a rip off (Take the 'Boogeyman' sequel for instance). The first was an eastern action-adventure and the second - an all out spaghetti western.     Sure I would love to see a complete one volume version where all the action is more evenly paced (maybe the dvd version). I would recommend this but I would also warn that it is not as fast paced as the first. On a lighter note there is some really funny bits (especially with Pei Mei) and the fight scenes (as short as they are) are still quite watchable complete with a suitable ending. There are still some questions unanswered, but hey that might be resolved in vol. 3?",7,0,1,25 April 2004
Star Trek," finally, a frontier
","Before I drone on about the highly impressive special effects or the interesting storyline, I must give a special mention to the performances of the new cast to the Enterprise. Chris Pine makes Kirk his own, retaining the womanising overconfident captain (to be) that Shatner before him built up, but also managing to make him fresh and new. The much waited for 'Kobiashi Maru test' scene sees Pine doing a good impression of Shatner's Kirk though, complete with stilted dialogue. Zachary Quinto has Spock completely nailed, even early on when he is still between being Human and Vulcan. Karl Urban though has to be my favourite, after seeing his performance as 'Bones' I can imagine no-one else in the role (Dammit Jim i'm a doctor man, not an actor) DeForest Kelly would be proud. His performance doesn't seem like a simple impression either, he simply is... Dr McCoy. Anton Yelchin is fine as Chekov (Didn't join the original crew until the second season I believe) giving a somewhat sincere yet funny performance ('Wictor Wictor' not 'Victor Victor'). Zoe Saldana is a sexy Uhura and a fine tribute to Nichele Nichols, but who finally gets the kiss with Spock that Nichols' Uhura was supposed to get in the 60's.Sulu has never been so exciting as John Cho's edition, well not since the Undiscovered Country anyway. Simon Pegg's Scotty is highly amusing (I am still curious as to what true Scot James Macavoy would have done with the part) and as with all the cast, they all confidently make the roles their own. Eric Bana's Nero is what Nemesis' Shinzon should have been, but both have been underwritten, I think a bit more time should have been donated for more nasty fun with Nero... perhaps taunting Captain Pike or the crew of the enterprise (think of the memorable taunting in Wrath of Khan and Undiscovered Country).J.J. Abrahms has successfully dragged Trek into the 21st century, with the excellent casting all-round, cutting edge special effects, witty dialogue and interesting and exciting plot.Right from the start as the camera pans from the hull of the USS Kelvin we are treated to so much eye candy that our ocular areas may suffer from diabetes, but yet they don't feel superficial or time- filling as they melt in with the live action seamlessly. Never since Spocks death have I felt emotional in a Trek movie since the apparent death of Spock than with the birth of Kirk.. a highly memorable moment.The dialogue as mentioned while witty is never overly so and is reserved as intentional dialogue, and every character gets their turn. Between Chekov's accent troubles, Kirk's confidence, Scotty's wide eyed freshness, Sulu's chosen hand-to-hand combat skill and even Spock's love life. The humour is spot on and gels perfectly with the plot and never seems forced.The plot itself is as you've probably read by now, is loosely about time-travel (not a new plot device in a trek movie, but is integral to the whole reboot thing). The main story is about Nero's revenge for the destruction of his beloved home planet of Romulus with blame squarely place on Ambassador Spock and the federation's shoulders, where it goes from there I will leave for you to find out yourselves.Nimoy's return as Spock (Which I have saved for last), is also integral to the reboot, showing us that nothing will EVER be the same again.",9,1,6,18 May 2009
Dawn of the Dead," do people just not get it!
","Yup, I would say that this is a remake worthy of the original.  Yes I know that there are people that swear by the original Romero classic, hell I myself was very apprehensive before I saw this.As a fan of horror and more-so of zombie movies (Which have been too thin on the ground), this has to be the best zombie movie since the original. Better than the original?...... All I can say is decide for yourself. But as a modern day zombie movie, it has plenty of scares, gore and some good humour makes for a good watch.As i have just mentioned zombie movies have been thin on the ground, but 2004 seems to be year of the zombie, with the weak and inept 'House of the Dead', the impressive and funny looking homage that is 'Shaun of the Dead' (Which has been getting some good reviews) 'Resident Evil Apocalypse' which looks as if it takes off straight after the end of the first and maybe, just maybe Romero will have his 'Twilight of the dead' out on release before the end of the year (but i doubt it). So if like and you are unsure about going to see it, dont expect the original, just enjoy it.......You will.",9,0,0,3 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," what can i say? well...
","Excellent, considering how hard reading the book is and the special effects of Gollum make harry potter's Dobby look like something out of pinky and perky. Only one misfire of the effects caught my eye, when Legolas charges the wargs, watch out for it. The acting is still top notch.The only gripe I have with LOTR:TTT is that it is another  year until Return of the King.To sum up, this is a highly recommended film that will blow you away with battle scenes that go above and beyond Braveheart and co. Go see, a must.",10,0,0,19 December 2002
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Easily shrunk to a half hour decent episode
","The first (Twilight) was at best, average. This one would have been better if not for too many reasons. The only positive parts I can remember are The werewolf pack (apart from when they went all gay (mush like turning the vampires into diamond necklaces instead of burning them up as in the first movie) and felt the need to protect humankind from the nasty vampires) and Victoria's chase. Edward... well Captain Boring would have been a more adequate name, then there's suicidal Bella... (Wooooaaah exciting NOT!).Now take the film, take out the repetitive use of the word 'Bella' and that must bring it down to close to half an hour, not since X-men have I felt the urge to start counting because of over-usage.My wife and daughters are big fans and I don't see why anyone can invest so much time in these movies. I believe the fans are called Twihards.... hmmm going by the movies I think Twits would be more appropriate!It's quite a shame really as i'm sure there is a decent story there somewhere....At best I felt the urge to call our next daughter Bella.",2,19,34,24 November 2009
The Dark Knight," The Darkest Knight
","Batman Begins was a highly enjoyable film and the first to be truly close to its origins. Tim Burton's films were good but the Bat seemed somewhat inanimate, cold and lonely (despite Alfred and billions of dollars).Killing off a major Bat-villain is always sacrilege in my eyes and the only thing that Schumacker did right with his two duds was to incarcerate the villains in Arkham instead of killing them off. you should at least leave a plausible chance of their return.Back to the 21st century and Begins did what all have failed before. Gotham is completely believable as a real city and not the hyper-exaggerated version of the 90s versions. The characters are a lot more convincing and more like their literate counterparts and perfectly ended with ongoing storyline of all the characters and the tasty teaser of The Joker.With the exception of the different Rachel this 'sequel' goes for continuity in spades. Gordon recently promoted (All knowing that he ends up as commissioner and excellently played by Oldman)still keeping his head above water with the corruption around him. Harvey Dent rising to his expected post as DA after the previous one was murdered and his eventual fall from grace after being disfigured (differently from the written version). The only gripe with continuation in this flick is the sudden disappearance of the whole rail system from the original.The Dark Knight is brilliantly acted, expertly written (more of that in a mo)and properly styled.The good thing about the script is that everything that happens, all that is said is there for a reason, never (despite the long running time)does it feel like padding. Take the obvious, Dent saying 'you either die a hero or live long enough to become the bad guy' which resurfaces towards the end, or the two scar stories from the Joker that ends with Batman throwing a punchline regarding the aforementioned scars.As for Dents final scene, like I said you should never kill off a major villain ( Big no-no in my opinion) but as Maroni said 'one professional to another if your gonna scare someone try a different height, from here the fall won't kill me' (please forgive possible misquotes) Two-face didn't fall that far and technically Dent is dead, I want to believe Two-face ain't. (and much Kudos for Eckhart, simply brilliant).Despite really just being the glue that holds the film together, Ledger's undeniably brilliant (and spot on) performance of the Joker cannot be unmentioned in any review, terrifying with a very dark sense of humour (Watch as the Bank robbery at the start plays out like a joke.... albeit with a very funny but subtle punchline... Not to mention his 'magic trick' which was worth the admission (or six) alone.As good as Bale was, it seemed like he needed an inhaler at certain points in the movie (understandably he would be knackered doing what he did anyway) but at a certain scene towards the end, he just seemed to have got over it in just a change of camera view.As for Oscar nominations, this is considered an ensemble movie where there is a big cast and all are good performances meaning that the stars are overlooked for other roles in other films. I do firmly believe in all honesty that Ledger deserves a posthumous nomination but as predictable as the Academy is, he will probably be awarded some sort of achievement award or something. I also believe that Gary Oldman deserves equal recognition improving on his role from Begins.The only thing (other than Begins) that comes close is the fan-made 'Batman; Dead End' (see youtube).AS FOR THOSE THAT REFUSE TO WATCH IT BECAUSE IT IS A 'BATMAN' MOVIE OR A 'SUPERHERO' MOVIE.... SHAME ON YOU, LOOK PAST THAT STIGMA AND ENJOY WHAT IS Easily THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR AND ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER (SEE IMDb TOP 250 FOR EVIDENCE).",10,6,13,21 September 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the new trilogy - not a hard task it is.
","Maybe its just me..but i thought that episode 3's script isn't just tight enough. and sometimes some of the action scenes seemed a little too much on the eyes. Also the 'loose strings' from the other episodes seemed a little tacked on. I also thought that NOT all the loose threads were tied up. however on the plus side, ROTS was still highly enjoyable. some of the scenes may offend the lesser de-sensitised of us, and it was good to see that Mr. LUCAS didn't hold back as much as he could have. Recommended, this movie is. 5*****.My only question is that how long - and how much pressure from the massive fanbase will it take to make Lucas film episodes 7,8 and nine.",9,2,5,21 May 2005
Live Free or Die Hard," be honest, the rest of the summer blockbuster make anything look good......
","Can you honestly say with hand on heart that you have ever came out of a Die Hard movie thinking, that was a bad movie. My guess is no and Die hard 4.0 (as its better known over here) is no exception. Pulling in at around 2 hours and a bit, it never seems like its never ending and the action sequences are all great. I especially liked the reference to what eventually happens to the xbox360 at the start if you keep getting the 3 red lights LOL. I know this is no masterpiece (even by action movie standards) and neither is it the best of the 4 (2 is still the weakest (I refuse to use the word worst in this case)), but buy some popcorn and juice, sit back, relax and enjoy the action.",9,0,4,6 July 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," improves on the 2nd film the way two towers does to the 1st.
","Lord praise Peter Jackson not only for his effort for making the whole trilogy, but also for sticking so relatively close to the books. O.K. so we all know that there are some major discrepancies as well as minor ones throughout all three movies, however im sure we all should agree that these are so easily overlooked for what is such a great accomplishment.ROTK is inarguably the greatest of the three with some great battle scenes that make all previous ones (in any movie) seem like a schoolyard fight. The visual effects are also very worthy of a mention as is the much expected acting standard.I found certain scenes a little disturbing especially the Smeagol/Gollum scene, but these only convey the horror that goes on around the characters.To summarize, ROTK as well as the fellowship and the two towers will always have a special place in my heart and if Peter Jackson doesn't get his much deserved Oscar (tm) this year then someone should get booted out of the academy. GO SEE AND ENJOY!!!!!",9,0,0,20 December 2003
