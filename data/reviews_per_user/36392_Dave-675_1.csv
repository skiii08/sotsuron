The Blair Witch Project," scary, but.....
",You know I've seen the blair witch project and I must say it is a really good and scary film.  BUT I must warn people who haven't seen the movie that if you  are the kind person who is weak at heart do NOT see the film. NO not because the movie is full of blood and gore (which there is none) but the whole movie makes you kind of uncomfortable seeing it because of all the shakey camara movements.  After I saw the movie I was very suprised that a lot of people in the theatre felt dizzy and EVEN threw up.  So if you are the kind of person who can take a roller coaster ride the by all means GO SEE THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT!!!!!!!!!,10,1,2,29 August 1999
