Lucky Number Slevin," Quentin wannabe...
","Sure Quentin is the king of this fast paced style of wham-bam movies, but can't anyone come up with a new take on his style that doesn't look like it's stolen? This movie, along with Stay, Smokin Aces, Boondock Saints, etc. all try to rip off Quentin's style but don't add any substance. Sure, lots of violence and a twisted plot look great on paper, but the delivery falls flat as hell. There are so many plot holes and unbelievable twists that 20 minutes into the movie my wife looked at me and said 'bleh, drivel', and I had to agree with her. She fell asleep while I waited for it to make the smallest bit of sense, but it continued to be totally unbelievable right up to the end. I give the director props for trying, but if you rate this movie higher than a 5, you really need to watch more movies.",2,1,5,22 August 2007
