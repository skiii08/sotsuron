Requiem for a Dream," Intense
","I've seen alot of movies, both mainstream and independent, and this is one of the most intense films I have ever seen. The directing and cinematography are outstanding. The story for the most part is right on the money. The editing is key as well as a very complimentary soundtrack that enhances rather than detracts. May be too intense for some but, See this movie.",10,0,0,22 November 2000
