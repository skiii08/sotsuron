Monty Python's Life of Brian," GOD
","Where did God come from?God is a creation of man himself.In the movie, Brian is nothing more than a dork, a dork, a dork, but how ironic is it that this puppet who is being used by the Jewish people has become a god? !
Let us reflect on ourselves and let God come down from the altar.God is not himself, but our worship, worship and superstition.
Perhaps Only Brian himself was conscious, and he felt sorrow, and mourned to all, which gave him some possibility of a loving God. He said, 'Never follow others, never believe what they tell you, you are special people yourself.' He also said, 'Life does not and does not need to have meaning beyond its own meaning.'",8,1,4,7 June 2020

Many years later, James knelt at the captain's grave. The cruelty of the war is not frightening, and the director also wants to appeal for the peace of the whole world through this film, to arouse people's repentance and reflection.In front of the United Nations headquarters, there is a cold cast iron sculpture 'cast sword into plough'. It is the shape of a gun, unusual is the muzzle rolled up, tied a knot, the muzzle tied knot, meaning world peace, no war. But after years of fighting in one place and another, what did this gun witness?In this peaceful age, we still need to reflect on the war and realize the value of life. Remember what the captain said to Ryan on the bridge: 'you have to live.' In a word, let the original brutal war become full of warmth.

","The film was slow in pace, so the first half of the film was boring and I insisted on watching it. Although the second half was a little dull, I was gradually moved and my eyes watered by the gradual spread of the plain dramatic conflicts and sadness.The movie is both realistic and romantic, and the combination of the two and the slow pace of the movie make me feel both sad and sensible. The reality is the betrayal of the most loved lover, romantic is not a good person who knows the silent help and self-sacrifice.In the writers and the viewer to reality is helpless and feel the world, there is still a goodwill and light writer no longer writing about after his girlfriend died quietly to help with the writing and desire, wrote the book 'sonata for a good man to the injured man in reality, the film is the most wonderful fascinating man walked into the bookstore, bought the book, the cashier ask him need packaging, to give others to his light smile to answer: no, that is for me.Never lose hope for the world, because in the back of you do not know, maybe someone will always pay for you silently.",9,0,0,4 April 2020

Gran Torino," Gran torino
","When the music plays at the end, which is fully integrated with the film, the deep male voice seems to slowly pour out the sadness of the characters. At that moment, all the plots and images of the film gathered in my mind, and a feeling of sadness, full and extremely sad, began to permeate in my heart, which also kept my thought activities out of words. Perhaps the film is too painful experience of the Miao people, Su suffered humiliation, tao suffered bullying, miao people because of the war forced away from their homes, just want to find a trace of peace in a foreign land, but even their own homes are to be shot, they not only failed to do so, but also become the victims of 'racial discrimination'.The sad fate has become a foregone conclusion, the sad people also have nowhere to tell.The thing that moves me the most and saddens me the most is that when I can tell, I still choose to be silent, or even say nothing. This is the equivalent of taking all the damage. Questioned by the foreign police, the Hmong are reluctant to say what happened to them. I do not know, still less what is the intensity of their obsession that makes them willing to endure humiliation and passively accept all the harm around them. That, I think, is the saddest thing about the pathetic man. This, of course, makes one think deeply and regret deeply. Miao people always maintain the kind and seclusionfrom the world so that they accept everything around them, no matter it is good or bad, they can only passively accept and bear the consequences. Perhaps, it is a kind of 'escapism' in the support of their heart. May God look upon all who yearn for a better life in this world and allow all of them to live a better life in this world as they wish. Amen.",10,0,0,20 June 2020

","The story line of '1917' is very simple. It tells the story of two soldiers who go to the front during world war I to serve an evacuation mission.But the film's redemptive dialogue, metaphors and hidden texts save its otherwise thin plot and keep its so-called one-shot technological marvel from being showy.What was supposed to be an immersive experience of the technological age turned out to be an allegorical masterpiece, possessed by tarkovsky's soul.
