Catch Me If You Can," An entertaining movie with more depht that seems in the first view
","First of all,i think Spielberg is a great director of adventure movies.That's the best gift of many of his movies.This movie seems a simple entertaining flick but it show us how ET's director has grown.His obssesion with the family is here and also his best cualities as cinema autor(broken families,lonely child,sense of adventure.....).The movie is not great but is very good.I think this is one of the best biopics in recent american cinema,full of joy and ,surprise,drama.This film is also a magnificent portrait of the 60's ,the period of the Frank's swindle.The story of the young fake becomes in a great biography in Spielberg hands.Leonardo DiCaprio at last can be the great actor that always he was.His performance here is the most adecuate in every sense of the word.He's moving,charming,and plenty of life.This is his best performance since Gilbert Grape.Tom Hanks is good,although the show belongs to DiCaprio. Catch me if you can is an entertaining movie that give us more than it seems.",8,1,2,12 February 2003
Sleepy Hollow," Gothic,delightful,funny and beautiful tale
","This is a great movie in many ways.The first time i saw it,i didn't like very much because i reed the Washington Irving story but in the second view i was pleasant.The movie is dark and funny with Burton's sense of humor.The photography reminded me movies like Nosferatu(Murnau),M(Fritz Lang);was completely expressionistic and dark.The story of the Headless Horseman is a classic tale from America and this movie show us a variation respect to the book story.However,Johnny Depp is great here(like always)and the movie combined horror,humor and a beauty typical of the fairy tales.Is a fantastic movie.The only failure would be a script too much complicated and with some holes but that's doesn't care,at least for me.See it if you like costume horror movies.Probably,Sleepy Hollow is the most romantic movie of the last years in the old sense of the word.",8,0,0,4 July 2002
Lost in Translation," Wonderful movie about the loneliness
","Wow,this movie is simply wonderful.The performances of Murray and Johansson are great.Murray has the cynic dialogue(and the funny  moments,full of a kind of comic sadness) and Scarlett has an eyes that speaks for herself.The localization in Tokyo is the best metaphor that  i've seen since Thelma and Louise.That city so big,so crowded,so cold ,is like the characters' sensation of loneliness and lost.Coppola gets poetic images  with an ethereal music and a great cinematography.If you wanna see a movie experience,don't miss this movie.I think is the best love/friendship story i've seen in a long time.",9,0,1,15 February 2004
The Aviator," Scorsese homages Old Hollywood and DiCaprio is recognized at last
","OK,this movie is not a masterpiece,but i can't see the reasons many people give to dislike this movie.Its length??The usual length of all Scorsese's movies.The character identification with the audience??I've never was identified with Travis Bickle or Jake Lamotta.The movie is perfect in every single shot.The editing,the scenes design,all is really perfect.Howard Hughes was a spoiled rich man that defied the great American power(Scorsese criticizes again the American corruption beyond the eyes of an outsider and extravagant rich man).Cate Blanchett is perfect as Katharine Hepburn.At the beginning of the movie i was terrified (i thought his performance was going to be caricaturesque) but at the end i understood the kindness and the nerve of the greatest of all the Hollywood stars in Blanchet's face.Leonardo DiCaprio was a child phenomenon;an underrated actor because people ignores his first movies(This Boy's Life ,What's Eating Gilbert Grape? ,or his Rimbaud portrayal in Total Ecplise) in which he did everything (drug addict, revolutionary and evil poet, mentally retarded ,etc...).With the fame of this movie and his second Oscar nomination,the Titanic stigma disappear at last.No one could deny that his the great actor of his generation.(and better than Pitt ,Cruise and the rest of the pretty boys(except,may be,Johnny Depp or Ewan McGregor whom are great actors).I'm glad for Leo.Scorsese homages Old Hollywood style with nerve and precision:Citizen Kane,The Philadelphia Story(Hepburn's family), Bringing up Baby or his own Raging Bull are revisited in this film. This movie is entertaining and original.It tells the story of a man and his own demons inside of him.May it's a very long movie (a few minutes less and it would be a masterpiece) ,but is a movie that will achieve greatness with the passage of time.I'm sure of that.",8,0,0,12 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Well setting but too long and bored
","I'm not a Tolkien fan but i find the book better than this movie.The movie is not magic like the books.It seems more like a new Braveheart,with very much battles and a simplicity in its plot(good vs evil)unacceptable.Elijah Wood is not,at least for me,the actor who can play Frodo.He's a good actor but not here.At least ,the design of the movie is great and the special effects are incredible.This movie would be better if were shorter and much more magical ,like the Tolkien's books.I prefer Heavenly Creatures as the best film of Peter Jackson.",6,0,0,3 July 2002
Gone with the Wind," The granddaddy of all blockbuster,bigger than life
","This is the most popular movie of all time.All in it is great:the story of the fall of the Old South,the story of a selfish and pretty young woman named Scarlett O'Hara,the love story,the settings,the costumes,the shots...All the movie is BIGGER THAN LIFE.We must be sincere,it is not a masterpiece but,who cares? David O'Selnick made a great movie in which he redefined the sense of Hollywood spectacle and this is the most important thing about this movie.His glorious technicolor and performances in soap-opera style are definitely attractive to the public.The epic consists in made a spectacle of every gesture or every word.Is a movie to see a thousand of times because if it's the first spectacle movie in all the senses,is the best too. The first part of the movie(until the oath of Scarlett in Tara)is the best because we see the personal fight of Scarlett to conquest the love of Ashley and the fight against the Civil War.The dialogues are too much literary but in this consists the spectacle.The second part is worse because the marriage of Rhett and Scarlett is a stop in the narrative.The film contains unforgettable sentences like the famous 'Tomorrow is another day' at the end. Many people is very sceptical with this movie today because its plot twists and its soap opera style  but this was the first and real blockbuster of Hollywood.I repeat,it's not a masterpiece but deserves a viewing.Without this film may that Star Wars,Ben Hur,Doctor Zhivago or Titanic(so compared to Gone with the wind)never were existed.A movie for all the ages,a movie bigger than life,the perfect example of the Golden Hollywood,when art and success were a good couple.",10,2,3,13 July 2002
Meet Joe Black," An absolutely flop
","This movie is bored,stupid and sappy.The plot is simple and Brad Pitt acting is simply horrible.Don't waste your time in this awful 3 hours.There are movies about the death better than this.For example,you can see The Seven Seal or even Ghost.These movies are deeper than Meet Joe Black that is an idiotic and pink Hollywood romance.",3,0,2,21 April 2002
Million Dollar Baby," A near masterpiece that rocks your heart
","This movie is not a typical boxing movie.Thew script is perfect in a classic way,the actors are great and the surprise near the end hit your heart like no other movie has done in recent years.Clint Eastwood is a good storyteller in John Ford's tradition(many shots are like Ford's movies) but with modern themes and without obvious sentimentalism.(Ford used it sometimes,although did masterpieces like The Searchers, The grapes of Wrath or Stagecoach among many others).May the only failure of this great movie is the portrait of the girl's family (too obvious and manipulative for my taste),but this is a hell of good movie.Bravo for Clint,i'm only 22 years old ,but your cinema likes me much more than many young directors of today.",9,1,2,6 March 2005
Big Fish," The most accessible of Tim Burton's films
","A familiar tale which seems more a Spielberg's movie than Burton's.But i think this movie was snubbed at 2003 Oscars.OK,this is not the usual dark and bizarre world of Burton,but hey,this movie is like an American Fellini,a wonderful tale that debates the lack of illusion in our lives.The movie is also a wonderful portrait of a father-son relationship in an honest way.All the actors are very good(I've never seen Billy Cudrup as good as here) and the performance of Albert Finney is timeless.The movie has a magical quality that can be seen by anyone.That's why many people say this is the most accessible of all Burton's movies.I suppose that is not critic's like,but this is a movie that will age in a very good way.",8,1,1,12 February 2005
Titanic," The epic romance of the new age
","That's 'Titanic' to me.A perfect summary of the american cinema.The breakfast of Cal and Rose is like the breakfast in Citizen Kane(Kane and her wife).The face of Leonardo DiCaprio at the bottom of the starcaise is like Clark Gable in 'Gone with the wind' and the irish party in third class is like the John Ford movies.Seeing 'Titanic',you can see the cinema of David Wark Griffith ,John Ford or David O'Selznick(Gone with the wind producer).The only reason to critic this movie are its simple dialogues that,sometimes seem ridiculous.The rest is epic,romance,adventure and a great lesson of cinema.The 'Gone with the wind 'of this era. People usually hate this movie because of its great success(is the number one in historic top office)but is not a bad movie.The plot is simple but i think the ritm of the movie is great.Is a classic love story of two youngs.I think is wonderful,a really masterpiece underrated by titanic-phenomenon.If you like the cinema ,see this movie.",9,1,2,21 April 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Russell Crowe,Russell Crowe and Russell Crowe
","Russell Crowe is overacting and this is not a 'beatifull'movie.Is very unfair that Academy awards have given the Oscar to Ron Howard instead of Robert Altman.It's simple,lineal and a thousand times seen movie.Is bored and sometimes it seem a TV movie.Don't waste your time in this Academy winner(the worst Academy Winner of the last 4 years)",4,1,3,23 April 2002
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," The lost Disney movie of my childhood
","Yes,that is what i used to think when i was a child.This movie was not released on TV ,and it only appeared on video in 1994.I remember my wish for seeing the first Disney's masterpiece.Yes,the protagonist of the movie is bland and she's not aged very well,but the dwarfs and the queen are delicious characters.The music is perfect and the hand drawn animation is a perfect example of Disney's golden era.This was the first Disney movie and its success was unprecedented in 1937.It was a revolutionary movie that changed the perception about the animated form in cinema.It's a perfect movie ,although Snow White is not the kind of character a child would desire to be.In spite of this,the historical significance of the film hides the errors and the usual conservative message of all Disney's films.",10,2,3,12 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Mediocre ,boring,and highly overrated
","Yes,this movie has great production values,but it is artificial,false,without a single remarkable performance(I adore Ian McKellen) and cheese lines from the most commercial and stupid Hollywood.The humor between Gimli and Legolas is so simple and stupid that i had to laugh and the hobbits jumping in Frodo's bed at the end is one of the most ridiculous moments of my spectator's life .The battles are a poor imitation of Lawrence of Arabia.Peter,i prefer you in Heavenly Creatures,your great masterpiece.This movie is only for fans,not for me.I will say this movie is the worst of the five nominees to Oscars(Mystic River and Lost In Translation are great movies ,much much better than this piece of crap for male teenagers)",Null,13,45,15 February 2004
