Raiders of the Lost Ark," Classic
","While not the best movie of the 80s, it is excellent otherwise. The Special F/X, the Screenplay, direction and acting is brilliant and has one breathtaking stunt after another. While it's not Spielberg's best, it doesn't matter because he's done a role of classics anyway. It is definently the best in the trilogy and what makes this really come alive is the usual excellent score by John Williams. Check it out now.",Null,0,0,30 July 2000
Ed Wood," I Love this Movie
","I don't know what attracts me to this little gem. Maybe because it's funny or in black and white or the performances. No one could do Lugosi like that except Landau in a great performance. Depp was good too, certainly his best with Burton. This film really got touching when Lugosi died and when they played swan lake, I was really touched and at the ending. Howard Shore's score is also fantastic.",10,0,0,30 December 2000
Malcolm X," One of the Best of the 90s
","I can't believe while this film has less than 20 comments going for it, over-rated drivell like Gladiator has over 1000 comments for it. I have to say this is easily one of the best films of the 90s, probably Spike Lee's greatest achievement. Even this film is over 3 hours long, it is never boring as it moves at such a fast pace. The direction and acting, especially Denzel Washington and the cameos are great and really add to the film. Unmissable.",Null,2,7,9 December 2000
Pulp Fiction," Overated
","I can't see how everyone loves this movie or how it won a Oscar for best original screenplay. The actor is poor and the dialogue is laughable for being so bad. It's hardly realistic where as Goodfellas is (besides it being true). Ican't stand John Travolta in this film, his accents is annoying. The only thing worth seing is Harvey Keital. Go see Resevoir Dogs instead, its much better than this tosh.",10,0,1,30 July 2000
Raging Bull," One of my Favourite's
","This is one of my favourite movies of all time. It really brings you into the movie by De Niro's outstanding performance as Jake. Another thing that makes this movie so great is the suberb direction of Scorsese who ids the best director ever, and the stunning black and white cinematography which I love. It has my favourite opening titles ever, the classic opening with De Niro warming in the ring to the classical music blows me away everytime. Suberb.",10,1,1,30 July 2000
The Deer Hunter," De Niro's best?
","This is possibly Robert De Niro's finest acting he has ever done in a film, giving a emotionally charged performance that never lets up. Out of the two Vietnam films released that year (Coming Home was the other), this is the better of the two, where the performances is this are all-round better. Some people complain about the first hour of this film as boring, but not me. It sets all the backstories and what the characters are like perfectly. The best scenes in The Deer Hunter are the scenes after the Russian Roulette scene (which itself are highly emmotional), where Michael (De Niro) returns home. Cinema doesn't come much better than this.",10,0,0,4 August 2001
Goodfellas," Best Film of the 90s
",I Can't see how any one would rate Pulp Fiction as better than this flawless Mafia masterpiece starring my favourite actor (De Niro) and by my favourite director (Scorsese). It was a crime that this won only won one Oscar (for Pesci). There are far too many classic lines and scenes to list here and the soundtrack is outstanding (much better than anything Tarantino could put out). You must see this now.,10,0,1,30 July 2000
