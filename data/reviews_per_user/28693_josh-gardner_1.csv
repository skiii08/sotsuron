The Avengers," Entertaining in every sense of the word.
","This is the first review I have written on this website, but having seen some of the negative reviews for what I feel is a brilliant film, I felt the need to weigh in.The Avengers does everything that it sets out to do perfectly, it pulls of huge action scenes with 6 major characters without making them compete for screen time, it has funny and clever dialogue and it manages to actually give the film a strong sense of continuity with the previous titles in the 'series' in a way which works very well.I saw this film with my 13 year old brother and for once we both agreed with regards to our opinion of a film: we loved it. The action was impressive, the jokes were funny and the characters were likable.The main area of criticism I have seen so far seems to be that this movie does not 'deserve' to be held in the same regard as other high scoring films on this website. All I can say is that this film is pure and simple fun, it is well worth the money and is well worth your time to go and see. A film doesn't have to be meaningful or deep to be great, it just has to be an experience and the jaw dropping excitement I felt towards the climax of this film is not something I will soon forget.",10,1,4,5 May 2012
