"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Formulaic, predictable, not funny
","Romantic comedy by numbers. It's been done before a hundred times and done better. Much better. 20 minutes in to the film you'll know how it's going to end, and it's not worth the wait.I sat in an auditorium with maybe another 50 people. I think there was only one moment when everyone gave a simultaneous chuckle. Other than that, there was an occasional snort ... although it may just have been someone blowing their nose.It's slightly impressive, given the quality of the cast, that the production amounts to such a dull procession. Definitely goes in to the 'the sum of the parts is less than the total' category.Ultimately the script is weak, the gags predictable and the directing is lumpen. Find something better to do with 95 minutes of your life.",2,10,21,4 October 2007
