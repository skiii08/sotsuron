Hereditary," Classy horror story telling
","If you want jump scare movie, go elsewhere, this movie raises eyebrows and needs intellectual analysis to enjoy.. loved the acting and directing, though a directors cut version would be more enjoyable..
Excellent horror story..",9,0,1,17 June 2020
Captain Marvel," Good story and acting.. worthy origin movie
","I don't know which movie were the negative reviews watching, this movie was good and a worthy prep for end game..
The actors were commendable and the special effects was very good..
I don't want to spoil the movie but it has sadness, happiness, fun, and fury was funny as hell..
Highly recommended..",9,6,19,8 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Extremely annoyed by haters
","This is a great end to the saga and beautifully done with action and special effects that are right on the spot..
Well done JJ Abrams this is very satisfying to fans of starwars..
Please go watch and ignore the false negative reviews..",10,11,36,19 December 2019
Sausage Party," Tasteless film that can be watched by children
","How can this even be allowed? sick and twisted.. The end sequence is horribly pornographic.. Without giving too much of details, I would definitely ask you not to watch this sick movie.. Watch out for your kids.. A sausage shaped like a penis and a bun shaped like a @%#$ with the end of it turning into an orgy????? What kind of distasteful garbage is this? the twisted ideas are too psychotic to show to anyone.. This should be banned!! Basically this shows you how to be chaotic, disrespect everyone's beliefs, live a pointless life, follow Satanist rituals of having orgies and not caring for anything... But again this kind of film will further degrade the societies..",1,11,24,20 August 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Watched it again and again..
","Well done .. the movie Jeep's you on the edge through out with great acting from all.. the effects are realistically done and the story is intriguing..
Watch it more than one time ..",9,1,2,6 July 2019
