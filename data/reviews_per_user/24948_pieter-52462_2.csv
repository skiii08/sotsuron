Blade Runner 2049," Curate's Egg - Good in parts
","I didn't read reviews of this film before seeing it. I note that the critics loved it but the users think its a bit of an emperor's new clothes thing.So let's start by stating that I, like a lot of 50 somethings, thought that the original was something really special. I was surprised to read that on it's original release it was not a commercial success... but clearly with hindsight the original's reputation has grown.But to the new film. I think it has a lot of flaws and like a lot of sequels it has to chart a difficult course between comparisons with its predecessor and making its own mark.It's too long and its too slow. There are many examples whereby it is referring to the original in its drama, its structure and its plot development and it feels like that reference is not useful.I also think the reason users do not like it is that they probably expect the kind of visceral excitement that other films in this genre provide...but the original was always cerebral rather than visceral.... The sound design was very loud and made an attempt at experimenting with the 5:1 surround sound, I guess to add excitement to what was fairly turgid plot development. However, the central vision that corporations are gradually destroying human life, that 'man' is downgraded and the Nexus robots, although starting out as slaves, now perceive that they have rights, which the corporations are frightened to acknowledge is extremely percipient.So on that level the plot develops themes from the original, which I think is a good thing.I've given it a 8/10 because we should reward film makers who are ambitious and go against the trend but I think as a stand alone film it would probably score lower. I enjoyed the 2+ hours in the cinema and I'm glad someone found the finance to make this, I wished they'd made it shorter and that would have strengthened it as an cinematic experience.",8,0,4,1 November 2017
Bridge of Spies," Thoughtful, possible allegory of man versus government
","I am not a Spielberg fan. I don't dislike his films but they are not essential viewing. However Bridge of Spies is different. I am sure others will comment that he has made similar films. I may not have seen them.Here's a few thoughts. Interesting to note that Spielberg's father had been involved in US - Soviet negotiations at the the same time as the film is set.Although the character points out that the US government is a sham and a fraud in their trial of Abel, no search warrant etc Tom Hanks does not appear too outraged. Did the financial backers of this movie also insist that an American out negotiates the Soviet and East German governments? Or did that actually happen?Are there any parallels int his film with the moral vacuum we see in the US's attitude to the Middle East and Islam? Was that an intention? I feel certain that the Cohen Brothers and Spielberg definitely do not believe that everything is shiny under the bonnet of the US. To the film itself. As I left the cinema I heard several people say 'best film I've seen all year. I wanted to find out why they thought that. Because aside from a few scenes of graphic threat and danger I was struggling to work out how you'd sell this film as one of the best films all year.Personally I loved it. Occasionally the story telling was a little trite but it was a grown up film for grown ups...telling us a story of man v governments in a cynical way. It's just a shame that so many Americans still think the US is honourable. Let's hope Bernie Sanders leads them from late next year for 4- 8 years. Thankfully in this film, man seems to win but it a closer thing. Of course the East Germans are trying to outdo the Soviets. Of course the soviets don't believe anything they are told. Of course the American CIA are small minded and ridiculous and cannot see that their imperialism is as authoritarian as the Soviets....but the audience get to side with a human being not an ideology.Great film.",8,0,2,3 January 2016
