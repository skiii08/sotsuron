","while watching this movie i couldn't stop thinking about my grandparents and all the people that had to endure these kind of cruelty. This movie is about 1 village out of hundreds that had to go through hell because of the Nazis. This movie didn't tell me anything i didn't know about the WW2 but it told the story from an other point of view, when most people think about WW2 they think of Jews and Nazis, well this movie is about what Russians went through. A lot more Russian people died then Jews during this war and the way the Nazis killed them isn't better then the way Jews were treated during this terrible war. This movie is a real chef d'oeuvre even in the slow scene of the movie they are filmed so realistically and you can tell that no scene is pointless. Some scenes last more then 5 min without a cut and you really feel like you are in the war, i would feel my heart beating faster and getting anxious while watching it. Sometime you feel like you need to hide from the bomb yourself even though you are sitting safe in you're living room. very incredible movie",8,1,1,7 December 2011
