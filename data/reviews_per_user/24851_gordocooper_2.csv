Hereditary," hear no evil, see no evil..
","The basis of this story is a mother who knew nothing.
Who did not notice that her mother drove the father and brother to death.(which is unbelievable)Who didn't realize that her mother was the boss of a witch's circle. (which takes a lot of time)Who never saw photos or friends of her mother. (which is impossible)So this stupid Annie didn't know the slightest bit of anything. Now is the plot working, right?? Like all the other crap in the genre.What else is there to say:The idea of the image of the grinning demon in the door, was stolen from 'the devil rides out'.
Annie builds boring dioramas what takes 50% of the movie time. In the end, is does not matter anything to the plot ! Reason: kill some time due to the insufficient plot.",1,1,4,25 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," thanks QT, for all the years
","Despite this disaster, we must appreciate the work of Quentin. He did a lot for the younger generations and for those who where ignorant or unknowing, to build respect for the unique work of artists, directors and film musicians of the good old movies.
i loved ALL his projects and the thoughts behind it. He did a great great job, and now its time to say goodbye. Every creativity comes to an end at some point.
QT: you did good for 8 times!",1,8,10,17 January 2020
