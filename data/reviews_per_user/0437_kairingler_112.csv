Mission: Impossible III," ethan hunt is back
","First off, the down side Kerri Russel should have had a bigger part, she is too talented and pretty to have such a little role. 2nd Laurence Fishbourne needed more screen time he is under utilized in his role as well. 3rd, just a hair too many plot twists, this time i kept up with the plot twists till pretty much the end, then of course found myself lost. This film was great as far as action goes, top notch thriller, good story line, has some plausibility to it for real life. I did like the fact that Ethan in this story does get married, gives him more of an everyday Joe feel in a way. Ving Rhames was great as usual. The stunts are going to be hard to top next time if there is an MI 4. they were totally mind blowing to me anyway. i thought the movie was a thrill ride, it held my attention. didn't seem to slow down at all, it hits you 90mph and doesn't let go.. Tom's performance i thought was pretty dam good, maybe even better than the last mission, all in all i give this movie a thumbs up. hint for the next one, don't have too many characters where they don't get enough screen time.",8,0,0,14 September 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," good gangsta flick
","this is one of the best movies that i have seen recently. first of all Bruce Willis did a stand up job, Morgan freeman, thumbs up, Stanley tucci, very well also. Lucy liu, very nice, sir Ben Kingsley good job also, but an outstanding job to josh hartnett, the movie was kick butt all the way, the use of mixing the scenes up ala Quentin Tarantino, and reservoir dogs, would make him very proud. the plot line was excellent. the movie did give away anything too quickly it mixed the scenes just about right the whole way through. it's basically a case of mistaken identity, and a man that has the worst luck of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, he has not one but two gangsters after him plus a hit-man , and the police tailing him, there is a classic scene between freeman and Kingsley that is not to be missed , all in all i really can't find anything wrong with the movie at all, the was the perfect mix of crime, comedy, action, mystery, you name it this movie has it..",10,6,8,11 September 2007
3:10 to Yuma," 3:10 to Yuma
","Well it seems like every once in awhile a great western seems to come along , well i guess the time is A Fistfull of Dollars by now means, but you have to consider that today Hollywood has all but abandoned the Western and folks that is pretty darn sad to see that happen,, this is the best western since The Jack Bull 1999 and The Unforgiven 1992. Russel Crowe is great in this one as the killer without conscious Ben Wade,, Christian Bale is a rancher who hires on to help the local law bring Ben to justice, the story is all about there travels and adventures on the way to the 3:10 to Yuma, you gotta love that once scene where they got that gatling gun in the stagecoach,, now that was fun to watch,, and all of the gunplay action in here was pretty darn good,, all in all it was a very good western, not epic,, but pretty darn good.",8,1,2,12 April 2009
The Hangover," viva las vegas
","A group of men embark on Las Vegas to have a weekend on the town before 2 of them get married,,, well they have a blast get drunk, wake up the next morning, and they lose their buddy. Everything is foggy for the men as they have their worst hangover yet, not knowing what they have done or where they have been, they don't have a clue where to look for their buddy, and they have to get him home so he can get married by the next day,, this movie has so many laughs, it's hard to catch you're breath from the non stop gags in this movie. familiar premise redone but this one seems more in touch with today's times, not a lot of major A list stars in this so expectations for me as to the characters played weren't that big,, overall it's a barrel of laughs not to be missed, will definitely recommend to anyone looking for some great laughs.",8,1,2,26 July 2013
Stop-Loss," stop-loss
","i thought that this was a very compelling movie.. lot's of good character development, ryan phillipe was great in this, he really knocked it out of the park with this one, he plays a staff seargeant who comes home a 'hero' from Iraq, there is a parade , the whole town comes out , the senator is there and tells him anything you need son, come look me up. so him and his buddies spend a few days at home over the weekend catching up with their wives girlfriends,, and what not, things get rowdy and lot's of drinking happens, usual stuff. so on Monday morning our hero goes back to the office to get his official discharge papers,, well to his chagrin, he is sent back to iraq for another tour of duty, this little known 'trick' in the military is in the fine print,, basically it says , the president can extened you're military term in time of war.. well in this particular case the war was already declared over years ago,, there you can see our hero's dilemma should he suck it up and go back or fight the system. he decides to fight the system going AWOL.. that's absent without leave.. first he tries canada then d.c. then Mexico.. and were not to the end yet. very compelling movie, it's grips you to the core, and makes you wanna get up and do something about getting our boys back in one piece from Iraq which we have no business being there in the first place.",9,7,8,17 September 2009
United 93," great movie
","i was thoroughly impressed with paul greengrass's latest effort united 93 , it tells an effective story of what happened on 9/11/01, i remember what i was doing on that day, do you? anyway. as most disaster movies go, it takes a little time to get the story going but once the story get's going , this movie is very interesting , and a kick ass ride all the way to the conclusion. i particularly liked the scenes at the air traffic controller locations, and the military command center,, and the fact that the 2 agencies,, being the military and the FAA couldn't seem to co-operate, the president was the only one in authority to say whether the military could have shot down the planes. the 4th plane went down near shanksville, pa, not far from where i used to grow up, this movie pays tribute to all of the passengers and crew of flight 93. i recently went to the memorial near Shanksville for flight 93 , they plan to have a full memorial by 2012, i think the lady said they still need 158 million yet, from the park service, interesting note , the lady that did the little tour there, said that there were U.S. fighters 60 miles from flight 93,, and the plane was following the p.a. turnpike west. not mentioned in the movie, my cousin tells me that he knows of people that worked at the mill behind where flight 93 went down, and are said to have seen the plane in a fireball upside down,, then crashing, of course suggesting that the military shot the plane down,, anyways, i have some camcorder footage of the memorial, and will try to get it up on my my space for those to see if anyone is interested. i went there on 7-10-07, for anyone planning to go , you can't get to where the plane went down,, that area is only for relatives, but when they get the concrete walkway in , in a few years, the lady said you will be able to go right there, she also said the plane , believe it or not was 3/4 of the way into the ground after it crashed,, it crashed at 560 miles an hour she also said.",8,8,13,16 June 2007
Deja Vu," haven't i seen this.........
","Wow!! what a heck of a movie, yeah a lot of nitpickers will complain there are plot holes in the movie.. so what, just cause you don't understand it, or believe in it doesn't mean you give it a bad rating.. I liked the idea of the time travel, i especially bought into th e idea that the U.S. Government caused those blackouts on the Eastern Seaboard a few years ago,, ie.. Michigan,, or is it Canada's fault,, yeah some of it is far-fetched granted, but that's what makes it fun.. you get to do what if,, and wow i wonder if that could really happen; and furthermore given our own governments penchant for huge cover ups,, ie.. area 51, Roswell , the last 2 elections, j.fk. need i go any further, Denzel did a great job in this one i thought; he was right on cue with everything that he did in the film,, Val Kilmer wasn't too bad , though his acting looked kinda stiff, and forced, boy did he gain some weight for this role. all in all it was a heck of a ride .. Jerry Bruckheimer, and Tony Scott are a can't miss combination, and with Denzel in the lead , you can pretty well take it to the bank that the movie will be very good to say the least.",9,1,3,25 October 2007
Casablanca," classic
","I don't know why I waited so long to see this film,,, I picked this one up at a local Goodwill for 25 cents.. best quarter I ever spent.. Humphrey Bogart gives one of the best performances as night club owner Rick,, Ingrid Bergman is astonishing in her beauty as well as her acting skills.. Claude Rains is also wonderful.. and Peter Lorre is in it two, so what's not to love,, the story takes place WWII , and people are trying to get letters of transit , so they can get out of Casablanca, and to other places, such as America,, a man comes into Rick's club one day , and needs to stash these letters of transit because he is suspected by the local police,, so he leaves them with Rick,, he stashes them for future use,, then his ex- love walks into his club,, my fav Bogey quote ' of all the gin joints in all the world,, why did she have to come into mine'. this movie is not overrated whatsoever,, I gave it a perfect 10 because I believe that it is not flawed in any way,, I enjoyed the acting,, the storyline,, and everything this is Humphrey Bogart..",10,2,3,26 January 2014
Unbreakable," unbreakable samuel
","this is the 2nd M. Night Shamaylan movie and it's kinda out there, let me explain, it deals with a man who has been the only survivor of a massive train wreck, and somehow he comes out of it without a scratch, he meets a man that is curiously interested in him, the man is handicapped , he seems to be the total opposite of David, his bones break at will, some kind of rare bone disease. The story is a creepy one that is kind of hard to follow in spots, Bruce Willis does put in a good performance in this one,, this is the 2nd movie in which Samuel jackson and Bruce are together. There isn't a lot of blood guts and gore in this one, it is more of a kinda creepy paranormal feeling,, David slowly realizes that he has some kinda superpowers, and has to deal with them to the stunning conclusion at the end of the movie.",6,0,0,18 April 2009
12 Monkeys," Bruce's Monkeys......all 12 of em
","it's been 13 years since i watched this,, for along time i absolutely hated this movie, so i thought i would give it another try,, wow, i guess i just didn't get it the first time,, this was really a great movie. I understood it a lot better this time, even though Bruce is the main character it doesn't feel like he is,, he has a strong supporting cast in Madeline Stowe, and Brad Pitt, Pitt's performance was okay,, Madeline Stowe on the other hand was brilliant,, Bruce plays sympathetic and crazy very well in this film. One thing i loved was the 12 Monkeys musical theme, very catchy French sounding. The plot was very detailed and makes you think,, the ending which i can't give away was brilliant i thought, the film makes you wonder if Bruce is crazy or if things are real,, the time travel in all,, going back to before the virus started,, then supposedly he was sent to the wrong year,, then somehow he gets in WW1. altogether it was a different kind of movie , that does take some getting used to. heck it took me 13 years , but i'm glad that i gave it a second look.",8,0,0,13 August 2008
Stripes," funny
","Bill Murray once again shines in this raunchy comedy. John Candy and Harold Ramis also provide lot's of laughs. a down on his luck cab driver in NYC. loses his job his girl his apartment, and so with nothing left to lose decides to enlist in the Army for fun,, he recruits his pal to join him.. some of the most funniest parts in the movie are in basic training. later on they tangle with Sgt Hulka who gives them all they can handle. after that they wind up in Germany in the middoe of a war.. this movie has so many laughs it's hard to stop laughing from one point to the next,, semi interesting plot involving the boys going off to war, and of course there are a couple of hottie MP's who also like the boys,, these guys get into so much trouble and mayhem,, well worth watching.",7,0,1,11 July 2013
Alexander," Alexander
","coming from Oliver Stone i guess i expected more than what i got, this one was soooo. long and drawn out, i think the story could have been told in much better fashion by another director easily. i usually enjoy oliver stone movies.. i.e. j.f.k. but this one,, not really, i mean bi men,, kissing, i about threw up,, it disgusts me personally. didn't even recognize val kilmer at all, is that good or bad. angelina jolie, way underused in this one.. and colin farell, way out of place geesh. it was a very good story , don't get me wrong, just that stone as usual has too much information, and you have to think this movie, from start to finish.. kept flashing back 9 years earlier, so you just get it,, and then it goes back 9 more years, then 9 more, i'm thinking why not 10,, why is it 9. anyway i think that i would have enjoyed this movie better, had they cut out about 1 hr and 15 mins. and left out the guys kissing.",4,0,0,14 August 2007
Constantine," god vs. devil
","while hard to understand at first, i got the meaning of the movie. keanu reeves makes the perfect anti-hero in this movie. the story of god and the devil, gabriel, and the book of revelations is very very interesting, was Jesus murdered?? hmm, makes you think. anything's possible i guess, anyway what i think is this the storyline was very interesting, the special effect was very good, and for the most part the story moved along very well. this is a movie that i would watch again just to see what i missed the first time, rachel weisz also had a good showing as the tortured sister. i give this movie a thumbs up. could have movie just a hair quicker in the plot , but otherwise very good.",6,0,3,8 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," pirates 3
","maybe because i watched this third installment before the second one is probably one of the reasons that i just didn't' get this movie.. but on the other hand to me too many things were left unexplained , i hate it when i don't get answers to my questions when i watch a movie, maybe some will be answered in subsequent movies,, as for this one there is NOT enough Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley although good to look at , well she just seems likes she's along for the ride and not really trying, one thing i definitely didn't care for was the length of the movie 2:48 really it could have been like 2:05 and probably would have been better at least for me,, the movie was okay , i mean it didn't totally stink,, just too many plot lines with loose ends.",5,0,0,25 November 2012
Yes Man," Zoey
","although not being a huge Jim Carey fan over the last few years I have watched several of his movies,, my fav.. number 23.. and this film was pretty good, for me Zoey Deschanel stole the show, not only can she act pretty good, she's cute sexy and so adorable. as for the movie, our main character, was always so negative,, never really had anything good or wonderful happen to him,, so a friend of his convinces him to attend a seminar.. it's all about saying 'Yes'.. so he decides to give it a try and low and behold he starts to say yes....... to everything. whether it's ridiculous or not,, he meet a cute girl and they hit it off. overall this was really funny entertaining,, so many laughs.. a little bit of seriousness, a human quality where you feel for the characters,, some sadness, but all in all just a pretty darn good movie that makes you laugh.",7,2,2,12 July 2013
Resident Evil: Extinction," resident evil 3
","Well i waited a long time for this one to come out,, it was pretty good,, but not as good as the first,, but then again when are movies as good as the first,, i think the first half of this movie kicks ass and takes names,, and Milla Jovovich is as sexy as ever,, even Mike Epps is fun,, and the dogs are back for a little bit too,, in the second half of the movie,, the story loses some of the original punch,, it slows down a little too much for me,, but it does manage to pick it up a notch again,, for a decent ending i thought,, i just think this movie like most,, in this genre that are a sequel,, is it was disjointed ,, meaning the pieces just don't seem to fit,, i mean all the action was there,, and Milla was great as usual,, and the Umbrella Corporation is mentioned quite frequently,, and the return of Alice not to mention,, so it's a good movie,, but can't top the original.",7,1,1,28 April 2008
Zodiac," very similar too.. well um, an east coast killer,,, Son of ......
","Wow,, this movie was shocking yet compelling in the same way,, taking place in the 70's for a time,, this is the childhood that i grew up with,, although i have no personal recollection of this being a young child,, but this movie is very interesting to say the least, i love how all of the police seem so baffled, and yet cannot solve the case,, the different counties, and cities that are involved, and the confusion about which department has which evidence, and the involvement with the reporter's makes it sort of seem like Ted Bundy meets All the Presidents Men,, heck i was waiting for Deep Throat to make a cameo in the movie.. all in all though that i have to say that this is a very compelling movie that really cannot be missed by anyone that has any ounce of curiosity in them,, pretty much the only thing that i didn't like about the movie , was the ending,, but hey,, not enough to deter from the over all picture,, which would 9 times out of 10 subtract at least 1 from my personal rating, but not this time though,, this movie was strong enough to overcome this,,,the acting was very strong in here, Jake Gyllenhal was great,, and so was everyone else for that matter, Robert Downey Jr.. great also,, the film will leave you breathless with anticipation, if you can get over how confusing it is.. but hey you know what they say about patience,,,",10,1,4,11 February 2008
The Prestige," 2 dueling magicians
","well this one was a first a movie about 2 dueling magicians, fighting it out to the death, Michael Caine gives a great performance in here also, the two magicians Borden, and Angiers are dynamic in their tricks, deceit, lies , and overall performance,, the two females characters are also pretty good eye candy. Always been fascinated by magicians,, especially the greatest one of all ,, the late great Harry Houdini, this is a hard movie to keep track of , with all of the twists and turns, it is very good, just kinda hard to follow, with all of the trickery and other things going on in the movie,, this is the kind of movie where yoiu have to watch it a couple of times to get the hang of it,, but otherwise it is an entertaining flick.",7,1,3,29 March 2009
The Terminator," Arnold
","Well I finally decided to give this Trilogy a try, here goes, Arnold Schwarzegger in his most popular role. being the first time that I had watched it , it was a hard story for me to follow. I don't know why but it just was. Michael Bein was good, and so was Lance Henricksen. A futuristic machine or robot is sent back into the past to kill a waitress named Sara Connor so her baby won't be born,, I guess that's what it's about,, i'll have to watch it again,, I did love all of the action scenes.. and Arnold did have a lot of funny lines.. thought it was comical him running around the streets in his birthday suit,, was kinda sad when he didn't let the gun store owner live. I liked the movie for all of the stunts and action,, I just want to understand the story better .",6,1,6,13 July 2013
Cloverfield," strange creature attacks n.y.c.
","first of all i loved this movie.. plain and simple,, the creature looked pretty darn good if you ask me,, i like the suspense where you don't know what is attacking the city, the only thing that really threw me was the babies in the movie, they looked like flying little dinosaurs , but they were pretty cool, i liked the fact that the direcor j.j abrams, used little known talent for this one, it made the movie seem more real,, also the use of the steady cam,, sort of like blair witch with a twist, the movie was done in documentary style, from the first person, which i also thought was pretty cool,, all in all i can't find anything wrong with the movie, except it was extremely short,, but that also means that it was compact, and didn't have a lot of the typical wishy washy crap you usually see in the big movie,, thumbs up here, cloverfield's a winner.",9,0,1,1 June 2008
Silent Hill," video game movie
","I had no idea that this was based off of a video game till after I watched the movie, and went to the special features section of the DVD, i'm not a video game kinda person, but I can only imagine how hard it must be to make a movie out of a video game. based on true events from Centralia , PA.. a mine fire wipes out the entire town, what lies below is anyone's guess... a mother tries to help out her young daughter who is having problems with sleepwalking and nightmares,, so she decides that the best thing for her daughter is to tackle her dreams head on ,, she takes her to the town of Silent Hill,, the town of which her daughter has talked about in her dreams. on the way the mother get's into a chase with the police,, and they are ran off the road..,, by the way only character I recognize in this movie ,, is Kim Coates who was pretty good as the sheriff,, I enjoyed this movie,, very creepy and scary.",10,1,2,1 August 2013
Crash," wonderful story
","Geesh i don't know where to start, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Tony Danza, Ryan Phillipe , Matt Dillon, Ludicrous, and a slew of others who i'm gonna kick myself for not remembering all their names, this movie is so surreal, it's very current with the times, very true in fact, the stereotyping that goes on in this country, me included, i'm guilty of prob the first scene in the movie, but i shouldn't be, cause i've worked with many foreigners and there not all terrorists, anyway, the only thing is that where the ending is,,, or where you think it ends, then comes the tying up of all the loose ends,, seems to drag somewhat, that's the only flaw that i see with this movie,, and well maybe the snow in L.A. bit, i mean snow in the valley, what's it been 40 or 50 years since it's snowed in L.A. guess it 's supposed to be a symbol of hope,, think they could have used rain,, and had a drought all the movie,, but hey i mean this is a movie that will, shock you, interest you, captivate you, heck i couldn't get my teen daughter off of the couch, she was mesmerized by it. i give this a 2 thumbs up.",9,1,5,5 December 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Dr. Sellers
","Peter Sellers plays 3 different characters in this movie,, now that's something you big Hollywood actors of today wouldn't dare dream of. I think that a first time viewer of this film won't get it.. i think you need to appreciate the classics before watching this film,, it is a black comedy that does poke fun at the military,, Sellers performance was nothing short of brilliant,, wish Strangelove character would have had some more screen time,, but all in all i was happy, George C. Scott wow, what can i say,, he stole the entire show for me.. James EArl JONes is in here also, basically a general goes loony, and orders his boys to bomb the crap out of Russia,, President finds out and all heck is breaking out in the war room, where the Russian Ambassador is waiting for them,, i think that this movie is funny,, kinda dark, hard to get at first. but overall good, although for me not quite an 8.7.. maybe a 7, but good nonetheless.",7,0,4,22 August 2008

Their mission is to stop and investigate a signal coming from outer space, they are not sure if it is a distress signal or something more. so they need to investigate, upon investigating one of the crew members slips and falls, and the alien gets the better of him,, attaching itself to him,, the major and fatal flaw is that one of the crew decides to open the hatch and let him in,, instead of keeping the hatch closed, and prevent the alien from coming aboard and contaminating the whole entire ship.. i thought that parts of the movie were pretty good,, but to me it seems like things didn't gel,, scene to scene, there was a lot left uneplained which in my opinion made the movie very very hard to follow.",5,1,7,22 November 2009
The Doors," An American Prayer
","Visually stunning, very graphic lewd at times, but hey this is the 60's and early 70's , peace love dope all that stuff, where would i start well, i have a little bit of a bias being an avid Morisson fan , and the Doors for 20 years. i think that Oliver Stone did do a decent job, i don't think he captured everything there was to say about the Doors, rather i think that he did a broad general overview of the Doors. Val Kilmer folks if for no other movie he ever did this is the one that will knock you're socks off completely,, he is better in this than Heat . He sounds just like Morisson,, I really thought that Meg Ryan for the character for Pamela was an odd choice,, but it didn't work out too bad,, it is a wonderful trip,, hearing all of those classic and some not so classic doors songs in the movie,, yeah the movie is long,, and follows Jim's childhood to his death,, follows the band somewhat,, and Pamela,, a great movie , but i think you need to have lived a little and had some life experiences before y ou can completely understand a movie like this,,, great job for everyone involved in the picture,, i think Jim would be proud.",10,3,4,6 January 2009
The Polar Express," most wonderful time of the year
","Polar Express is just a well made movie that tugs at the heart strings especially at Christmas time. Tom Hanks plays I believe 5 characters if I'm not mistaken, my favorite however was the Train Conductor, A boy boards a train on Christmas Eve destined for the North Pole. and along the way he meet a little girl his age and she loses her ticket,, and he gives up his for her's , then they are questioned by the conductor, without giving too much away , I will say that the special effects are dynamic,, animation is out of this world,, I watched this on my 52 plasma with surround sound,, and let me tell you that the sound was just off the charts,, very enjoyable Christmas movie,, or any other time of year, very heartwarming,",9,2,4,16 January 2014
Ocean's Thirteen," revenge
","George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Al Pacino, yes folks Al Pacino,, odd choice for this movie I thought,, and also stars Ellen Barkin,, this time the crew is out for revenge as one of the original members from Ocean's 11 is ripped off on a casino deal by arch rival Willy Bank ,, played by Al Pacino,, also involved in the shenanigan's is our old pal,, Terry Benedict,, the odds in most casino's are roughly the same,, but folks ,, those aren't Terry Benedict's casino's.. reference to Tony Reali there. So our crew is set and they go after Willy Bank and try to crush his new Casino opening up,, the man that was going into business with ,, one of the original 11 ,, he caused the man to have a heart attack, and he is lain up in the hospital,, our crew enlists the help of Terry Benedict,, who also has a score to settle with Bank,, not a bad movie,, pretty good actually,, but I felt that Pacino could have done a bit of a better acting job.",7,1,2,4 June 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," the Bourne end
","well we finally get to find out all the questions we have been asking ourselves all the years.. well by the end of the movie all will be answered, just not by me of course. first off Julia Stiles needs to go somewhere else, she didn't belong in the series in the first place. Matt Damon did a terrific job in all 3 movies.. I love all of the glob-trotting all the machinery and gadgets of today, the espionage, black ops CIA stuff. the movie starts off almost in mid chase as Bourne is hot on the trail of those who tried to kill him the last time. lot's of great car chases in here remind you of the older films that had great car chase scenes Ronin, French Connection, and of course Bullit. overall this is a very satisfying end to the trilogy, let's just hope for everyone's sake that Hollywood leaves this one well enough alone .",8,0,2,7 July 2013
10 Things I Hate About You," awesome movie, better music

Fargo," love this movie
","Frances Mcdormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi, now how are you gonna go wrong with a cast like that,, simply put you can't ,, the only thing I didn't like in the entire movie, was something small just annoying was the accents , other than that I loved it, and I learned to just tune out the accents. Our local car salesman needs cash bad,, but instead of simply asking his father-in-law he decides to hook up with these two well we say bumbling idiots to try and kidnap his wife in hopes that his father in law will pay a very handsome randsom. this movie has so many plot twists and turns , and wow the chipper/shredder scene never ever seen someone get killed that way,, what a horrible way to go if you ask me.. the characters in this movie are memorable, there aren't many movies today that I can get tired watching, I can watch this one over and over and never tire of it.. I guess everything just came together perfectly for this movie,, I've always wanted to go to Minnesotta, Or North Dakota , wherever this was filmed, and I love snow,, so really this picture had everything for me,, i'm a big Steve Buscemi fan and he didn't disappoint whatsoever.",10,0,0,7 July 2013

","i had to watch this a few times before i actually liked it a lot,, this is my 3rd time watching it.. i really liked watching Carl Weathers, and of course Jessie 'the body' Ventura, Arnold was pretty good as well but the main character of course has to be without a doubt the Predator. i like how it was set in the jungle and you really don't see the predator at all at least till after the halfway point of the film,, the ways in which the predator sets about killing his victims one by one almost at random seems very intereesting to me,, i know i shouldn't bring up sequels but predator 2 in my opinion is actually one of the few movies that to me is better than the original.. just thought that i would throw that in there, but overall i was happy with this one",8,0,1,24 December 2012
The Italian Job," cars, hot women
","Jason Statham once again is awesome in this,, I like Ed Norton's bad guy though.. Donald Sutherland always a pleasure to watch,, the rest of the cast did a wonderful job too.. so a heist is set in Italy by the team leader.. all goes well,, and time to split up the loot.. well one of our main characters,, our bad guy decides he wants it all, and kills one of the team.. and tries to wipe out the rest of the team as well,, So thinking that they are all dead he returns to L.A. unbeknownst to him only one member of the team died,, now it's time for revenge,, they recruit, Charlize theron ,, a safecracker, to join the team as well,, they slowly plot and plan their revenge on the evil Ed Norton,, who I thought did a great job playing the villain here,, he should get more bad guy roles.. so i'm not gonna give away any endings,, but I will say that there are awesome car chases,, shootouts,, and a memorable ending..",9,2,3,15 July 2013
Footloose," music
","This is the first movie I ever seen in the theater I must have been 13 or 14 when this came out,, and to me it still holds up well, I haven't seen the remake,, nor do I really want to,, this soundtrack is totally amazing, I had to buy it as soon as it came out,, the music fits almost every scene in the movie,, Kevin Bacon star just took off after this movie,, Lori Singer is really beautiful and did some decent acting,, although her character I didn't care for, Chris Penn did a wonderful job,, but John Lithgow steals the show for me. a young man moves to a town where he doesn't know anybody , has to make friends, and finds out that the town has a ban on dancing because of a horrendous accident many years ago,, he has to convince to the town that times have changed . excellent picture,, I never get tired of this movie...",10,7,10,31 July 2013
28 Weeks Later," 28 seconds, minutes, hours, days
","At the beginning of the film i wasn't quite sure what to make of it,, i wasn't even sure that i would like it, but after it got rolling i liked what i say, the reason for this is simple, in this film we follow one character Don, you see him going from a loving father at the beginning, to being infected with Rage and going totally bonkers,, so you see the whole beginning middle and end of Rage following this man and his family.. I liked the plot very much in this one,, again the use of the Military this time wasn't too over - the - top,,, but it was darn close,, i did like the firebombing of District 1 scene,, i prob would have done the same thing, if i had a city full of infected, i'd burn em out,, anyways, I was hooked on this movie after about 15 mins in,, all the way until the end,, which was fantastic,, and that's all i well say on the ending,, but i liked it,, i think compared to the last film , in this one you have more, details about Rage, how it spreads,, the medical side of it, and what can happen..All in all i can't really find anything wrong with this movie,,it's almost as good as the original or as good,, i won't say better,,, but maybe a few percentage points under the original,, but not many.",10,2,5,28 February 2008
Armageddon," time to save the world
","One of my favorite action movies of the 90's if not my favorite of that time period,, Bruce Willis shines in this as Harry Stamper, leader of an Oil Drilling crew. along with Liv Tyler who plays his daughter,, who is actually Steven Tyler's daughter,, Michael Clark Duncan, Will Patton , and Ben Affleck and a host of other notables, the cast was amazing,, the music was awesome,, especially Aerosmith's , Don't wanna miss a thing.. earth is being slammed with a huge asteroid and a cast of oil drilling misfits are sent to save the earth,, also worth mention are Billy bob Thorton and Steve Bucemi, who did an awesome job, this movie has everything that I wanted, great action,, nice one liners.. lot's of laughter, a decent plot, and great music,, will recommend to anyone who likes action,, and a decent storyline.",10,1,2,4 September 2013
21," BlackJack
","Winner , Winner chicken dinner,, now that's said in the movie, when someone hits blackjack, in my 10 plus years in the casino i never heard that once,, must be exclusive to Vegas i guess, the movie is pretty darn good i must say. the last one i seen was Rounders when i was there for the filming of it. Kevin Spacey did a very good job in here as the teacher of the six students who go on to Vegas to take the desert wonder land for millions and millions. Laurence Fishbourne did an okay job , but i felt that he could have done better in it.. the other kids in the movie did a good job,, but never really have seen them in another movie. overall i think it was a pretty darn good casino movie about blackjack and how it is played today.",8,2,5,26 April 2009
The Hills Have Eyes," Craven appoved remake
","Wes Craven approved this remake.. what i find interesting is they shot this in Morocco. As a fan of the original i didn't think that a remake would be able to beat a Wes Craven original masterpiece, now i'm not saying that this one does yet.... that's up for review whenever i get around to watching the both at the same time on two different screens, now i don't believe this is a shot for shot remake, like psycho, or last man standing, but same idea basically, but what i really like about this one is that they have the nuclear testing village, something that wasn't there in the first one,, the idea that the U.S. Government bombed the crap out of that area. and then the mutants fled into the mines,, and then nobody cared about them,, well that's pretty original , and i admired that part of the movie very well, there is a lot of blood and guts in this movie , as you would expect, i love the camera angles in this also, especially where Big Bob is hanging from the tree about to be burned,, ala 'Burning Man festival'. all in all i don't have any complaints really about this movie at all,, it was an experience that Wes is prould of, as he stated on the DVD special features.It wasn't perfect, but pretty darn close.",9,0,2,23 August 2007
American Psycho," strange movie
","wow , this movie was really out there, i mean good in some ways, different from most, say a character piece into the pectic mind of a serial killer,, and sort of like businessman, normal everyday guy, slices up these rich girls for fun and games, this guy leads a seemingly normal life goes to work everyday,, has power lunches,, makes deals , is obsessed with the perfect body, but then comes home and proceeds to slice up 20 something girl,, okay a bit of a stretch,, but like these girls should have like seen this coming,, with his references to Ted Bundy,, Ed Gein,, these girls were totally stupid,, and the character that Reese Witherspoon played was totally shallow,, i did like the character played by Willem Dafoe, the cop who knows that something is up,, very interesting movie,, but sick in a perverse way,, not a movie to let teens watch, especially the unrated version,, this movie will keep you're interest, but not for the faint of heart.",7,2,3,24 February 2008
Knowing," impending doom
","I thought Nicolas Cage did a great job on the movie. the premise is pretty good to.. a man figures out by some sequence of random numbers,, that certain things are gonna happen on a certain date and time,, and wouldn't you know it.. he's right.. people of course don't believe him at first and he is chastised and ridiculed. he goes thru the movie trying to prevent what appears to be the end of the world,, will he save the day , or is it already to late to save mankind,, this movie isn't you're typical disaster flick, It centers more on the predictions, and how the man has to go about figuring out what disaster is gonna happen next and how to stop it,, this movie has lot's of action, thrills, mystery and suspense, I thought it was very well watching and will see it again soon.",7,4,7,11 July 2013
U-571," U-Boat
","Just got done watching this one, for the 2nd time and it gets better every time i see it. I know that it's not fair to compare this to Das Boot my favorite World War 2 movie, but the comparisons are romped on this site, i think this one is just a hair below Das Boot , you can't get any better than that,, but back to this one,, I think that Matthew Mcgonaghey looked well kinda out of place in this one,, i liked Harvey Keitel's performance. Bill Paxton was alright, i liked all of the action scenes, the underwater stuff, the plot line,, the story all of that,, since i'm a sucker for submarine movies, all the intrigue about the Germans was pretty good, but what i think that this film did lack that DAs Boot had was the backstory, and the other scenes that didn't involve the sub ,, like Central Command,, the updates from Headquarters, stuff like that,, but hey other than that i mean this was a terrific movie that really is top of the line, with only a couple of minor flaws.",8,1,7,22 February 2008
The Shining," Here's Johnny
","I have to admit after I watched this as a kid I was totally terrified, I was 10 when this came out, the maze scene at the end is what did it for me,, well 33 years later,, i'm not terrified of the movie anymore, I can appreciate it for what it is, classic horror. Jack Nicholson's finest role or close to it.. Shelley duvuall is excellent as well, Scatman Crothers is wonderful as well,, a writer goes for some peace and quite to an exotic winter hotel , to be the caretaker for the winter so he can get plenty of peace writing his new novel,, unbeknownst to him however the previous caretaker had murdered his wife and children. he get's the job,, and is told what has happened at the hotel.. but it doesn't seem to bother him at all.. his son has the ability to 'Shine', you will just have to watch the movie it's hard to explain,,, anyways, strange things start happening at the hotel as the snow flies and winter set's in,, cabin fever is striking,, I would say this is in the top 10 or 20 of all horror movies ever made.",10,0,2,3 September 2013

","very interesting sci-fi look at the world of robots. and what the world would look like in 2035,, A Chicago detective is called in to investigate a possible murder at a Robotics Lab. The inventor of the robots has either been murdered or jumped out the window and committed suicide,, we don't know yet,, the detective is the only one who doesn't really care for the robots,, and he thinks a robot had something to do with the Professor's death,, but since a robot cannot harm a human being, because it would violate on of the three laws,, It seems highly unlikely that it happened the way he believes it to be. very interesting high - tech look at a futuristic world,, movie has great plot twists,, some action,, some comedy,, a pretty good futuristic movie if you ask me. Will Smith does a great job.",8,0,1,1 August 2013
Over the Hedge," a great movie
","I was totally amazed at how good this movie was, now i've seen a few of the kids movies but not that many, and this was better than any kids movie .. animation that i have seen. Loved the actors/actresses who they got to do the voices here,, Bruce Willis,, perfect choice, Eugene Levy, Gary Shandling,, William Shatner, and yes even AVril Lavigne my daughter's fav. singer. The plot line was very good as well, i mean you have this squirrel who steals food from the bear, get's caught of course, then has 7 days to get all of the food back before the bear get's up from hibernation.. bear woke up early cause the squirrel made such a racket to steal the bear's food. The squirrel then goes into suburbia ... on the other side of the hedge to join up with some of the other animals who were in hibernation to help him with his plan. unbeknown est to them of course,, what a great family movie here, trust me , this is good , and not just for kids, i am usually very leery of animation movies, but this was top notch.",8,1,1,5 November 2007
Wanted," sexy Angelina
","this movie was a thrill ride almost from the start. our main character to be honest with everyone I never heard of.. Angelina Jolie is sexy as ever in this,, bring in Terrance STamp and Morgan Freeman,, that's a recipe for success. our main character an office worker is picked on and bullied by the boss.. well eventually he finds out he is a long lost descendant of a big time killer. he has powers that cannont be perceived by most,, they teach him so many things, that I honestly can't remember them all in here but they were way cool trust, me,, I remember now something about teaching him how to fight,, and shoot,, how to 'curve' bullets, stuff like that. Morgan Freeman plays the head honcho,, all in all a pretty good action thrill ride of a movie,, not to be picked apart and bashed by people expecting this movie to win an Oscar and take it self seriously,, sit back and enjoy the ride people.",7,3,4,10 July 2013

Apollo get's killed by Drago,, and Rocky challenges DRago to the fight for his life. Rocky was coaching Apollo , and Apollo's pride got the better of him it was very sad to see Apollo go down the way he did,, Rocky disappears for awhile to go an train for his fight with drago ,, meantime the Russians are conducting a full media blitz to try and discredit Rocky,,his promotor,, the premier, and so on and so forth,, also Rocky's girlfriend, and his trainer are helping him prepare for the ultimate fight.. The ending fight scenes are tremendous to watch,, technically correct and very realistic. obviously not as good as the first 2 but definitely worth a look,, not that bad actually.",6,0,0,31 July 2013
Face_Off," Face... Off
","This is one of the better action movies of the 90's without a doubt, John Travolta goes over the top in this one,, he faces up against Nicolas Cage,, Gina Gershon is also here in a supporting role, Joan Archer as well,, there is a lot of great action sequences in this one,, Director John Woo, you got to love his super slo-mo action sequences, i don't know how many bullets were fired in this movie , but let me tell you it was a lot,, it's really a neat plot that really has never been shown on film before,, a cop taking the face of the villain,, in order to catch him you must become him,, now i know for a fact,, and i've watched well over 2000 movies i've never ever seen that one before,, this is a great action thriller,, basically the FBI man get's mad cause the killer for hire, kills his son,, then plants a bomb in downtown LA and the fbi man has to try and save the day.",10,1,1,26 April 2009
Dark City," kiefer's city
","this is definitely a strange one, a city encapsuled by some kind of bubble or what have you,, ruled by alien strangers,, you have a dr. played by Kiefer Sutherland who injects patients with something that implants memories of themselves or other people,, our main character has to spend the movie, trying to figure out his life,, what happened is it real or not,, sorta reminds you of Minority Report.. Rufus Sewell did a pretty good job in here, but i think that Kiefer Sutherland stole the show.. i really didn't think too much of Jennifer Connely especially ehr singing if that is what you call it,, not a bad movie,, but very strange, and hard to follow.",5,3,5,30 March 2010
Aliens," back again
","Sigourney Weaver did another remarkable job to the sequel of Aliens,, probably obe of if not the best sequel ever made,, most sequels suck, not this one.. along with Paul Reiser,, Lance Henricksen, Bill Paxton and a host of others , the team goes back to where it all started. but this time something's different,, she will have a trained crew of Marines to go with her with all the firepower she will need, she is very skeptical to go back,, as Paul reiser is the man assigned to convince her to go back,, she agrees reluctantly but only if they can kill the creature and not tinker with it, and save it for research,, lot's of action,, great stunts,, and amazing creature work,, alien was good I think this one may pass the original,, may ,, i'm not sure yet..",8,1,2,13 July 2013
Saw III," the end of a trilogy
","after watching this one, i have to admit that i was lost for a little while, till i started piecing together all ofhte twists and turns that saw III has to offer. i liked the traps especially in this one, they were without a doubt pretty dam clever. it was good to see jigsaw back in action, amanda was way more evil in this one i thought, i especially like the scene with the four pigs, that was pretty cool i must say, overall i th ink that this one does some explaining from the previous two movies, tying together saw 1 and 2 very well, although there are still some loose ends in my mind that need to be tied up, i don't think this one was as good as the first saw, but sequels are so hard to be better than the original, but it was a dam good ride.",6,1,2,17 May 2007
The Usual Suspects," Keyzer Soze
","Gabriel Byrne , Kevin Pollack , Kevin Spacey, just to name a few what an all star cast. I must admit for years I did not see this movie,, sure I wandered what all the buzz was about so I had to give in and give it a try. this story is very hard to follow, so you really have to play close attention. there is a murderer running around,, the mythical Keyzer Soze. he is legendary,, but no one has ever seen him or dare talk about him for fear of retribution. Benico Del Toro is also in the picture and gives a good performance, a bunch of criminals are all lined up, and they proceed to tell their stories of what they believe happened during a series of flashbacks. their stories are murky at best and the viewer is left to decide what really happened, then you have to get to the ultimate question, who is Keyser Soze, and the better question does he exist.... watch and find out,, a very good movie,, but I won't give it a 9 or 10 just yet.",8,0,0,12 July 2013
Die Hard 2," die..much harder
","First reason why this is better than the original.. SNOW.. and lot's of it,, the story is set in Christmas time, so you got to have snow,, love the idea of the bad guys taking over a whole entire airport,, now that is neat, i've been to Dulles more times than i care to remember,, though i don't remember the Annex Skywalk.. so this movie just rocks on all levels,, the bad guys,, and there are lot's of em,, are pretty sneaky, and clever in this one,, Bonnie Bedalia returns as Bruce Ex-wife, but as usual don't have to much to do in here, i loved the fact that Dennis Franz was in this movie,, he is such an underrated actor,, he is so funny, and i love every minute that i see him on the big screen. Bruce has lots of funny moments in this one, he has to be sort of like McGyver in this one,, trying to come up with different ways to outwit the street smart terrorists, and o yeah there is a twist in this movie,, but i can't ruin it ,, in good conscience.",10,42,70,27 May 2008
Independence Day," id4
","gotta love this movie,, Will Smith kicks absolute butt , love Randy Quaid as our resident lunatic kidnapped by the aliens... Vivica Fox merely eye candy.. our story deals with Aliens landing on earth,, now we have to find out what they want. well after that doesn't go so well, we try to fight the, and that doesn't go so well either,, now the President Bill Pullman is left with a choice,, he is taken to one of my favorite places in the whole world...... Area 51. I thought that this was the best part of the entire movie hands down,, I don't know how much was taken from fact or how much Hollywood did in embellishing the whole area 51 deal,, but it was neat to say the least,, here we find the aircraft from Rosewell New Mexico, and the Alien that came with it,, we have to learn about them if we are gonna fight them wouldn't you think, this is an excellent action adventure I thought was worth the perfect 10 rating that I gave it.",10,4,7,5 July 2013
District 9," aliens
","very interesting Sci_Fi movie about Aliens that landed some 20 or more years ago and have been just left in a camp in the middle of a desert in the middle of nowhere, now the government all of a sudden wants them cleared out and to move on,, the government wants to take a look at their weapons and all of the technology that it brings,, the film shows the bond that some of the Aliens have with some of their human counterparts that they must occupy space with,, and not so much about , hey we are being attatcked by the aliens, please help us.. this was definitely a much better film than that.. i feel that in 20 years it will still be a Sci Fi classic,, great film with pretty decent acting,, it helped that there were no stars in the movie..",8,1,2,11 July 2013
Remember the Titans," high school football
","i remember going to h.s. football games with my aunt,, Pennsylvania is a very big football state also. this movie sorta brings back how the feeling was on a cold dark Friday nigh.. Denzel and Will played very well off of each other.. Will originally has the job in 1971 but racial tensions are high, and the board feels they need to put in a black coach,under immense pressure from the state.. enter Denzel,, he is a hard coach,, making the some of the players resent him at first especially the white players who fear they will lose their starting jobs to black players. there are no clan representations in the movie, but a brick does get tossed through the black coaches window.. all in all it is a very heartwarming movie with a lot of nice touches.",7,1,2,24 March 2010
The Pianist," the pianist
","What a mesmerizing film,, watched this the other night on IFC , just simply amazing.. i think that Adrien Brody gave the performance of his entire career with that film. the atrocities that were captured on film are surreal,, these are some of the same things that my mother and grandmother and mom told me about when i was little that they went through,, like the SS coming right up to the door and asking if you were hiding any Jews... the air raids at school,, all that stuff,, the cabinet in the movie that is used to hide Adrien Brody,, i actually have one of those,, it's a one piece and weighs almost a ton.. it's monstrous.. anyway back to the movie,, the landscape was awesome on the other side of the wall,, all of the bombed out buildings,, i really liked the part where the German officer talks to our main character not like a German officer but like a real person would. the movie just fascinated me to the point that it is one of my favorites.. there are a few scenes that might tend to shy people away from this, like the old man getting thrown out the window,, wheelchair and all,, but this is a story of triumph and survival,, and should be seen by young and old alike,,,,",10,0,1,31 December 2009
28 Days Later...," Rage... Bad Temper X 10million
","Wow i was totally blown away by this film for starters, Let's see the empty highways, the scenic spots in London all deserted, I like the very limited use of the soldiers, seen enough movies where soldiers take over and quarantine the area. i like the character of Mahler,, the chained up one infected for 2 days. the daughter of Frank, she was very good in this,, there really is no NAME actors or actresses in this movie and that's what i like, you don't need that for this particular kind of film. 28 days later shows us what probably WILL happen in the not to distant future with diseases, this movie really goes in depth and shows you exactly how the disease came about to be, how it got spread,, then and only then did it skip to the 28 days later. i can't wait for the sequel.",10,5,8,7 December 2007
The Number 23," My Love of Numbers
","First of all i thought that this was probably the best movie that i've seen in quite awhile,, and I'm not a Jim Carrey fan,, never owned one of his movies ever... so with that in mind,, what did it for me is the storyline,, the #23 , i'm a mathematician so the movie i guess has special meaning for me,, i love facts,, anything to do with history,, i love the way the storyline went,, i also loved the idea of Jim Carrey playing 2 characters,, and Virginia Madsen has always been one of my favorite actresses of all time, ever since Buried Alive. i thought the acting was superb,, the sequences were very dark, the scenes very thought out,, i don't think i've ever seen a movie like this before, and that's why i really enjoyed it,, and besides , i can personally relate to this movie, being that i have the fascination for everything numbers,, so a big thumbs up for this movie.",10,3,6,20 February 2008
Ghost Rider," marvel comics
","i bought this movie mainly for the action and story that it presented, my son went to go see this at the theater on opening day. Anyway i thought that Nicolas Cage did a wonderful job as the Ghostrider. Second Sam Elliot was a great lift for the film excellent choice there, but why i ask why does these movies have this stupid love interest in them,, Eva Mendez please.. how about J. Lopez. anyway; the whole story plot seemed very interesting, here you have a man making a deal with the devil. aka. the devil and Daniel Webster. The devil of course will break the deal, so he can sucker the young man in for the rest of his life. now the young man has to somehow defeat the devil in the end. What i liked about the movie is that you had Peter Fonda as Mephistopholes.. then they introduce his son. Blackheart who him and the angels got kicked out of heaven , supposedly by Micheal. Somewhere though the movie got disjointed, and my daughter whose opinion i highly value said the same thing. For instance the whole deal about the caretaker.....towards the end.. black-heart's fight near the end with ghost rider.. it seemed like the movie's storyline jumped at tad to much and felt out of place. also i didn't really care for the ending.The graphics were great, the action, and i love Nicolas Cage, i guess the only reason i am NOT giving this film high marks is that it was so HYPED by the media. that expectations are so high. at least mine was, and i feel that if a movie is hyped to death it needs to be better,, not a bad film, at all, i just expected more.",6,0,2,19 October 2007
The Mist," the mist
","Stephen King strikes again.. the Mist. Frank Darabont directs this one based on a steven king novel. i thought Marcia Gay Harden was the perfect choice for the radical Christian lady spreading her 'word' of god in the grocery store. Thomas Jane in the lead , i got so used to him in Punisher, it took awhile for me to get used to him in this role. as far as the movie itself goes, it's definitely not for everyone there are very strong religious views in this movie, basically the premise is that a 'mist' comes down from the mountain and envelops the town, there is a little mystery of what caused it, you see national guard and police fire vehicles going to what appears to be the mountain,, there is mention that maybe the army caused this mist, an experiment gone wrong, then there's the belief that it's one of the signs and it the end of the world, what is really annoying to me is that every year you get movies that come out in pairs ie happening and mist.. like they want you to compare the two, i have been a stephen king fan for over 20 years and enjoy his work immensely, i enjoyed this movie very much and highly recommend it to anyone as long as you're not to squeamish.",9,1,2,13 October 2009

Gina Gershon, was very good in the movie,, not to mention easy on the eyes,, so was Estella Warren for that matter,, the racing scenes.. jargon between the drivers,, the tension, and the crash scenes were awesome,, to me what stole the show was the gracefully again Burt Reynolds,, he plays race car owner Carl Henry,, he brings in the veteran retired driver to help coach his rookie. sparks fly in the beginning, as you have drama between the two men, first about racing cars,, then about the women themselves,, overall a pretty good racing movie,, with a lot of great stunts and thrills.",7,0,2,12 July 2013
The Game," penn vs. douglas
","What a cat and mouse game this is, between Sean Penn and Michael Douglas,, a company called CRS is involved,, that company is sorta like a reality based dreamscape vacation let's call it,, sort of like vanilla sky,, in a way,, a birtday present from little brother to big brother turns deadly when all ain't what it seems to be in this very deadly Game. you really don't know what's reality and what is the actual game,, throughout the game , Michael Douglas is given clues as to what he has to do next, and which objects that he is given,, obviously his bank account is messed with,, his house,, cameras are putting him under surveillance constantly,, he has to dodge bullets, a drowning in a taxi cab,, lot's of cool stuff,, it makes you wonder what you would do if you were put in a situation like that if it ever occurred. this is a great suspense action movie all the way,, but the best part is that it keeps you guessing till the end,, the en ding should blow away most people.. i know that it did that for me..",10,2,4,11 November 2008
Gran Torino," Mr. Eastwood
","Once again time after time Clint Eastwood writer director actor producer whatever, he wears all the hats and get's the job done. this movie is a movie about life , you really can't fit it into say a category. there's sad moments, and laughs, not much on fast paced action because it doesn't need to be,, Clint plays a man just trying to keep to his business on his front porch,, when local thugs try breaking into his garage to steal his Gran Turino. from reading past reviews I guess a lot of people didn't care for all of the Asian slurs,, I didn't mind them they weren't that bad,, his character has a right to say them because he fought against them in the war. this movie has a lot of depth character and raw emotion,, something you always get from an Eastwood film,, his acting was pretty decent too, sure it's sad to see Clint get older,, but he seems to be getting better with age as a fine wine,, I liked the movie all the way up until..... the end..",9,0,2,7 July 2013

Mary Steenburgen comes along in this last installment of the series,, I would really have to watch this 3rd installment at a later time to give everyone a more fair assessment of this movie,, loved the first two,, i'll have to give this one another look in a few years..",5,1,4,30 December 2013

Edward Norton was okay in this one,, Jessica Biel okay i guess, the movie to me didn't have enough action in it, yeah some of the trick were nice, and the movie was funny at times, but i was just like there is something that just don't make since in this film,, maybe i have to rewatch it to understand it better, the premise was okay, but i felt cheated somewhat that the movie didn't go in a different direction i guess, overall i guess i was very disappointed with this movie, there's really not that much else to say about it .",5,0,2,19 April 2008

","Pi is one of these movies that is very raw,, definitely indie,, which i love very much,, course i'm into numbers, so if you're not , then well you probably won't like this one,, a mathematician is obsessed with finding and unlocking the numerical code to the stock market,, it is also supposedly linked to the Hebrew religion,, in the movie,, there are mentions of famous mathematician's,, Fibernacci,, Euclid,, just no Einstein mention at all,, all in all it's a good interesting flick,, with a great musical score,, it definitely keeps you very interested. the movie itself,, deals in paranoia somewhat,, some sort of self abuse whether it be the pills,, or the physical, abuse or torture, that this crazed genius is putting himself through, although hard to watch in some points i agree, but it's very thought provoking,, and touching in points as well,, i think that it's a very dark movie,, one that has to be watched from a certain point of view,, not all will get this movie,, but i'm happy with it..",8,0,1,10 November 2008
Jerry Maguire," show me the money
","Tom Cruise plays a big time professional Agent signing the big names. supposedly it's loosely based on a major professional real life agent. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a highly skilled football player who just wants to get paid,, hence the phrase and catchline... 'Show me the Money'. or as Prime Time Deion Sanders would say,,, Pay the Man.. this is a story about how much our sports agent will take and go thru to make his clients happy,, it seems he will have to sell his soul in order to please them,, he decides that working for the agency he's had enough,, and he starts his own agency and takes a beautiful young helper with him,, together they start up his own business, of him being a free lance agent. he tries to spend time at home, as his job requires him to be away a lot, and it just isn't working out for him,, his client keeps bugging him about his new contract deal,, and wanting to get paid.. this movie takes a look at a different sides of sports... very interesting,, just I think Cruise wasn't up to his usual great performance in this one.",6,1,1,4 September 2013
Mission: Impossible II," i disappear
","I really liked this one better than the original,, the original was good but this is soo much better. the action sequences super slo-mo the Woo-ism's,, John Woo kicks ass. Tom Cruise is at it again as he is trying to stop a deadly disease from being sold on the black market and infecting the entire world,, he goes up against Dougray Scott who plays the bad guy,, Thandie Newton wasn't bad to look at either,, Anthony Hopkins plays Jim Phelps,, wish he would have had more screen time. and Ving Rhames is at his usual witty best,, I loved all of the action scenes, especially the flying motorcycle scene at the end,, the music kicked butt too especially Metalicca's I Disappear.. excellent movie, great direction,, great music,, and lo'ts of John Woo classic hand to hand action, and stunts, with super slo mo..",8,3,5,10 August 2013
World Trade Center," true story
","First i would like to say that i'm very surprised to see Nicolas Cage in this type of movie, and i give him credit for tackling this role it must not have been very easy to accept a role like this. Anyway here goes. great opening lead ins. great footage of different part of N.Y.C. and surrounding area, as i'm very familiar with it, i was in New York City.. lower, and midtown, Manhattan, twice 95 for a day, and once in 96, spent the night,, i drove.... anyway point being i got to see the towers before they came down, and after they were repaired during the 93 attack. back to the movie here, i love the way Oliver Stone portrayed the attack, and didn't show the actual plane,, just the shadow,, the building falling, all of that footage was good,,, the part that just gets me to know end is why in a movie, when a true story is portrayed, why don't they give you hmm in this one, i wanted more, rescuers, rescuing survivors,, or trying to,, i wanted to see firefighters, putting out fires, police trying to help, instead i got a pair of Transit Authority cops stuck 20-50 ft. below the concourse. but Stone focused on that, and nothing else. maybe that was his intention i guess, i just hoped to see like some dramatic rescue attempts,, y ou know stuff like that, and being stuck on one group of persons, just knocked the film down a few points for me,, but otherwise i don't have a problem with it.",6,0,2,17 September 2007
The Insider," Whistle Blower
","I was kind of surprised that Michael Mann directed this,, usually his films have tons more action in them, that being said , I guess this isn't' sposed to be an action movie, it's about a Whistle Blower in the Tobacoo Industry,, a scientist who discovers what the big boys are up to trying to hook the American public into smoking cigarettes, and what deceptive practices and lying that they do,, such as spiking the cigarettes. he get's fired from Big Tobacco and has to sign a confidentiality agreement, saying that he wont' release secrets,, at first he doesn't want to but later agrees,, but then the company adds on more stuff to the agreement,, then he end up not signing it and the company goes after the ex employee,, sending him vicious notes in the mail, and fire bombing his house,, he goes to a reporter from 60 minutes for help,, not a bad movie,, just slow moving in parts,, a little hard to watch at times.",6,0,1,10 August 2013
Into the Wild," Alaska, here i come
","Wow, that's all i can really say,, this movie is an Epic of great proportions, it tells a very captive story.. that will hold you to the edge of you're seat the whole entire movie. this is the kind of movie that you cannot possibly pull yourself away from. Emille Hirch is great in here as a 24 yr old who runs away from his problems,, and hitchikes his way all the way to Alaska. yes the story is a long one , but i believe it has to be , because it has a lot to tell. Along the way Chris meets a lot of interesting characters,, such as Vince Vaughn's character, just to name a few,, Hal Holbrook also is in this film, Eddie Vedder's music in here just seems to hit the spot for this kind of movie, it doesn't detract from the movie,, it just seems to blend right in there,, all in all i th ink that this is an important movie that should be seen by all of the American public, cause it has something important to say to everyone.",10,0,3,17 August 2008
Taken," taken
","first off i think that Liam Niesen was great in this movie,, i don't think that he was miscast at all,, the film begins with his estranged daughter begging for her father to sign a permission slip for her to go to Paris,, she's underage so.. to make a long story short, she lies to her dad about the truth of her little party vacation,, and well it get's her into a whirl of trouble,, once at the airport the girls are tricked, then when they get back to the hotel, that's when the fun starts,, kim's friend is kidnapped, and kim is taken shortly after that, but not before she has a chance to call dear old dad to the rescue,, she gives him just enough information to go on before she is taken away. he proceeds to go underground below the radar as a one man wrecking crew to find his daughter, this movie has lot's and lot's of action,, good plot,, moves fairly quickly , pretty good action movie for anyone.",9,2,2,30 August 2009
Mission: Impossible," espionage
","first off I loved the uncredited role that Emilio Estevez had,, Jean Reno was awesome in a supporting role,, Hollywood tries the ultimate mission,, to re do the mission impossible series on TV in to a movie. Tom cruise plays the leader of the group Ethan Hunt.. his whole crew get's killed,, and their's a mole inside the department,, now on his own and with no one from the department to help him,, he must recruit some old friends if he wants to find out what really happened to his team and who killed them,, his is after a noc list, which is a list of agents,, code names ,, matched with their real names,, and if the bad guys get ahold of this list,, everyone will be in serious jeopardy,, not a bad action adventure,, I think for the most part Holllywood got it right..",7,0,0,1 August 2013
From Hell," who is Jack the Ripper
","i've always been fascinated by jack the ripper ever since i was a kid whether it was movies or TV programs about him. the story takes place in London 1888, where Jack is slaying prostitutes in a wealthy area of London. there has always been a great mystery as to who is jack the ripper was it someone connected to the prince for his indiscretions, was it a commoner,, or a laborer, tradesmen,, maybe a doctor,, well i'll guess we'll never know. Johnny Depp does a decent job as Inspector Aberline trying to figure out just who is Jack the Ripper,, although it is a fairly decent tale, the movie yet seems to be so convoluted with needless scenes , sometimes i didn't know which way to turn, there should have been a few scenes taken out cause they really didn't need to be there in the first place. i think maybe Depp was a little over his head on this one.",6,2,4,12 April 2009
Reservoir Dogs," Are you gonna bark all day little doggie,,,,,,,,or are ya gonna bite
","This is probably the most funniest, hilarious, raucously, saracastic, witty crime caper EVER made, one of my top 15 0r 20 movies of ALL TIME. i recite the lines to the movie just out of habit,, been a fan of Quentin's ever since this film,, everybody seems to copy him, this film started all the scene jumbling, Quentin hit on something there, and people to this day are trying to repeat his sucesses,, There ain't enough time to tell ya all the good this movie is,, Michael Madsen was great, as Blonde, STeve Buscemi, what a wonderful actor,, as PINk, never really knew blue ..Eddie Bunker, i'm a big Harvey Keitel fan,, so he was great. every actor, heck even the cop that get's his ear hacked off did a good job, if i wasn't soo tired right now, i'd write till the bottom of the page, go see this film it is IMPORTANT. to watch, add it to you're collection, it's a keeper, it's been in my top 10-20, for 15 years, and ain't likely ever gonna change, the biting sarcasm is a winner, 90% of the film was filmed in the warehouse, which was a mortuary. This movie is one of true great movies in the last 40 years, and should be treated as so,, i have nothing bad to say about this movie whatsoever, it is the perfect movie.",10,0,2,2 January 2008
Inside Man," perfect heist movie
","Denzel Washington keeps getting better and better. And Spike Lee ain't bad either. Jodie Foster had a good spot in the movie , but could have been longer, more lines written for her. Clive Owen stole the show as the bad guy robber. Willem Dafoe was pretty good in there too . It was nice to see Christopher Plummer too. i really enjoyed the plot twists. the only thing that i didn't like and this was the only thing was about the flasback interviews with the hostages during the middle of the movie, other than that it was pretty much the perfect movie,, yes there are some un answered questions to the untrained eye, that i didn't pick up on till the last minute, there was slick references to t he movie Dog Day Afternoon, which i still have to buy. The planning that went into this heist was perfect , i mean the uniforms for the hostages to wear. the spraying of the cameras. the loud music, the bugging of the pizza box. also bugging the police van, very elaborate, i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.",9,1,2,2 September 2007
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," tom,soap,bacon,and Eddie
","I never thought that i would like an English caper comedy,, but once again i was wrong,, delightfully so this time,, Guy Ritchie has come up with a full blown masterpiece of cinema. This is Jason Statham's first picture, he plays a odd character named 'Bacon'. along with Soap, who likes to keep his hands clean , Eddie the card shark,, and Tom the businessman, the four proceed to rip off London's elite underground criminals,, in order to get 500,000 quid to pay back Hatchet Harry, a man who owns a small porn industry, Eddie's dad won a bar from Harry, and now Harry wants the bar back, there are at least 4 different groups of criminals in this one,, Eddie's gang, Winston's gang,, Hatchet Harry's goons,, and Rory Breaker's thugs, the funny thing in this movie is that really no one really knows who is stealing from who in this one,, and there are lot's of surprises and turns in this movie,, you don't see a lot of it coming,, there are other fascinating characters in this one also,, like Barry the Baptist,, that's Harry's henchman,, Big Chris,, Nick the Greek,, just to name a few. the music is also very good here, and for a film being shot in London , you don't get that touristy feeling , a perfect crime caper that will make you laugh so hard you won't believe it.",10,2,5,29 August 2008
The Da Vinci Code," the bible.. fact or fiction?
","Well talk about a movie to really make you think, well folks this is it. I mean the Bible, Jesus,Mary Magdeline, the Pope, just to name a few, the Knights Templar, The Crusades. It's a lot to take in but let's try, I can buy the fact that their could be a conspiracy i mean just look at the Catholic Church, now i was raised protestant, and haven't been to church in many years, after being made to go as a kid, but the point is, the corruption in the church, Jesus was 33 when he died, you mean to tell me he never had sex,, course he did, he was mortal i believe, him having a kid, i'll buy that much. I liked the first 1:45 of the movie, then well it seemed to me that too much was revealed at the wrong time, making it less than suspenseful after that. I loved the character of Silas, played by Paul Bettany, Tom Hanks character i liked very much. seeking the truth, very studious, always thinking, i respect that. I absolutely think Jean Reno shined in this movie, he is one of the best French actors today. I think that this movie came too quickly after the book, I haven't read the book, but i will someday. The movie took us to magical places. Westminster Abby, the Louvre, just to name 2 . All in all like i said a great thriller, mystery. lots of intrigue, for the first hour and forty five mins.. after that well, it just didn't work for me. but that's me.",7,1,4,19 September 2007
The Happening," the happening
","first off let me say that this is much much better than lady in the water, maybe not quite sixth sense or signs, but pretty good nonetheless. the eerie tension that builds up throughout the movie is very good M. Night said that he set out to create a 'b' movie of the 70's well if that was the case he suceeded overwhelmingly. i thought that the horror and suspense were classic Night. The perfomrnace of John Leguizamo was pretty darn good. Zoey Deschanel not quite sure about her performance, felt though as if she wasn't really trying in her role. it is interesting given the situation with the world today that this movie comes out now.. greenhouse gases, global warming, swine flu, bird flu,, maybe M. Night foretells of things to come here on earth. overall i thought this was a pretty decent and very graphic movie.",7,0,2,2 September 2009
Zombieland," comedy land
","I never thought that you could put comedy in a Zombie movie,, but they pulled it off, kudos to everyone that helped make that happen,, Bill Murray steals the show with his cameo,, Woody Harrelson was awesome,, and Amber Heard,, well she's just sexy.. a group of people try to get where they are going,, a man to Ohio, a couple of girls to an amusment park so and so forth,, along the way they encounter countless zombies as America has been overrun with zombies for more than 30 years. I love the guy's 30 rules for surviving,, my fav.. double tap,, meaning two shots to the head of any living zombie,, this is by far the funniest zombie movie out there, it actually had a decent plot,, great acting and awesome make up and effects.. what a good movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",9,0,2,15 July 2013
Enemy at the Gates," Great War Movie
","This is one of my favorite all time War movies in general, maybe because it's different two snipers vs each other is the main point to the whole movie,, yes there is a love interest in the movie and probably could have done without it,, but hey other than that.. you have Ed Harris as the Major, who is sent out by the Fuhrer himself to eliminate the top Russian Marksman,, Vasily Zietzsev. Jude Law was excellent i thought as the Russian Hero.. his love interest is Rachel Weisz who is cute and nice to look at it, but a war is the wrong place for a love story,, the two characters play cat and mouse practically the whole movie,, the scenes of the Luftwaffe when they attack on the Volga River are totally awesome i thought,, the special effect,, bullets flying,, everything was realistic i thought, the movie is very tense and well put together,, the struggle for Stalingrad in the Fall / Winter of 1942 early 1943. Stallingrad gets overrun by German's and the villagers left to survive help Zietzev in his quest for fame by trying to eliminate the German Major,, Harris doesn't appear till the 34 min. mark but is very effective all the way to the ending of the movie. There is some treachery, and backstabbing,, going on in the movie,, some people that you thought you could trust,, you can't,, i liked Bob Hoskins character prob the most, as Nikita Krushchev,, what a riot he was,, so all things considered this is a great movie,, not really to be missed at all.",10,2,4,11 February 2008
The Departed," Best Mafia movie since Goodfellas
","Wow this movie really takes you're breath away. What an all-star cast, you have Jack Nickolson, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Anthony Anderson, Matt Damon, and Leonardo DiCaprio. i think i like Leo's character the best though,, there are a lot of plot twists in this one,, i think this is also probably Jack Nickolson's best work in a very long time, this kind of role seems to suit him, Mark Wahlberg's character was very intriguing too, Matt Damon did a fairly decent job here, this is much better than the Good Shepard,, which Leonardo passed on wisely.. This gangster movie has it all,, people getting thrown off of roofs,, blood splattering everywhere,, hey i almost forgot Martin Sheen is also in this,, and he did a superb job as well, i think this is the best since Goodfellas, this movie has a lot of twists like i said,, i won't ruin the ending,, but you will be in suspense right up until the end, no matter who you choose to root for,, all in all i have to give this movie a very big thumbs up.",10,2,4,28 June 2008
Die Hard," Die Hard
","Bruce Willis kicking butt. what more could you ask for, i liked the character of Hans Gruber, and some of the other villains, of the 4 die hard films, this however was not my favorite, maybe cause it's L.A. anyways Bonnie Bedalie did okay in this movie,, i liked the character of the limo driver Argyle,, you know like the socks.. i think Bruce should have had a one liner to go with that one,, this movie has a lot of action, things getting blown up,, gunplay you name it,, this was the one that started it all, and inspired 3 sequels to date. this movie is set in Christmas time, but you don't see much Christmas stuff happening,, they should have set it in say Chicago or something like that,, would have had the same effect, i mean you have skyscrapers in Chicago,, but that's just me,, overall though the movie does rock,, and Bruce is very funny in it.",7,1,4,25 May 2008
30 Days of Night," 30 nights in Barrow
","What a brilliant concept for the movie, to have it set in Barrow, Alaska where there is no sun for 30 days,, perfect setting for the vampires, heck even in the movie one of the vampires says to the other hey we should have done this centuries ago.. i agree. i've never quite seen a vampire movie like this, and i've seen a lot in my time. Josh Hartnett did a fair job in this one as the lead, he plays the sheriff. the plot line isn't to bad, didn't care for the ex, bs. but hey , this movie is about vampires taking over an entire town for 30 days and nights with no sun. The look of the vampires in this one is different from most movies that i've seen,, they actually speak some kind of Draconian language in this one too, never seen that before either, also the vampires are really super quick and fast in this movie,, that's another first, ain't never seen a Vampire run so fast in a movie before.. all in all i think most horror buffs should like this movie, and i don't see why they wouldn't , there's even a slick character reference to Bela Lugosi in this one.",10,2,5,18 May 2008
Die Hard with a Vengeance," die the hardest you ever died
","Wow this film has it all,, i love it when Bruce argues with the Samaritan, the quickest way south is not Park Drive,, it's 'through the park... and of course Lt. McClane is just one step away from being a full blown alocholic,, love the opening scene where Bonwith Tellers get's blown to pieces, then Simon makes McClane walk around Harlem with that 'Sign' around his neck,, and the backup , drops back 10 blocks,, police captain says John we'll be back to pick you up in 15 mins,, he says, don't worry i expect to be dead in 4. Samuel Jackson,, this was to me one of his greatest roles of all time,, playing opposite of Bruce,, was the bomb. Jeremy Irons,, plays a great bad guy,, now this time i think that the accent for the villain was very good. i loved the idea of all the riddles in the movie,, made for some interesting watching,, i was so happy with this one.. and you're a retard if you don't like this one,,",10,0,1,28 May 2008
Con Air," awesome
","one of the best action movies in the last 20 years, seems like Hollywood can't make an action movie like this anymore. An Army Ranger who comes home after serving his time in the military, get's into a fight one night and kills someone,, ordinarily it's self defense,, but since he's a Ranger, his hands are considered a lethal weapon,, so it's manslaughter. he serves his time,, get's his parole, and get's put on a military transport plane, just so happens the plane he's on is carrying the most deadliest criminals of current day, they are rounded up from prisons all over the country to put them in a 'super max' prison for the worst of the worst,, the men take over the plane,, and from that point it's mayhem as they try to get away from the law. the law is played by John Cucack, who was excellent in this picture,, among the villains are John Malcovich,, Ving rhames, Steve Buscemei,, Danny Trejo, just to name a few,, loved this movie ,, it's moves at 100 mph for the most part, and was fun to watch.",10,0,0,26 July 2013

","brilliant film about a sniper who gets left for dead, not to mention his partner, the spotter who get's killed, the American government typically ain't supposed to be in a certain country, can't acknowledge the mission, and leave a man behind,, obviously he is quite perterbed at the government, and quits the army , 3 years later , wow all of a sudden the Army needs him,, they con him back into service to stop a potential presidential assassination, the kill is supposed to be from over a mile away,, and of course only a handful of men in the world could actually make that shot, this is where he comes in,, he is supposed to scout locations from where the afformentioned sniper will take his shot,, his choices are baltimore, washington d.c. , and philadelphia.. anyway to make a very long story short,, the assassination goes off, but he is framed for it,, and he has to go into hiding,, and gather information, and weapons, to try to figure out why the government set him up. great movie.",10,0,3,7 September 2009
The Good Shepherd," The Bad Sheperd
","Wow i was totally freaking disappointed with Robert Deniro the way this movie was cast, Matt Damon's acting was wooden at best , he was all wrong for the role,, Angela Jolie,, come on people she can't disappear into any character these days,, Alec Baldwin done the best he could,, Deniro seemed to have gained 40 lbs for this small appearance in the movie,, it was just horribly miscast,, There was very little action,, i was bored out of my mind,, so unbelievable,, just god awful i thought,, i wasn't glued to my seat or anything like that,, just thinking to myself , when the heck is it going to end,, it wasn't the worst movie ever, but for a cast like that, it got was overbilled , and highly overrated,, i think someone like Ed Norton could have done a much better job,, how bout Julianne Moore, did anyone catch Joe Pesci's cameo in there,, dang he got old,, anyway i really in good conscience recommend this one to anyone,, it's boring as heck,, and i darn near fell asleep watching it,, shame on you Bobby you can direct something better than this shlock.",3,0,3,29 February 2008

","A man is sent to prison and has to learn to adapt to prison life,, there he meets a wise old gentleman who he befriends, and there friendship grows immensely. along the way he meets different prison characters, all of which are very likable... adapted from a short short by Steven King,, this is a powerful movie,, showing prison life in the early 20 th century. Tim Robbins was wonderful in this and should have won an award,, Morgan freeman is captivating in his role as 'Red' , Our main character, Andy Dufrene plans a prison break and needs the help of several of the inmates.. I wont' say what happens after his attempted prison break,, but this is a touching movie, with a lot of character development, and not much on the action,, but it really doesn't need to have a lot of action,, lot's of humor abound, a movie about growing up in person, and the people that you might, and the life struggles of being in prison,, excellent movie.. but not the greatest of all time,,, I can think of at least 10 better .",8,1,1,31 July 2013
Back to the Future Part II," Continium
","close to being as good as the original,,, just a small cute below,, everyone is back except for Crispin Glover,,, Elisabeth Shue is now in the movie,, Fox, LLoyd, Thompson all reprise their roles,,, they pick up right where they left off in this first one,, going from 2015 to 1955 to change the events of time before they actually happen,, and everything seems to have worked perfectly except for one small problem,, through their greedy efforts they have tore a hole in the time space continuum and the world hang's in the balance,, unless they can go back in time one more time, and fix things the way they were,, Michael J. Fox.. plays his original character,,, his son , and daughter,, so lots of extra work for him,, Christopher Lloyd shines as usual,, and the beautiful Elisabeth Shue gives a decent performance,, nto to be outdone by the veteran Lea Thompson,, all in all not a bad sequel at all, I think the storytelling was perfect for this one,, and the lightning strike scenes were just totally awesome.",8,1,2,30 December 2013
1408," Cusack in a Horror Film
","My daughter seen this one in the there when it first came out, and she told me that it was lame, too corny,, well i watched the previews, took her review with a grain of salt and bought it,, The first half of the movie is pretty good no doubt.. i think most people would agree,, now some of the stuff that happens in the second half of the movie, well we've seen before, and is quite over the top,, i think a lot in the movie was never fully explained, or left too much to the imagination. supposedly this was based on the writings of Stephen King,, well whoever the heck did the screenplay failed somewhere, cause i own many Stephen KIng books,, and his books are better than this,, and lot's of his adaptations have turned out better than this. Anyway back to the movie,, John Cusack had to carry this movie on his back practically the whole way,, yeah Samuel Jackson was in the movie,, but not nearly long enough,, he has a great screen presence and should have had more stuff to do in the movie, i think the movie had the right idea,, but got stuck in the trap of too many special effect and not enough actually scares,, not bad but could have been much better.",7,0,1,2 March 2008
Raging Bull," Deniro
","first off I liked the movie very much,, I don't think it was Deniro's finest , but he was very good to say the least.. I like Cathy Moriarty in here also,, Joe Pesci is you're basic tough guy you just have to have in a movie like this,, the movie is about a boxing champ Jake laMotta from the 1950's I believe . lot's of good stock boxing footage, but most of the movie revolves around Jake's personal life, and how throughout the movie his life slowly starts to disintegrate around him,, he especially treats his wife like crap, it's really hard to feel any sympathy towards the character after you see just what happens to his wife in several of the scenes.. I also love the entire length of the movie being shot in black and white,, I don't' know why it was done that way but I like it,, another Scorcese DeNiro, success,, it's a sad story,, but very good .",7,2,4,10 July 2013

Cameron Diaz what a hottie in this,, and of course Tom's wife Penelope.. is very hott to,, it was said in the special feautures on this disc, that as off 2001 that this is the movie that Tom Cruise is most proud of.. and i can see why,, it's sorta like a dream,, some flashbacks,, kinda like a great riddle or mystery as to whether or not he killed so and so,, or at what point is he dreaming or is it actually real,, what a great movie to see over and over again.",10,0,1,11 June 2009

","in this one we go back to before James Bond was a 00 and had a License to Kill. this is a re make of Casino Royal 67 not considered in the Bond library. Daniel Craig is hard edged, tough in you're face and downright plain nasty. reminds you of the original Bond, .. Mr. Sean Connery, not since Connery has Bond been this tough,, the opening sequence was awesome. tell a lot about the early Bond. we go to Casino Royal where Bond is set to play a high stakes poker game with one of our main bad guys,, if he wins that won't look good because it will look like he's showing off and showing up the bad guy,, solution lose one and see what happens next.. this was a little hard to follow but i'm sure that when I watch it again I will begin to put the pieces together,, I think Daniel Craig should be Bond for awhile,, next bond definitely Jason Statham.",7,0,2,12 July 2013
The Deer Hunter," Best Vietnam War movie Ever.....
","First of all this should be in the top 50,, it is the best Vietnam era film ever made bar none,, better than Apocalypse , or Full Metal Jacket. Christopher Walken shines in his supporting role. Meryl Streep well what can i say,, she looks so beautiful in this,, and boy can she act. Robert Deniro is the king of actors , he prooves it in this one time and time again as 'Michael'. The movie is basically in 3 parts,, you have the beginning where there's some steel mill scenes,, a wedding,, a reception,, and some deer hunting,, then the boys go off to Vietnam,, proceed to get captured,, bust there way out,, then what follows is the aftermath of what happened there,, and what effect it had on the soldiers there, and the people back home. there are so many good quality scenes here i can't begin to list them all, being from a steel town and growing up there i know the attitude of the people that come from there,, the music in this film is classic too,, Too Good To Be True,, is my favorite love song,, and y ou here almost 2 minutes of it in the movie,, this movie is so intense , it leave you rooting for everyone,, a lot of time is spent on character development,, which most times i don't care for,, but oh not in this case,, you really care for the characters,, because i think that they are portrayed so well, and 'real',, like common folk.. lots of people work in steel mills,, and some did go off to Vietnam,, so a lot of this movie is based on realism,, interesting was them portraying the Fall of Saigon,, which was kinda neat to see,, this film goes beyond and war movie that i seen,, this is probably the best War movie ever,,,bar none,, if i could rate this a 15 i would.",10,1,3,1 August 2008
Identity," i.d.
","Wow what a sleek, stylish thriller. This one is not to be missed, this is the kind of film that the great Alfred Hitchcock would be proud off. 10 characters one motel,, ie.. like the Bates Motel sort of... anyways, the roads are flooded, and people start dying one by one,, and of course you have no idea who is doing the killings or why, where's the motive? John Cusack shines in his role as a Limo Driver as Ed. Ray Liotta also gives a gritty performance worth of an Oscar i believe, Amanda Peet, what can you say, sexy as ever, and can act, the rest of the cast is pretty decent as well, especially TEd Mcginley. The movie is very different than most thriller who dunnit's it's got some horror mixed in, some great one liners, for comedical zing, I loved the shots of the rain in the movie,, it's sort of like one of the characters. overall there really ain't nothing wrong with this movie, cept it pushes the envelope for how many plot twists you can use in a particular film i think.",10,2,4,8 December 2007
Beowulf," legendary Beowulf
","I really enjoyed this movie,, having heard this when I was a kid all of the horrible stories I heard as a kid about the monster. Ray Winstone did a nice job in this picture as our hero,, Anthony Hopkins,, and Angela Jolie are also in the picture, they did okay I guess. I really like the whole mysthical story of our hero having to go up against the monster Grendel, who is terrorizing villages, and people left and right with no remorse, an epic battes ensues where Beowulf must face of against Grendel,, after defeating Grendel all seems well now,, flash forward, and someone is upset that there son is dead.. now you got Grendel's mother to deal with,, and boy is she mad. Played by Angela Jolie,, I wont give away any endings , as you will have to watch on you're own and tell me what you think.. overall this was a really good movie with lot's of action and thrills.",7,1,1,13 July 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard (Drive4),,
","This computer movie took a little getting used to for me,, yeah some thing s i could have possibly done without,, too much computers,, to o much Bruce looking stupid,, hey our hero ain't never supposed to look stupid,, but hey , then i got to thinking that,, hey hey's human,, not freaking superhuman,,, his daughter in the movie,, is a carbon copy of my step-daughter 15 going on 26 , teen angst,, anyway,, to the movie,, i love the cast of relatively young stars, teaming up with Bruce to make a kick ass movie,, the special effects in this movie are pretty good to say the least,, the locations, the scouting for the picture all seem to be very good, the one liners that Bruce has are very good,, although i wish that Bruce had more of em this time,, i mean i like this one very much,, and i'ts funny as heck, just something missing i guess the violence,, or the guns,, the killer instinct.. something ain't there this time,, now don't get me wrong this movie is still a 10 compared to most out there, but compared to the series 1-3 then i would go a 9 , but hey folks, i'm not going there, Bruce does give an excellent performance, as a 20 year police veteran,, marriage turned sour,, teen daughter who hates him,, , why is this so familiar,, Deja Vu,, here,, anyway,, Thanks to the directors, writers, and Bruce most of all for kicking Cyber Terrorism in the teeth,,",10,1,3,11 February 2008
Final Destination," flying
","First off if you're afraid of flying do not watch this movie. I've flown all of my life so it doesn't bother me in the least. A teenager of a class trip to France has a premonition that the plane they are on will explode, so him and 6 others get off the plane,, the plane then of course explodes,,shortly thereafter the survivors each must cheat death, as death doesn't like to be cheated, death comes after each one of them and it has a plan,, the students must figure out a way to cheat death. but first they have to figure out who is next in order to cheat it. very exciting movie, thrilling, lot's of cool death scenes tons of action,, some laughs,, wish I would have seen more of Sean William Scott but still I enjoyed the movie very much, would recommend to anybody that isn't afraid of flying.",8,0,0,26 July 2013
Munich," true story
","at first when i looked at the box and seen 2:44 run time i was like oh no,, i'll be bored, but to my delight i was not. the only thing that i wish that they would have done in this movie is shown more of the planning involved in the actual killing of the hostages at the Olympic area, other than that i liked the movie in general with few complaints. the object was to kill those responsible for munich , 11 of them i believe, there is also a mention of Carlos the Jackal midway through the movie. i thought it was funny that the team leader of the assassain group was a chef, you had the bomb maker,, the identity fixer, and the guy who cleans up other people's messes. on the whole the movie seemed to be very accurate in fact, based on a book written in 1984. there is lo'ts of blood and gore in this one, some action, but not as much as i would have liked, from a historical point of view i think it was a good movie, just bugged me where they started the movie,, they s hould have started say like the day before, but enjoyable throughout, with only one or two parts that should have stayed on the cutting room floor.",6,1,4,29 June 2007
Casino," Casino,,, vegas style
","First i don't think that this is a sequel to Goodfellas in any way shape or form,, I loved this movie from start to finish,, i am a big Deniro/Pesci fan,, i loved seeing Don Rickles in here as well,, Sharon Stone was hot in here as per usual. This movie is based on a true story as well,, It takes place in the 70's at the Vegas heyday,, when the mobsters were right in the thick of things in the Casino industry,, the Teamsters Pension fund to be exact.. The cast of characters in this movie is just endless,, like James Woods a small role, but very effective in here. The plot is very good ,, the bosses give Sam 'Ace' Rothstein a casino to run,, hire a front man,, to make things look on the up and up,, and then the midwest bosses start skimming the casino,, ie. doing short counts,, losing fill slips... and what really does it for me, is the accuracy of filming in the count room,, i used to get in the count room when i worked the casino's 'back east' in the late 80's and 90's, and it's pretty accurate,, cept for maybe the guy in the suit coming in and walking back out,, that would never happen,but hey,, it's pretty accurate,, the hard count room,, soft count room,, the cage,, all of that is real casino stuff,, i spent 10 years in one.. anyway back to the movie,, i thought that it was wonderful,, Robert Deniro has all of the class , charm , and charisma you could ask for ,, Joe Pesci,, steals the shows for me,, as the muscle in the movie,, i mean puttting a man's head in a vice,, very neat idea ,, if you wanna get information out of him,, all in all i would recommend this movie to anybody who is a fan of gangster movies.. 10 of 10 for me.",10,2,3,5 July 2008
Heat," Deniro vs. Pacino
","This is a great Crime Saga,, along with Crime Story,, also by Michael Mann, this is one of the great crime movies to come along,, why you ask,, 2 reasons,, a. it's deniro and pacino in the same movie,, b. the greatest street shoot-out scene ever in my opinion,, the coffee shop scene also,, everything is just so high octane,, Val Kilmer gives the performance of his life,, save, 'the Doors'. Kilmer hasn't been in anything really good since doors, and Heat, Tom Sizemore is great in this movie as well,, here you have a very young teenage, cutie,, the step-daughter,, Natalie Portman,, you also have,, a very hot Ashley Judd,, and a host of other character that i just can't remember em all,, but the ensemble was very good in fact,, i liked the idea that the robberies or heists as you call them,, were in this case referred to as 'Scores', high end robberies.. you know what's coming,, it's cops and robberies,, Deniro and Pacino style,, there is nothing really wrong with the movie,, as i've seen it at least 4 times , and probably will watch at least once a year for the next 20 years,, it's that good folks,, let me tell you. open and shut case..",10,1,3,17 July 2008
The Replacements," awesome
","I love this movie.. and here's why first of all it's based on a true story even though the No Fun League ...NFL will never admit it,, 1987,, 4 plus years removed from a total work stoppage, this time the players get greedy, and of course want more money,, they want their share of the pie, that the NFL is holding onto. Keanu Reeves plays 'Footsteps Falco'.. gotta love that nickname,, he is a QB that had an awful game at the Sugar Bowl lost 45-0 and has since went into hiding,,, Gene Hackman is wonderful as coach Joe McGinty,, together the two just give such a wonderful performance,, the cheerleaders in this movie,, are like the best iv'e ever seen,, pretty, sexy,, and seductive,, catch some of their moves during the game. what I like best about the movie is the more than accurate portrayal of the game itself,, the play calling,, the locker room stuff.. in the real NFL Washington did have a player on work furlough from prison,, this is a must see movie,, especially for a football guru or you re casual fan,, and even if you're not a football fan you will be after seeing this movie,, thumbs up .",10,0,2,9 January 2014
Apollo 13," space race
","this was for all intensive purposes one of the best space movies ever made.. Tom Hanks, Ed Harris, Joe Spano, Gary Sinise, Kathleen Quinlan, Kevin Bacon, and a host of other top notch actors , and actresses,, the film follows the near fatal mission of Apollo 13, from a couple of months before all the way to splashdown,, the film starts out with clips from the first Apollo mission where the hatch didn't come open and 3 astronauts lost their lives, this is a very harrowing and surrealistic film,, Ron Howard is one of my favorite all time directors,, he seems to get so much more out of his actors and actresses than most directors do,, he also hires the best people to do the cinematography, the music in this film was also very well done,, the shots from the top of saturn rocket were unbelievable,, the shots of the moon and earth were also very good,, overall a very good movie,,",10,0,0,15 November 2009
The Great Escape," a really great escape
","this one has so many great performances it's really a piece of art to watch, you got, Steve Mcqueen, the obvious king of cool,, not to mention ' the cooler king' in this one,, you got Donald Pleasense, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson,, he'll be digging tunnels,, as the tunnel king.. the list goes on and on , this one did spawn a sequel 25 years later, but it is inferior to this great epic of a war movie,, Nazi Germany, brand new prison camp just built, to house ' all of the rotten eggs in one basket' , boy what a mistake by the German high command,, you got the Luftwaffe, the S.S. and the Gestapo,, what a triple threat,, as the movie proceeds you know it's just a matter of time before they all get out of that camp.. it's not a sappy movie,, some heroes don't get out,, some get killed,, so i liked it for that also,, great music in here, in my mind, this is a perfect war movie,, one that you could watch over and over again,, without any problem, i know i wouldn't .",10,0,1,31 March 2009
Happy Feet," Penguins
","Rather enjoyable film with excellent animation. this is the story of Mumble a penguin who is rather unusual.. he can't sing whatsoever and sounds just god awful,, and he is ostrasized for it throughout the whole movie for it,, but to his credit he does have a talent for something that no other penguin in the land has... he can tap dance,, well that doesn't go over to well with mom and dad,, and the Penguin leader ,, the Penguin he grew up with she can sing,, and she tries to teach him but sadly to no avail It doesn't work,, so he and a few friends go on a journey seeking advice from an all knowing one,, then when he get's the answer that he needs he comes back home to see if he will be accepted by the girl,, his parents , and the rest of the Penguins.",7,0,0,9 January 2014
Contact," interesting
","I especially like at the end credits,, where it says for Carl,, and I m thinking to myself,, Carl,, ? then at the end it's revealed , it's Carl Sagan,, that blew my mind,, this is a great movie that really has only 2 flaws for me,, run time,,pushing 3 hours, and one part of the ending,, not the whole ending ,, just one part.. Movies really don't come along like this but once or twice in 20 years,, Jodie Foster, gave the performance of her career,, James Woods was pretty decent,, but I didn't care for Matthew Mcconaghey's character,, Tom Skerrit was pretty darn good also,,, scientists will get a communication back from 26 lights years away,, in the movie they say that the first transmission of television into space was the 1936 games at Berlin,, where Adolph Hitler says,, Ich Bein Ein Berliner.. well now the country is in a frenzy,, what does the alien creatures want ,, are they friendly,, do they mean us harm or are they gonna wipe out the human race,, watch and find out.",9,1,3,6 January 2014
Back to the Future," almost 30 years
","Hard to imagine that it's been almost 30 years since this came out,, boy am I getting old.. Micheal J. Fox's career took off with this futuristic Sci-Fi adventure,, I remember as a kid I loved this movie,,nd still do to this day,, sure it's dated, but I think that it has aged well,, Christopher Lloyd has always been one of my favorites and he did a great job in this.. Lea Thompson,, and Crispin Glover are very good in supporting roles as well.. basically time travel is explored in this movie,, and if it is possible,, there are some pretty cool looking futuristic cars in this movie,, like the DeLorean for example.. I just wish that Hollywood would make more of these kind of movies that stand the test of time,, instead of some of the dreck that seems to have came out over the past years.",9,1,1,30 December 2013
Goodfellas," Bad Fellas
","Definitely one of the better Mob movies of the past 30 years. Ray Liotta gives a great performance as Henry Hill,, from a youngster all the way up to the very end when he is older. also starring is Robert deniro,, Joe Pesci,, and Paul Sorvino,, as Paulie, the boss,, there are other characters in here that just make the picture also,, the movie deals with the rise and fall of the gangsters,, especially trailing the career of one Henry Hill,, some of the characters do end up in jail,, some do get out,, and others not so lucky,, there is rampant cocaine use in here, you get the effects of watching henry as he gets paranoid after snorting a bunch of it. all in all i think that this is probably even better than the godfather i thought,, but it's a close call.",9,0,0,7 June 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," killing
","I was really impressed with Gerard Butler never heard of him before this film, he did a great job. Jamie Foxx was great in the supporting role. reminiscent of Death Wish in the early 70's our protagonist sees his wife and daughter brutally raped and killed.. the killer after 3 years is set free. well this doesn't sit well with our main character so he decides first that the killer must pay. after that he systematically goes after the judge, the D.A. and anyone else who had something to do with the extreme miscarriage of justice,, this film goes deep into one's mind, I imagine our main character's mind had snapped and he felt that he had no choice in the matter but to eliminate everyone involved with the vicious and heinous crime, I m sure if someone had did that to my wife and step daughter at the time I would have done the exact same thing.",10,1,2,11 July 2013
V for Vendetta," 1984 revisited
","this movie was so george orwellian i loved it!!!! the political statements that it makes are just fine with me, i agree 100%, if the government ain't working for the people then it's time for a new one.. natalie portman did a very fine job in this one,, by the way loved her as the girl in pigtails, that goes to see the priest. john hurt. what a performance one of his best as the crazed chancellor adam sutler. to be honest with you i never heard of hugo weaving before,, i loved the mask,, i used to be very leary of comic books heroes or villains, turned into movies, but this was a very different than most movie in that it was like i said before , very political, they call him a terrorist, i like to think of it as freedom fighter, like the i.r.a. in irerland. this movie had a lot of dark tones in it,, which i didn't mind at all, overall i would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, way to go d.c. comics.",8,1,7,9 August 2007
