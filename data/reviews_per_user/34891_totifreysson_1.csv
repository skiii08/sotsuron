Blade Runner 2049," Not worth it
","Way too long, extremely boring and degrading to women. One day Hollywood will hopefully move on from the 'lets put naked women in the film for no reason other than to degrade them and sell a few extra tickets' thing. And Harrison Ford is hardly in the film at all although it does contain what is possibly the most awkward romantic scene ever. That's all ... this film is not worth many more words.",1,41,91,6 October 2017
