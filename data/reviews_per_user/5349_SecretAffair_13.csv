The Village," it a love story!
","Firstly, i liked this movie because it tell the diffence love story than the others love story been made in Hollywood , about a blind girl who love a curios young man and also tell a retarded man whose love a blind girl, let me get to this way a retarded-man love a blind girl and the same blind girl a have crush with a curios young-man. The story sets in 1897 where a small village been terrific by an unknown creature, in this movie i keep asking myself how the creature looklike?? and why this village people afraid of them?? and where do this unknown creature come from.?? and then come Lucius(Joaquin Phoniex)he play as a curios man and who a fall for a blind girl that he knew since his childhood, then Ivy(Bryce Dallas Howard) who has crush on Lucius and lastly Noah(Adrian Brody)by the way Adrian Brody show great performers in this movie., plays as a retarded man.I was amazed by Night directing so calm but a bit dark,, lot questioning will apears in you mind including the ending so my advice is be ready for the ending because it diffence than your expect.",Null,0,0,24 August 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," thank God Ang Lee don't direct this movie!
","it's not that i don't like Ang Lee but what he did to the 'HULK' was terrible and horrible that the worst marvel comic to the movie compared to the 'DAREDEVIL'.anyway, the third installment for 'TERMINATOR 3 : RISE OF THE MACHINE' it the best one compared to the previous movie and Jonathan Mostow the director did a great job and i was amazed with the way he(Jonathan Mostow) directing and in this third installment Jonathan Mostow put a few comedy element so people will be more entertain .not just that i was also amazed with the special effect or FX and it been conducted or  supervised by Stan Winston and he also did a great job in FX.and now let go to the cast first Arnold, if you go back and see the first movie of Terminator you will notice a different hair style and the body just look the same that mean he take good care of he body than the hair but for this movie he doing the same thing from the previous Terminator which AWESOME.and what about Kristanna Loken, all i can say about her is she is really beautiful, good bodyshape and not forget she The T-X a machine been send from future to kill John Connor( Nick Stahl)and Kate Brewster ( Claire Danes ) and also a few another people that are really important in future. Nick Stahl whose took a part to play John Connor from Edward Furlong whose a having a problem with drug, Nick Stahl took that part and play it with well and also Claire Danes that she plays as Kate Brewster whose will be Mrs. Connor in future.overall this is a good movie a bit funny, lot of action sequences less talking and more destruction so i give this movie 9/10 .",Null,0,0,16 July 2003

","Batman Begins is about how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman? and where he got all of his gadget?,who created the gadgets?,Who trains Bruce Wayne to fight?. And all the questions been answers through this film,this been show the dark side of Bruce Wayne that full of anger,revenges and a spoil rich kid.Bruce Wayne lost it way and don't believe in anything all on his mind is to seek a revenge to a man who killed his parents.There a part of him(Bruce Wayne) felt a bit guilty,so he runaway from himself then he met a man named Ducard(liam Nesson).Ducard train Bruce Wayne how to fight and kill a person,Ducard and Ra'Al Ghul planned to destroy Gotham City and been stop by Bruce Wayne.Bruce go back to Gotham and become someone else and there he met Lucius Fox a man who been working with Bruce Wayne's father for years and also the one who created all the gadgets from suit to batmobile.The acting is really good and i thought the best batman is Val Kilmer in 'Batman Forever' but i was wrong Christian Bale doing a very good job carrying Bruce Wayne and Batman's characters.

Hero," This movie been made in COLOURS!
","Actually I already seen this movie before on DVD, while i was in Taiwan for my business trip and i bought up a lot of DvDs and Hero is one of them, why i bought it because the movie is such a bit hit in asia after Shoalin Soccer(a funny movie with special weird effect), so i spend a time to see Hero, At the first hour of this movie i kept bitching about Yimou Zhang directing ways and what with the colours,what was he thinking and i tought this movie supposed to be a government propaganda that been using for centuries in Chinese history, then suddenly something hit me in the head that i know what type of formula their using in this movie, OK first thing is Rashomon(Akira Kurasawa) then Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon(Ang Lee) and Usual Suspect(Bryan Singer) this three movie been put into blender and Yimou Zhang blend it and this is the result what it gets. yeah, it quite confusing no, no let me type correctly it really confusing, this movie is more confusing than Rashomon, actually Rashomon are not that confused but this movie it is.but for Asian people this movie is full of an ART and this is an ART, and last but not aleast i was amazed with sword fighting moment so slow motion.7/10",Null,0,1,30 August 2004
Saw," A really good TwiSt.... LoT of Questioning...Gave you an Headache !!
",After saw SAW with a friend of mine...i really had a good time while watching this movie...but then a lots of question came out from my mind...like why don't he do that..than doing this ? Why don't he used that then used this.?.why ? why ? and still why ?it is because he to panic or to paranoid...or people who are working behind this production didn't noticed the mistakes in this movie.The movie started when two complete stranger wake up from been drugged and trapped in a room and their leg been chain to the sewer pipe and not to forget one dead body in the middle of the room...On my right corner we got a white man age about late 30 and he a doctor's and has one lovely wife and one beautiful daughter and he also has an affair with his medical student..now on my left corner we got a white man age about 25 years old...and he been paid to follow Dr.Gordon and he name is Adam. Adam been paid by an ex-cop play by Danny Glover to follow Dr.Gordon activities because Dr.Gordon is Danny Glover former suspected and Danny Glover believe that because of Dr.Gordon his partner died.In this movie..audience don't know why 'JigSaw ' want with Adam and Zep...poor Zep..he did nothing wrong..instant he died tragically..what a bastard..and who is the hell is JigSaw...where he got all these ideas and methods to killed people...and how did he choose his victims...and why he so psycho..Even this movie show a lot of brutality moments like Dr.Gordon sawing his own leg..but still it not enough..lot a thing is missing and been left with question mark...but i do had a good time..6/10,Null,1,2,24 January 2005
War of the Worlds," What Happen to the Heavenly Marriage!!
","Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg make a first collaboration in 2002 hit boxbuster film and one of my finest film ' The Minority Report '. Now is their second collaboration, and this time a big budget film and it is a remake and also been taken from a book title ' War Of The Worlds ' from an author H.G Wells.The First movie been make in 1953 if i was not mistaken,if i was please sue me.This movie got a great special effect, good acting from all the cast start with Tom , Dakota or D(that what Tom called her )and the guy who played Robbie.The directing also great,well who doesn;t know Mr.Spielberg with his work before start from E.T to Jurassic Park.The story are not so confused accept why alien came to earth and try to kill all human races.For those who read a book before or saw a 1953 ' war of the world ' before so this is not so confusing but for those who doesn't, well can't help it.This movie worth of watching me and my friend really enjoy with the explosion people get hyteria ,scared ,and screaming.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Finally,this is what people want !
","This is a masterpiece, better than episode 1:The Phantom Menace and episode 2:Attack Of The Clones. both movies quite lames,nothing special accepted Master Yoda scene,having a light-saber fight with Count Dooku(some people called him Count Dookie).In this movie i think our friend here George Lucas more focusing on Anakin and Obi-wan,there is a few lame scenes in this movies like SPOILERS When Master Mace Windu came to arrest Palpatine because he(Palpatine is Lord Sith or Dark Sith)Master Mace Windu didn't come alone he came with 3 more Jedi's master which is been killed by Dark Sith so easily,and i was like what.that scenes supposed and should be a good scenes like 4 jedi's master fight with dark sith but,it didn't happen SPOILERS END : Most people enjoy this movie including me this is one of the best Star Wars movie.I give this movie 8/10",Null,1,5,23 May 2005
