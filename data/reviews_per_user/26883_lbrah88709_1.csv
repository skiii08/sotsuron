It," You almost feel bad it's marketed as a horror movie!
","Oh my God a horror movie with a good/great/awesome story!Disclaimer: I didn't read IT which means that as I proceed with professionally criticizing some plot holes I'll have no idea whether it's Stephen or Andy who screwed it up (that's just because I know there are some experts on the book (who never read it anyway) and I'm sure they won't like me hate on the story given the fact I didn't read the book). Let's start with an obvious statement that going to the theater I had absolutely no idea what IT would be which allowed me to enjoy IT without having a list of strict rules how IT had to be like in order for me to like IT. The opening scene was scary and by scary I don't mean a high decibel jump-scare or synonym for 'gross'. It's scary on an emotional level - we're introduced Bill and Georgie, the two happy brothers. Then all of a sudden we are 'unintroduced' Georgie and reintroduced Bill who's not happy anymore. What an introduction! After that, we get to know a few other troubled kids who then all become part of The Losers' Club. Now although I'd absolutely love to tell you something cool about each of them, I'm not going to be able to do that since I only got like 750 words to go so I gotta be careful (and I'm afraid I forgot some of their names too huh..). What follows next is a really impressive loop of '(making friends, bonding)/friendly/funny', '(investigating, learning more about Pennywise's wrath)/thrilling', and '(boo boo, I'll make you jump)/scary' scenes up until the finale. which is not that impressive. I mean compared to all other horror movie finales it's still a terrific one no doubt about that. But relative to the movie it sucks. IT starts as a heck of a scary/thrilling/touching movie by brutally killing off an 8-year-old boy (on camera!!!) and it ends with a ridiculous fight that could easily be found in a comedy/parody. Don't get me wrong, the moment when Bill found Georgie's raincoat DID make me feel sad but it could've been much more than that had there been a proper setup. Finally I've been saving the part where I specifically talk about Skarsgard's Pennywise for the very end of my review cause I bet 80% of you are only here to read yet another person saying how out of this world his performance was and I wanted you to read the rest of my awkward impressions on IT as well. Bill Skarsgard did a really great job - I agree (shame he was only there for like 10% of the run-time :(). He is the reason why IT was so great - I disagree - he is one of the reasons why IT was so great but not necessarily the main one. He is really scary as Pennywise - I disagree (but I'm not afraid of clowns so this one doesn't count (actually you could say this whole review doesn't count but whatever)) - I sometimes found him to be funny (but isn't that something clowns should be? Even scary ones?).IT is marketed as a horror movie. That's fairly surprising given the fact that they often follow this exact formula: 'Here you got a bunch of uninteresting characters you won't give a crap about. Here you got a ridiculous ghost/demon/entity that's supposed to be scary. Every now and then it's gonna give your ears a jump-scare. During the movie, the retarded characters you don't give a crap about are unsuccessfully trying to say a line that'd make at least a tiny amount of sense. At the end most/all of them die which is supposed to make you feel scared/bad/sad/emotional but you still don't give a crap.' What's interesting is that this movie does not and you almost feel bad it's marketed as a horror movie. Acting - The Losers' Club - ROCKS (yeah and there's also a scene with rocks), Pennywise - playn' wise, the rest is above average. Writing - There are some memorable lines (which you'll remember) and some very not memorable lines (which you'll also remember because of how not memorable they are). Overall, what the characters say and how they s-s-say it m-m-makes s-s-sense, some moments will break your heart, some will make your stomach hurt from laughing. Soundtrack - captures emotions (I mean most of the horror movie soundtracks often capture that very rigid 'I want my ears back' emotion - fortunately, it's not the case here). Benjamin Wallfisch is a Ballsy Outstanding Score Supercomposer!!! On top of it all let's see how I'd answer these questions:Did I like IT? --- No! I loved it!!! Why did I love IT? --- Take your average horror movie, remove from it everything that it does bad (pretty much everything!) and replace it with a bunch of terrific actors, great story, sympathetic characters, bad-ass villain and an above average finale and you got all the reasons together. Is there anything I didn't like about the movie? --- More 'hahahaha' scenes than 'sniff sniff' scenes especially toward the end when it was not exactly appreciated (at least not by me I'm a much better 'sniff sniff'er than 'hahaha'er) Would I watch it again? --- I already did. And yes! IT has a good point, a good story-line, a love triangle, and a rectangle that looks more like a circle (shapes are cool aren't they?).",10,1,4,15 October 2017
