Blade Runner 2049," An insult to fans specifically, and cinematography in general
","What an utter turd.... Playing with four Lego blocks for the duration would be more entertaining. DO NOT fall for the crap 10-star reviews, the are simply a lie. I am a big fan of the 1982 version, which I watch at least once a year. I had great anticipation for the 2049 version. Watching it left me with a feeling like frying the perfect steak and then dropping it into a turd by accident...avoid and do not waste your time and money. It's like 'The Hitcher' and it's sequel all over again....I must be getting old.",1,26,55,22 October 2017
Dunkirk," An utter disgrace to movie lovers in general, and war movie boffins in particular
","No context, no sense of scale of what really happened at Dunkirk, no plot, no character-building, plain stupid editing, utter foolish flying. Yet I want to thank the producers! After Fury and Blade Runner 2049 I thought it could not get any worse with cinema these days. But no, this movie was quite an education! I was wrong and and feel enlightened that, yes, it CAN be worse. The rave 10-star reviews on here make me sick. Do NOT see, rent, or buy this crap. If you really want to know more about the miraculous events that took place at Dunkirk, watch the 1958 version, or Mrs. Miniver.I'll give them one star for the nearly correctly configured and painted Spitfires. That must have cost 1,5 million of the 150m budget. The rest was spent on paying people for good reviews, no doubt.",1,7,10,7 December 2017
1917," Bland, bad, boring and stupid. Hype is a lie.
","It is unfathomable that this movie gets such high ratings. Mind-B-O-G-G-L-I-N-G.I don't know where to start..(no particular order) The Geman pilot that just crashed managed to stab Blake while Schofield rushes to find water for the hurt pilot. In WW1 pilot's where men of honour and they would 1. Just not do such a thing, and 2. it's idiotic that a weakened haf burned pilot finds the strength for it. The town is levelled, but the church tower is stil intact. Bot only is it intact, but apparently there is someone there to sound the church bell at 5 am? Really? Just before the woman in the basmeent appeared I thought: 'soon he finds a woman', and bingo. And yes, she cares for a baby that is not her's without any further context. And yes, Blake is the only soldier in WW1 to have carried milk in his canteen. What Luck for this baby! And so unexpected!The river he jumps in to suddenly turns into a wild stream? Really? In otherwise flat scenery there's not only a wild river but even a 20-foot waterfall? PleaseAs usual, Germans can's shoot straight and a re all drunk, bad, puking, and have I mentioned they can't shot straight?Later he hears singing in the woods, and walks up to a large group of soldiers who did not think it was handy to put up a perimeter guard of any kind, near enemy territory. He sits himself down amongst them but no one notices.Blake (a Corporal) asks every second soldier and officer he finds where MacKenzie is, and they all point him to him, never asking any questions as to who he is and why he wants to see their CO.Scenery: too clean just like the soldiers. explosions take place next to soldiers, but the stand tall without any reaction, or, they stand still for one second and only then get blown to the side (slightly) by the blast.This movie better than Saving Private Ryan? What travesty and utter crap. This movie can't hold a candle to the muppet show. Do not waste your money. I you're looking for brainless entertainment: good for you you might enjoy it.You are a war-movie/history buffin like me, avoid this one. It's just another Dunkirk-like mediocre flick. Dead in the water and a missed opportunity. I'd give it two stars. One star because of all the fake 10/10 reviews.Oh, and the one-take camera approach leaves you longing for a cut after 10 minutes.",1,13,30,12 January 2020
