Blade Runner 2049," Blade Running
","Blade Runner 2049 is the sequel to the 1982 sci-fi classic Blade Runner. This series is based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? The pacing is a bit slow at times. For the patient viewers, this movie does not disappoint. The visuals and music are excellent. Ryan Gosling does a superb job acting like an artificial human. The former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) also does an excellent job in this movie. Philip K. Dick would like this film !",8,1,3,9 April 2018
