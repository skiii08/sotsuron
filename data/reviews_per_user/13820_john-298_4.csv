Antz," Z: 'Lunatic at 3:00 o clock'
","Okay, I have a weak spot for computer animated movies. And Antz is the best so far. The characters where animated fantastic with perfect voices. And Woody Allen as the ant Z is great. Lots of good humour. And not especially for children but also for adults. Just go and see it!",9,0,0,26 April 1999
The Terminator," 'Washday tomorrow, nothing clean right?'
",One of those Hollywood classics. And it deserves it. I think this one is better than T2. The hunting/fear element is much stronger than in T2. Arnold fits perfectly in his role as the cyborg who doesn't stop until Sarah Conner is dead.Arnold on his best!,Null,0,0,12 April 1999
Predator," Dutch: 'Did you find Hawkins?' Poncho: 'I.......I can't tell'
","Absolutely my most favorite movie ever. Godzilla can learn from this movie. Some really good actors and a monster you wouldn't want to meet at night. Arnold Schwarzenegger did his greatest job ever.A lot of unanswered questions are there in the film. Why would a alien go to earth and kill men for trophies in the jungle of South America? But those questions don't matter, it gives the movie a more mysterious touch. You won't care when you watch it. Some scenes are really unforgettable.Everything in the film is good. The scenery, the atmosphere. From A to Z you will be stuck at your chair.A masterpiece!",10,4,4,12 April 1999
Predator," You will forget to drink your cola and eat you chips...
","Okay, the rest of these comments speak for themselves. I just want to say that this movie is so good! I think that this is the greatest movie Arnold played in.Just see it!!!",10,0,0,6 March 1999
