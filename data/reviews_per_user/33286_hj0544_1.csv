Skyfall," The best Bond movie ever...
","Ian Fleming's James Bond (007) has been enthralling people around the globe for a long period of time. He holds us with extreme action, humor, style; super-fast cars and technology hyped electronic gazettes. Skyfall yet last released movie of James Bond and is very different from all other movies of the series.Skyfall portrays a Bond never seen before. Though his physical strengths are depressed his character is actually outstandingly strong. Moreover the terrorism shown in movie is a true reflection of present situation. Our enemies are no longer known to us, there is no specific battlefield. They don't have certain identity. As it is said in movie, 'They are not nations, no uniform they have'. Some other day we may find them at the next door. The world is truly in shadows.James has grown older now. He is not strong as we saw him previously. Physical and psychological tests highly reject him for field duty. MI6 is broken down. There best security systems are hacked. Government now doubts their efficiency. M herself is targeted by enemy.We observe resurrection of James Bond in this worst situation. Hero is not the one who comes from distant planet or star, he is not mutant neither he has superpowers. He is one of us. He has limitations and above all he is mortal. Bond shows intention and great determination is enough to be a hero. Movie itself has commented some lines on this fact, 'We are not as strong as we were in the past. We might have moved earth back then in time but it has changed now. We have become weak. Now muscles would not work but motivation can. And this is how some men with strong will fighting hard to save the world.'Concept and presentation is just outstanding. It is not just a Bond movie; it is an inspiration to rise again from failure. A great Philosophy narrated in James Bond style is so effective. A must watch movie.",8,6,14,27 October 2013
