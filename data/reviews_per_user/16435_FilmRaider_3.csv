Catch Me If You Can," Great film that's based on a true story.
","I usually don't watch movies like this. I decided to give it try, and I enjoyed it a lot actually. It has a pretty talented cast behind it : directed by Steven Spielberg, starring a younger Leonardo Dicaprio, and having Tom Hanks play the antagonist of the film (Which I think might be the first time), they all do a good job. One thing I think I will congratulate this movie on though is the emotional scenes, because actually have..well, Emotion in them, they seem real. Overall I think this was a really good movie but it might be a bit lengthy for some people.",7,0,2,4 August 2018
Unknown," A good but kinda for forgettable Mystery.
","A very Jason Bourne-esque tale of Liam Neeson trying to get his identity back. It's not the most memorable movie though, but it's not a bad one either. As you expect there is a surprisingly unexpected twist ending (which I will not spoil). Overall it was good movie",6,0,0,3 August 2018
Kingsman: The Secret Service," It's funny, it's goofy, and it's over-the-top, but it's supposed to be.
","The movie is a spoof of spy films, but it also stands out in it's own way. With very good cinematography (especially for certain action sequences), and some pretty memorable characters, the movie is great in my opinion.",8,1,2,3 August 2018
