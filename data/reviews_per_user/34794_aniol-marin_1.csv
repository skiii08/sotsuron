The Lobster," Good, but specific
","I liked this one. But I could perfectly understand if others in the same situation say they didn't. It's not a movie that makes anyone feel good, but it's one that DOES make me FEEL. And I understand anyone that doesn't want to feel that way while watching a movieIn my opinion you just have to watch the first 2 minutes in order to assess if you may like it or hate it. After this be aware that absurdity is a big part of the film (less than Dogtooth, more in the line of Hard to be a God), you'll have to deal with unanswered questions or unsatisfactory answers to side stories. Despite this it also has pretty sarcastic moments, I found some of them brilliant.",8,1,1,18 March 2020
