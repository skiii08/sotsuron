The King's Speech," A Good True Story
","THE KING'S SPEECH is one of those rare films that come along every decade or so at best in which a true story is done in a really great way. I'm sure they added some fictional elements here, but the end product is nonetheless well worth watching.The story told in a traditional, formulaic way, but the acting is just so good and the story is so interesting that it's hard not to be totally intrigues for the duration. The pacing and directing in this film are spot on. Bravo! Highly recommend.",8,1,1,2 May 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Decent Sequel
","Well I enjoyed the original. I don't really like sequels for the most part, or at least I enter them with a fair amount of apprehension. They seem to never live up to the original. But this one exceeded my expectation.While it certainly was not as good as the original, it was a still a worthy sequel. They got a good director for this one, and the acting and writing were all very good. The camerawork was very nice as well. It's everything a fan could ask for. Recommend.",7,1,9,22 November 2019
Vertigo," A Wonderful Classic!
","What's not to love? VERTIGO was ahead of it's time and a groundbreaking film, in terms of both storytelling and visuals. It is a masterpiece on many levels.This film really holds up against the test of time, possibly better than any other. It has inspired countless films over the decades since its release and will undoubtedly inspire countless more to come. Highly recommend.",9,6,7,8 June 2019
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Great High School Drama
","I was not expecting to like this film as much as I did. THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is not your typical high school movie. It is so much more. It's about real kids with real problems, taking place sometime in the early 1990's before cellphones corrupted all of our innocence.It's great, honest, and heartfelt. Some have compared it to ORDINARY PEOPLE. Dare I say this one may be even better? Recommend.",9,0,0,14 January 2019
Catch Me If You Can," A Fun 'True' Story
","To say that CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a true story would be to stretch the truth. Some would call it a flat out lie. If you look up the real story, you realize that there are few similarities past the main character's name and a very basic description of what he did. The filmmakers took countless liberties.But they did it in order to make a fun movie. It's nothing groundbreaking. It's not great art. But it's good fun for the entire duration. The actors did a great job. Recommend.",7,0,1,16 April 2019
Memento," Great Flick
","MEMENTO is a nonstop edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride. The plot is unpredictable and told in an unconventional and beautiful way. It's not particularly hard to follow, but you must pay attention. It's a great film in every way.The acting isn't the greatest, though it's never terrible. I can't discuss the plot too much because that would give away important details, but suffice it to say it is about a man with memory problems who is out to solve a mystery. It's the greatest of all amnesia films, Chris Nolan's best film, and one of my personal favorites since the first time I saw it back in 2001. Highly recommend.",10,1,2,1 February 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Brilliant And Fun
","INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a very unique kind of war film. In hindsight, it's just the sort of thing you'd expect from Quentin Tarantino, but the plot is totally unpredictable. It's just a great ride.It somehow manages to be hilarious funny and incredibly tense both at the same time. It never lets up. The acting is absolutely wonderful. And the ending is one of the best I've seen. Highly recommend.",10,3,6,20 May 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Good Zombie Comedy
","The zombie comedy film is a subgenre that has been around for virtually as long as the zombie film itself. A lot of people love them. Usually I do not. I had head that this one was good so I decided to give it a try.Immediately I noticed the good production values and strong humor. It toed the line between the dumb comedy that ruins most of these films for me and the sort of hilariously clever jokes that you can't help but laugh at. That is the sweet spot, what I call comedy gold! Recommend.",7,0,0,5 March 2019
Knives Out," Fun Mystery Film
",KNIVES OUT borrows from countless other whodunit films that have come before it while still managing to put a fresh and original take on it. It's everything that's great about the genre with just the perfect amounts of satire and parody added for good measure.It's one thrill after the next. It's hilarious and a whole lot of fun. Don't try to figure it out yourself. Just enjoy the ride! Recommend.,7,5,8,15 April 2020
500 Days of Summer," Not A Romance
","Yeah yeah, we get it. 500 DAYS OF SUMMER is not a romance. 'Not a romance.' That's what everyone seems to have to say about this movie, critics and regular people alike. But it's just a regular romantic comedy, if you ask me. It's a little bit different though, right? Actually, not really. I mean it's as different as TERMINATOR and TERMINATOR 2, but it's just more of the same really. People thought the filmmakers were genius for turning the genre on its head? Sorry, but I'm not seeing it.I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedies in general (I only ever watch them with my girlfriend whenever I let her pick a movie) and I didn't particularly like this one any more or less than many of the others I've seen, but overall I guess it was decent for a romantic comedy (not so mushy and more realistic than what they usually do). And it's got Jess from NEW GIRL, and she's fun to watch. The acting is good (though I never really cared for JGL) and the story is better than some, worse than others. I like the music (Pixies have a song in here). Recommend for fans of the genre.",6,0,0,17 January 2019
Match Point," Fun And Kind Of Different
","MATCH POINTS certainly has its fun moments. It has some really great ones. Overall, it's not a perfect film, but it's good enough. And it's different compared to much of Allen's works. The guy keeps cranking out movies year after year, but he's really branched out lately, making more films in Europe; in Spain or the UK, wherever he can get financing.That's part of what makes this film so good, is that it's a Woody Allen film set overseas. The story is great too, of course, as is the acting from some really talented stars. I've heard, however, that they didn't like the film so much over there. I think the uninformed dialog sounded weird to their ears. That makes sense, but I didn't know any better, so enjoyed it. Recommend.",7,0,0,17 May 2019
Full Metal Jacket," Great Vietnam Film
","FULL METAL JACKET was a great movie when it came out, and it has only gotten better with age. Everyone has their own opinions about Vietnam and the war there, but none of that matters here. It's just a gruesome look at one man's struggle to survive.The movie is violent, it is bloody, and it is great fun. There are many wonderful moments and tons of quotable lines. I understand that not everyone liked this movie when it first came out, but I would find it hard to believe that people still feel that way all these decades later. It's great! Highly Recommend.",9,1,1,25 February 2020
Empire of the Sun," Great WWII Movie
","EMPIRE OF THE SUN gives us a unique view of WWII that we don't normally get a chance to see. It's a totally different perspective that is totally different from the other WWII films. It's from the point of view of a young boy living in a certain part of the world whose life is affected by the war.The acting, storyline, and action are great. It's completely intriguing from start to finish. Very well done. Highly recommend.",9,0,0,7 September 2019
"Monsters, Inc."," Great Pixar Film
","Animated films in general I could take or leave most of the time. All those Disney films that have been all the rave for decades, they're pretty hit or miss for me. Even the ones that people say they're the best, I've never been so crazy about them.But Pixar is a whole new ballpark. It has truly changed the game, not just with computer animation, but the quality is really a level up from what we've seen before. They're not all masterpieces, but the vast majority of them are very good. And MONSTERS, INC. is one of their best. It's not just for kids; everyone will enjoy this fun movie. I'm sure they had a lot of fun making it but they also put in a lot of hard work to make it excellent and to make the best film they could make. Highly recommend.",9,0,0,7 April 2020
Bird Box," I Didn't Like It
","A lot of people seem to have enjoyed BIRD BOX. The director made the film BROTHERS (the original European version) which I liked a lot, so I figured I would like this one. I was mistaken.It all just feels so fake and corny. It's not exciting like a lot of people said. At least I didn't think so. It does feature a great performance from the talented John Malkovich, so that is one thing that is good about it, but it doesn't exactly make up for the rest of the film. Felt like a bad rehash of THE BOOK OF ELI with bits of other post-apocalyptic films mixed in and done so poorly, like a bad clich√©. Do not recommend.",5,1,3,19 January 2019
The Revenant," Could Have Been So Much Better
","THE REVENANT is based on the incredible true story of one man alone in the wilderness and his fight for survival. But they went way over the top trying to make it good. They added a bunch of fictional elements that were not only unnecessary, but which actually made the movie worse.If only they'd stuck to the original story I think this movie could have been much better. As it was, a lot of the stuff came across as very corny. The special effects and cartoon bear sort of ruined it for me. However, I will say that the cinematography was very good. There was some stuff that I had no idea how they did it. All the same though, they ruined a great story with this one. Do no recommend.",5,0,0,2 May 2019
Apocalypse Now," Another Great Vietnam Film
","If you thought FULL METAL JACKET gave us a unique look at the Vietnam War, think again! APOCALYPSE NOW isn't even a war film in a lot of ways, being more of a horror/thriller. But there are enough great shots of war and its effects that it should undeniably be classified as such. Still, it is a very unique kind of war film.The character development here is some of the best I've seen in any film of any kind. It is obvious that some true magic happened in the making of this film. Everyone knew exactly what they were doing, from the actors to the director and everyone in between. All that combined with a little bit of luck led to this wonderful masterpiece. Highly recommend.",9,0,0,25 February 2020
Silver Linings Playbook," Really Good
","I was not expecting to like this movie. I didn't want to like it. Part of me tried not to like it, even while I was watching it, but I just couldn't help it. I really liked it! I think the reason I didn't think I would like SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK was because of the trailer. Usually I can get a pretty good idea of how much I'll like a movie from the trailer. Sometimes I'm wrong, but not often. But this time I was.The reason I watched it even though I didn't think I'd like it was because a friend of mine told me that it was really good and that it would be different than I expected. This was the same friend who recommended GIRL, INTERRUPTED to me (not a fan), so I was skeptical. But he was right this time. It was so much better and different than expected. The story seems predictable at first, but it goes in a completely different direction than you think it will. Recommend.",8,1,1,24 February 2019
In the Name of the Father," Daniel Day-Lewis at His Best!
","In my opinion this is one of the greatest performances from my all-time favorite actor. It is a real treat to see it and I believe that the world of cinema is better for it. The film itself is very political, as that is the nature of the story, and for that reason I could not bring myself to give it a higher star rating. It is slow at points, having been based on a true story.But it is a fine film nonetheless, and is worth watching even if only for Day-Lewis' stellar performance. Recommend.",8,0,0,13 January 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Not My Kind Of Film
","I did not enjoy this movie very much, although I admit that there were moments in which I was entertained. I enjoy a lot of different types of films, but I don't really care for movies like this one. It's sort of offbeat and cartoony.That being said, it is still obvious to me that a lot of people WILL enjoy this movie. It definitely caters to a certain demographic. And for those who seek out these sorts of films, they will love it. However, as I did not enjoy it myself, I would be hard-pressed to say what is or isn't good about it, and I suppose it doesn't matter what I say anyway. It's just not my kind of film. Do not recommend.",5,1,1,16 April 2019
The Butterfly Effect," Ashton Kutcher is Good!
","By now I assume most people who want to see this film have already seen it. It is great. I recommend the director's cut, which may be too disturbing for theaters which was why it is only available on DVD, but it's better than the regular version in my opinion.And there's great acting all around. I was surprised at Kutcher's performance, being so accustomed to seeing him play the stereotypical dumb guy in THAT SEVENTIES SHOW for all those years. But I have heard that he is actually very smart in real life. Eric Stoltz gives a great performance also, as always. Don't waste your time with the sequels though, as they were just made cheaply in order to capitalize on the success of this one. But the first one is top notch. Recommend.",8,1,1,14 January 2019
The Fault in Our Stars," Overrated
","Everyone really hyped this movie up, so I was excited to see it. But alas, it disappointed. It's not that it was bad, but it just wasn't as good as everyone made it out to be.The acting was fine, as were the directing and just about everything else in the movie. There just wasn't anything really great about it. Recommend only if you like teen dramas.",6,2,3,2 May 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," A Good Animated Movie
","WRECK-IT RALPH does a good job of including nearly all that is good about animated films these days while still managing to stay on the tolerable side, for the most part.Animated films can be a bit annoying with their humor sometimes, but WRECK-IT RALPH is actually genuinely funny most of the time and should appeal to all ages. Recommend for fans of animation.",7,0,0,4 May 2020
Man on the Moon," An Admirable Biography
","Andy Kaufman was a very funny man. Many would consider him to be a genius, and I would agree. His genius was in his brilliant originality. Jim Carrey captures some of that about as well as any actor could, I suppose, although there is just no substitute for the real thing in this case.Carrey gets Andy's voice and mannerisms down pretty well, but of course he's just acting. It doesn't quite come across the same, as is so often the case with biographical films. However, there is still a wonderful and engaging story here about a rare comedic genius, and taken as a whole it is worth watching. Recommend.",7,0,0,14 May 2020
Saving Private Ryan," Another Great War Movie
","SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a nearly perfect war film about a group of soldiers trying to find another soldier who has orders to return home. The story and the action are totally realistic and believable.The only drawback is the phony sentimentality that seems to be present in every Spielberg film, so this is no exception. But here it is particularly well-hidden among all the action and chaos and great acting. And even despite that one drawback, everything else about the film more than makes up for it. Highly recommend.",9,0,1,21 March 2019
The Favourite," Solid Biopic
","THE FAVOURITE is a new historical drama about a bunch of people who died a long time ago. It's a period in time that I tend to find rather boring when depicted in film, I must admit. However, they did a decent job here. The story and the performances are solid.I only chose to watch this movie because I am a fan of the director. While I must say that this is not as good as his previous films (THE LOBSTER and DOGTOOTH, to name a few) I think that's because he wrote those ones and this one was written by somebody else. It's still a solid film though and a good watch. Not nearly as boring as a lot of other biopics I've seen. Recommend.",7,2,4,25 January 2019
28 Days Later...," A Smart Horror Film
","This is not your typical cheesy horror flick by any means. It is the opposite of that. It is very smart and well-thought out, not only in terms of the writing but also the directing and the acting.It is not just a movie for horror fans, though horror fans will enjoy it. This is the type of movie that everyone will enjoy, although some more than others. Recommend.",7,1,1,19 July 2019
It Follows," An Original Horror Film
","IT FOLLOWS is a new kind of horror film. While many horror films seem to more or less blur together over the years in our collective memories, IT FOLLOWS is one film that truly stands out among the rest. While still being true to the genre, it manages to do it's own thing.The movie is eerie and suspenseful, and has some of the most terrifying moments I can recall having seen in a horror film. It will stick with you. The whole tone of the film is perfect. Recommend.",7,0,1,2 May 2019
Good Will Hunting," Good Movie, But Overhyped
","GOOD WILL HUNTING is a good movie, no doubt about it. The story is great and intriguing and told well. The performances and writing are good. But it is NOT this great movie that everyone makes it out to be, not in my opinion at least. It was fun and enjoyable, but I found it to be nothing groundbreaking. It is not even Gus Van Sant's best film. And the title is so stupid, right? I think it's supposed to be a pun about hunting for goodwill or something, and the character's name is Will Hunting, which I think they just did for the title. I hate when they do that, like with that movie JUST WRIGHT and a bunch of others.The story is even a bit unbelievable and feels fake at points, and not in a good way. But overall, it's still a good movie. The dialog and acting are great, especially from Robin Williams. Even Ben Affleck (who I don't like much) is alright in this, as he's not the main character so we don't have to watch him for too long. Recommend.",7,3,6,26 January 2019
The Elephant Man," Good Movie
","THE ELEPHANT MAN is based on a true story about a young man with a deformity. It is directed by David Lynch and is a much different kind of film than he has typically made. The acting and directing here are great.The story unfolds in a perfect way and is always interesting and intriguing. It is a story of compassion, and one of humanity and tolerance that deserves to be told and to be seen. Recommend.",8,0,0,20 January 2019
Meet Joe Black," Really Good
","MEET JOE BLACK is about Mr. Death (a.k.a. The Grim Reaper), who decides to inhabit the body of a man for a period of time in order to experience, for the first time ever, what it means to me alive. Brad Pitt plays the role and he does a great job, as do Anthony Hopkins and the rest of the cast.It has tones of WINGS OF DESIRE and a few other films, but it does its own thing at the same time. It's wonderfully directed. It's about love and life and death and business. It's funny and sad, with some interesting twists and some fun scenes that seem totally new and original. Even at three hours it doesn't feel a bit too long. It's never boring. I've seen it many times over the years. Highly recommend.",8,1,1,7 February 2019
Garden State," A Beautiful Movie
","GARDEN STATE is the perfect blend of comedy, drama, and romance in my opinion. It's a bit of a tragedy, but not. It's filled with hope and sadness. It will make you laugh and cry.The acting is wonderful. The directing is wonderful as well, especially for a first timer. This is the exactly the kind of film I could watch over and over again. Highly recommend.",10,3,3,15 May 2019
8 Mile," Good Hip-Hop Film
","I'm not of rap music in general and I didn't think I'd enjoy a film starring rapper Eminem. But I did enjoy it very much. It is very enjoyable and intriguing. I even found myself enjoying a lot of the rapping, much of which was improvised I believe.There is a lot of rapping in the movie but it is crucial to the story. The story and acting are both very good. It tells an honest story about a man struggling to make ends meet in the ghetto. Recommend.",7,0,0,14 April 2020
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Not For Me
","I watched this movie because I was a fan of some of the director's other films, so despite the fact that I've never been a huge fan of musicals I thought I'd give it a shot. I admit, there were a few good things that I liked about it and some fun moments even, but overall I did not enjoy this.It's a rock musical, so take from that what you will. I am sure there are loads of people out there who will love this movie, but I am not one of them, and for that reason I cannot recommend it. But I will say that musical fans will almost certainly love it. So yeah, just my take on it. Do not recommend.",5,4,7,5 February 2019
Everest," Good Man vs Nature Film
","EVEREST tells the true story of a group of climbers trapped on Mt Everest during a severe weather event. I had heard the story before and seen interviews with those involved, and I always found it intriguing. The trailer for this one looked good but I was a little worried that the filmmakers would ruin it. They got a big famous cast and a big budget, so it only seemed natural to me that they would over dramatize things and give it the real Hollywood treatment, which tends to make things worse.But that was not the case here, fortunately. The film was stunningly shot and the story and acting were great. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, the climax was true to life, and I think this may have been Jake Gyllenhaal's best performance yet. Surely it is. No doubt about it. Recommend.",8,0,2,24 January 2019
Groundhog Day," It's Very Good
","Today is Groundhog Day, so what better film to review than - yep, you guessed it - GROUNDHOG DAY, starring the wonderful Bill Murray in his best role ever. For his character, EVERY day is Groundhog Day. We're lucky we're not him. But hey, it's fun to watch for an hour and a half or so. You may have seen it already. I've seen it many times over the years and it never gets old. It's just so funny and original and the acting is great. Murray is not only very funny but also proves his acting ability here. He's come a long way since his SNL days.Many movies that have come after it have copied the premise to some degree, but none have done it this well. I won't give anything away in case you've not seen it, although knowing the story doesn't really ruin the experience. The talented supporting cast does a great job as well. Highly recommend.",10,3,4,2 February 2019
Reservoir Dogs," A Wonderful Debut
","RESERVOIR DOGS was our first taste of Quentin Tarantino, way back in 1992. We may not have known what we were in for at the time, but it's sure been a wild ride. And even after all these years, the one that started it all is still as good as ever. I mean it really withstands the test of time.Watch it again today and it's like going back in a time machine, like nothing's changed since then. It is still one of my favorite films. I find myself reciting half the lines without even thinking about it! And it has what just may be the greatest beginning of any movie I have ever seen. Highly recommend.",10,0,0,10 April 2019
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," A Very Good Film
","This movie is not for everyone. Some will find it long and tedious. But for those who enjoy this kind of narrative, it pays off big.The acting, story structure, and production values are all top notch on this one. The story is completely engaging and will have you on the edge of your seat. Despite the running time of more than two hours, it still felt like it was over very quickly. Recommend.",7,0,0,8 October 2019
The Descent," Good Horror Film
","THE DESCENT is a very original horror film. I'm not normally a big fan of most horror films in general. Many of the ones that a lot of other people like just end up boring me. But this one I found intriguing.The story is about a group of women who go exploring in a cave. What they find in there the scary part. I won't give it away, but it feels very original. I haven't seen anything like it before. The acting and directing are bother very good. Recommend for horror fans.",7,2,3,9 February 2019
Pulp Fiction," One Of The Greats
","Quentin Tarantino first stunned audiences with his amazing debut film RESERVOIR DOGS back in 1992. Two years later he repeated that feat on a grander scale with PULP FICTION, one of the greatest films ever made.It's extremely original and pure fun. Even the dialog is fun! There are tons of movies that came after it that tried to copy it, but none have succeeded. This is the real thing in all its glory. Highly recommend.",10,0,0,10 April 2019
The Disaster Artist," Not Good, And NOT A True Story
","THE DISASTER ARTIST is a movie based on a book based on the true story of a movie. Or, more appropriately, it's based on the story of the making of a movie (THE ROOM) which was supposedly based on an unpublished novel that was based on an unproduced play that was written by THE ROOM's director Tommy Wiseau. The book that THIS film was based on was written by Tommy's friend and fellow ROOM actor Greg Sestero.I read the book. It was very good and apparently follows the real events quite closely. So I was excited when the movie came out. But the movie does not follow the book or the truth very closely at all. It takes huge liberties, and bad ones at that. In lieu of changing things around to make them batter, this film instead makes them worse. Not because it changes the truth, just because the true events in this case happen to be better than the fiction. There was real drama on the set of THE ROOM. Good, interesting things happened that would have played well here. Director James Franco chose to swap those out for more boring things. I don't know why. Maybe it was because they got Bryan Cranston to play in their movie for cheap so they thought they'd change things around to write a part for the star of television's BREAKAING BAD (he's not bald in this one!).Additionally, the plot plays out like a bad, sloppy version of ED WOOD, which also took liberties with the truth but in a much better, entertaining way, in order to improve the plot, which was not done here. Overall, the film is entertaining to a degree but never great. Maybe it will be less frustrating for those who haven't read the book, as things tend to be. Watch ED WOOD instead. Do not recommend.",5,0,0,23 January 2019
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Just Plain Awful
","This movie was absolutely terrible. Even if you like Michael Bay's films, even if giant robots are you're thing, I bet you'll still have a tough time sitting through this one. It feels like it's about five hours long, and it's like sheer torture. I could not wait for it to end.There is nothing good about this movie. I suppose it's my fault that I watched it. No one forced me to sit through the whole thing. No one put a gun to my head. I could have gotten up and walked out anytime I wanted. Come to think of it, why didn't I? Steer clear of this one. Do not recommend.",1,1,3,16 April 2019
Mudbound," Starts out Good, Fizzles
","I was honestly expecting more from this film. The trailed and the reviews seemed so promising, but in the end it was all a lot of hype. The movie starts out pretty good but it fizzles after not too long. I would say the first half is really interesting but in the middle it gets really slow to the point that I just didn't care anymore. I lost interest.Overall I would say there are some good things about it, but don't waste your time unless you are a big fan of these actors. Don't recommend.",5,4,9,13 January 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," The Best Dracula Movie
","I'm not a real big fan of vampires or horror films in general, or even of Dracula for that matter. But I've seen several Dracula films and I can honestly say that this is my personal favorite.As far as production values go, this is hands down better than the rest. And it is clearly much more faithful to its source material than the others. There are many flaws, but it's still a good film. It kept me engaged despite not being a fan. Recommend.",7,1,2,5 November 2019
Con Air," Good Action Thriller
","CON AIR is an action crime thriller. It's got something in it for everyone. It's not a really great movie per se, but it is a good movie, and I would have a hard time believing that anyone didn't like it at least a little bit.It's got jokes, a decent story, some great scenes and some great lines. The acting is pretty good too, even from Nic Cage who I think can sometimes be a bit over the top. Overall, this is a solid film. Recommend.",7,0,0,6 February 2019
Inception," I Didn't Love It
","INCEPTION had some good things about it and it had some bad things about it. A lot of the stuff was fun and original. However, I didn't love this movie like most people seemed to and I may never understand why it was so popular and well-liked. I thought a lot of stuff in it was overdone and a lot of parts were just downright boring.The acting was good and so were the special effects, but a whole two and a half hours of nothing but special effects honestly does get pretty boring after a while. This was no better than any of Nolan's other hack films he's made, like the Barman movies or INTERSTELLAR, and it drags on for way too long, which is why I'll never watch it again. Do not recommend.",6,1,4,2 April 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Interesting, Although Over-Hyped
","BIRDMAN is a good film. I like the story, the acting, and the execution. But it's not all it was made out to be. When this film came out people acted like it was the best thing ever. It is not. But it's still good.It's not making it onto any of my lists of top films, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it. It's good fun. Michael Keaton delivers a very fun and talented performance. It feels a bit too long at certain times, and gimmicky, but it's still worth a watch. Recommend.",7,0,1,15 June 2019
Scream," Decent Horror Film
","SCREAM is a well-known horror classic by this point in time. It was a milestone when it first came out, and it has held up with time. There are a lot of things that were original to this film that we've seen a hundred times since, but SCREAM did it first.Of course, there are a few things that it stole from earlier horror films, as is the case with most movies. There are bits that it borrowed from elsewhere that everyone else forgot about, so SCREAM gets all the credit in most folks' minds. There are some cheesy bits, and bits that didn't seem cheesy when this came out but do now. Overall, it's a must-see for those who enjoy the genre. Recommend for horror fans.",6,0,0,19 April 2020

","MARRIAGE STORY is a good, realistic story that keeps you intrigued from the beginning to end. The acting and writing are both excellent, and the directing is very good. Filmmaker Noah Baumbach has come a long way.His earlier films were good and they've consistently been so since then. This is perhaps his best so far overall, though by only complaint is the length. Longer films are fine, but this feels just a tad too long for what it is. Still very good thought. Recommend.",7,1,3,1 January 2020
Blade Runner," Pretty Darn Good
","I'm not normally a huge fan of the science-fiction genres. I like the old Star Wars movies but I could do without most of the rest. This is one of the exceptions however.What's not to love? It's got the best of Harrison Ford, neo-noir, and Ridley Scott. It's got a fun sort of steam-punk feel to it. And it's got a great story too! Recommend.",8,0,1,15 April 2019
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Great Woody Allen Film
","VICKY CHRISTINA BARCELONA is a very fun film with great characters and a unique plot. The story feels familiar, and yet it takes us in directions we never expect.Just hang on and enjoy the ride! The acting is great, as is the directing. Feels fresh for an Allen film, who is still coming up with original ideas after so many years and so many movies. Highly recommend.",9,0,0,8 May 2019
RED," Good Fun
","RED is an action comedy with an all-star cast. It's better than most others in the genre. It's certainly better than any of the EXPENDABLES films. It has a few truly great moments, some good laughs, and great action.That being said, it still follow the same conventions of its peers. There's nothing new or groundbreaking here. The story is predictable and formulaic. But those looking for some good mindless fun will enjoy this one. Recommend to fans of the genre.",6,0,0,11 June 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A Comedy Classic
","This beloved classic is absolutely hilarious for some and intolerable for others, although the latter category seems to be small but it certainly exists. I personally admit that I must be in the mood for this sort of humor.I could turn it on at the wrong time and find it hard to watch. But catch it on a good day, and it's a laugh a minute. Highly recommend.",9,0,0,5 April 2020
Slumdog Millionaire," An Excellent Motion Picture
","SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE has something in it for everyone. If you love feel-good movies you will love this movie for that reason and more. If you hate feel-good movies you will still love this movie for so many other reasons.It looks great, the soundtrack is awesome, the acting and story are both incredible. It's a beautiful film and you will want to watch it over and over again. Highly recommend.",10,0,1,26 March 2019
The Nice Guys," Very Good, Original
","THE NICE GUYS is surprisingly good. The trailer made it look kind of corny, but it always says on the good side of that line. It's quirky and fun, but never corny. The basic plot is nothing new, but the dynamic between the two leads feels fresh and original.There are some greats scenes and great dialog. There are several bits of long banter, the kind that often feels like it goes on for too long in a lot of films, but here it feels entirely appropriate and even welcome. The jokes are good and the action is good. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling both give great and memorable performances, some of the best of their careers. And they set it up for a sequel, which I hope we see someday soon. Recommend.",8,1,2,2 February 2019
Me Before You," A Fine Romance Film
","ME BEFORE YOU is a pretty good take on the romance film. It's not a romantic comedy by any stretch, but more of a sort of drama that has something to say. And whichever way you feel about the issues presented here (even the main characters share conflicting and ambiguous views about them) you will certainly enjoy this.What makes it good is that it's not too cheesy, like so many other films of its kind. Admittedly, it feels a little cheesy toward the start, but it never crosses the line. There are some good laughs and you may even cry too. The acting is great, as is the script and the directing. I feel like the roles were perfectly cast. It's hard to imagine another group of actors would do as good of a job. Recommend.",7,3,3,19 April 2019
Born on the Fourth of July," Sorry, But I Didn't Like This
","From a historical perspective, I'm very interested in the Vietnam War and the events surrounding it. But I don't know what it is about Oliver Stone. His films and their stories always show such promise. They start out good but then unravel at a certain point. Every time. Without fail. That's how it feels for me anyway.I do love Tom Cruise as an actor and thought he did a really good job here. But the film ended up boring and frustrating me. Perhaps in the hands of another director it would have turned out better, but Oliver Stone has failed me here once again. I should learn to live with it. Do not recommend.",5,1,2,15 April 2019
The Birds," Fun And Good
","THE BIRDS is a fun film by one of my favorite directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock. I've seen just about everything he made. This is by no means his masterpiece but it still holds up after all these years. It's unique and never boring. A classic, often shown on TV.Granted, it's nothing compared to the likes of PSYCHO or VERTIGO, for instance, just to name a few. He made tons of great pictures, and this falls somewhere in the middle. Better than most of his very early work. Recommend.",7,1,1,23 January 2019
The Martian," Good Fun
","THE MARTIAN is a realistic science-fiction film set in the near future. It stars Matt Damon in one of his finer performances. I normal don't care for his acting, but I thought he did a pretty good job in this one.The directing and cinematography are great. The pacing is spot-on. I think this is one of Ridley Scott's better films. Highly recommend.",8,2,3,2 May 2019
