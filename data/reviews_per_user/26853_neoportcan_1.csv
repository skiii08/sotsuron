The New World," Don't waste your time - Boring with no redeeming qualities
","First, I don't normally leave comments for movies, but I felt I need to for this one. My wife and I watched this film because it was rated 7.0 on IMDb.org. What a mistake! We both were completely bored by this movie. The 'acting' of Colin Farrell is pathetic. The rest of the cast is acceptable. Christian Bale did a good job with his role, but he doesn't appear on screen until the last 3rd of the movie. The scenery is pleasant but not enough to make up for the horrid script.We fast forwarded through the last 20 minutes having already wasted 2 hrs on this awful film, hoping it would get better (afterall, it was rated a 7.0). Don't make the same mistake I did. If you value your time, don't watch this movie! You have been warned.If you want to watch a good movie about the white man learning to appreciate the beauty and simplicity of the native's lifestyle, watch Dances with Wolves instead. You will not be disappointed.",1,2,8,10 November 2006
