The Rock," A surprise of a lifetime for action movies
","This movie surprised me like no other.  I read reviews, I saw how it did in the box office, and so I didn't expect too much.  Turns out, I got what I would have never expected. I came across something big.  Big enough to be one of, if not, the best action movies I have ever seen!  Ed Harris made a perfect patriotic bad guy.  Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery made a perfect match, and it made me laugh.  Cage played the wimp, and Connery played the tough guy, and it worked perfectly.  This movie based around a hostage situation, any hostage type story always drives me into it, but doesn't always end well.  This one did.  I enjoyed every moment, and that's why I gave it a rating of 10/10.  If I had any complaint for this movie, it would be to get rid of that white, hair-slicked-back, mustache guy.  That dude was annoying and really didn't need to be in this picture.  A better actor for that part might have helped.",9,2,2,21 March 2002
Predator," The best Arnold flick ever!
","Superb!  From start to finish, this movie left me on the edge of my seat. Arnold S. was perfect in this movie and I don't think any other actor could have pulled it off better.  As I watched it, I was just as bewildered as the guys in the mission.  Things were happening, and they didn't know what, and niether did I!  It was so cool to know my heart was pounding to their rythum.  Eventually, when everything was exposed, it got even better.  The action was very well plotted and the soundtrack matched perfectly.  Carl Weathers was a cool sidekick, giving complaints here and there and turning out to be a mole.  My only complaint is Arnold's invincibility.  I mean, he died like 5 times in that movie.  Either way, that doesn't harm my rating for this movie:  10/10",10,2,2,21 March 2002
LÃ©on: The Professional," Why is it called Le'on?
","First off, I loved the way this movie started.  After that, I was kind of disappointed.  Jean Reno looked like one cool dude and than quickly became a softy soft because he had to live with a 12-year old girl.  *SPOILER ALERT* I was a bit shocked when I noticed he muffled his gun and attempted to murder Matilda in her sleep.  I kind of wish he did, because to me, she was in the way most of this movie.  Still, he did not, and the movie was what it turned out to be.  *SPOILER GONE*Gary Oldman is hilarious!  This guy is never put on a leash.  In every movie I see him in, it's always an outrage personality he seems to portrait.  He's crazy, and that's a good thing.  Keep screamin' Gary, it's good for you. The ending was better but still failed to live up to any possible expectations.  Basically, this movie did not deliver in the way that I hoped.  Jean Reno is better suited for Ronin, than he is for this movie, IMO.  Rating:  6/10",7,0,3,28 March 2002
Cast Away," As real as it gets
","What a splash in the face.  This movie was amazingly put together and Tom Hanks delivered a performance like no other.  He was nominated for Best Actor for his role in this movie.  At first, Castaway takes you down an easy-going slope of normalcy and everyday life that we easily take for granted.  After that, it's pure survival that becomes so astonishingly gripping.  It makes you sad, and it may even make you cry.  Zemeckis and Hanks made another great movie together since Forrest Gump.  Don't miss out on this movie, especially if your a Tom Hanks fan. The cons?  I had a few minor ones.  Like, how big was the island?  I also didn't like how this movie ended but that is for you to decide.  My rating: 9/10",9,0,0,22 March 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Total recall of excellence from it's previous
","I remember seeing the first Terminator, and it was very good.  Though, this one sparked many areas that the first one did not.  This movie had action, and suspense, and acting, and(of course) graphics that out-did the first one.  I may be talking into my generation, but it's an opinion that I hold, and one that I will keep.  Finally, Arnold was able to play the good guy, and he was still his old self.  The grim faced get-outta-way terminator that we all loved from the first one.  Linda Hamilton also improved, showing she can defend herself this time instead of always running.  To me, it's hard to decifer that a mental institution can turn you into a gun handling combat marine when you were once a soft hearted little angel that just wanted to be hugged.  But, that's what it was and it was fine with me.  I loved every moment of this action flick.  The soundtrack was above average, but the graphics are definitly the highlight of this film.  Nothing looked unreal, like it did in the first Terminator.  The bad guy was totally awesome.  He was basically indestructable in which made the movie actually pretty scary at times.  Horror and action made a nice blend for this movie.  Terminator 2: Judgement Day was definitely 'Bad to the bone' and earned my 10/10 rating. My one complaint was the fight scene between the two terminators, kinda lame.",9,1,1,21 March 2002
Heat," Best Crime Drama I've seen yet!
","Y'know, I was never a big fan of Robert De Niro.  I also did NOT like Al Pacino, for reasons disclosed.  But after this movie, I am their biggest fan, I kid you not.  This movie is THAT good.  The soundtrack really went great with how the movie developed.  Elliot Goldenthal did a wonderful job composing it.  At first this film was kinda hard to swallow, but it gets much better.  It's quite thorough, and that's a very good thing.  You'll wanna see it over and over again, just to get a better understanding.  I can promise you, you won't understand this movie the first time you watch it. It takes a few rounds.  The suspense is amazing though..  This movie had many stars to make it great.  Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, and(now a star) Natalie Portman.  De Niro's tough punk attitude was perfect for his role.  He was so ruthless and that makes any bad guy, a REAL bad guy.  Al Pacino was a bit of a wild one at times, but that's his character for this movie.  Besides, he's used to yelling.  He's yelled in every movie I've seen.  This movie was 171 minutes, and I love long movies that aren't romantic, I really do.  I gave this movie a 9/10 rating.  Good enough for anyone to see(except for the kids).",9,0,0,21 March 2002
Back to the Future," A unique twist of Time Travel gone super!
","Time travel is something we all want to do one day.  Still, until that day arrives, we have Back to the Future to reminiscent off of.  Back to the Future was a great movie.  The teen style McFly mixed with a doc inventing everything from anything.  Going into the past was so cool.  Everyone wishes they could visit their heritage, so this movie did it for us.  Robert Zemeckis did a wonderful job on this flick.  My only con, is that they didn't explore more avenues.  For example, jumping into the Roman times, or even the Egyptian times.  Although, to be fair, they didn't actually get the chance according to the storyline, so it's really nobody's fault.  I gave this movie a rating of 9/10.",9,1,2,22 March 2002
