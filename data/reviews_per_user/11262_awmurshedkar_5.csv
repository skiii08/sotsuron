The King's Speech," The King's Speech
","THE KING'S SPEECH – 9.4/10 Director: Tom Hooper Writer: David SeidlerMost intelligent scripts are not written out of pure imagination. There must certainly be a mix of brute reality and concocted fantasy. The King's Speech is one of those films that balance the nuances of fictional storytelling with realism exceptionally well, to an extent where it provoked me to research the inspirations of the writer who came up with such brilliance in simplicity. The film is a classic case of intelligent script writing. We frequently come across films where we are not sure what happened in the end. By this I don't mean films that have complicated plots, but instead films in which viewers are lost and rendered hopeless. If we being to explore the myriad elements the scriptwriter has used to produce this marvel, it might well serve as a little old school text book lesson. While I do believe that the purpose of art is to redefine definitions and break rules, this one almost seems to stick to archaic definitions but much to ones delight. The film has a strong protagonist, the roscius Colin Firth (King George IV), with an even stronger antagonist, well. Mr.stammer. Every character that does anything in the film is impacting, affecting, and related to in some manner or the other to the protagonist and antagonist. Even the King's brother's character has so tidily been knit into the entire scheme of speech impairment, no matter how little on screen time he received. The writer never forgets his central plot and focus, and keeps every character, their individual stories coming back to the central theme of the film – The King's speech impairment.He takes the film to a meaningful conclusion but first builds towards it systematically, craftily placing each stone, each brick in the right position to ensure the edifice of the film is flawless. What matters even more is the climax is not bigger than it should have been nor was it subdued or understated for sake of humility or otherwise. The achievement of the film was to make the viewer feel the joy of both, the King who just overcame his toughest hurdle, and the shrink who knew what he had achieved. Like the insignificant audience to the King's speech, we too are awed, enamored and pleased by what we are hearing. With a very weak premise – A King's Speech impairment to begin with, it is a mammoth task to build a film with so much dimension, several characters each carefully delineated, absolutely no lose ends or irrelevant sub-plots, a thick central plot and yet there was time to sprinkle ample humor. A point worthy of mention was the humor in the film. It does not rely on age old situational tactics or awkward everydayness inflated to extract laughs from a fatigued audience. The film has exceptional eloquence as though it was a book and not a film, and the humor is well integrated, flowing as smoothly as the prose with the rest of the film.The acting is top notch, and each individual more than outperforms the other. The characters are real and believable and are consistent throughout the film, never once showing signs of their true selves. It was acting that carried the film further than what it would have gone had the acting gone wrong or was not appropriate in the given circumstances. When you have several conversations between a shrink and his patient, it is the acting and the script that will keep you absorbed, and nothing less, if nothing more. Camera techniques were interesting to watch. You had the use of wide angle in closed rooms, contrary to its purpose. The magnificent halls of the royalty palaces and grand architecture of yester year London have been captured and used to great effect. The rule of thirds, though I am not sure what purpose it served in context of the film, added a sense of dimension to the scene and character. Close crops were introduced strictly when needed. Use of empty space is to perfection; I wonder if it was added to increase the sense of restriction an individual with speech impairment feels, as it certainly played on my subconscious mind and was only noticed when I made an effort to. David Seidler who suffered from the same problem himself has done justice to his cause by writing such a witty, emotional and simple yet a grand film. With whatever cues the makers could take from reality, the film certainly manages to deliver at all levels. All in all, The King's Speech is a perfect family drama, with several layers within it, and is an all weather, mood and season film.",9,0,1,27 April 2011
127 Hours," 127 Hours
","127 HOURS – 9.3/10 Director: Danny Boyle Writer: Danny Boyle, Simon BeaufoyThe first film I saw of Danny Boyle's was Slumdog Millionaire and his third was 127 hours. From an ordinary, mainstream and clichéd director, he rose to the status of an extraordinary genius, ring master and a leader in his style of work. It was the brilliance of 127 hours and Trainspotting that led me to understand the master at work in Slumdog. It's a film worthy of discussion, and probably can teach you as much about direction as you would learn from a month long workshop.The story deals with the real life incident of trekker Aron Ralston , played exceptionally well by James Franco, who fell into a crevice in a remote canyon in Utah as a lose boulder came off and trapped his hand in the process. In my opinion, the subject the film deals with is the hardest to recreate as you are dealing with almost one subject for the entire length of the film, and here is the hardest part – your subject is stuck in one place. Boyle manages to do what no other director has dared or achieved to do thus far. Many survival stories have been made, but I remember none being so enigmatic and captivating for the entire duration of the film.Boyle uses several techniques from triptychs, zooming and split-screens to mash-ups and other beautiful original and inventive techniques. The challenge was to ensure that at no point, the film becomes static as the story had forced the subject to be. Audience attention span is limited and you can often lose them very quickly if nothing much transpires on screen for more than a few minutes. In this case, Boyle absolutely conscious of this fact, at all times, keeps the camera alive. There is almost a sense of desperation in the camera work, which in reality is actually conveying the trapped trekker's desperation. The film reflects what one could call Boyle's vivid and childlike imagination. In the hands of a serious story teller, this film could become another survival tale meant to pluck at those emotional strings, more suited for a Discovery Channel documentary than an hour and a half commercial relay. Boyle paints the film colorful, capturing every little detail one could possibly capture in a cramped crevice. James Franco, who has managed to raise standards for acting in survival films to a new high, is as much part of the charisma that Boyle creates with his breath-taking camera work. It is to be observed how Franco switches from a tormented trapped trekker unsure of what will happen in the next few hours to a mature, controlled and calm individual in control of the situation. Franco jokes around as though he was on television, and you can see the pain and realization, and the hopefulness lingering on his face and in his voice. Boyle does an excellent job of using, memories, flash-backs and hallucinations to build character and move the film forward.127 Hours is an achievement, a feat in itself. The very fact that such a difficult story was chosen shows extreme boldness and appetite for new challenges on part of the director. The film is arguably the best survival film I have seen. This proves so much that we don't need a lot of special effects and large budgets or exotic locations to make something worth your money. Three cheers for Danny Boyle!",9,2,4,15 May 2011
Cast Away," Cast Away
","CAST AWAY – 9.3/10 Director: Robert ZemeckisWriter: William Broyles Jr.The greatness of a film is normally traced to the director; there are no two ways about that. We seldom know who the writer is and are even less curious as to who it might be. Cast Away is a case-in-point; it made me shout half way through the film – 'who the hell wrote this' ? One of the finest stories of the 21st century, there is much more this film talks about than what it was given credit for. The director, Robert Zemeckis (Forest Gump fame) needless to say has done a brilliant job, but what needs serious mention is the writer – William Broyles Jr.The writer marooned himself for a week on an island to understand what people do in survival situations and consulted several survival experts. Cast Away deals with the very basics of human life; it pokes the viewer with questions we never ask ourselves. Or maybe the need to ask these questions never arise - Why are we here? The film has a strong existential undertone and Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee marooned on an island after a plane crash, has given one of the finest performances of his career. The film deals with the struggle of a man who must survive, for the sake of surviving. Chuck, after repeated attempts, has given up hope of returning to the civilized world, and after realizing he has no control even over the way he wishes to die, he simply lives on with the memory of his would-be-wife – Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt).During the period when Broyles had marooned himself on an island, a ball came in with the tide and pop came the idea of the inanimate character – Wilson. Broyles highlights how a man is so helpless and no better than a rock, if his existence is not recognized by another. The character of Wilson has given the writer some creative liberty to make the film something not close to a silent film, and this stroke of genius mixed with some luck has been craftily used. The cinematography is commendable and the almost one sided conversations throughout the film are interwoven with hidden philosophies and memorable humor.An emotional poetry of love, fate and belonging, Cast Away is a milestone in Hollywood cinema. To breathe so much life, meaning and humor into a subject so dark and tragic, needs pure genius. Chuck's longing for Kelly and his ultimate acceptance of his fate in the final scene between them is a timeless poem that will outlive the film's critics and lovers. Man needs to belong; that is the very crux of him. Don't forget this. This film won't let you.",10,4,6,26 April 2011
City of God," City Of God
","CITY OF GOD – 9.8/10 Director: Fernando Meirelles & Kátia Lund(co-director) Writer: Bráulio MantovaniI can get into the technical aspects of the film and destroy it or I can just leave you to do the hard work. I think I'll go with the latter. An ensemble cast with only one trained professional actor, the film is the finest I have scene when it comes to depicting lives of those living in situations so unfortunate, that most of us forget to be remotely thankful or remorseful. The screenplay though, needs special mention; we constantly but seamlessly cut back and forth in time throughout the film – a special thanks to Daniel Rezende for the razor sharp editing – but never is the viewer lost, so refined is the choice of sequences and finessed the flow of the film. There is also a reason why the film is cyclical, the point of which I am hoping to get across by the end of review (enough of technicality).The story progresses from the point of view of Alexandre Rodrigues (Buscape – Rocket), the only individual to escape the violence but not the favela. Through his camera and narration, we see the lives of several children/individuals, who grow up in the City of God, a housing project in Rio de Janeiro quite notorious for its criminal activity. The film casually depicts how children get absorbed into mindless violence and are perpetually condemned to it, their lives spiraling towards an endless state of human tragedy. The plot is too lengthy to narrate and it wouldn't serve a purpose to serve up spoilers either. There is something this film evokes within me, which I feel is worthy of a mention.There is a prevalent belief that if a film is nominated for Oscars, it must be good. That is a dangerous belief. What is even more dangerous is the belief that if a film did not win an Oscar, it must have not been 'that' good. To understand the complexities of a film like City of God, there is no given formula; but if you are from a third world country and have had first hand knowledge or even worst, experience of such a life, there is a good chance you might not relegate such films to award ceremonies.Social structures are complex. We take what we get (at birth) as a given and live with it for the rest of our lives. The marginalization, is a given. Wealth disparities, cultural and behavioral differences across strata are all a given; it is what we use to separate 'us' from 'them'. The 'them' & 'us' & 'us' & 'them' perpetuates. We never imagine what our lives would be if we were not born to the fortunes we were. Instead of our parents, if our guides were our peers who were gun wielding, drug churning maniacs, whose lust for power leads to failed societies and absolute chaos, the very same power the civilized societies so tacitly condones.The director wants us to ruminate, to ponder, to reflect. Take the directors intent too seriously and all coffee table discussions about poverty, crime, brutality and the children who are victims and perpetrators of such intent, might seize into oblivion. The 'us' & 'them' might fade and disappear, the same 'us' & 'them' which gives us our superior identity and allows us to take pride and reason in what we do. Well if you dare to fathom the film City of God, all the superiority complexes, the fragile mirages and concocted illusions might just get shattered and the unreal reality – debunked. You have been warned. That is the power of City of God.",10,1,3,12 February 2011
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Blood
","There Will Be Blood – 9.8/10 Director: Paul Thomas AndersonWriter: Paul Thomas Anderson Ground-breaking, disturbing, distraught,frightening, unnerving, intimidating, and in every sense of the word –'a masterpiece'. There Will Be Blood is a character sketch so strong,so complex, that it might take an individual a lifetime of trials and tribulations to comprehend the forces of human nature at work.The film is dark and desolate, like much of Upton Sinclair's works, on whose book 'Oil' the film is loosely based on. Paul Thomas Anderson's (Magnolia) vision to convert this nature study of capitalism into a stunning film, revolving around an oil baron and a pastor has yielded starkly contrasting reactions. While audiences at large have not taken to the film particularly well, most critics unanimously agreed it was Anderson's best. Daniel Day-Lewis (Daniel Plainview), who plays the role of the oil prospector, has etched a new character in the history of world cinema and Paul Dano (Paul Sunday/Eli Sunday) who became a part of the film after the shooting started has played Day-Lewis' antagonist with perfection.Anderson researched this film with all sincerity and it shows. Day-Lewis spend days understanding the character he was playing, to an extent that the actor who Paul Dano replaced alleged he was intimidated by Daniel's character, off-screen as well! The cinematography of the film is simple brilliance, and rightly earned Robert Elswit, Anderson's companion from Magnolia, an Oscar for best cinematography. While the music of the film did not earn much appreciation, I thought it perfectly complemented the film. In several instances, the music lays bare Day-Lewis' emotions, especially in the instance post the accident, when he has a conversation with his son HW, played by Dillion Freasier.The film had a very strong script. This is almost true of all films made from successful and well written novels. But Day-Lewis has gone a step forward and owned the character. He commands every iota of attention in the film and for the first twenty minutes, where there is no dialogue, Lewis proceeds to build and delineate a character which will ultimately define what the film will be. I am not sure if I have seen a better character sketch in a film, a character so powerful, that it leaves one disturbed when the credits role in. What has amazed me is the magnitude with which the audience and critics alike have misunderstood the character narrative of the film.Lewis' character has largely been interpreted as a heartless, cruel, capitalist for who even his adopted son is just a tool to achieve power and success. I believe this widespread misinterpretation is due to a shallow approach that capitalists are greedy and will stop at nothing to achieve their goals. The character of the film is so complex, that I am not sure if there is enough space and time, and ability to explain the nuances and explore the depths. But I will make a brief attempt to do so.Lewis' character is shown to be highly competitive. A man who trusts no one and loves nothing; he is lonely and believes there is no need to understand people as it would be a futile pursuit beyond that what is obvious. But he is not a man driven by pure greed, nor is he blinded by wealth and affluence as many viewers have believed. His relation with his son, and his inability to chart the course of his son's life, reveal his softer side while throwing light on his own superiority, godlessness and a form of megalomania. His character is extremely rational, but his hatred for everything that competes with him ultimately leads to his destruction. Not only is he aware of this (the last dialogue of the film tells us this), we see several moments where his loneliness breaks him; but the fundamental purpose of a human being shedding tears is undermined if there is no one to wipe them. He rises spiteful, harsher and harder after each trial, like a rock hardened by the incessant heat of a volcano. He seeks some solace, something to hold on to. Any trace of familial blood (There WILL Be BLOOD) which he can create by the virtue of his will or by the hand of destiny, he shall accept. The complexities of his character are so profound, that they only reveal themselves in small and quick passing dialogues and one has to live the character to truly see through him.I dread to say there are common traits Daniel Plainview shares with all and everybody. We have either failed to realize it, even though our actions would speak, or we have managed to subvert, repress and bury them deep enough for acceptance in an unforgiving, conditional society. The film is like a streak of artistic lightening in a bleak sky. Whether this film speaks of perfection or not, we will never know, but one thing is certain, we will debate its mastery for years to come.",10,16,25,23 July 2011
