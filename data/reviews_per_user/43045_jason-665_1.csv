Scarface," Work Of Art
","This was the first Al Pacino Film I Watched and it has Permanently made me addicted to the mans films. The has endless amounts of great acting and brilliant scenes, Pacinos accent is fabulous and I admire his dedication to a film project to be able to produce Tony Montana on the screen with this accent. The Chainsaw scene is particularly brilliant with making it so gory yet not really showing any think it is a mixture of sounds and blood spraying that makes this an excellent scene. Overall this film has become a fantastic thrill for me to experience and I recommend this with a ten out of ten or one hundred per cent either way one hell of a good film.",10,3,6,16 October 2004
