National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Umm ...How Did Finding The Treasure Clear The Gates Family Name?
","I admit that watching the first NATIONAL TREASURE movie was a guilty pleasure, but here ends my enjoyment of anything National or Treasure. Sequels are tough to pull off (can anyone say 'INDIANA JONES 4?') and one has to wonder why Hollywood continues to pump them out even when the script fails on almost every level ...and such was the case with National Treasure 2.If anyone can tell me how finding this new treasure helped solve the Gates family's problem related to their relatives' association with the Lincoln assassination, please let me know. Because that was what this film was all about, right? I mean, we start off with Thomas Gates (Joel Gretsch, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) being approached by the men who set up President Lincoln's assassination, who in turn kill Thomas for refusing to give up the secrets to an ancient language in a document they have. We then move on to the current day where this document comes to the attention of the Gates family by the sinister Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris) who presents his evidence that Thomas Gates was the mastermind behind Lincoln's death. So Ben Gates (Nicholas Cage, GHOST RIDER), his father Patrick (Jon Voight, TRANSFORMERS), Ben's estranged wife Abigail (Diane Kruger) and Ben's trusty friend and sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha, FAILURE TO LAUNCH) head out to clear the family name by finding the lost treasure of pre-America. But how, exactly, this will clean-up their family name isn't clear ...or even explained. A pretty big hole in the story's central plot.This plot hole combined with everything we've already seen in the previous NATIONAL TREASURE film makes this second installment tedious and full of non-surprises.The only positive spin the film can claim is Justin Bartha's Riley character who infuses almost all of the comedy by having a monopoly on the best lines ('Ben, if it were you trying to convince me, you'd have less evidence and I'd already believe you by now.').But that's it. Even the dastardly character Mitch Wilkinson (Harris) doesn't stay dastardly; only moments before he turns 'good' he was holding a knife to Ben's mother's neck (Helen Mirren, THE QUEEN), making his character completely unbelievable now. Gah! National Treasure 2 is a true disaster, with such poor characterization and plotting that it makes the entire film feel like it's laced with fool's gold with nary a piece of treasure in sight.",3,1,2,6 July 2008
Changeling," Jolie Surprises By Not Showing Skin And Instead Showing Much Talent
","The CHANGELING is a frightening cautionary tale of historical abuses by those in power against the meager. No, I'm not talking about the last eight years under George W. Bush. This is 1928 Los Angeles, and a single mother named Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie, WANTED) returns home from work to find her young son Walter (Gattlin Griffith) missing. After frantic calls to the local police department, the next day a patrol car is sent out and a missing person's report is filed. Five months later Walter is found and brought home ...but it isn't Walter. He was taller ...and was not circumcised. Ms. Collins pleads with the police to find her son and take back this imposter but the police refuse.Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan, HITCH) of the LAPD tries to make Ms. Collins seem crazy or out of touch. He goes so far as to have her incarcerated at a mental institution where she finds other women like herself who have challenged the authority of the police only to have everything taken away.Meanwhile we learn that an insane man named Gordon Stewart Northcott (Jason Butler Harner, JOHN ADAMS miniseries) has kidnapped many children and taken them to his distant ranch where unthinkable things were done. Most of this was discovered when a Canadian child illegally in the U.S. spills the goods to a semi-decent cop, Detective Ybarra (Michael Kelly, DAWN OF THE DEAD) who tries to bring this to the attention of his superiors only to be rebuffed because 'it doesn't look good for the department.' On Ms. Collins' side (even while she's in the loony bin) is Reverend Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich, BURN AFTER READING) who learns of Christine's problems with the LAPD and already has a running battle going on with them over their autocratic style. His assistance is invaluable in aiding in Christine's release from the mental institution ...as well as releasing the other women who were wrongfully imprisoned on behalf of the LAPD.History tells us that Mr. Northcott gets what's coming to him. He's a slightly pitiable and disgusting fellow who was probably completely insane. Actor Jason Harner played him exceptionally well; a creepy and frightening premonition from the past. We also learn that several LAPD higher-ups get canned in the wake of the breaking news about the despicable things the authorities have done.Most of the praise obviously goes to Angeline Jolie for her excellent portrayal of Christine Collins. You can feel the rising tension as she battles to find her son and butts up against the walls of 'justice.' Frustration is palpable. And you hope beyond hope that little Walter survived his ordeal. But did he? History tells us he probably didn't. But who knows. He could be a changeling, wandering out there, lost amidst the masses. We hope...(Final note: Clint Eastwood needs to stay behind the camera from now on. He's got what it takes to remain a powerful director. Please!)",9,1,2,3 June 2009
The New World," Strolling Through Nuance Rather Than In-Your-Face Action
","The New World has many detractors. Most comment on the slow pace of the film, and this is undeniably so. 'It's like watching grass grow' is the commonly heard cliché. I'm not here to defend the speed at which this story unfolds; it IS slow. But it's also beautifully put together.Try this: You're in a raft on a placidly flowing river. Trees wash by, animals nibble grasses on the shores, the sky illuminates a beautiful blue above and below while the sun warms your legs. The rapids are few and easily navigated, allowing you time to view everything around you. Sound boring? Or comfortable? If this sounds like death, stay away from The New World. If it sounds pleasant and enjoyable, give the film a try.What I enjoyed was the how the story dribbled into the viewer's lap. It roiled around you like a cool mountain stream and allowed time for everything to come into focus. This isn't Disney's Pocahontas; this is how the Jamestown Settlement came to be, in all its boringness and beauty.Colin Farrell stars as Captain John Smith, one of the founders of the original colonies. He and his shipmates arrive in the Americas and are soon building a fort while the leader of the group, Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer), heads back to Europe to resupply and bring more colonists.Meanwhile, Jamestown is nearly overrun by disease, power struggles, and the native Indians. Amidst all this, Captain Smith meets up with Pocahontas, the pretty and inquisitive daughter of a local chieftain. It is her generosity that allows these first colonists to survive, and it is mainly because of her love for Smith.After Captain Smith leaves the colony in search of better lands up north, it is wrongly reported to Pocahontas that her love perished in a shipping accident. Thus she despairs and eventually falls for John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a tobacco farmer.Pocahontas is later requested by the King and Queen of England to come to Court and meet them and she does. Thus, we have TWO new worlds being discovered: one for the Europeans (America), and one for the Native Americans (England and Europe).Pocahontas later learns that Captain Smith is still alive. It is a bitter realization and she has to decide whom to stay with, Smith or Rolfe.It is the beautiful cinematography of The New World that really pulls the viewer in. Some have complained that it should have won Best Cinematography at the Oscars and not Memoirs of a Geisha. I disagree. The New World is extremely beautiful to watch, no doubt, but I feel Memoirs of a Geisha was a bit better on the eyes.The wondrous musical score was another boon for the film. Surrounding the viewer/listener in an emulsion of color and sound, the music made for some powerful moments. Terrence Malick, Director, knows how to engage an audience. But it's not going to capture all those who watch it.In a society where action sells better than art, this film will be lost to many. Don't get me wrong, I love action films just as much as anyone. But it's not a necessary ingredient for a movie such as this. The authenticity (as seen on the DVD's extra features) will astound many; I know it blew me away. The re-creation of the settlement, the Native American huts, the battle gear, etc, are all pulled from archaeological records and sources. Impressive.It's also noteworthy to mention how little dialogue there is in the film. Terrence Malick prefers to let the scenes speak for themselves rather than have actors and actresses voices spoil the moment.I guess what it boils down to is this: If you don't like art films that focus on nuance rather than specifics, stay away from The New World. But if you don't mind letting your mind meander through a burbling set of scenes, you'll probably delight in this film.",6,0,2,29 May 2006
Howl's Moving Castle," Loose Ends Ruined It For Me
","Having little experience in the Anime realm, I have to admit I'm probably not the most knowledgeable reviewer to examine a film such as this. But what I DO feel I'm fairly qualified to do is to evaluate stories. Animated or not, films are a valued method of reaching out to viewers and creating entertainment.Although HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE had some great animation and interesting concepts, the story was so nonsensical in so many places that I found myself shaking my head wondering why I was watching it.The story (if I'm not mistaken) is about Sophie, a young milliner (hatmaker) who lives a mundane life until she's afflicted by a curse put upon her by the (initially) evil Witch of the Waste. The curse comes in the form of age, turning Sophie instantly from a vibrant young girl into a ancient old hag. In order to break the spell, she must find Howl and his moving castle. But with the curse comes the added insult that she cannot tell anyone about it. So once our heroine meets up with Howl, she's unable to tell him what she needs and instead becomes the moving castle's housekeeper.Within the house she finds a young boy who wants to be just like Howl. She also meets and befriends the power that helps keep Howl's castle constantly on the go: a type of fire called Calcifer. And with the castle comes a multitude of problems: Howl's carelessness and difficulties of 'the heart', a war against outside forces, and the threat of the Witch of the Waste.Again, the animation in the film was great. It was excellently colored and moved in an almost Van Goghish fashion across the screen. But oh the story! There's never an explanation given as to the war that is constantly circling this strange land. Why and how it got started are never fully explained, even though much screen time is given to the machines of war. Why and how the young boy who lives in Howl's castle came to be there are never explained either. Nor is any explanation given to the powers of Calcifer, the fire that drives the castle (the ending touches on it slightly but very ineffectually.) There are plenty of other non-sequiturs but those are the biggest. Too bad, really, as there were some great voices amongst the cast ...from Christian Bale, Billy Crystal and Lauren Bacall just to name a few.I don't mind films that leave a certain amount of exposition up to the viewers interpretation, but there needs to be some rhyme and/or reason for the basic constructs of a movie. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE left me howling for too many explanations.",3,37,64,5 June 2006
Walk the Line," My Dad and Johnny Cash
","My introduction to Johnny Cash's music was when I was eight years old. My father started collecting his albums (8-tracks actually) and whenever we were on the road he'd pop one in and we'd listen to I Walk The Line or Ring Of Fire or Folsom Prison Blues; those were the main ones anyway. My dad wasn't a big music fan back then  he was extremely selective  but Cash was his exception. Not knowing what Johnny's music was all about, I really didn't give much thought as to why my father should or shouldn't like the singer ('He sings real good, doesn't he Dad?' 'Yes he does'). This might seem more like a family reminiscence on my part but humor me for just one more minute.My father was pretty conservative: he paid his taxes on time without question, was a Marine, believed in the death penalty, enjoyed any kind of sports, and coached in a Pop-Warner football league.Fast forward to this movie, Walk The Line, and I have to wonder why my father felt so strongly for this man's music. Johnny Cash was anything but conservative. Joaquin Phoenix's excellent portrayal of Mr. Cash  from his humble beginnings on an Arkansas farm to his nearly fatal brush with amphetamine addiction  shows us all the flaws this incredibly gifted man had balled up inside him. He drank like a fish, womanized while on tour, supported better living standards for prison inmates (something my father would NEVER agree with), and enjoyed the rock-a-billy sounds that were just emerging onto the airwaves. Cash's worldviews were fairly extreme and this spilled over into the lyrics for his songs (just listen to his best-selling At Folsom Prison album and you'll see what I mean).So what was it about Johnny Cash that pulled my dad into his fandom? Well, this movie shows us. Johnny Cash's voice ('Like a freight train coming 'round a bend but sharp as a razor') is hypnotic, and Mr. Phoenix deserves all of the notoriety he's received for playing this role. It's stunning to learn that Joaquin didn't lip-sync any of the songs, but sung them all himself. And although Johnny Cash's voice was a bit coarser and deeper, Mr. Phoenix should be congratulated for his singing talent. He amazed me.The shining light in the movie, however, was Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Who could've guessed that this Legally Blonde comedic talent could act so dramatically? Her singing voice was wonderful, too, doing all of June Carter's songs without lip-syncing  just as Joaquin had.But I do have two complaints. First, I didn't much care for the ending. I felt it was abrupt and tried too hard to tie everything up into a nice 'family package' in just a few minutes. Second (although not really a complaint but more of a comparison) is that there've been some really great character films done in the past few years, and although Walk The Line ranks right up there with the best of them, I felt that Jamie Foxx did a bit better job in Ray (but I think overall Walk The Line was better as entertainment).Still, this is a great movie with excellent filming and information about an American icon of the music industry. I'm sure my dad loved it, too.",8,6,9,15 April 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Dorat, Borat's Second Cousin, Gives His Review
","'It is with great joy that we were able to reach Dorat, the second cousin of Borat, and get his input on this new film that is sweeping box offices around the globe. His perspectives on the movie are unique to those from Kazakhstan and we hope that you enjoy his review.(Note: the commentary by Dorat is in no way supported or condoned by us, and do not necessarily represent our world-view opinions.)' Hello! Is Dorat here. Can you hear me? Hello? Oh. I guess this is one way conversation, so I talk at you and you listen. Okay? Hello? Okay. I come to speak today of movie, Borat. My second cousin from Kazakhstan make this documentary and I love it. It touch my heart. I need say, too, that Borat's sister now #2 prostitute in all of Kazakhstan. Her trophy bigger now. She kiss like Juicy Fruit gum. You know Juicy Fruit? Hello? Okay.When Borat leave Kazakhstan, we all worry he make us look stupid. But he did great job. His house nice place, too. He show how it stand almost straight and have room for beautiful cow in livingroom. I need say, too, there was rumor Borat's wife die. Is not so. She fall in love with man from Siberia and go north with him. She may be dead now but don't think so.Borat come to New York City on plane with Azamat, other Kazakhstan man who help Borat along way. It scary Americans on subway not kiss Borat back when he greet them. What wrong with America? Hello? You still listening? Okay. I worried, too, that Borat's Kazakhstan chicken get stomped on subway when she got out of bag. But not happen. Whew! It nice to see so many good places to relieve bowels in America. The flowers in front of place called Trump Towers was pretty and open.On early visit, Borat run into man who teach him about jokes in America. It strange, too, that Americans do not joke of retards. They so stupid, you must make jokes. And what is happening with feminism. Is that right word? Hello? Okay. Borat speak true about womans smaller brains. Scientific study in Kazakhstan prove it. Don't know why those womans so upset with Borat for speaking true.Television in America look very nice. And is place where Borat fall in love with Pameela Anderson. I would sex her up as good as my own sister, too. But Borat should not have lie to Azamat about why they go to California. He should have said to Azamat, 'We go California so I can sex up and marry Pameela.' The trip across America was fun and scary. I love bear they get for protection. Too bad Azamat get so hungry later on. Poor bear. At least they no have to clean up bear poop now. I not know, too, that American Jews no have horns. Is most scary! When Borat and Azamat stay at Jew home and not know until too late. Brrrr! I thought documentary turn into horror film. But I cheer when Borat and Azamat get out of Jew home safely in middle of night.When Azamat and Borat get into huge fight, was sad. But Azamat should not been masturbate to Pameela's picture. They wrestle and fight and run through hotel. Naked fighting is tough, because no clothes to hang on to. When Azamat pinned Borat to bed and make mustache smell like testicles, was sad day for Borat.It good that they return to friends soon. I surprised, though, that Azamat dress like Hitler in California. Was he trying to hide? When Borat finally meet Pameela, it sadden me that she not understand Kazakhstan way of marriage proposal. Kidnap is natural courting. I sure Borat would explain that to Pameela if given opportunity.I happy to see Borat return home to Kazakhstan. He bring Luenell back with him, too, and she now #1 prostitute in all Kazakhstan. Borat sister now have competition.I take away from movie pride all Kazakhstan people now feel for country. We have representative in Borat. He a man who know the cultural learnings of America for make benefit glorious nation of Kazakhstan.",10,2,14,6 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," Tell Me What The Plot Was Again?
","Hulkamania is back on the screen! He's green! He's mean! He's ...uh ...green and mean.With less than five years separating Ang Lee's 2003 version entitled simply HULK, French director Louis Leterrier (who's done a few questionable films in the recent past, including TRANSPORTER 2 and DANNY THE DOG aka UNLEASHED), takes up the Marvel comic book reigns and takes a shot at the pi$$ed off Bruce Banner.Replacing Erica Bana (MUNICH) as the Hulk/Bruce Banner is film star Edward Norton (THE PAINTED VEIL). Norton's film repertoire up to now has been fairly superlative: American HISTORY X, DEATH TO SMOOCHY, FIGHT CLUB, THE Italian JOB, DOWN IN THE VALLEY, THE ILLUSIONIST, and several other high caliber films decorate his resume, so I was expecting another engaging film from him. Although I found his performance to be good, the story suffered from a lack of direction; it's goal seeming to be only to tell you that another film is coming with the Hulk's involvement. In other words, no plot.Marvel has had a couple of successes lately, though, and one can't necessarily knock them for doing what they're doing, which is setting comic book fans up for 'something big'. Their highest claim to fame is undoubtedly IRON MAN starring Robert Downey Jr. I loved Iron Man. Downey Jr. encapsulated the character and was both funny and cocky. A great match. But here, with THE INCREDIBLE HULK, we get a jumble of quality.Part of the problem is undeniably due to the fact that this film comes off the heals of Ang Lee's version. Lee's Hulk was anything but perfect, let's make that perfectly clear. But it did reinvent Hulk and gave us a unique look at the dynamics behind the character. Here in The Incredible Hulk, we get a forced love story (with no background, really), an intro to the Abomination, and lots and lots (and LOTS) of guns. The Abomination's inclusion will obviously play a vital part in upcoming films, and I appreciate that, but let's tell a good story along with it. Lee's Hulk, at the very least, did that.There are a few positive qualities here, though. The cast is fairly strong except for another wooden performance by William Hurt (INTO THE WILD). He seemed to be just going through the motions. There's also the fact that the film feels more like the television series, jumping us right into Bannon's life and his isolation due to his medical condition. We also get a glimpse of the original Hulk, Lou Ferrigno (if you pay attention).But these positives do not outweigh the negatives. Lacking any real direction, The Incredible Hulk is interesting eye-candy with plenty of action but little substance ...which made me turn a bit green.",4,1,4,23 November 2008
Mission: Impossible III," Ethan Hunt Shows His Humanity
","One might picture Ethan Hunt as the American version of James Bond, and they would probably be on the mark. We Americans always have to one-up anybody who tries to top us, of course. If the USSR has bigger missiles with higher yields of plutonium, then by God we'd better get some bigger ones ourselves! And if Ian Fleming's James Bond can out-maneuver the world's bad-guys every time, then by God we'd better find a hero of our own who can too! So The Impossible Mission Force (IMF) was created to the excitement of action film fans around the West. With it we got Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, VANILLA SKY), a kick-butt-and-take-no-names kinda guy who's out to save the world.With the previous two Mission Impossible flicks, the focus was always on the action just for the sake of action. It was entertaining, but lacked the depth that we'd like to see from characters on occasion. So it is notable to mention that we get much more from Ethan Hunt in MI: III thanks to a love interest named Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan, NORTH COUNTRY). That we have Philip Seymour Hoffman (as the bad guy, Owen Davian) also pumps up the character interactions to new and higher levels.The story surrounds Ethan's retirement as an active member from the IMF. He's an instructor now who's forced back into service when he learns that his star pupil, Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell, WE WERE SOLDIERS), has gone missing on a mission. She was tracking down the deadly Mr. Owen Davian (Hoffman). Back with his cadre of IMF members (including Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and Maggie Q) they locate Lindsey and pull her from the clutches of the evil doers, only to have her die in Ethan's arms. Now out for vengeance as much as to find Davian, Ethan and his folk track down the bad guy and stumble upon something called 'The Rabbit's Foot,' a deadly item that is never fully explained (gotta give the writers/director credit here, as this wasn't what the movie was about, so the focus didn't need to be on another world-destroying virus or whatever it might've been). And when Davian kidnaps Ethan's girl Julia, Ethan must do double-duty as an agent and a man protecting the woman he loves (and recently, secretly, married).Full of eye-popping stunts, shot on multiple continents, and loaded with great cars, boats, and beautiful people, MI: III has everything that the previous two Impossible films had. Except, as stated, this time we see more of Ethan's humanity. He's a husband now, a man in love who DOESN'T lose the wife just so, in the next film, he can meet the next Mission Impossible girl (i.e., Bond girl). So we have a departure from the norm, which was pretty refreshing. Not only does the audience get to see the action they're so accustomed to, they also get this bonus.But one has to wonder if Ethan's wife might meet a deadly end if another Impossible movie is made. We can only hope that they won't fall into cliché-land. Let us pray!",7,0,0,6 November 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," What's In A Name? Everything.
","When Slevin (Josh Hartnett) arrives in New York to visit an old buddy, he quickly runs into trouble. First he gets mugged. Then he arrives at Nick's house (his friend's) to find him not at home. Slevin makes himself comfortable but is soon interrupted by Lindsey (a very perky and fun Lucy Liu), Nick's neighbor. They are instantly attracted to each other and the humorous sparks fly as they verbally joust with one another. Lindsey notices his battered nose (mugged?) and Slevin tells her what a terrible day he's having, which endears him even more to her.Shortly after Lindsey leaves, two thugs arrive and mistake him for Nick. They don't believe him when he tells them his name is Slevin and drag him out of the apartment clothed only in a bath towel. They take him to 'The Boss' (Morgan Freeman) where he's told that Nick (i.e., him) owes a lot of money but can work it off by killing one man: the son of his biggest enemy, The Rabbi (Ben Kingsley).Soon after agreeing to do this, Slevin is then picked up by The Rabbi's thugs and told by him that he owes The Rabbi money, too, but can work it off by killing The Boss. Caught between the disbelief of two mob bosses about who Slevin really is, he's forced to make a decision. Or is he? At the beginning of the film we're introduced to a poor family man with a gambling problem. He bets a lot of money on a losing horse and soon he and his family are 'rubbed out'. And who killed the family? Yep. The Boss and The Rabbi before they became enemies. Bruce Willis plays Mr. Goodkat, a heartless assassin who eliminates the young boy of the losing gambler with a single bullet to the head. Or did he? Convoluted stories are often so complex that they lose cohesion and I was afraid that this might happen with LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN. Thankfully it didn't. The complexity is there and subtle, but handled with expert care by Aussie director Paul McGuigan. The flashbacks are impeccably pulled off as are the many action sequences. The fact that it all came together so nicely in the end made the entire movie watching experience effortless. Although I did try and figure out what was happening, there were so many well executed twists and turns that I was continually surprised and delighted.We always here the words 'ensemble cast' when certain films come out with a few favorite actors sprinkled here and there, but this time the title is well deserved. Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Josh Hartnett, Lucy Liu, Stanley Tucci, Danny Aiello, Kevin Chamberlin and a smattering of other notables round out this pristine cast.Comparisons between Tarantino's directorial style and Mr. McGuigan's have been made, but Paul McGuigan's methods, I think, are more subtle in tone but direct in execution (I hope that makes sense!).The other notable point in the film was location. The filming of the sets held a consistent circular theme to them, including wallpaper, stairways, and cups. This theme is well deserved, as a circle has no beginning and no end.",8,0,2,13 September 2006
3:10 to Yuma," A New Retelling of the 1957 Version
","Westerns are a tough sale to many movie buffs. They tend to be overdone, cliché, and ho-hum on action. And although 3:10 TO YUMA has a few of those strikes against it, it does stand out as a good film for a couple of reasons.First is the acting. Russell Crowe (CINDERELLA MAN) as the bad-ass Ben Wade was a great choice. He's a ruggedly good-lookin' fella with a heart of stone that melts just a tad when faced with a good man trying to raise a good family. The good man is Christian Bale (THE PRESTIGE) who plays Dan Evans, a one-legged rancher who decides to help out the local constabulary by hauling the murderous and thieving Wade to the 3:10 train destined for the Yuma federal prison. But the biggest surprise wasn't from Crowe or Bale but instead from Ben Foster (30 DAYS OF NIGHT) as the gruff and deadly Charlie Prince, lead member of Ben Wade's outlaw gang. His creepy and maligned gunslinging attitude was well-honed and goes beyond anything you've seen of bad guys in past western films. A surprisingly decent addition in the form of Peter Fonda (WILD HOGS) as a roughshod Pinkerton also adds a bit to the acting caliber throughout the movie.Secondly, although 3:10 To Yuma is basically a remake of the 1957 film by the same name (starring Glen Ford and Van Heflin), the script of this re-envisioned version weaves a new ending that goes a long way to helping it define itself as something more than just a remake. Keeping us guessing about the strengths and flaws of each of the main characters added a fresh element to what could have been a stale retelling.And finally, the action. There's plenty of old-style sequences that many will be familiar with (blowing up a tunnel by shooting a wad of dynamite in midair, a stagecoach shoot-out, etc.), but there's also some great chase-and-shoot scenes in the beginning and end of the film.I do have to mention that Hollywood has seen fit lately to remake just about anything some movie studio still holds rights to, and this trend appears to be gaining steam rather than diminishing. 3:10 To Yuma is no different in that respect, but it doesn't simply follow the same script of the 1957 version, which makes it an unusual hybrid: a film that treads over old terrain but leaves a new imprint via its ending.",8,1,3,11 January 2008
Marie Antoinette," All Pomp, No Circumstance
","After Sofia Coppola's successful films THE VIRGIN SUICIDES and LOST IN TRANSLATION, many movie-goers awaited her next masterpiece with baited breath. Taking on the life of MARIE ANTOINETTE is no small feat, too. Here is someone who's short life and reign as Queen of France ended in head-tumbling fashion, but affected France's government for years to come.It is unfortunate that a few factors ruined this film, causing it to get booed at the Cannes Film Festival and leaving it with lackluster gains at the box office. But many who were displeased with this rendition of her life have rightly showed their displeasure. I'm not going to give you a history lesson, as I'm assuming most of you know about the life and times of Marie Antoinette. But I will give you some idea what to expect if you watch the film. First, expect to enjoy the great sets and costumes. Any gal who loves to go shoe shopping will probably drool over the number of scenes involving footwear (perhaps too many) and their excellent designs. Heading from the feet upward, the dresses, wigs, fans, and head-wear are also very nicely arranged and in accordance with the times. The film was shot on-location in Versailles, so no one should be able to complain about the authenticity of the sets. But from here the production takes a serious nosedive. The screenplay is riddled with boring and absent scenes (from Louis and Marie eating many silent breakfasts, to a complete lack of what was going on outside the palace walls). The end of Marie's life is run through in slipshod fashion, as if a race were on to finish the movie on schedule. Then, of course, there's the music. Incorporating modern day music with historical elements has been done before. The one that most comes to mind is A KNIGHT'S TALE. Although not the pinnacle of film success, A Knight's Tale had some catchy tunes that went along nicely with the story. But with Marie Antoinette, the connections are distant at best. Can you imagine songs from Bow Wow Wow and The Cure infusing a renaissance-style film? If you're like me, this is a bit hard to swallow. What happens in the end is we get a movie that is all pomp and no circumstance; visually appealing on almost every level but sorely lacking a decent script that would allow the acting to shine through. I'll give Kirsten Dunst a few claps of applause for her portrayal, as she made the best out of a pretty awful screenplay, but that's about it. A bit of a snoozer, I'm afraid.",3,0,1,2 March 2007
United 93," Good Flick But Plays On Recent Emotions
","This could be the toughest review I've ever written. Being a born-and-bred American, I have a few protective sensibilities regarding my home country. When 9/11 happened, I was just as stunned, fearful, and outraged as most of my fellow countrymen, I'm sure. And watching a film related to those events only a few short years after that dreadful day, I could feel those same emotions smoldering within me. Trying to objectively rate this film based solely on its merits becomes a bit sticky, simply because that emotional scar is still so fresh. But I'll do my best.The greatest thing about UNITED 93 is that it's filmed using hand-held cameras, giving the viewer an intimate sense that they are an active party within the movie. This is most effective when we're on the plane (for reasons stated earlier) and get to witness all of the passengers' interactions with each other and the hijackers. The other excellent part is that there isn't one star that we follow, nor are there any big name actors/actresses in the film. Every person is just as important as the next. I applaud director Greengrass' script interpretation and this seldom used method of filming.Another admirable item is that the film shows us how off-guard the FAA and the military was immediately following the hijackings. As the movie moves between the FAA headquarters and the military's interactions with these public offices, we get to witness the incredible chaos that ensued and feel the frustrations as they try to figure out which planes are risks, what to do about them, who has the authority to shoot them down (if need be), and the unavailability of President Bush.The big issues with the movie will obviously be very personal. Each individual will probably feel differently about it. Mine were of manipulation. Since this is still a fresh memory in the minds of most Americans (including my own), I felt as though the film makers were trying to feed off of those memories. This isn't as horrible as it sounds, though. Some of the best films play with our feelings. The risk here, however, is what we do with them. Do we continue to fear? Or hate? Or do we learn from these experiences and move ahead? This film won't give you the answers to those questions, which is both a strength and one hell of a flaw. But it is a well put together piece of cinema.",8,1,2,26 September 2006
Deja Vu," Tony Scott Knows Action But Not Necessarily Science Fiction
","Let's make one thing perfectly clear: director Tony Scott does action. Whether it's TOP GUN or THE LAST BOY SCOUT, he knows how to keep viewers riveted to the screen. He's also worked with the best Hollywood has to offer, from Madeleine Stowe and Gary Oldman to Nicole Kidman and Denzel Washington. This last name is significant since Washington and Scott have worked together on several previously successful film ventures (CRIMSON TIDE and MAN ON FIRE), and come together again with DEJA VU.More of a science fiction action-drama, Scott dips gingerly into the genre to test its waters utilizing his own unique style. The staged explosions. The high body count. The dessication of morality through characters. It's typical Scott fodder but brandishing the SF genre adequately if somewhat disrespectfully.There's a lot to like about Deja Vu and one big hunk of burnin' dislike that might make or break it for some viewers (and we'll cover that in a moment). But first, let's look at the film's machinations...Denzel (INSIDE MAN) stars as Doug Carlin, an investigator for the ATF. He's summoned to a ferryboat explosion in Louisiana and quickly wraps-up evidence regarding its cause: terrorism. Domestic or foreign? We're not sure. But the ferry carried a bunch of navy personnel on shore leave, which brings in the FBI. Specifically, Agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer, 10TH & WOLF), who realizes the brainpower of Carlin (Denzel) and asks him to join his team of experts. Carlin agrees and Pryzwarra takes him to an elaborate mobile facility where 'monitoring' equipment takes on surreal proportions. Carlin meets up with the rest of Pryzwarra's crew, Denny (Adam Goldberg), Gunnars (Elden Henson) and Shanti (Erika Alexander), and checks out the new gadgets (involving wormhole/foldspace theory coupled with time-travel).Carlin isn't immediately let in on how the technology works, but soon surmises that they are looking at the past. Three days past, to be exact. He's also interested in finding out who killed a woman who's body was found several hours before the explosion, burned and battered like the rest of the ferryboat victims but who's time of death doesn't match up. She's a beautiful Louisiana native named Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton, IDLEWILD), and even in death, Carlin is oddly attracted to her. And when he sees her walking around in the FBI's three-days-past time-machine, he knows there's a connection between the bombing and her life.While checking out her kitchen, Carlin also finds a message on her refrigerator ('U Can Save Her'). Who wrote that and why? How can you save someone who's already dead? Racing against fate, destiny, and lateral time-lines, Carlin boldly goes where no man has gone before. And this is where the hitch comes in. When Carlin offers to risk his life to save Paula, we as the audience are supposed to believe that an entire human body can be transported through time using a machine never designed for such a thing (they send back a piece of paper and, in so doing, use so much of the local power grid that they blackout most of the South). Imagine the power required to send something as complex as a person and you see where the problem lay.There is one other thing that I have to mention that bugged the crap out of me, and that was the film's title. Deja Vu isn't really mentioned or hit upon until the closing moments, which made me wonder why they gave it its current title. And Deja Vu is more of a feeling and that didn't come through in the movie.But it was certainly entertaining. Tony Scott has another successful action film on his hands. But you might want to switch-off your overly analytical brain when it comes to the SF elements.",8,0,1,5 June 2007
In Bruges," In Hell? Or In Bruges?
","How do you make the story of a hit-man who accidentally blew a hole through a child's head funny and light? It ain't easy, but IN BRUGE does it on several levels.You definitely have to have a main character who can pull off something both dramatic and comedic. And that someone is Colin Farrell (MIAMI VICE), a killer who finds he's having trouble living with the accidental death of child who got in the way of a bullet.Then you have to have a great co-star, and he turns out to be Brendan Gleeson (KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). Gleeson has been a favorite star of mine since his American portrayal of Sheriff Keough in LAKE PLACID. His combination of dramatic chops mixed with witty line delivery made him the perfect choice for this role.You've also gotta have some sort of tryst going on, and there's actually several of those. The primary is that of Ray (Collin Farrell) and Chloë (Clémence Poésy). Their brutal honesty with each other makes for some interesting mental sparring between the two and has some of the lighter moments within this otherwise dark dramedy. The other is that between Ken (Gleeson) and pregnant Belgium hotel owner Marie (Thekla Reuten). Ken's distant manner opens up to Marie during certain film segments, and Marie's stunning good looks and prideful appearance make her a person to be reckoned with. Another mini-tryst comes thanks to a film being produced 'In Bruges' where one of its stars named Jimmy (midget Jordan Prentice) is out to have a good time with whatever women he can find (or drugs).Normally location wouldn't necessarily play that important of a role in a movie like this that is truly a character study of dark people who are also genuinely decent in many ways. But Bruges, Belgium IS important. After Ray (Farrell) accidentally kills the small boy, he and Ken (Gleeson) are told to 'get out of town and head to Bruges.' For Ken, it's like a vacation; the stunning buildings and peaceful waterways put Ken in laid-back mode. But Ray is tense, on edge, and sincerely depressed at his accidental shooting of the small boy. The two clash as soon as they reach Bruges, and their differences are mirrored in the landscape around them: swans, steeples, guns, and prostitutes.There's also a comparative study going on between a famous painting of Hell in Bruges, Belgium (that Ken and Ray check out), to that of the movie being filmed in town by Jimmy (Prentice) and that of the experience Ken and Ray find while visiting this quaint, Belgian community. I won't say more for fear of giving away too much.The final bonus for movie watchers is checking out Ralph Fiennes (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) as the overly-scrupulous death dealer Harry Waters. He's a family man with a mob-boss mentality who must head to Bruges himself in order to set things right. And once he's there things really heat up! Bullets fly. Bodies fall from tall buildings with resounding *splats!* And he finds himself the victim of his own moral code in the end. Nicely played.A warning should probably be given to those who are squeamish or don't care for the overuse of foul language. Both play out significantly in the film, but they are also integral to the characters and the life they've chosen. But you can't say I didn't warn you (the R rating is definitely deserved).What's more interesting to me now, though, is that I would LOVE to see Bruges in person. The extra features on the DVD include a boat trip through the canals of Bruges and point out incredible spots of interest. An added bonus, for sure. I just hope I don't see any cloaked midgets or men with silencers running around.",8,3,7,4 August 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Skadoosh!
","Animated films rely heavily on the appeal of the actors voicing the various characters. Get a group of them who could care less about the material and you'll get a quick-to-DVD release (see SHARK TALE). But get a bunch that really gets into it, and you can capture lightning in a bottle. It's happened before. I consider FINDING NEMO and HOODWINKED! to be the prime examples of this type of success. And KUNG FU PANDA now resides in close company with them.Whomever cast Kung Fu Panda deserves some serious recognition. All of the voice characters, without exception, were perfect for their animal type. From Dustin Hoffman's wise Shifu and Angelina Jolies rough Tigress to Jackie Chan (as Monkey), Seth Rogan (as Mantis), Lucy Liu (as Viper) and the unforgettable Jack Black as Po the Kung Fu Panda, every one of them were awesome shining lights of pure ...um ...awesomeness.The story is standard fodder: a nobody Panda (Jack Black) seems destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a shlepper of noodle dishes. But Po (the Panda) has always been infatuated with the Kung Fu masters. And when a call comes down from on-high that a new master is being chosen, Po rushes to the tower to find out who it might be (will it be Tigress? Or Viper? Or one of the others?). Surprisingly it turns out to be the rotund and out-of-shape Po.Training begins and Po is neither liked nor respected by any of the Kung Fu fighters (yes, the song is in there, too, of course). But once Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) learns how to motivate Po, the training begins in earnest.Problems arise, however, when word spreads that an enemy of the Kung Fu lands has escaped his prison and whomever the new Kung Fu Master might be will have to deal with him.The antics and battles are funny and epic. Using his blubbery size, Po often bounces his way to success, or eats his way into the audience's heart (particularly funny is when he finds a stash of cookies in a high cabinet and does a perfect split in order to reach them and gobble 'em down).It is a telling story that shows us you don't have to be some foxy 007 type in order to succeed. Using your natural abilities often times allows you all the power you'll need. And Jack Black's sloth-like nature was a perfect fit for Po and those who enjoyed Kung Fu Panda.Skadoosh!",9,0,0,22 November 2008
I'm Not There," Originality Doesn't Translate As 'Great' Cinema
","Convoluted and questioning, I'M NOT THERE is an insiders take on the life of poet/singer Bob Dylan. And what I mean by 'insiders' is that if you're not in-the-know of what Bob Dylan was like and how his life meted itself out, you'll probably be scratching your head rather than applauding (with one notable exception which we'll cover in a moment).Six separate actors (and an actress) portray Dylan as he remakes himself during times of tumult and exacerbation. The first is young black (yes, black) Woody (Marcus Carl Franklin), a train-jumping blues-boy who tries to focus on music of the past rather than the present. When he fails to make it, he must move on and reinvent himself. And the incarnations are many and bewildering (not unlike the man himself). From the pensive Jack (Christian Bale, 3:10 TO YUMA), to the brutally uncompromising Robbie (Heath Ledger, THE DARK KNIGHT), to the solemn Billy (Richard Gere, THE FLOCK), Dylan's music changed with his personae, and a barrage of his songs carry throughout the production.The big failing of I'm Not There, though, is it's pacing, it's unfocused time-line, and the inability of many watchers to understand where, how, and when we are. Although this style was also a plus in that it created an original format (like Dylan himself), it leant itself to extreme confusion. I hope some people out there aren't watching and raving about it simply because they don't want to be seen as 'musically uneducated' or 'art handicapped.' Sometimes the 'I don't understand what this was so it must be good' attitude pops up at times like these. But sometimes confusion is simply that: confusion.But there is a shining moment that stands out amidst these bizarre sequences, and that radiant star is Cate Blanchett (INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL) as the uneffeminate Jude (Dylan's drug infested wonderlust time). Blanchett's performance was striking in that one never questions her masculinity nor her Dylanesque personae. Her win at the Golden Globes (2008) for Best Supporting Actress was no surprise, nor was her nomination in the same category at the Oscars. Nor her many, many, many, many wins at film festivals across the globe.I'm giving the film a positive rating based on Blanchett's astounding performance, which blew my mind. I know. I know. I've 'got a lot of nerve.'",6,4,5,28 July 2008
Star Trek," Star Trek -- The Next Series Has Begun...
","Okay. How do you re-imagine STAR TREK, one of the largest sci-fi franchises in the world, and do it without alienating the 'trekkies' and, at the same time, not lose an audience of new watchers who may not be that familiar with it? The first thing you do is hire J.J. Abrams, the genius behind the LOST series on TV. Abrams is making a serious name for himself in Hollywood, and it took some serious c@hones to take on a project that could literally blow up in his face. Re-imagining Star Trek with an all-new cast and a new storyline was seriously risky ...but the risk has paid off big time.The thing Abrams seems to be aware of is that entertainment (be they TV or big screen) is ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. Let me say that again in case you missed it: entertainment is ALL ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. You can have action, adventure, cool CGI, but it's how the characters respond to such things that pull the audience in, and Abrams has done that with extreme care here.Undoubtedly, however, some trekkies are gonna be seriously pi$$ed about this. Much has been altered (by way of time travel ...but that's the only semi-spoiler I'll give) and the new Kirk (Chris Pine, SMOKIN' ACES), Spock (Zachary Quinto, 24), Bones (Karl Urban, LORD OF THE RINGS) and the rest are only shadows of what they once were on TV. Even so, there are plenty of inside jokes for trekkies to enjoy ('I'm a doctor not a physicist!'), including finding out if Kirk always does get 'the green chick,' Chekov's (Anton Yelchin) battle with his accent and the computer recognizing him, and Sulu's (John Cho) fighting abilities. The other thing that'll rankle true trekkies is Spock's emotional state. But let's remember that Spock is half-human, and always battled with his emotions, from the beginning of the series and even on in to The Next Generation where another Vulcan (Sarek) gives over his weakening emotional thoughts to Captain Picard so that he can finish negotiations.The great thing about this newest version is that it relaunches Star Trek when it was headed downhill. The Next Generation is dead. ENTERPRISE is ...not good. DEEP SPACE 9 has been ousted for some time. And no new films with older cast members were in the works. So, although trekkies might 'hate' what's been done to their beloved series, they won't bemoan the possibility that this newest version will bring in fresh blood to their ranks. But is that enough? No.What Abrams and the rest did was incorporate just enough of what made the classic Star Trek part of our culture (honestly, who doesn't know where the term, 'Live long and prosper' came from) while giving us an action-packed, summer popcorn movie that'll please just about anyone. And I say this with all sincerity. When I went to the theater, there were teenagers and octogenarians in the audience. In fact, a buddy I went with brought his mother and grandmother, and they both loved it! Quite an accomplishment.This one's a sure winner. And I noticed that another film is in the works for 2011. Let's hope this new series truly does live long and prosper.",10,5,14,13 May 2009
Fight Club," Don't Read Those Reviews With Spoilers. Please Don't!
","I have to admit from the beginning that I had never seen FIGHT CLUB before 2010. Yes (hangs head in shame), I'd heard all the hype and thought it to be just that: hype. Although I did notice that most of the kudos came from guys, not gals, even though the well-built Brad Pitt (INGLORIOUS BASTERDS) was liberally smeared on cover displays along with witty (and not unhandsome) Edward Norton (THE PAINTED VEIL). Hmm. So I finally took the plunge and picked up a Blu-Ray copy.Although brutal along the lines of GOODFELLAS, Fight Club is smart, funny, and exceptionally dark. It also has at its heart a (very) surprisingly good love story starring Helena Bonham Carter (SWEENEY TODD). I also think this is one of Carter's strongest roles. She is so beyond anything I'd ever seen from her that I originally had trouble believing it WAS her in the film.If you can get past some of the more gory scenes, I dare say that all viewers will be well-rewarded in the end. That's not to say you should dismiss the violence. Indeed, it is part-and-parcel to the entire components of the film and its incredibly awesome story structure.And this isn't the first time Brad Pitt and director David Fincher have worked together. In 1995 they did the excellent film SE7EN. If you enjoyed that film, you'll absolutely fall in love with this one. Fincher loves to play mind-twists but he doesn't do it in a heavy-handed way or even in a directly misguiding one (unlike M. Night Shyamalan with his groundbreaking THE SIXTH SENSE).Although the twist towards the end was enjoyable, I was an astute enough viewer to realize what was going on long before its reveal. Which didn't make the movie any less enjoyable. It was HOW the reveal was pulled off that made the film so amazing.Some of those who haven't seen the film might want a kind of blow-by-blow description ...and many reviews like that can easily be found. DON'T READ THEM! They will absolutely ruin the film for you. I have, in the past (and probably will in the future), given descriptions of films, but not here. This one needs to be experienced without foreknowledge. Kind of like a surprise punch to the face...",9,1,3,28 March 2010
Inglourious Basterds," 'Gnat-see' Hunters Versus Jew Hunter
","INGLORIOUS BASTERDS is brilliantly scripted, has two of the best acting jobs all year, and is purely Tarantino. If you've seen any of the KILL BILL series or THE GRINDHOUSE films, you'll know to expect a bit of blood and brutality. This is, however, Tarantino's first dip into alternate history, and he does a great job at it. However I do think he toned down the bloodshed a tad. Perhaps he's becoming more aware of it, or perhaps he just didn't feel the film warranted it. Whatever the reason, it balanced out nicely ...compared to his other films which tended to go overboard on the crimson.The alternate history involves three unique perspectives: Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) aka The Jew Hunter. Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt, BURN AFTER READING). And Shosanna (Melanie Laurent). All three of these perspectives are taken to extremes (no surprise, again, considering we're talking about a Tarantino movie) during WW II in which we see a persecuted Jew get her just dessert by killing Hitler in her own version of 'The Final Solution.' We get to see Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt) gather a group of ruthless 'Gnat-see' killers and carve swastikas into their foreheads. And finally we get the cream of the crop, Jew Hunter Colonel Hans Landa (Waltz) who's ability to sniff out hiding Jews have given him his title.Without Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt in their respective roles, I feel this film wouldn't have been a fraction as good as it was; probably a testament to the casting heads. But specifically to Waltz as Landa, who played the slimy Nazi brutalist only interested in saving his own skin by the end of the war. I think he deserved top billing, not Pitt (although Pitt did his usual extraordinarily great job). Waltz was so key to the entire film that he really held the reins of the story throughout its length. And his range of emotions, from anger to giddiness, was astoundingly disturbing. I loved every second he was on-screen. The fact that the Hollywood Foreign Press gave him a Golden Globe for his supporting role was most appropriate (and I noticed he's garnered praise from many other award ceremonies and, I'm hoping, the Academy Award roster will list him this year).Brad Pitt as the countryfied, American Nazi-hunter was great. But most of his notable lines are delivered whenever he's on-screen with Waltz. The ending sequence in the woods with Lt. Raines' knife and Col. Landa's ...umm ...life, are wonderfully vicious.Of course, we cannot leave out French actress Melanie Laurent as the persecuted Shosanna who is forced to watch her family slaughtered by Landa then flee to Paris and blend in with society. Only later does she learn that her new life and career sets her up perfectly to exact revenge on the Nazi party ...and its top leaders; the very top, in fact. She also is forced to fight off the advances of a German soldier whom she finds both endearing and loathsome.By the end of Inglorious Basterds, you feel like you've been on a wild ride at a theme park, until you realize you've never left your seat. It's a remarkable film that is cast exceptionally well. This one's worth owning for sure.",9,1,6,19 January 2010
Coraline," Target Audience? Who Cares!
","Watching CORALINE, I was enthralled and puzzled. 'Exactly what audience is this type of animated feature shooting for?' I asked myself. And it's not an easily answered one. On the surface, Coraline is an children's adventure story; the story of a little girl exploring her surroundings and finding a kind of Tim Burton-esquire rabbit hole leading to an alternate reality. But dig just a bit deeper and you hit a rather frightening layer closer to the truth behind what might be perceived as a kind of heaven and hell. But which is heaven and which is hell? These are the questions that linger throughout the film...Coraline's transplantation into a new home leads her to explore its surroundings. First bumping into Wybie (Robert Bailey Jr., THE HAPPENING) she learns that their new house has a history. Death has lurked not far away and looking at the landscape one quickly gets a sense of foreboding. A black cat (voiced by Keith David, CRASH) adds to this sense.Coraline's parents Mel (Teri Hatcher, THE DEAD GIRL) and Charlie (John Hodgman) don't have much time for Coraline, as they are trying to meet a literary deadline. So Coraline is left to her own devices and soon discovers a doorway to a much happier, alternate reality. Trouble is everyone there has buttons for eyes. But why? The reality is rather frightening and ghostly. So this isn't something young kids are going to enjoy nor understand. But it does have appeal. And, dare I say, it has appeal on a more intellectual level, even though much of the story can be dissected rather easily. But what parts aren't can, and will, linger in your mind for some time.This isn't WALL-E or some other cutesy Disney film. This is raw, unforgiving storytelling within a stop-motion animated feature with a clever design and nightmarish qualities. Think of it more along the lines of THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas and you'll be closer, but not quite there.The dangers to Coraline seem real, not just physically but spiritually. And when you see Coraline's Other Mother and Father on the downside of the rabbit hole, you get a knot in the pit of your stomach that tells you everything may not turn out well for our heroine or her family and friends.The voice actors all do an admirable job with special nods to Teri Hatcher as both Mel and the Other Mother. Her digression into this dangerous character were well played. And a big thumbs up to Keith David as The Cat. His voice was PERFECT and you really can't tell who's side he's on ...if any.This is something to watch and ponder. But not with the kiddies. This is a thought-provoking animated film for adults and teens.",10,1,3,31 January 2010
Two for the Money," Will Be Lost On The General Population ...Myself Among Them
","I don't think I've ever been addicted to anything (with the exception of caffeine which doesn't count, right? Right! I didn't think so!) But taking a look at something so addictive and so expensive is a bit unnerving. Two hundred billion dollars a year in sports gambling? That's 'billion.' Whoa. The problem with this, however, is that 'normal' people won't have any idea about the machinations behind such a business, and that is one of this film's biggest failings. Myself never having been a sports gambler, I simply couldn't relate to this shady business nor could I have cared.The main problem was that the focus was on the men who were on the inside, not those most affected by the bets: the little man who loses everything due to his addiction and the pressure put on them by bookies and gambling affiliates (beware in Vegas!) Two For the Money did show a touch  just a bit  of the terrible side-effects of gambling by glimpsing a man named Mohammed who ran a dry cleaning service. But it was very short.The prime focus was on Brandon Lang (Matthew McConaughey, REIGN OF FIRE, 2002) an injured football player turned sports-win-picker who's 80% successful selections make him a phenomenon. No one's ever done that and Walter Abrams' (Al Pacino, THE GODFATHER, 1972) bookie team grabs hold of Brandon and inducts him into their company. He quickly leads them to unparalleled success, money and fame but, as fickle as luck/fate can be, it just as quickly gets snatched away.Although it's interesting to get an insider's look into this little-known world, it's also (as stated earlier) of little concern to most mainstream Americans (I know of no one who has sports gambling problems but maybe that's just me).The other big failing was that the movie brought up problems related to these two men, but then summarily dropped them with no rhyme or reason. For instance, we're told early on that Walter Abrams has a heart condition, then ¾ of the way through the flick it's never mentioned again. We're also shown how upset some of the rich and famous become when they lose, and one of these wealthy men sends 'a warning' to Brandon. It happens once, and then we never hear of it again, as if they (the movie makers) just wanted to show us this side of the issue. You know what I said when I saw that: 'Who cares?' All in all a poorly done film. The script was seriously lacking (and littered with holes) and the acting was nothing special. Pacino is just Pacino. But I'm sure the ladies will love seeing McConaughey with his shirt off. Uh-boy...",3,2,4,16 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Quick! Hide The Rum!
","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back and he's in bigger trouble in Dead Man's Chest. Along with him, of course, comes Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the two would-be married lovers whose wedding is interrupted by the corrupt and unscrupulous Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), a true marketeer for the East India Trading Company.The continuing story. Jack, sashaying his way across the Caribbean, is trying to continue his infamous ability to cheat death. Problem is, though, is that he owes a life-debt to the dreaded Davy Jones (come full-on as a character and not just a small piece of sea karma by Bill Nighy). Davy Jones and his barnacled crew take the souls of those not willing to venture into the Great Unknown and apparently Jack had met Mr. Jones previously and wrangled a deal: he'd captain the Black Pearl for 13 years, and now that 13 years is up. So, in true Captain Sparrow fashion, Jack decides to cheat, steal, manipulate, and do whatever is necessary to save his skin. Even if it means finding the heart of Davy Jones (which is stowed away ...somewhere, waiting to be found). The more trouble is that Beckett wants the heart of Jones so that he can control the seas (he who controls Davy Jones' heart controls something called the Kracken, a mythological beast ...more on that in a minute) and thus be the only trading ships on the ocean. But Will Turner also needs the heart in order to save Elizabeth from the deadly clutches of Beckett who has promised to hang both Will and Elizabeth if he doesn't get it. The race is afoot! And what a race it is! As far as summertime blockbusters go, you'd have a pretty tough time finding something as entertaining as Dead Man's Chest. The action is incredible, the dialogue fun, and the special effects first-rate. Johnny Depp, as always, inhabits the role of Jack Sparrow. His mannerisms, line delivery and antics are just a sheer joy to watch. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are also fun to watch but not nearly as much as Depp (who steals every scene he's in).There are problems though (Argh!). Length is an obvious issue. At 2 and 1/2 hours, younger kids might find it a bit irritating to sit through something so long. Indeed, little youngsters should avoid the film altogether as it has some rather gruesome if not downright frightening scenes in it (gaining its full PG-13 rating by having images of eyeballs being plucked out of living and caged pirates, etc.) The other problems involve the meshing histories. A tenuous connection between Davy Jones and The Flying Dutchman can be made, of course (the true captain of the Flying Dutchman was NOT anyone named 'Davy Jones' but the myth is adequate enough to have him helm the ship). The other issue is Davy Jones' mythological undersea monster, the Kracken. The Kracken is a beast related to Greek and Norwegian mythology, not something as current as Davy Jones (who's myth started, I believe, in the early 1700s). My only other movie experience with the Kracken was in the sad, sad, sad B-movie CLASH OF THE TITANS (maybe not a true B-movie, but it sure felt that way!) I will admit, however, that Dead Man's Chest got the creature's features down more appropriately according to legend.At any rate, this is a wonderful summer film. Blockbuster? Definitely. Disney has done something amazing in their marketing, too: pulling stories from rides at their theme parks is a sure way to ensure that people come back to Disneyland and Disney World time and time again. Sheer genius.",8,1,3,12 July 2006
Hostel," Revenge Ending Needed A Different Character
","Horror films need more than just sex and slashers ...so if you're looking for something with higher level cinema, you best look elsewhere. HOSTEL is designed for the young man with an appetite for video-game style plots.The films premise is, at least, interesting. A Hostel in a Slovakian city is a jumping-off point for nightclubs, sexual encounters, drugs ...and murder. The hostel owners are secretively helping a select group of the rich and demented. These wealthy and twisted individuals pay to kill people, and an 'art house' on the outskirts of town acts as the facilitator of horrors. For those unweary travelers who happen to fall victim to the wiles of the hostel owners, ending up drugged only to reawaken in Hell on Earth is a gruesome and life-ending discovery.Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his friends Josh (Derek Richardson) and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are three college students traveling through Europe. They stop at this hostel and are quickly enraptured with a couple of young women who have an appetite for sex. Once fully involved with these women, the boys begin dropping off one by one. First Oli vanishes, the Icelandic disco-lover. Then Josh, the nice boy. And soon even Paxton finds himself strapped to a chair with an axe-wielding and chainsaw-ripping psycho standing over him.But Paxton escapes and with him he takes another Japanese girl who was also being tortured to death. Once out, Paxton loses the Japanese girl and soon spots the 'main man' responsible for this death camp. Can Paxton exact revenge on him? Or will he get caught and killed? The main problem with the film were its characters. Josh, the likable guy who seems to be the brains of the trio, is killed off in short order. Paxton, who I thought was a bit of an ass, lives on to exact revenge on the man responsible for doing in his friends. But this revenge sequence felt very flawed as I had no empathy whatsoever for Paxton. Josh, on the other hand, should've been the guy to figure out everything and avenge the death of his buddies. Even Oli would've been a better choice. He was at least fun to watch and had a great personality. Perhaps the script writers weren't sure who should live and who should die ...and I think that really showed in the revenge aspect of the film.",4,0,0,15 June 2006
Balls of Fury," Low-Brow Comedy Nets Few Laughs
","If you're a low-brow comedy fan, you'll probably love BALLS OF FURY. On par with films such as SCARY MOVIE and TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY, Balls of Fury hits the bottom end of the funny bone, but it does hit it. Just not often enough. Adding an impossible love story added to the low ranking here, too (even the poster image is aimed for low rung laughs, 'Oh look! It's a penis and testicles!') I'm not trying to be some snob who doesn't enjoy a good laugh. It's just that the film as a whole needs to be funny. But Balls of Fury has too many valleys where the laughs vanished. In its defense, however, I will say that there were a few peaks (most notably when Randy Daytona tries to escape his Japanese style imprisonment and attempts to jump through a shoji screen but quickly discovers metal bars on the other side. Ouch!) I will also give director Ben Garant (RENO 911!: Miami) credit for making a comedy out of something as inane as a ping pong evil underworld. Making fun of the serious films that have come before (THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS rapidly comes to mind where a secret world exists for hotrod enthusiasts), Balls of Fury daringly strikes out and nets a few points for originality.Surprisingly, the character who achieved the most laughs from me was not Dan Fogler (the main protagonist) but comedian George Lopez. His Al Pacino SCARFACE impersonation was the funniest moment in the film, especially considering it took place during the pivotal action sequence.Christopher Walken as Feng the main villain was okay but very forced. His feminine dress was meant solely for shock laughs and nothing more.But the biggest fault was the rapid  and impossible  relationship between the chubby, poorly groomed Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler) and the athletic and exceptionally beautiful Maggie Wong (Maggie Q). This happened in rapid, slipshod fashion with no explanation as to why Maggie would fall for such a despicable lout.For those who don't mind plot holes the size of a semi-truck, they probably won't mind this. But, for me at least, I need things to fit together, even if a bit roughly.Meant more for young teens than anyone of adult intellect, your enjoyment of Balls of Fury will depend on how you felt about recent low-brow comedy film releases.",4,2,5,3 September 2007
Superbad," Okay-Bad
","Those with a penchant for the highly crude will probably faun over SUPERBAD. Perhaps I'm becoming too much of a prude or simply don't find crude behavior for the sake of just being crude funny. I grew up during the Jeff Spicoli phase when FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH (1982) was the epitome of the upcoming culture clash between my parents' world and the emerging one that I would inhabit during my early adulthood. True, there was crude behavior in Fast Times (the 'how-to' lesson on oral sex stands out still today), but it was liberally sprinkled throughout with plenty of simple laughs.With Superbad, the F-word is used more times than in any other film I've ever seen. And it's true that some teens do talk like this, but that doesn't mean we need to hear it in every sentence just for shock value or to prove some linguistic point (whatever that might be ...maybe to set a record?) What gave this film its pull (in my book) was the plot surrounding two youths ready to graduate from high school and having to deal with their impending separation as they prepared to go to different colleges. They were Seth (Jonah Hill, KNOCKED UP) and Evan (Michael Cera). Both are hiding their feelings about the upcoming separation and deal with it by arguing and trying to buy booze for a party where two girls they like are headed. Mixed amongst them is an extreme geek named Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who has a fake I.D. with a fake name: McLovin. No first name. Just a last one ..from Hawaii. And he's an organ donor. But they have what they have and must get their alcohol quickly. They send Fogell/McLovin into a liquor store where he is promptly assaulted by a robber who cold-cocks him and steals all the cash in the till. Waiting outside are Seth and Evan who then see a cop car pull up and are freaking out. Will Fogell/McLovin go to jail for this? But the cops are waste cases themselves. Officer Slater (Bill Hader also of KNOCKED UP) and Officer Michaels (Seth Rogen, SHREK THE THIRD) take young Fogell/McLovin into their confidence and into their squad car; they agree to take him home with a few stopovers. This trio is often waylaid by their own stupidity, blazing through every red lighted intersection, breaking up barroom brawls (after which they order thirteen beers ...to go), and generally not giving a crap about serving or protecting anything but their own butts.Meanwhile Seth and Evan are trying to get some booze  any booze!  so that they can get to the graduation party and the girls that await them there. Seth battles multiple hits from automobiles and finally lands up at another party where he has to deal with being exposed as a 'man-gina' and swiping alcohol via detergent containers. Evan just wants to get to the party which sparks angry retorts from Seth.Eventually the two do make it to the correct grad party and peel off with their respective sexy gals. Seth wants so badly to lose his virginity that he drinks himself into near oblivion, while Evan discovers that having sex for the first time with a drunk girl isn't all its cracked up to be.The party is quickly wrapped up as our two unenlightened cops show up and break up the party ('We assume you all have guns and crack.') Thankfully the cursing slows down toward the middle and end of the film allowing one to actually focus on how the story unfolds rather than how it's verbalized. The hysterically funny ending is both cringe-worthy and guffaw appropriate; two boys acting like two girls ('I can say I love you!') Your enjoyment of Superbad will depend on how much you enjoy letting your mind revert back to a more primal state versus something funny because it IS funny and not designed to gross you out or shock you.",6,0,2,27 December 2007
Hot Fuzz," By The Power Of Greyskull!
","If you enjoyed SHAUN OF THE DEAD, you're going to feel an irresistible pull toward HOT FUZZ. Done in similar fashion and with familiar names, Hot Fuzz is an action flick that loves to take jabs at those cop and western films we so loved growing up with. Everything from PALE RIDER (an old Clint Eastwood film) to BAD BOYS is referenced in some fashion, and they will most likely tickle your funny bone.Instead of deadbeat zombies, though, this time we've got a sleepy little town with a deadly secret. Feeling very STEPFORD WIFE-ish, a highly successful police officer named Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is forced out of his undefeated duties as London cop-extraordinaire and into the dull and mundane town of Sandford. Partnered with the chubby and inept Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), Officer Angel learns to slow down but not before discovering a few strange things about his new town. They've won, every year for some time now, an award for being the best town in England. Not much to argue with there. But Nick Angel soon sees death lurking here and there (and when I say death, I mean scythe and all!) Townsfolk are cut down and the local constabulary simply wave them off as accidents. But to Nick these are NOT plain old mishaps.A conspiracy theory soon engulfs Nick's solo investigation and we find our lone hero riding a pale horse into town while loaded for bear (queue whistling Eastwood soundtrack here). The big question, though, is can he trust his lame partner, Danny, to back him.Battles and bloodshed fill the screen as Nick finds himself at odds with everyone in Sandford. From blowing away the clergy to drop-kicking an octogenarian in the face, Nick has his arms, legs and other appendages busy keeping himself alive as much as solving these supposed murders.There are a ton of great lines in the film, showing that writer/actor Simon Pegg has some significant screen writing abilities (one of my favorite lines was after Nick and Danny watched Bad Boys and Nick said, 'Well, I wouldn't argue that it wasn't a no holds barred, adrenaline fueled thrill ride. But there is no way you can perpetrate that amount of carnage and mayhem and not incur a considerable amount of paperwork.' And I enjoyed Danny's, 'By the power of Greyskull!' moments, too.) Making parodies of previously serious or scary films seems to be Pegg's and Frost's forte. And they do it exceptionally well. Although I think Shaun of the Dead is the gauge by which their future works will be judged, including this one, I also think they've hit upon something that isn't bathroom humorish like the SCARY MOVIE films/franchise. The dialogue and action fit together well and are meant for those who enjoy their laughter with a little more thought and quite a few in-jokes.I still hold Shaun of the Dead as a much more entertaining film, but this one rates up there well enough, too.",8,0,0,29 August 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Breaking 1963 Societal Taboos On Brokeback Mountain
","Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two down-on-their-luck cowpokes looking for a summer job as they silently meet outside a dusty ranch trailer in 1963 Wyoming. Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid), ranch boss, gives them the duty of moving a herd of sheep up to a spot called Brokeback Mountain where they'll wile away the hours protecting the flock from predators and allowing them to graze. Their lives are pretty boring and tough, each having to cook, keep an eye on the sheep, and suffer their daily routines. Until one night ...Ennis comes down from the mountain and is too drunk to go back up, so falls asleep outside Jack's tent. Ennis' shivering awakens Jack and he tells Ennis to get inside the tent before he freezes. It is here that something extraordinary and frightening happens: they have sex. It isn't the soft, touchy-feelie kind either. It's rough and earnest, as though they had hidden something deep down inside each of them that finally was allowed out for some air. But their activities don't go unnoticed ...Their boss, Joe Aguirre, catches sight of the two of them 'wrestling' and decides to pull them off the mountain. Their summer is cut short and as they part ways, Ennis and Jack are awkward and hesitant. Jack drives away and Ennis walks down the street, watching Jack's truck vanish down the road. And as this happens, Ennis suddenly become overwhelmed and crumples to the ground, acting as if a part of him has been ripped out.Jack and Ennis won't meet up for another four years, during which time they both become married, have children, and develop a semblance of societal normalcy. But when they do finally meet up, they run into each others arms and are immediately back on Brokeback Mountain.But can their relationship survive in a time when 'alternate lifestyles' were taboo? Can Ennis give as much as Jack wants (Jack continually asks Ennis to move with him to a quiet cabin spot and help with a herd of their own, but Ennis can't break away from what his family and society expects of him)?Ang Lee (HULK, 2003) delivers his best film to date. The panoramic shots of the mountains were awe-inspiring, and the period vehicles, saddles, and other props were excellent.Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance, and I must say that I was highly impressed with his excellent portrayal of a quiet cowboy in conflict with himself and the world around him.Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job, too, as the more earnest love interest, wanting more and more each time they meet up.The only issues I had with the film were its pacing and the 'love' the two feel for each other that some other reviewers have so adamantly pointed out. The pacing was very slow, like the lives of these two men, so if you're expecting a bang-bang (no pun intended) action, don't get your hopes up. But if you don't mind a very leisurely pace (I'd say it's about on par with the film SIDEWAYS, so if you didn't like that film's pace, stay away from this one), you'll probably love it to pieces.The 'love' should've been ratcheted up a notch. The scenes took on a sense of paramours meeting rather than two people truly in love.But the upside of the movie can't be denied. It touches on relationships in a way that most films can't get close to, and does so in a dramatic and thought-provoking way. And ogling at the stunning mountain backdrops added that extra bit of flavor, too.",7,4,10,1 January 2006
Terminator Salvation," Been There. Done That...
","With the exception of a few interesting action scenes, and decent acting by Christian Bale, there's not much new in TERMINATOR SALVATION. The only exception is that we're fully immersed in the post-apocalyptic world and not time-traveling into the past ... which is why it got four stars from me instead of one or two.I do love Christian Bale's acting chops. He is, to me, the complete action hero. His DARK KNIGHT performance cemented that. But you need more to make a good movie, and Terminator Salvation fails to give us a new (or even interesting) storyline. What's more alarming is that rumors are circulating that a Terminator 5 film is being considered. Oh boy. Perhaps it's time to lay this series to rest. I'm not saying that T5 will be bad, but if the track record for this series remains unchanged, then we won't be in for a highly successful sequel.If you're familiar at all with any of the other three Terminator movies, you're aware of John Connor (played here by Christian Bale), the quintessential hero against the thinking machines; machines that have brought mankind to near extinction. In T4 we stay firmly in the future, fighting the crazed machine-made mankillers (with the exception of a brief stint in the present that rapidly moves us forward) and discovering that Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington, AVATAR) – a man from the past awakened in the future – has become a weapon for the machines by being an unawares accomplice in trying to eradicate the human population. When his true identity as a machine is finally revealed, it is as much a surprise to him as to the 'humans.' With the help of a young and feisty Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin, STAR TREK), Marcus fights his way through the machines and into the safety of the humans. Here we see him battle with the knowledge of his new internal, metallic identity, and throw himself into the war. But who's side is he really on? This is 'The Big Question' that the audience is supposed to ponder but, to no one's surprise, the embittered and oft-conflicted anti-hero makes 'The Right Choice.' In addition to being a cliché, the movie even reinvents a scene from T2 in which a Terminator gets frozen and tries to break free. Been there. Done that. Let's move on people! The final word I have on this film is that it really doesn't do what it should, which is to show us a great story about characters we've come to know through cinema. But instead, we got a rehashing of old themes with a bit of action eye-candy. Not much to it, really.",4,0,1,19 January 2010
500 Days of Summer," Perhaps Autumn Will Be Better
","I'm sure most of us have heard the term 'chick-flick'. You know the one. The movie that has the girl falling for the guy, then a dilemma develops, they fall apart, only to be brought back together by serendipity {play romantic chorus here}.Well this isn't that kind of movie, thank you very much...This is something newer, something I like to call 'a romantic guy flick.' No, it's not some horny dude looking to plop his thing into any attractive gal that comes along (KNOCKED UP) or some roadtrip movie gone awry (THE HANGOVER). This is a story of unrequited love ...from the man's side. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (THE LOOKOUT) stars as Tom, a guy wanting nothing more than to fall in love with the girl of his dreams. And he believes he's found her in Summer (Zooey Deschanel, THE HAPPENING). Trouble is Summer only wants to be 'friends with benefits.' She tells Tom this from the get-go, but Tom's having none of it. He believes he can turn her toward him and onto a path of blissfulness.The film juxtaposes their 500 days together in a unique pattern: by traversing the days in a haphazard fashion, jumping from day 490 to day 39, then on to day 65 and back to day 1. This is representational of Tom's need to find out what went wrong with their relationship, as Summer breaks it off and devastates Tom. Or did anything go wrong? Perhaps Tom simply wasn't listening ...or being unrealistic in his expectations of Summer.Whatever the reason, many lonely guys out there will probably be able to identify with 'that girl that broke my heart' syndrome that Tom goes through. This is what makes (500) DAYS OF SUMMER the guy flick I referred to earlier. It is frustrating, funny, and downright depressing. Doubly so when we see Summer hold hands with Tom even after there is no hope for them, further confounding Tom's sense of right and ...love.Even though there's a depressing air to the entire film, it does have its lighter moments thanks to two of Tom's buddies who are absolutely clueless about relationships yet offer their ridiculously bad advice to him. Tom's kid sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz) plays the sounding board and only person who seems to have a grip on what Tom really needs, which is a funny byline since she's basically a 12-year-old with the maturity level of a 20-something.The movie might have ended on a very sour note, further depressing anyone watching. But, in the end, we're given a small ray of sunshine that drifts away from Summer and helps lift Tom into a new season. Perhaps Autumn will be better...",8,0,0,23 January 2010
Juno," It's All In The Dialogue
","Imagine having a baby when you're sixteen. Can't? Neither could Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page, HARD CANDY), a sassy and intelligent young girl who finds herself having to deal with this very issue in the highly acclaimed film JUNO.Once the rabbit dies, Juno is forced to come to terms with what she must do. Telling and not telling various people becomes a challenge, as does deciding whether or not to terminate the pregnancy. Once she decides against abortion (after a hysterical scene in the clinic where tapping fingernails play an annoying part), Juno decides to tell those closest to her. This includes the would-be father Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera, SUPERBAD), a geekish track and field teen who's shocked to learn that his first time sexual encounter has also resulted in first time potential fatherhood, and her father Mac (J.K. Simmons, THE ASTRONAUT FARMER) and stepmother Bren (Allison Janney, HAIRSPRAY). Paulie seems equal parts embarrassed and elated (his seed has taken hold), while Juno's parents are dismayed, disappointed, but eventually supportive ...especially after they learn that she's decided to give up the baby to a couple that can't have kids (whom she finds advertising in the PennySaver).The unborn's future parents are the Lorings, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner, THE KINGDOM) and Mark (Jason Bateman, SMOKIN' ACES). Vanessa is agog with the anticipation of motherhood, while her husband, Mark, is more pensive, unsure if he's ready to take the dive into daddydom.The mixture of characters works well for the film with the only exception being that it was tough to swallow someone of J.K. Simmons' and Allison Janney's age being parents to a sixteen year old; they're a bit too old for those roles. Even so, the dialogue is stupendous, often making one forget that visual distraction and making them strain to catch every last nuanced syllable. And there are plenty.Although there aren't many teens out there with the intellect that Juno possesses, that's exactly what makes this film so watchable. It touches on an unfortunately ordinary premise (teen pregnancy) but pulls it up to a whole new level by allowing us to see it through the eyes of someone (Juno) battling with self-recognition during an age-crucial time.If there was ever any doubt that Ellen Page is one of the finest young actresses working in film today, Juno should put further arguments to rest. It is her razor-sharp line delivery that makes this film what it is: a character study of unusually funny proportions.",9,2,8,5 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Length Aside, It's Still A Great Action-Adventure Film
","Placing your brain on cruise control can be fun whenever you watch a film. Thinking takes a backseat to blatant entertainment while you let your worldly cares dwindle away, immersing yourself in a time and place you know never really existed (except in this case, they do, at the Disneyland Parks).THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN series are really the only successful films based on one of Disney's rides. The appallingly bad HAUNTED MANSION shouldn't even be considered here, so I won't mention it again for fear of some poor reader losing their lunch.For those who've seen the previous two installment in The Pirates Franchise, this one's just as fun if a tad overly plot heavy and exceedingly long (bring your hemorrhoid donut). Clocking it at a whopping 2 hours and 48 minutes it is the longest of the three Pirate films and the lengthiest film this summer. I'm not one to complain about film length, simply because if the movie holds together well I'll sit through it regardless of gluteal discomfort. But this time the complaints about length are justified simply because the many plot lines introduced don't add anything to the film.This time we find Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY) in a true bind. He's dead. 'Living' out his own personal hell within Davey Jones' locker, Jack battles multiple incantations of himself, often killing off these nuisances (Freud would have a field day with this one).Meanwhile, back in the land of the living, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, HAVEN) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, STAR WARS EPISODE ONE) need to get Jack back to the land of the living so that they can convene a gathering of pirate lords who will help fight off the dastardly East India Company that threatens to plunge every last pirate ship to the bottom of the sea. And Jack is one of the pirate lords.Barbossa and his crew sail their ship 'to the end of the world' and find Jack. They bring him back to the living world (to the dismay of Davey Jones) and proceed with the gathering of pirate lords. The choice is made to fight the East India Company after some heated debate and a surprising election. This is also where we get to meet Captain Teague (Keith Richards), the keeper of the Pirate Code. Richard's is spot-on perfect for this role and has some hysterically funny dialogue with Depp.There's a lot more going on, too. Will turner is determined to free his father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard, BEOWULF & GRENDEL), from the clutches of Davey Jones' boat. Elizabeth simply wants to get Jack because ...well ...I'm not sure why. It seems she's a bit confused as to her love-life, too. Will she choose Will Turner, Jack, or someone else? Barbossa simply wants to keep The Black Pearl to himself and will do almost anything to insure it. Calypso turns out to be someone we've known for some time and it is her revealing that takes up most of the useless time added to the length of the film. A 'relationship' between Calypso and Davey Jones (Bill Nighy, SHAUN OF THE DEAD) is hinted at but then summarily dropped Â— and rightfully so.There's also the nonexistent demise of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce, BROTHERS OF THE HEAD) which, although seen through the eyes of his daughter, Elizabeth (Knightley), feels completely lost amidst the substantial length of the film (I believe this entire bit took up about 60 seconds of film time).Now that I've completely thrashed Pirates 3, you might be wondering about my positive rating. Well, the Pirate Films were never meant to be taken too seriously. They are conspicuous action entertainment and, on that level, this newest movie succeeds quite well. Never a yawn shall escape your maw while watching this, I'd wager. The ship battles. The sword fights. The storms. The ship battles while there are sword fights going on within a storm. It's just fun to watch. And Johnny Depp is his usually wonderful self as the swashbuckling and sashaying Captain Sparrow.",8,5,8,5 June 2007
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man's Not A Woosie!
","Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN films are something of legend amongst the comic-book-to-film fans. The first two were excellent and helped, perhaps, pull more people toward the comic book world. Number 2, in particular, was astonishingly good in that we got to see how much Spidey had to give up in order to be the man he had to be. And with the mondo-budget given to this third film (something like $250 million, I believe, which was only recently eclipsed by the $300 million PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END), one would suspect that it would hold onto its previous successes by following a somewhat similar format.But no...Although loaded with action and some top-notch special effects, the film is overloaded with too many characters and some unwontedly bad scenes that were in need of excision.This time Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire, THE GOOD German) is up against not one, not two, not three, but four evil forces. Although this sounds enticing, there's no way (NO WAY!) anything approaching cohesion could happen for this 139 minute film: an evil, outerspace symbiote that attaches itself to Spidey's suit; Green Goblin Jr./Harry Osborn, played by the returning James Franco (TRISTAN & ISOLDE); Sandman/Flint Marko played by Thomas Haden Church (CHARLOTTE'S WEB); and, eventually, Venom/Eddie Brock, played by Topher Grace.I'm not sure what Mr. Raimi was thinking, but more is not necessarily 'more,' if you catch my meaning. Audiences don't need impossible odds to enjoy a hero's journey into darkness and back; we just need a good story that holds together.Oh, and we definitely don't need a woosie Spider-Man crying in every other scene. The guy's a superhero, make him act like one for crying out loud! It's still nice to see the beautiful Kirsten Dunst (ELIZABETHTOWN) in her role as Mary Jane the love interest. She can act well and she's believable in every scene, it just that she gets lost amongst the overly crowded cast, too, just like the Sandman and Venom do.Too many questions about what's happening plague the middle of the film but are wrapped up in slipshod fashion at the very rushed ending.It isn't all bad, though. The scenes with Spider-Man and Sandman together are shot well, with the special effects taking center-stage more than the story or the actors themselves. The death of a pivotal character is handled well but, again, the tears are overdone and make Spidey look wimpish.Perhaps the next Spider-Man film will help put this one behind us as 'the bad one.' We can all hope that Mr. Raimi gets back to doing character shots that help strengthen our superhero rather than making him appear like a crybaby.",5,0,1,8 November 2007
Match Point," You're Headed In The Right Direction, Mr. Allen
","Some reviewers and movie-goers have been stunned by the transformation of Woody Allen as a director because of this film, and there's no doubt that this is a step in the right direction. His horrible, horrible, horrible film THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION completely turned me off (not to mention some of his less-than-appropriate personal behavior but that's another story). Woody had trouble seeing himself as an older guy in many of his more recent releases and seriously miscast himself in roles that were never intended for a short, balding, and aging man.Thankfully, here in MATCH POINT, Woody's balding pate never makes an appearance. He's planted firmly behind the camera as director, and this is a very good thing (but not a great one).I will give Woody Allen credit; he's gone off his previously overly beaten path and is branching out into realms unknown to him. Match Point is a case in point (no pun intended). Here we have a young tennis pro stud named Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who comes to London from Ireland in pursuit of a better life. He meets up with a nice, wealthy young man named Tom and is quickly introduced to his sister Chloe (Emily Mortimer). A relationship starts to build but not before Chris runs into Tom's fiancé, Nola (Scarlett Johansson), a blond bombshell who's ready to ignite anything near her. Chris marries Chloe but not before having 'an encounter' with Nola, setting the stage for a relationship nightmare in the future. Tom breaks up with Nola, thus allowing Chris more access to her, but when pregnancies, family fortunes, and the future of everything Chris has been working for comes to a head, he has to make a choice; a terrible and wrong but lucky choice.I don't want to give too much away here in case some of you decide to watch the flick. If you've seen it already, let me say that I don't agree with Chris' choice (obviously) but one can see why a man (or woman) could be driven to do such a horrendous thing.I'm gauging this film based on other movies, not just other Woody Allen movies  thus my 'thumbs down' rating. Although this is a giant leap in the right direction for Mr. Allen, it still held a narcoleptic pace. The acting was okay, nothing extraordinary, but nothing to jump up and down about either. The sets eh. Nothing great there either. The dialogue was okay but sometimes felt forced and speedy. When Chris first meets Nola over a ping-pong table, their actions and emotions feel rushed.Match Point has been compared, in theme, to Hitchcock. I beg to differ. Woody isn't that good, but perhaps with a little time he'll get there.",4,1,4,12 May 2006
Resident Evil: Extinction," Milla Kicks Some Ass!
","Call me old fashion, but I just love to see a good looking gal with sharp weapons beheading zombies. The gal is none other than Russian-born supermodel turned action star Milla Jovovich (ULTRAVIOLET). Most will probably remember her from the sci-fi comedy hit, THE FIFTH ELEMENT where she played Leeloo (aka The Fifth Element). The movie was an astounding success and helped launch her into more mainstream films and out of her B-movie dregs.Milla was also picked up by the Resident Evil franchise in 2002 (films based on the computer game), and she seems to have found her footing in these betwixt-type slasher/zombie movies.Reprising her role as Alice, a genetically enhanced human-machine, Milla kicks some serious ass. She is reunited with love interest Carlos (Oded Fehr, THE MUMMY series) and her wayward band of zombie dodging wanderers while trying to keep a low profile from the genetic seekers that live in an underground complex in desertville. These scientists are trying to find a way to combat the increasing zombie threat. Problem is, though, is that a power hungry mad scientist named Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris, LADY IN THE WATER) is developing a serum to help cure or tame the zombies' insatiable hunger for human flesh. But the serum goes awry and Dr. Ashford becomes something of a monster himself.Meanwhile, Alice and her buds are fighting off zombified crows and left-over gamblers in Viva Las Vegas, all while the mad scientists bear down on her.The movie is what it is: a zombie flick that goes overboard when it comes to the creation of a new creature. But the zombies are realistic looking, and Milla looks (and acts) great as the reluctant desert hero, trying to find out who she is and where life is taking her. You don't have to do a lot of thinking during the entire film; it's all laid out for you in wonderful slash-o-vision.It would've been nice, though, if the screenplay hadn't incorporated this new creature I mention. That went so beyond anything that it truly spoiled much that had come before.Still, RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION is a fun film to watch. And a must for Milla fans.",6,2,3,13 March 2008
The Prestige," Revenge To The End
","If one had to pare down THE PRESTIGE to two words, they would undoubtedly be 'dark' and 'twisted.' Coming from director Christopher Nolan, who gave us the BATMAN BEGINS gem, this shouldn't surprise anyone. Nolan is also responsible for the successful somewhat underground-ish film, MEMENTO, another flick that fits perfectly within those two pared-down words.Similar in style to THE ILLUSIONIST, but with much more substance, The Prestige has a unique flow and some surprisingly good acting from previously unknown places.Like Memento, the story jumps around time-wise, going from present tense, to past, then even further past before heading back to present tense (excuse the use of literary style rather than film, as this seems to also apply here), director Nolan has given us a study in revenge based on the lives of two fictitious magicians in the late 1800s. They are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman, THE FOUNTAIN), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, BATMAN BEGINS). Initially friends who's relationship is shattered by the death of Robert's wife after a terrible on-stage accident, the two become mortal enemies in a one-upmanship that leads to bad ends for both men.The two opponents are willing to do whatever it takes in order to be the best magicians in the world. This often entails 'getting one's hands dirty.' Severing body parts, breaking one another's bones, and using anything and anyone to further their goals is a necessary evil.Double, triple, and quadruple-crosses await the viewer in this stark but beautifully filmed movie. The sets are awe-inspiring (in their own dark way) and each shot given plenty of thought with regards to shadow and contrasts.The big winners for the film, though, are the script and a surprisingly excellent performance by David Bowie as the genius (and real life) inventor Nikola Tesla. Melding fiction with nonfiction was a nice touch and added to the overall concept of the film.Many may be able to figure out 'the big secret' long before it's revealed (this reviewer was able to deduce it rather easily), but this won't take away from the enjoyment of the film going experience. The great acting, moody sets, and applaudable screenplay will keep most viewers enthralled regardless.",9,2,3,22 February 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Needed More Than Just Great Visuals...
","Before I start I need to explain something about why I rated this film the way I did. First let me say that I'm a pretty big fan of both Guillermo del Toro and the original HELLBOY film. Ron Perlman was perfectly cast in the title role and I wouldn't wish that changed for the world. The first film (also directed by del Toro) had a pretty cool story about the beginnings of Hellboy and the organization he would eventually belong to. Let me say that again, the STORY was cool. That's important, because when you get right down to it, films must have that to carry them through to audiences.A friend of mine said that if I loved PAN'S LABYRINTH that I'd love this film. Well, he was wrong. I did love Pan's Labyrinth. A lot. In fact, it was probably the best film of 2006. It won BAFTA awards and three Oscars and a gaggle of others, so the critics seemed to agree with me on that point. But Hellboy II didn't fair so well. Sure, it got one nod from the Academy (for make-up, though), but little else; not that I'd expect a comic book-to-film story to garner much critical acclaim amongst the snobby elite of Hollywood-dom. But here's the thing: It could have! Take a look at things like IRON MAN and THE DARK KNIGHT and you'll see what I mean (sometimes the snobs are forced to take note of these otherwise overlooked gems whenever they're done with extreme care ...and I mean E-X-T-R-E-M-E!). So what was the problem? you may be asking. First let's look at what wasn't the problem.Guillermo MUST be recognized as a visual artist. The sets and camera shots and costumes were very much on-par with what I expect from him (i.e., Pan's Labyrinth quality). The troll's market scenes were worth the price of admission alone! Stunningly dark, dreary but equally enthralling and uniquely beautiful. The Elfin lands and flashbacks were also well-done giving us a bit of history about the war between humans and elves.But we need more than history and battles to make a great film. We need originality, and this is where the film fell short for me. Looking more like a side-story for THE LORD OF THE RINGS, the history of elves and men have been done ad nauseam (in both literature and film). Although del Toro tried to put a unique spin on the story by incorporating the elves as split between being nice to humans and wanting them all dead, the story really never found traction for me. This was due, in great part, by the incorporation of two love stories. One we're already aware of between Perlman's Hellboy and the firebranding Liz (Selma Blair), and the other comes as a bit of a surprise (and ends up nowhere, really). To me, del Toro could've easily excised this second love story and extended the history behind Hellboy and/or extended our understanding of why the division between the human-hating elves and the human-loving ones was so wide (I understand some of this was due to the twin elves' father, but much of it is not). We're supposed to assume (or so I assume!) that one of the elves is just flat-out evil for the sake of being evil. Not good storytelling.So there you have it. I liked the film as a diversion, but I wasn't at all captivated as I was with the first Hellboy. Story, story, story. It's so important. I hope that with the next Hellboy flick (and I really hope there is another because I WILL watch it) that del Toro directs again and can give us a fresh story with the amazing visuals we've come to appreciate from him.",6,0,1,1 February 2009
Cloverfield," Godzilla Meets The Blair Witch Project? Sorta...
","It's always nice to see someone in Hollywood take chances and move outside normal filming practices. Although CLOVERFIELD isn't wholly original, it does have an original feel thanks to the incredibly myopic look the audience gets via its length through one camera lens.Labeled as GODZILLA meets THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, Cloverfield definitely incorporates portions of both but comes out the other end as its own animal.The myopic view was seen, as stated earlier, in The Blair Witch Project, which had a hand-held camera being buoyed around by an amateur film maker, allowing the viewer to get up-close and personal with the story. With Cloverfield, we get the same experience but with a bit more high-tech status along the way. New York skyscrapers crumble and explode. The head of lady liberty comes hurtling down the street. The Brooklyn Bridge gets twisted and ripped apart like tissue paper. And the 'monster' causing all this ...well ...you'll have to see that for yourself. I will say, however, that it was nice to only get glimpses of the creature and its 'offspring' since that is the way it would truly happen if viewed through one person's eyes.Which brings us to the Godzilla aspects of the film. Japan has that monster, and J.J. Abrams (LOST) gives us a new American one here. Unique is size, shape, and color, this new beast is just as tough to kill as Godzilla and has many smaller monsters (about the size of a regular dog) that it sheds like lice. And you don't want to get bitten by one of these lice; trust me! The more unique and intriguing thing about this new creature is that we know nothing about it since the story is all coming from one herky-jerky camera lens. Alien? Radioactive giant? Government experiment gone wrong? Who knows. This added to the realism of the story.Although I understand the need for character development, I felt that the opening 20 minutes dragged on a bit too long. The love story between Jason (Mike Vogel, RUMOR HAS IT) and Beth (Odette Yustman, TRANSFORMERS) added to the story in the end but was overly forced upon us in the beginning ('We get it! They're in love already!') Two other notable items must be mentioned. The first is the realism of the camera movements and the klutzy guy who carries it named Hudd (comedian T.J. Miller). Although why he continued to carry it sometimes bordered on ludicrous, his dopey demeanor helped make this easier to swallow. The second item is the sound quality. Absolutely amazing! The thumps, bumps, and explosions were an awesome thing to hear, and the dolby digital sound quality really shone through.Certainly something to watch on a big screen TV with a great sound system. This one is sure to please monster movie afficionados.",8,2,4,1 May 2008
Once," A Sucky Hoover Vacuum Repairman Follows His Musical Dreams
","With multiple film festival award wins (and a recent Oscar nod) and produced on a shoestring budget (in just 17 days), ONCE is an independent movie marvel. But this isn't what should draw you to it. The draw should be its quirky humor, its incredible music (nearly 2/3 of the film is entirely music), and its intimate portrayal of two people making music while forming a strong bond of friendship.The main actor and actress aren't even given names; there's no reason to as this Guy (played by guitarist extraordinaire Glen Hansard) and Girl (pianist Marketa Irglova) could be anyone off the street. Anyone with an incredible gift for music, that is. Both Guy and Girl work differing jobs than their hearts desire, Guy as a Hoover vacuum cleaner repairman and Girl as a house cleaner. But both have aspirations toward music, Guy more than Girl ...initially. Guy, on his off-time from the Hoover shop, panhandles on a street corner, belting out known songs during the day and his own at night (when no one's around). Girl discovers him and asks him why he doesn't play his own music during the day, and thus starts a series of events that speed this short film to a satisfying conclusion. I say 'speed' in the sense of how short and sweet the film is, not because it is an action or speedy-type film in any way, shape, or form. In fact, if you were going to ding the film for anything, it would be its pacing. Sometimes achingly slow, the story nearly stalls at several points, but thankfully never falters completely.The music is what makes Once what it is, and rightfully so. This is a story about musical wishes and dreams, and how those dreams should never be let go of no matter what the circumstances. Sometimes it takes a wallop upside the head to get you back to your dreams, and Girl is exactly the smack Guy needed in order to accomplish his. Her enjoyment of his songs and her persistent requests to hear more and more from him drive Guy to higher and higher levels. Although much of Guys' songs are based around a former relationship gone sour, it is Girl that opens his eyes to the fact that he still loves his girlfriend and his music ...and this awakening is all thanks to a platonic relationship with a stunningly pretty Czech (Girl).Although Girl gives Guy what he needs, he too gives her something in return. Both come to understand how important their friendship is and what it will eventually mean to them, even should their dreams fail. Chasing after them no matter what the cost becomes all too evident as the film winds to a close.You can't comment on Once without noting its camera work, too. It is very amateurish, almost as if someone were filming an episode of Wayne's World (in Wayne's basement). But it is the amateurish nature that binds the audience to the characters. You feel like you are the camera, peeking at these peoples' intimate lives from behind this corner or through that window.And the music; it's impressive in the extreme, so much so it got nominated for Best Achievement in Music via the Oscars this year (2008), something of a shock for such a low budget film (much smaller than any previous nominee). Glen Hansard has 'the voice' and his co-actress, Marketa Iglova, is no slouch either. Both are musical talents that can make you laugh one minute and nearly bring you to tears the next. And since over 60% of the film is music, that's a very good thing. In fact, for Once, it's the only thing.",8,3,6,8 February 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," The Brutal Beauty Of It All
","Prepare to be immersed in PAN'S LABYRINTH, the excellent adult fantasy film by Guillermo del Torro. Note the words 'adult' here, because this is not something parents should take their little ones to see. Although stunningly beautiful in presentation, it holds back absolutely nothing when focusing on the barbarism of mankind. This includes gunshot wounds to the face, the sawing off of infected limbs, or the torturing of one's enemies.Set against the backdrop of 1944 Spain, Generalissimo Francisco Franco has his forces set to squash any rebels prepared to inflame Spain into civil war. Into the woodland areas of Spain's countryside is sent Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), a commander so selfish and heartless as to kill anyone or anything that gets in his way. This is immediately noticeable when his unhealthy and pregnant wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil) is sent to live with him at this distant wooded post. Vidal cares not that she's ill and shouldn't be traveling in the late stages of pregnancy, but only wants his son born where his father can see him. With Carmen comes her preteen daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), the daughter from a previous marriage in which the father died at war.The unabashed horrors of war are close to Ofelia and her mother's new war post home. Ofelia, feeling helpless and frightened, goes off into the woods and discovers strange runes and eventually an old stone labyrinth of indeterminate age. Soon a faun appears and discloses some interesting information to Ofelia: she is the princess of a lost underworld, a world of immortals where her father-king awaits her return. But in order to find her way back to this wonderland, she must accomplish three tasks in short order.But as the battle with the independent fighters draws near to the human world, the tasks set for her in the magical become nearly insurmountable ...and more dangerous.The question as to if Ofelia is truly a princess or not is completely left up to the viewer to decide. Whether all of the fantastical elements in the film were solely a part of Ofelia's imagination  and a way to get away from the horrors of the war  or were real are never given over to the audience. A definite high point for the movie.Pulling from Greek mythology, the faun (played by Doug Jones) is Pan, a half-goat, half-human, better known as a caretaker of woods and shepherds, and also a bit of a trickster. When we first meet Pan we're told that fauns 'aren't to be trusted.' Usually a wise thing when dealing with the unknown. Added to this problem is the dark nature in which we find Pan. He's in a tomb-like structure, full of shadows and decay. It's also noteworthy to mention that Doug Jones plays a double-role in the movie, as both Pan and Pale Man, a freakishly dangerous creature with eyes in its hands.Spinning the audience between the brutality of war and the beautifully surreal world Ofelia explores, the merging of the two comes to a close in a most satisfying way. But it's an adult way, not a fairytale one. Pan's Labyrinth isn't designed to be a feel-good flick. It's a historical recounting of the Spanish Civil War and what one young girl's reaction to it might've been.The film is a foreign language flick (Spanish) and subtitled, forcing those of us who aren't Spanish speakers to pull our eyes away from the sumptuous sets and down to the bottom of the screen; a necessity but still bothersome considering the extreme high quality of the sets.Young Ivana Baquero as Ofelia deserves all the award nods she's sure to get. Her performance was truly outstanding, making movie watchers cringe whenever she's in danger and applaud when she succeeds with one of her tasks. Her tough choices are felt more than seen, making us care about her all the more as she wanders into unfamiliar and potentially dangerous terrain. That she has to make tough decisions for such a little girl will cause many-a-viewer to reach for the Kleenex box.Because of these terrible decisions forced upon Ofelia, the audience is left to ponder one important thought: Caught between the stark beauty of a (possible) magical world and the brutality of human warmongering, which would you choose?",10,3,7,21 January 2007
Knocked Up," Unrealistic But Damn Funny
","KNOCKED UP has some of the funniest dialog and delivery you've probably ever seen in the past year. Although the plot is a bit contrived and unrealistic (the stoner dude with no ties would probably tuck tail and run when he found out about the pregnancy!), the acting is quite good with a cast that reflects the moral ambiguity of our times.This is the story of a one-night-stand that never should have happened. The girl, Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is sexy, funny, and successful. The boy, Ben Stone (Seth Rogen, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN) is a pot-smoking and frumpy loser with nearly pornographic ambitions.The two unawares meet up at a hoppin' club and bump into one another at the bar. Alison has already had too much to drink and Ben is also well on his way. The two dance, chat, and eventually end up in bed, much to the chagrin of Alison come coyote morning. The two happily separate from one another and both think that is that. But a few weeks later, Alison's morning sickness kicks in. She and her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann, BOTTLE ROCKET) rush to the drug store and buy up every brand of pregnancy test they can find and, yep, that little red line shows up every time.Alison and Ben are thrust back together in the name of impending parenthood. Alison quickly decides that abortion is out of the question; she wants a kid and is already getting 'older.' Forced to either accept the pregnancy or leave Alison and her unborn child to circumstances, Ben tries to form a bond with Alison, only to have multiple obstacles thrown in his path. First is his lifestyle. He lives with a bunch of stoners who's only wish is to create a website that focuses on female nudity. Ben's father (Harold Ramis, THE ICE HARVEST, director) can't give much fatherly advice since he's a washed-up stoner, too. And Alison's sister Debbie doesn't really want him around.Alison and Ben's on-again off-again relationship seems doomed. The two have nothing in common except the pregnancy and the audience is left (for a while) to wonder if Alison wouldn't be better off raising her child away from Ben anyway.Eventually the fateful delivery day looms and Ben has set himself onto the path of fatherhood, moving himself away from his pot-smokin' days and buddies. Although Alison has shunned him, the two are forced back together again once Alison's labor begins and she has no way to get to the hospital. Rushing her through traffic, Ben gets her to the delivery suite and Alison and he are eventually united via the bonds of babydom.The funniest parts of the film are surprisingly not between Heigl and Rogen, but instead between Rogen and Paul Rudd (NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM), who plays Pete, Debbie's husband and Alison's brother-in-law, as they head to Vegas on a roadtrip after Debbie boots him out of the house and he finds solace with Ben. Their 'shroom experience is absolutely fantastic and will probably have you wetting yourself ('There are five different kinds of chairs in this room.') This is, without a doubt, director Judd Apatow's best film to date; it's even above THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and ANCHORMAN. But it is unrealistic. People as varied as Ben and Alison DO NOT get together. And even if they initially did, they certainly wouldn't stay so. That said, I will say that it was refreshing to not see two hunky actors in the prime roles. Although Katherine Heigl is a damn fine looking lady, there are other actresses that certainly look better. And Seth Rogen appears as a sloth, which was an interesting dichotomy within the sexual portions of the film.",8,1,2,15 November 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A Little Comedy Helps The Medicine Go Down
","Moving a musical from Broadway to the silver screen is not a simple thing. The abhorrent musical RENT is a prime example. Although Rent had its place on stage, it suffered with its transition to film due to a shoddy script and even shoddier sets and acting. And although SWEENEY TODD has a similar history, it holds up much better. The first successful element of Sweeney Todd is that it has some really fine actors attached to it, as well as director Tim Burton (CORPSE BRIDE), the master of dark themes. Not surprising to any, Mr. Burton has brought along Johnny Depp (CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY) whom Mr. Burton has apparently set up as his muse. Since 1990, the two have been practically inseparable, and this has turned out to be advantageous to movie audiences. They work very well together and know each others ins-and-outs. Sweeney Todd also benefited from the dastardly work of Alan Rickman (HARRY POTTER) as the devilishly evil Judge Turpin. Rickman has been a favorite of mine since 1988 when he starred alongside Bruce Willis in the first DIE HARD film. Another surprising bonus was that of Timothy Spall (ENCHANTED) who plays Beadle, the twisted sidekick to Judge Turpin. Although Mr. Spall can't sing very well, he did act the part of Beadle with exceptional creepiness. Then we come to Mr. Burton's other muse, his wife, Helena Bonham Carter (WALLACE & GROMIT) who plays the female lead of Ms. Lovett. Mrs. Carter is to be commended for her singing abilities, and she apparently took this film very seriously, going so far as to take a barrage of singing and voice lessons in preparation. The sad part about her role is that I found her singing better than her acting. I could easily have seen someone with more acting and singing abilities in her role (for instance Renee Zellweger). But I must give credit where it is due, and I found her acting portions acceptable if a bit flat.The second success is obvious: the music. Stephen Sondheim's score really reached down and pulled this film up a notch. I particularly enjoyed the music and lyrics during the song 'A Little Priest' in which Sweeney Todd (Depp) and Mrs. Lovett (Carter) look out over the London streets and sing about what certain businessmen or people taste like. I found this to be a good section of the film because it incorporated solid acting, a great song, and some darn funny lines/chorus', something not easily achieved in cinema nowadays. The third success is both a positive and a possible negative: the bloodshed. Similar to a Frank Miller graphic, Sweeney Todd is shown in a black-and-white, sepia-toned fashion while the blood of Sweeney's victims is given the royal red treatment (and there's plenty a-gushin' on-screen, too). Although this adds a flare of color to an otherwise dingy look, it also went a bit over-the-top on several occasions. I have to note here, too, the sickening 'thud' sound that the bodies make when they are disposed of down Sweeney Toddy's chute and onto the hard cobbles below. This might turn many viewers off so just beware.As mentioned earlier, Mr. Burton is well-known for his dark themes, and I dare say that this is probably the darkest of them all. But the infusion of some much needed comedy helps this one go down a tad easier. Kind of like eating one of Mrs. Lovett's pies and then drinking a nice ale after.Bon appétit!",8,0,1,27 May 2008
Nacho Libre," The Lord's Luchador
","Microphone {tap, tap, tap}: Ladies and gentlemen! For your wrestling entertainment, I introduce to you the Lord's Luchador, the Mauling Monk, the Orphanator! Put your hands together for Naaaacho Liiiibbbbre! Jack Black (KING KONG) returns as another obsessive character in Jared Hess' latest cinematic offering, NACHO LIBRE. Most will remember Hess for his stunning direction of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. Here he gets a bit more money for production and gives us a hilarious tale of a Mexican monk who's early dreams of becoming a luchador (wrestler) come to fruition later in life.Jack Black plays Nacho, a cook at an orphanage/monastery where his talents as a chef come into question daily. But the one thing Nacho yearns for is to become a professional wrestler. His contact sports passions are reignited by the arrival of a beautiful nun named Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera (LADIES NIGHT), and by a wily thief named Esqueleto (SUPERVIVENCIA), a streetwise thug with bizarre moves. Esqueleto and Nacho team up and eventual take to the ring, only to be beaten time and again, but still making money. But making money isn't enough for Nacho ('I want to win!'). Vanity gets the better of Nacho and he tries everything to achieve his goal of becoming a winner, including finding a shaman who gives him sketchy advice regarding eagle eggs.Finally Nacho learns that winning comes from within and uses his 'inner' strength to make his way to the top.Silliness occasionally racks Nacho Libre, but it is saved by Jack Black's incredible physical comedy. Not since SCHOOL OF ROCK has he been so well cast. The training scenes alone are worth the price of the rental (Cow dung to the face? A wasps nest to the head? Shooting Esqueleto with a blunted arrow?) When Nacho tries to court Sister Encarnacion, the comedy is further ratcheted up as Jack Black uses his butt-muscle tone in a nut cracking fashion! Napoleon Dynamite fans will flock to Hess' latest film, and will probably be amazed at what he accomplished with a little more cash and a few Hollywood well-known actors.",8,1,2,17 November 2006
Shutter Island," Scorsese Scores!
","If you don't like watching films twice, then I suggest you not view SHUTTER ISLAND even once. But if you do, you need to click over to the extra features on the DVD and watch 'The Making of Shutter Island.' It is here where you will begin to realize how important it is to restart the disc from the beginning.Shutter Island is a film-within-a-film, about a character-within-a-character. The multiple layers and textures are unbelievably inviting in a very twisted sense. The entire film screams thriller, but after you view it a second time, it'll scream ...something entirely different.Dividing audiences and critics, Shutter Island reveals itself to probably be too dense for many, but a revelatory success for others; I'm obviously in the latter category.Leonardo DiCaprio (THE DEPARTED) has rapidly become director Martin Scorsese's muse (and rightfully so). The two have been nearly inseparable since GANGS OF NEW YORK. 'Marty' saw something inside Leonardo and knew that he had the acting chops needed for some fairly tough roles. And here, on Shutter Island, Marty gives him his toughest role to date.As soon as we see Federal Marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE) arrive on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a mentally deranged prisoner, we get the immediate sense that things are off-balance. The guards look at Teddy and Chuck with great apprehension; their weapons pointed in Teddy and Chuck's general direction.And as Teddy's investigation winds up, so do clues that don't match up. The possibility of a 67th patient being on the island, even though the warden and his charges claim there are only 66, tips Teddy (and the viewer) off that something is amiss.The dark edges surrounding the island also leads Teddy into flashbacks of his time in WW II, and into other muted corners of his past that he'd rather not see.It is these dark corners that intrigue Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley, YOU KILL ME) and his partner Dr, Naehring (Max von Sydow, THE SEVENTH SEAL), themselves being psychiatrists. But we quickly garner that these two men are at opposite ends of the same field. And are they fighting each other over Teddy? If so, why? It is here that I'll stop any further possibility of spoilers for those who choose to read this review. And it is also here that I need to reaffirm the requirement that you watch this movie twice. If you do, you'll come away feeling as though you've seen two movies instead of just one.",9,1,3,8 July 2010
Capote," Hoffman Channeled Capote
","Truman Capote's masterpiece IN COLD BLOOD (1965) set a new standard and style in the literary world. We know that he didn't finish another novel after it, too, which begs the question, 'Why?' Fast-forward to the 2005 film CAPOTE and we get the answer.Mr. Capote is reincarnated in the body of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, and it is 'through' him that we get to find out what happened during this snapshot time of Truman Capote's life. A vicious murder of a family in rural Kansas takes place and Truman races there to find out if there's a magazine story in it. But what he finds is much more than just a short periodical piece. As the murderers are captured, Truman becomes enraptured with the idea of learning why these seemingly innocuous men did something so heinous.Truman digs deep, perhaps too deep, and we watch as every shred of decency is stripped away from him just so he can 'finish the story.' He bribes the prison warden and lies to the two killers (and ultimately to himself) about why he's really spending so much time with them on death row.In the end, it rips Truman apart, causing him to become an alcoholic and a shell of what he once was.Occasionally casting directors get 'it' right. And this time, they not only got it right by casting Mr. Hoffman in the role of Truman Capote, they bottled a bit of magic and captured it on film. David Strathairn did it, too, in his performance as Edward R. Murrow in GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, but Hoffman takes it to a euphoric level for movie watchers. His mannerisms, voice and costumes were impeccable. Many times I thought I was actually watching Truman Capote and not an actor playing him. Now that's great acting.If there was any failings in the movie, I'd have to say it was with its overall script. Although intriguing and genuinely creepy, it held only a small piece of what Truman Capote was. I realize that to capture all of what he was would be almost impossible ...but there you go. That's life.Even so, Hoffman deserves all the accolades he's gotten and I have no doubt he'll jump up on stage at the Oscars this year and pick up his statue.",9,0,0,18 February 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Starting To Founder
","Being a pretty big fan of the OCEAN'S series, I was looking forward to something new and fresh from director Steven Soderbergh. He did a nice job on OCEAN'S ELEVEN and OCEAN'S TWELVE but here, with thirteen, this tired franchise gets soggy.The back-and-forth banter is still there (thankfully!) as are some great comedic moments. Most notably is a scene between Rusty (Brad Pitt, BABEL) and Danny (George Clooney, GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) when Rusty visits Danny in his hotel room and catches him tearing up at an Oprah show; this also comes up toward the end of the film when a large donation to charity is made. Also the banter between Rusty and Lenny (Matt Damon, THE GOOD SHEPHERD) is nicely played when Lenny has to don a massive costume nose as a disguise ('Oh the nose plays.') But this is where we leave entertainment and hit some rough seas. The story of one of the Ocean's crewman getting wronged and becoming deathly ill is the pivotal point upon which the entire story swirls, and yet we feel nothing for this person because so little time is spent on him and too much time spent on the EXTREMELY intricate plot devices surrounding their latest 'get even' gig. The fixing of blackjack tables, slots, and roulette are given far too much film time, as is a Mexican uprising for fair wages in a factory where some dicey dice are being made for Ocean and his team. The point was supposed to be on getting some payback for the wrong done to one of their own and yet ...we don't see much of that.It's noteworthy to point out, too, that the film, however faulty, is very well acted. George Clooney and new bad-guy Al Pacino play well against each other on-screen ('I know the guys you'd send after me and they like me better than you'). Even the heavily busted Ellen Barkin does a good job as an uptight hotel manager bent on profit (the only ridiculous scene with her was when she is somehow overpowered by a sexy scent worn by one of Ocean's manly men).The final damaging blow to the film comes from its beginnings in which we're re-introduced to Roman Nagel (Eddie Izzard, MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND) and he is supposedly utilized in the Ocean team's plan to get even. But after he gives them some information on how to break into certain high security areas, he's lost forever from the script. That was very jarring.Even with these problems the movie is fun if the story is not. The strong acting make it watchable, but don't think too hard about its intricacies or your brain might explode.",6,0,1,30 November 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Streep Is Fantastic!
","Can you say Oscar nominee? If you can, then Meryl Streep's performance in The Devil Wears Prada should be first on your lips and list. Her witty, cool, and wickedly abrasive character portrayal of Miranda Priestly in this film certain warrants at least that. Simply put, The Devil Wears Prada is about corruption. Not political or business, but personal. The big question this movie asks is 'How much of yourself are you willing to let go of to get what you want? Or what you think you want?' In this Summer's blockbuster comedy-drama, this question is not as easily answered as one might think.Miranda Priestly has given up everything to become the president of Runway Magazine, the most expensive, most popular fashion periodical ever to hit the racks. To raise the magazine to such a prestigious level, Miranda has sacrificed everything  marriages, vacations, family. Her latest need, however, is fairly simple: a new office assistant. Enter Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway, HOODWINKED) a frumpy looking young lady who recently graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in journalism. Andy tries to use her position at Runway Magazine as a stepping stone to bigger and better jobs, but is soon sucked into the high-price, high-pressure world of fashion. She rapidly becomes Mrs. Priestly's direct assistant and has to be on-call 24/7. This wreaks havoc on her relationship with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier, ACROSS THE HALL) as she shows up late for dinners and even bypasses his birthday party. A dawning awareness of what she's become (or might become) soon hits Andy and she's forced into making a decision that'll affect the rest of her life. Should she stay with Mrs. Priestly and become a wealthy design assistant with an ulcer? Or should she follow her original dream of becoming a journalist? In a set of excellent circumstances where Mrs. Priestly really needs her, Andy finally makes her decision. It's a 'stand up and applaud' moment for many viewers and even Meryl Streep's Miranda character seems pleased with Andy's choice ...right before she yells, 'Go!' to her driver at the end of the film, indicating she may have approved of Andy's choice, but she's already made her own. Anne Hathaway pulls in a 'beauty' of a part as Andy Sachs. Mrs. Hathaway is a great looking lady (even when 'frumped' up) but I'd be willing to bet she's never been a size six! She's so tiny! But Meryl Streep's performance is simply amazing. Her bitchy, bossy, hardheaded, businesswoman performance was absolutely perfect! When she first meets Hathaway's character and says, 'You don't have any fashion sense.' And Andy says, 'Well I do, it's just' 'That wasn't a question,' Streep interrupts. That exchange sets the stage for this dynamite relationship between the two.If Streep doesn't get at least a few award nominations this year for her performance, I'll be highly disappointed.",9,0,0,1 August 2006
Corpse Bride," Tim Burton Is One Sick Puppy!
","Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is the son of wealthy fishmongers and he's had an arranged marriage set up for him. His wife to be, Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) is the daughter of Victorian-style royalty who are having financial difficulties. Marrying Victoria off is seen solely as a 'plan (score music here)' to pull her parents out of their money-rut.All seems to be going well until Victor fouls up his vows during the wedding rehearsal and runs off into the nearby forest. He continues to practice the vows as he stumbles through the trees, finally getting the words right and then ceremoniously placing the ring on a nearby twig ...at least that's what he thought it was. The twig turns out to be the dead finger of the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter). She and Victor are now husband and wife, and she emerges from the grave to tell him so. Running away from her and plowing into a tree, Victor falls unconscious, only to awaken in the underworld of the dead.Confusion reigns as Victor tries to tell the Corpse Bride that they cannot be married ...because he is still alive and she is dead. Well, there certainly is an easy way to fix that. But what of his living bride-to-be, Victoria? How will she take the news? The Corpse Bride has a lot going for it, but also a few issues. The positives far outweigh the negatives, however. Most enjoyable (from my perspective) were the miniatures and the way the 'claymation' flowed. The clay characters were smooth and outlandishly featured; Victoria's mother (Joanna Lumley) has hair that looks like two large breasts pinned high above her head, the Corpse Bride is disturbingly sexy, and the pastor (a perfect Christopher Lee) appears as an evil Vicar.Similar to WALLACE AND GROMIT IN THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT, the claymation is smooth and even. Although Wallace and Gromit has a more children's feel to it, Corpse Bride makes no such claim. Necrophilia, frightening death sequences, bodily decay, and several other possibly unappetizing ideas pop-up during the film. But they are usually infused with sprinklings of comedy, which made these items less morbid.The biggest 'hole' in the movie was its script. Clocking in at just 75 minutes, there's very little time to get acquainted with the characters and even less time spent on making sense of the movie's ending (I'll only comment that when the Corpse Bride said, 'You have set me free.' I said, 'Huh?').But the claymation, beautifully crafted caricatures, and mini-sets can't be denied. Nor can most of the musical numbers that added a certain garish quality to it (although some of the songs seemed forced to me, while several others were spot-on).I wouldn't let a child under 12 years old watch it, though. Adults will laugh at the humor thrown down at death's door, but the youngsters might not get it.",7,0,3,25 February 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Team Affleck
","I think it's safe to say that Ben Affleck may belong behind the camera rather than in front of it. With such disasters as SURVIVING Christmas, JERSEY GIRL, and the shockingly bad GIGLI {shiver!}, he's not the best leading guy. His only saving graces as an actor have been GOOD WILL HUNTING, DOGMA (saved by the dialogue), and HOLLYWOODLAND (his best performance to date).Directed and co-written by Ben, GONE BABY GONE shows a talent previously unknown to him (or us!) But another Affleck has appeared on the screen and his supplanting of Ben was cemented this year with his rock solid performances here and in THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD. I'm speaking, of course, about Ben's younger brother Casey. Young, hip, handsome, and with a broad range of abilities, Casey has proved himself to be a stellar young actor. His portrayal here in Gone Baby Gone as private detective Patrick Kenzie was superb, showing us a delicate looking guy with a tough interior.The story, too, is fascinating in that it makes the audience think about life's choices. When a child is kidnapped from her home, everyone is a suspect. Two police detectives named Remy Bressant (Ed Harris, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE) and Nick Poole (John Ashton) are suspiciously too close to the case, and even Patrick is eventually shown how upstanding yet corrupt they can be. The abducted child's mother, Helene McCready (Amy Ryan, LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE Muslim WORLD) is seen as a drugged out slut who seems to care little for her missing child. Did she have anything to do with the disappearance? Time and again the audience is shown multiple possibilities and sometimes it's easy to figure out that someone was involved in dubious activities. But if they were involved in the child's abduction remains foggy up until the very end.Morgan Freeman (10 ITEMS OR LESS) plays Captain Jack Doyle, the person responsible for the local missing children's investigations. Always a strong presence, Mr. Freeman is seen as the uptight yet extremely respectable lawman who finds himself in the wrong place at the right time. His 'involvement' may come as a complete surprise to many.This is a great drama with many tense moments that'll have you squirming in your seat, wondering if the poor little girl is dead, or perhaps wishing that she were so that this torture would end (after seeing what a pedophile is capable of later in the film, one begins to get this sickly feeling).Ben Affleck is to be commended for directing such a taught series of events that lead and mislead with just enough finesse to keep audiences guessing. It's also a great take on morality and what that entails. Sometimes doing the right thing is the wrong thing ...as weird as that sounds. It is our decisions that make us who we are and bind us to futures we may not feel comfortable with. This is something that is brought out to impeccable perfection at the end of the film as we watch Parick (Casey Affleck) sit on a couch and stare blankly at a television set. The pain and satisfaction of it all is who's sitting next to him.",9,2,3,20 February 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," Action!
","Not being much of a Matt Damon fan, I rarely look forward to any of his films. There are exceptions, of course, most notably his surprisingly great performance in THE GOOD SHEPHERD. But even within The Good Shepherd, Damon's emotional range isn't challenged, which is why the part was perfect for him considering who he was portraying.Part of that issue spills over into this series where we see a super-spy with little-to-no emotions that might help audiences 'feel' anything for Jason Bourne. But THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM and its predecessors aren't about character, they're about action, and director Greengrass knows action very well. If you think these stories have ANYTHING to do with character, you are seriously deluded. We never understand the motivations behind any of the prime or secondary characters. This is glaringly obvious when Jason and a CIA 'asset' sent out to eliminate him battle and, eventually, come to some sort of understanding.But, like I said, these stories aren't character pieces but adrenaline pumping action sequences designed as a thrill ride. And on that level expectations are well-met.Running from city to city, this is basically one long chase scene where the CIA learns that Bourne has resurfaced and several key officers within 'The Agency' don't want him to discover a covert operation that hearkens back to Bourne's uber-secret beginnings.David Strathairn (GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK) and Scott Glenn (FREEDOM WRITERS) star as two powerful but ultimately despicable Agency higher-ups who's attempts to snare Jason Bourne are continually foiled by Bourne and someone within their own department.Female leads Joan Allen (THE ICE STORM) and Julia Stiles (THE OMEN, 2006) pull in okay performances; Allen as the sympathetic CIA agent who wants to know why her superiors are so enamored with killing off Jason Bourne, and Stiles as the former love interest who reemerges to initially help Jason but only puts herself in danger and must be saved by Bourne. Although that was a bit confusing (i.e., their relationship history), the rooftop chase through Tangier is flat-out amazing.This is one of those film series' where you need to be in the mood for such things. If you want thoughtful, look elsewhere. But if you want heart-pounding action, you're in for a treat.",8,4,4,13 January 2008
Burn After Reading," An Intelligent Comedy About Stupidity...
","Looking much more comedic by the previews movie-goers saw prior to its release, BURN AFTER READING isn't so much a laugh-out-loud film from beginning to end as it is a sneak-up-on-you-and-catch-you-off-guard style film that speaks to the intelligence of this film about ...well ...stupidity. Yes, stupidity.From government higher-ups to health club morons, Burn After Reading shows us the ridiculous nature of those who want one thing, and those who think they know what's going on in the world but never really do. Let me explain...Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich, THE LIBERTINE) is having a really bad year. He's just been relieved of his assignment desk at the CIA. His wife is having an affair. He drinks too much. And now he may have lost the memoirs he was working on.Cut to a health club and we have Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand, MISS PETTIGREW LIVES FOR A DAY) looking for love on internet sites, but also under the impression that she's in desperate need of some serious plastic surgery (tummy tuck, breast enlargement, you name it). Her coworkers try to help by looking over her internet dating choices. One of her coworkers, Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt, BABEL) is a bit nutty but trying to be helpful. He also discovers that a CD found lying on the floor of the ladies room has 'secret sh!t' on it (could this be Osbourne Cox's memoirs?).Cut to Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney, MICHAEL CLAYTON), a Treasury Department employee who's overactive, extramarital sex life has him in deeper trouble than he could've ever imagined. Sexing it up with Osbourne's wife (played by Tilda Swinton, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA), Harry is somewhat of an internet sexual predator, not realizing that his wife is on to him and having him tailed.So...Linda and Chad try and blackmail Osbourne with his lost memoirs so that Linda can get some cash for her plastic surgery make-over. But Osbourne isn't having it. Chad is in for some rough times as he breaks into Osbourne's house, trying to find more 'secret sh!t' to blackmail him with.Meanwhile, Osbourne's wife has kicked him out of the house and is prepared to move on with her life by hooking up with Harry (who's not looking to hook up with any one woman). Harry, in the meantime, is hooking up with Linda and learning some distressing news about Chad.Back at the CIA...CIA heads are trying to find out why Linda and Chad have gone to the Russian Embassy to sell Osbourne Cox's memoirs (Osbourne had nothing to do with the Russian sector of the CIA) and discovering that murder and mayhem have broken out since they released Osbourne from his position.Whew! But the big question remains: Will Linda Litzke get her make-over? Sound like a lot? It is. But in the hands of master directors Joel and Ethan Coen (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN) it is a wild and surprising ride.The main thing I'd like to caution people with is that, again, this isn't a laugh-a-minute flick. It's subtle, very subtle, in the beginning. It builds on itself as the characters mesh and interact with one another. The Coen brothers show that they have the ability to surprise the audience with dramatic moments that overlap into comedic bits of interesting magnitude. Punches, gunshots, and skull-bashings are intermixed with lines of an absolute ridiculous nature, adding a unique flavor to this unusual comedy.",8,1,5,7 October 2008
Watchmen," A Tough Call: Length, Dialogue, and Confusing Narration Take Away From The Overall Enjoyment
","The biggest challenge for directors and screenplay writers  who are forced to deal with significant source material  is to make a movie that'll appeal to a broad audience while not alienating those fans who love what the film's based on; in this case, The Watchmen graphic novels/comics created by Alan Moore. Released via DC Comics in 1986 and 1987, the twelve book limited series quickly developed a cult following thanks to the truly graphic nature in which superheroes were depicted. Artist Dave Gibson and colorist John Higgins gave readers gritty images that swerved far beyond the comfort zone of most graphic novel fans, giving us heroes with flaws so grand it would make Penthouse and Playboy Magazine editors blush.The film rights for WATCHMEN were snapped up in 1986 and several production companies, directors, screenplay artists and others attempted adaptations that were promptly shelved. Directors such as Terry Gilliam (TIDELAND), David Hayter (X-Men) and Darren Aronofsky (THE WRESTLER and THE FOUNTAIN) were at different times slated to take on the film, but eventually backed out. Aronofsky I think was an interesting choice, specifically because I so enjoyed his visual take on The Fountain. But Gilliam deserves quite a bit of credit for saying something that rings truer than most. He said, 'I'd direct the Watchmen if it could be made into a five hour miniseries.' Hmm. Considering the extensive source material, that probably wouldn't be a bad idea. And considering the length of this sucker (163 minutes with an extended version that adds another twenty), one can't help but wonder what Gilliam would've done with it. But, instead, we got Zach Snyder (300) and a theatrical release this year (2009).Not taking anything away from Snyder, he did pretty well with what he got, which was an overstuffed script filled with some sketchy dialogue. But he also had some great visuals and an amazing musical score that really rocked the film on many different levels. The music came from so many sources that it boggles my mind. Nat King Cole. Bob Dylan. Simon & Garfunkel. Jimi Hendrix. And even KC and the Sunshine Band. All of the songs were well incorporated into the story and gave an added flavor to the scenes.One also MUST take note of the film's well-deserved R rating. The F-word is liberally sprinkled throughout, as is the act itself. One particularly steamy scene inside an aircraft reveals every inch of two prime characters, and I do mean EVERY INCH. Violence is rampant, just as it should've been, but parents might think  this being a based on a 'comic book'  that it is relatively harmless, Spiderman-like action. Not so. Dismemberment. Superheroes shooting  and killing  pregnant women. Rape. All of these are predominantly in the film's forefront, showing us the deconstruction of the superhero mythos envisioned by the graphic novels' original artist, Alan Moore.While the films visual qualities, sound, and music are something for fans to cheer about, the terrible dialogue, butt-numbing length, and confusing narration sequences pull the movie down quite a few notches. Initially seeming to be Rorschach's responsibility to narrate what's come before and after (Rorschach is a cop with a face only a psychologist could love and played very well by Jackie Earle Haley, LITTLE CHILDREN), the narration then jumps to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup, THE GOOD SHEPHERD)  whom I've affectionately renamed Mr. Penis  and back, and then back again to Rorschach. Since we're basically viewing the film via Rorschach's journal, I think sticking with him would've been the best and least confusing way to go.An example of the film's bad dialogue are just too easy to find: 'I know who my father was,' and 'It doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems,' and the lowly 'Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon.' Even with these significant flaws, it's worth praising Zach Snyder for having the testes to move forward and make this film. That, in itself, is nothing short of miraculous. But it doesn't negate the obstacles that could've made this a truly great film. Perhaps a trilogy would've been better?",7,0,2,7 March 2009
Little Miss Sunshine," Shines Brighter Than I Ever Expected
","The Screen Actors Guild have an 'Outstanding Performance by a Cast' award they give out annually, and this year LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE must be among the nominees (if not the recipient).Never before has a story been so well told and equally acted. Moving the audience to tears one moment and making us burst with laughter the next, this script was absolutely brilliant.And the story goes...Young Abigail Breslin (SIGNS, 2002) plays Olive, a six-year-old whom the entire cast orbits around. The first place contestant in a local New Mexico beauty pageant got eliminated and Olive, who'd came in second, is the default winner. She's going to California for the Little Miss Sunshine finals. But due to financial limitations, the family can't fly her, so all of them pack into a VW bus and head west. With Abigail comes her barely functioning dysfunctional family. Her father is played by the estimable Greg Kinnear (THE MATADOR, 2005). Richard (Kinnear) is the only one who can drive a stick, so he has to go. But with him comes his 'are you a winner or loser' motivational comments that irk everyone around him. Also with them comes Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano, THE KING). The 15-year-old has taken a vow of silence until he's passed a test that allows him to fly jets for the Air Force; he writes his caustic comments on paper for all to read. Then we have Frank (Steve Carrell, THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN) who was recently released from the hospital after slitting his wrists and is on suicide watch by the family. A renowned Proust scholar, Frank found himself fired from his teaching job after falling in love with a student; one of his male students. Next we have Olive's grandfather played pitch perfect by Alan Arkin (THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING, 2001). He's a smack-sniffing, perverted old man with a misplaced heart of gold. He's also Abigail's instructor for her dance sequence in the upcoming competition. And finally there's Sheryl (Toni Collette, IN HER SHOES), Olive's mother who is the glue that holds the family together.Road trip movies are practically a dime a dozen, but many miss the mark or become ludicrous. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has no such problems. Bouncing off  or sometimes smashing against  each family members' personality, Olive (Breslin) is the unifying good-natured persona that makes this entire flick so very watchable. Olive is a bit overweight, wears thick eye-glasses, and has little talent. But her family loves her without restraint and when they stuff themselves into the dilapidated VW, it is her unflagging perkiness and smiling that drives them onward toward California, even when confronting a failed father, a difficult brother, a faulty clutch, or death.The dance sequence at the end of the film is something of movie legend. If you think about who Olive's grandfather was, the dance she chose to do was outstandingly accurate (what other kind of dance could a drug-addled, porn-watching old man teach?) Needless to say I cringed and laughed at the choreographer's choice. It also made me ask 'if' I should be laughing at this, as it was completely deranged and inappropriate! I'm going to risk a lot here and say that I haven't seen a film this enjoyable in about two years. And the audience that watched it with me seemed to agree; they all stood and applauded when the credits started rolling. That says a lot, I think.",10,4,9,15 August 2006
The Orphanage," Not Really A Horror Film, Per Se
","THE ORPHANAGE is a tough film to review, as it had some really good points but some really low ones, too.The highest point comes from Guillermo del Toro's association with it. For those unaware, del Toro was the genius behind such films as HELLBOY, the new HELLBOY II and the exquisite PAN'S LABYRINTH. Visually wondrous and stark, del Toro has a discerning eye for what does and does not work, and one can easily see his input (as a producer this time) within The Orphange. Although he had a hands-off approach for this film, you can see it is distinctly del Toro in nature, with heavy shadows, complex film shots, and a movie that lets the images speak rather than a visceral score (which was minimal).Spanish stage-star-turned-film-actress Belén Rueda pulls in a fantastic performance as a returning woman to the orphanage she once inhabited as a child, but this time as owner of the failing building. Her pouty eyes, ruffled hair, and slumped shoulders gave her just the right mixture of attractiveness and cookyness that such a role demanded. When Laura's (Belén Rueda) adopted son Simón (Roger Príncep) goes missing from a party at the house/orphanage, Laura obviously does everything to try and locate him. Her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) also tries for many months but soon loses faith in ever finding the boy alive. He's probably right, too, since the boy was sick and needed daily medications. But Laura refuses to give up. She 'feels' something in the house, just as Simón had before he disappeared. Simón kept referring to invisible friends who wanted him to stay and play with them. Laura and Carlos, of course, just assumed the boy to have an active imagination.But Laura begins awakening to memories of her time at the orphanage, and with this comes a flood of troubled remembrances. When a group of paranormal researchers are called in to see if they can find out what happened to Simón, Laura's suspicions are aroused further, but cause a rift to grow between she and her husband. Carlos soon leaves but Laura stays, and she starts 'playing the game' that these memories tell her to (including a game of hide and seek that results in some of the film's scarier moments, '1 ...2 ...3...Knock on the wall.') Although the performances and filming were done with great care, the script itself was not. Deus ex machina rules the ending (just think of the movie THE OTHERS and you'll be real close). That this film has horror elements is undeniable, but genre-wise it doesn't quite fit. Although I don't think shoe-horning a film into a specific genre is a good thing, it does give the viewer a sense of what to expect and how the story will unfold. Not so here. The ending makes it a bit too sweet. Okay, so that might not be fair if you compare Pan's Labyrinth's ending and this one (true, they are similar). But Pan's Labyrinth had a much more cohesive story that came at you from a child's perspective. With The Orphanage, it is through Laura's eyes that we see this world, and she's a grown up with grown up ideals. Plus the brutality of Pan's Labyrinth was horrifically pulled off by the evil protagonist, while in The Orphange, it really had none other than its own circumstances.But if you're in the mood for something visually appealing, this one will stimulate that portion of your brain. Just don't expect a smashing success ...or a horror film.",6,4,7,18 July 2008
Over the Hedge," Urban Sprawl Meets The Varments
","Animated films have some stiff competition. Not only do they have to compete against some truly marvelous predecessors (see SHREK, HOODWINKED, and FINDING NEMO), they also have to entertain not just kids, but adults who enjoy taking their kids to watch such films.OVER THE HEDGE has some great animation and some good voices, but we've seen these things time and again. It also has a morally upstanding storyline (i.e., not betraying your friends and becoming a part of something bigger than just yourself), but we've seen that ad nauseam, too (ICE AGE). What most movie watchers want  regardless if it's animated or live-action  is something fresh, new, and engaging. And that is where Over The Hedge fails. We get the same old story, the same great animation, and the same impressive voice cast.It is the cast that'll keep you watching it, too. Bruce Willis (DIE HARD) is the main character, starring as RJ, a raccoon with a big problem. He attempts to steal all of the food from a hibernating grizzly's cave (Vincent voiced by the gravelly sounding Nick Nolte, THE GOOD THIEF). When the bear awakens before RJ can make good his getaway, RJ accidentally lets go of all the food and it slides down the mountain and is destroyed. He's then given an ultimatum: get the bears food back within a week or be eaten alive. So RJ heads out and stumbles upon an interspecies family that have awakened one morning to find their wilderness world encroached upon by a huge hedge. Urban sprawl has come to their neck of the woods, and this ragtag group's leader Verne (Gary Shandling, THE GARY SHANDLING SHOW) must find out what this hedge is for and why it's there. But Verne is just one turtle and needs the help of his extended family. They include Hammy (Steve Carrell, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE), a nonplussed squirrel with hyperactive sensibilities; Stella (Wanda Sykes, POOTIE TANG), a skunk with an image problem; Ozzie (William Shatner, MISS CONGENIALITY), an overly-dramatic possum caring for his family; and a few others.RJ runs into this clan and spots an opportunity to gather the food he needs for the bear. Manipulating his way into the family, he teaches them about junk food, dumpster diving, and the human world 'over the hedge.' But with the human world comes danger. Most notable among them is Dwayne (Thomas Hayden Church, SIDEWAYS), a varment exterminator. Will RJ risk this innocent animal family in order to save his own neck? The answer isn't surprising.Certainly the voices are entertaining, even more so than the script the actors read. Special notice has to go to Steve Carrell for his hyper-Hammy squirrel who avoids caffeinated beverages until the end when his super-speed is increased to Matrix-like proportions. Also, William Shatner's Shakespearean possum is flat-out fun. But that's it. And for an hour-and-a-half flick, it's not enough.",4,5,7,18 October 2006
Wanted," The Summer Action Season Has Begun!
","Full of nonstop action. Sexy. Impossible. WANTED is all these and shamelessly flaunts it. And with good reason: It's a popcorn flick. Summer is upon us and most movie-goers demand a few solid action films, and Wanted delivers.We've seen this plot before. A nobody discovers that he/she is a somebody and develops their 'abilities' thanks to the guidance of a super-dude/dudette. The nobody is cubicle-bound-anxiety-prone-loser Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy, ATONEMENT). Stuck in a dead-end job he constantly feels overwhelmed by his supervisor and must take anxiety medication to settle himself. Until one day he meets his dudette, the appropriately named Fox (Angelina Jolie, A MIGHTY HEART), who saves him from the deadly crosshairs of Cross (Thomas Kretschmann, KING KONG), an assassin gone rogue from within a group known as The Fraternity. Told initially by the leader of this group, a man named Sloan (Morgan Freeman, 10 ITEMS OR LESS), that The Fraternity is a group of 'good' assassins who do fates bidding by getting their kill assignments from something known as 'The Loom of Fate', Wesley (McAvoy) enters their ranks in roughshod fashion (being beaten, sliced, healed ...and then beaten and sliced again) to toughen him up for the job he must do.His goal, though, is to kill the man who killed his previously unknown father (Cross being the assassin of Wesley's dad). But if turning a no-account accountant into a killer weren't enough, there's a not-so-subtle twist that many might see coming as they watch this bullet swerving action movie.McAvoy is completely believable as the dweeb-infused office-boy-turned-gunslinger, making the premise of the film a joy. And watching the sexy Angelina Jolie whip out massive handguns and hit her targets nearly without fail is something that'll make your action-packed-weekend fun. She seems so comfortable doing impossible and ridiculous stunts that it makes them seem possible and plausible.For those in the mood for a great shoot 'em up, this one's a winner.",8,9,17,6 July 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Apatow Feels Out America's Musical History
","Film writer Judd Apatow has officially become synonymous with low-brow comedy. And low-brow can sometimes be pulled off to surprising acclaim. And such is the case with WALK HARD: THE DEWEY COX STORY.With THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN and KNOCKED UP firmly under his belt (as well as PINEAPPLE EXPRESS and YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE ZOHAN), Apatow has shown he knows how to tickle the funny bone of young and old alike ...but mainly the young. Deciding to test the waters of music history, Apatow jumped headlong into the tempest and came out of it looking fairly unblemished.The main thrust of the film's success is undoubtedly that it centers on America's musical past, dipping us into Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan (big time), Jim Morrison (watch out for the penis shots), Elvis Presley (love the hair), Tim McGraw (country?) and even Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.The other big draw is its title character/actor Dewey Cox played by the oft-underused comedic actor John C. Reilly (TALLADEGA NIGHTS). Reilly plays second fiddle to no one this time, and holds firm his grasp on the character. Completely ridiculous lines roll off his tongue in effortless fashion ('The Siamese cat is a symbol of mobility in Ancient Egypt.'). He also is sometimes very physical in his comedy, running down the street in his underwear in true Jim Morrison fashion.Other actors and actresses are fairly forgettable, however, with the notable exception being Sam (Tim Meadows, best known as a not-ready-for-prime-time-player on Saturday Night Live). Sam assists Dewey in his drug struggles, introducing him to the fairly benign (pot) to the deadly (Heroin). And watching Dewey go through withdrawals was hysterical from a medical standpoint ('I'm freezing!' 'He needs more blankets.' 'I'm burning up!' 'He needs less blankets.') If you're an Apatow fan, you owe it to yourself to check out this musical farce. If you've been ho-hum on Apatow up until now, you still might want to check this one out.",7,0,0,14 November 2008
Dreamgirls," Hudson Deserved Her Awards
","Musicals aren't really my thing. Many feel forced as the cast breaks out into song at the most bizarre of times. Cheesy is perhaps the best descriptor, but occasionally I enjoy a good toe-tapping flick if it's done right. And DREAMGIRLS is definitely done right. It certainly ranks up there with MOULIN ROUGE and CHICAGO as one of the more recently successful musical films, it too being a period piece (covering the late 50s through the early 70s).Acting in these style of films tends to lend itself more to dance moves than actual roleplaying of characters, but there are two highly mentionable performances in Dreamgirls: first time actress Jennifer Hudson of American Idol fame, and a major comeback role for Eddie Murphy. Hudson took home Best Actress trophies from The Golden Globes, The BAFTAs, The Screen Actors Guild and The Oscars for her portrayal of Effie White, the powerful and ultimately embittered lead singer for The Dreamettes. Eddie Murphy as James 'Thunder' Early is surprisingly excellent, perhaps helping wash away the stains of DADDY DAYCARE and THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH from his more recent, acting, downward spiral. Murphy can sing alongside Hudson and Beyonce and hold his own, too.The added entertaining fact about Dreamgirls is that there's an actual story behind the music, making this film much more watchable than many musicals which rely solely on their high notes rather than acting skill. This story is firmly entrenched in the early music industry as a 'white-washed' form of entertainment, separating it from 'black music'...until Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx, JARHEAD), a car salesman in search of more, jumps into the music biz and launches his own record label (Rainbow Records). Foxx's Taylor character is another smashing success for him in that he makes this man both lovable and despised as he turns from caring manager to control freak.Likewise, Murphy's Early character is someone who's moral ground we're never quite sure of. He's a married man with womanizing tendencies, but he's also a musical purist, trying to create sounds that are true to him while at the same time dismantling what he once was (a great, yet small, singing sensation). His fall from grace hits the viewer hard as heroin, time, and his own industry begin taking their toll. But veterans Murphy and Foxx can't hold a candle to newcomer Hudson's performance. She is the crux that holds the entire production together, and she does so with power, grace and a great emotional range. The ending is sure to choke-up many viewers.The only complaint I can lodge against the entire film was within one small section where Effie (Hudson) breaks out into a long chorus about being wronged by Foxx and the other Dreamettes. This seemed rather awkward and I would've liked to have seen this acted out in dialogue rather than burst into song.Still, this is a powerful musical film that deserves much praise ...and has rightfully gotten it.",9,1,1,15 May 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A Bit Too Shallow For My Taste
","The 40 Year Old Virgin is an adult comedy that tries too hard to be funny by infusing vulgarity and crude anti-social male behavior at nearly every turn (ala THE ARISTOCRATS).It doesn't miss the mark completely, but the attempts at portraying a message of some significance get consistently marred by foul jokes that pull the viewer away from any true meaning. I realize this is a 'comedy', but the message of what it's truly like to be a 40 year old virgin is never fully realized. All we know is that Andy (Steve Carell, The Daily Show) is a pretty boring virginal guy who collects action figures, works at an electronics store, and has never had sex with a woman in all his 40 years. This seems like a pretty shallow character representation ...and it is.Where the comedy comes in is when Andy's fellow male coworkers discover his lifelong secret. They try to help him out by giving advice, introducing him to loose women, and trying to change his body image (the chest waxing was painful to watch, funny, and gross).Andy finally meets Trish (Catherine Keener, CAPOTE) and falls head over heels in love. But his attempts to get close to her are stifled by his coworkers' advice and his lack of understanding of sexual behavior. This is where the comedy really could've gotten a leg-up on other shallow comedies (ex. DATE MOVIE) but doesn't take advantage of the opportunity. Instead we're given continual bathroom humor obviously directed at the teen movie-going crowd.After finishing the film I had to ask myself if I really cared whether or not Andy got laid. And the answer was 'no.' I also felt that the ending of the film was very forced; a last ditch effort to make the 40 and over crowd somehow feel more connected to the character by putting in a musical number from the 1979 musical HAIR.",4,3,7,29 March 2006
Jarhead," What If A Fighter Is Never Given The Opportunity To Fight?
","There's a lot to love about JARHEAD, but there's an underlying current, too, that may effect some viewers negatively (specifically those that have been or are Marines.) Myself never having been in the U.S. Armed Services, I can't make those glib comparisons that others who've 'been there and done that' might be able to. But what I can do is rate this film on its own merits and tell you why I gave it such a high rating.Like Sam Mendes' other film, American BEAUTY, which delves into the depths of suburbia and all its great and terrible significance, Mendes here takes hold of a U.S. Marine and shows us an excellent character study. But this time it's of a young man's ultimate genesis into a fighter.Jake Gyllenhaal (DONNIE DARKO and October SKY) is Anthony Swofford, a naive recruit with dreams of glory and medals, a dedicated American protector who takes his lumps during his early time in 'The Suck' (the Marine Corps unofficial title given to it by the grunts). He rises to the station of a Marine Scout-Sniper along with Troy, Peter Sarsgaard (FLIGHT PLAN and KINSEY). And above them is Staff Sergeant Sykes, Jamie Fox (RAY), who 'loves The Corp' and will never leave it.As Swofford makes it through boot camp and into the lower echelon of a Marine trained combatant, he is very willing, ready and extremely able to kill whenever the order comes.But what if it doesn't? This is the crux of the film.I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about JARHEAD before its release, and many have damned it for a message that I simply did not see, that being the making of a political statement or 'bashing' the Marine Corp. On the contrary, I think Mendes held back on this point and skillfully allows the viewer to insert their own beliefs (if you lean one way or the other  pro-War vs. ant-War). And that's War with a capital 'W'. Because, let's be honest, that is what our Armed Services are trained for. They are trained to kill during wartime. And each man/woman brings with them their own justifications for this (be it 'In protection of my country' or 'Because my father was a Marine' or 'Because it was this or jail.') This film focuses on the relationship that Swofford develops with the Marine Corp and within himself. He is given the right tools (both psychologically and physically) to exterminate the enemy. He is beat down by his instructors and built back up into a killing machine ('This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine...'). He's loaded with adrenaline as they enter Iraq for Operation Desert Shield. But the days begin to drag on and he begins to wonder whether he'll ever see any action and get to do what he was designed for (sharpshooting). Boredom sets in, and with it comes resentment and anger directed at anyone within reach (even men in his own platoon). But then a mortar attack on their outpost occurs. Slow motion blasts of sand cover Swofford's face, a sort of baptism into the War. He wets himself during this scene, but whether it's from excitement or fear is left up to the audience (I personally loved that part, as it might be perceived as another type of baptism.) Then we see Swofford and his platoon moving into the desert as they witness the burning of the Kuwait oil fields. They go into this muck and the feel of the film turns as dark as the petrol spilling from the infernal wells. Are they in Hell? My initial perception was that something bad was coming. But it never did.There is no 'War' to speak of for Gyllenhaal's character. We never see a speck of enemy blood on-screen. No head splatters or bullet-riddled chest shots. The war is 'distant', beyond his reach, and you begin to feel his frustration. Why can't he just kill somebody? (This is especially noteworthy when they are given the opportunity but it is quickly taken away.) All in all, this movie is a fantastic break from normal Hollywood form. There are no great external battles with dismembered bodies and the death of half the platoon. The battle here is compartmentalized into one man's struggle to find out what the Hell he's supposed to do as a killer when never given the opportunity to become one.(There is a great feel of dichotomy toward the end of the film when an obviously disenfranchised Vietnam Vet gets on-board the welcome home bus carrying the 'victorious' Marines down Main Street; a 'victory parade' that the Vietnam Marine never got.)",9,3,7,4 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Dark Days For Harry
","I'm going to admit something here that I probably shouldn't: I haven't read ANY of the books in the HARRY POTTER series (don't hurt me!) It might be because everyone says 'Oh you just HAVE to read this!' that puts me off. I'm not the type of person to follow all the lemmings over the cliff. I tend to enjoy more obscure stuff. But I digress...What I don't mind doing, though, is watching cinema and I've thus far seen all of the 'Potter films.' And this one I found to be quite different. Although the second in the series (THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, 2002) was pretty dark, it pales (brightens?) in comparison to this third installment.Harry is breaking the rules and barely getting away with it. He's using his powers outside of school and in general muggles population (he causes a relative to inflate to great size and drift away). And when he can no longer stand staying with his aunt and uncle, Harry decides to leave and seek refuge in the outside world. The trouble, though, is that a dark creature seems to be stalking him. Was that a wolf peering at Harry through the brush? Eventually Harry makes it back to Hogwarts and discovers that a psycho prisoner  Sirius Black, played by the wonderful Gary Oldman (BATMAN BEGINS, 2005)  has escaped his cage and may be stalking him. Was Sirius responsible in some way for Harry's parents' death? Dementos, dark specters that resemble wraiths, are assigned to the perimeter of Hogwarts and Harry has some very uneasy feelings about them. They seem inordinately interested in him, too.With the help of Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE, 2001) Harry is led down a dark path, a path believed to contain the secret to his mother's and father's death.Friends and enemies are often intertwined within the same characters as this third story unravels. Director Alfonso Cuaron (Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, 2001) gives some excellent direction to a film that could've easily gotten out of control. With the multiple twists and turns (i.e., time travel, werewolf friends, etc.) this film flowed smoothly and was packed with angst and action.The special effects (specifically the early bus ride) are pulled off nicely and give a slight sense of the whimsical without going overboard. But the previously mentioned wraith-like Dementos are pretty creepy and could easily freak-out children under 12 years old (so be careful, parents.) Again, not having read any of the books in this series, I have no idea where the storyline is going. But things tend to be darkest before the storm (forgive the cliché), then they clear. So my assumption is that things will come to a head very soon for Harry and his Hogwart friends. Darn! I might have to pick up one of the novels now!",7,0,1,23 January 2006
Ratatouille," Same Theme, Same Story
","Maintaining the status quo can be damaging to films, especially thanks to the highly popular animations that have graced the silver screen (SHREK, THE INCREDIBLES, HOODWINKED!) Audiences get bored if all you show us is the same ol' same ol'. And this is where RATATOUILLE runs into trouble.Written and directed by Brad Bird (who also did The Incredibles and THE IRON GIANT), Mr. Bird has fallen into a small rut; one that I hope he doesn't remain in. Yes, the animation was great. Yes, the voices were wonderful. Yes, the story was cute and funny. But there was nothing new. We've seen these themes over and over and over again, and it's becoming a bit tiresome.Instead of a superhero family or a misunderstood ogre, this time we've got an English speaking French rat (don't ask) who's taste for expensive foods  and not garbage  gets him into trouble. Living the life of the dull and mundane with the rest of his extended family, Remy (Patton Oswalt, RENO 911!: Miami) soon has buckshot whizzing by all of his furry brethren. Removed from his familial upbringing, Remy turns quickly toward his love for rich foods. His astutely attuned nose leads him to Paris (as does a ghostly visitation from a world famous chef known as Gusteau voiced by Brad Garrett, MUSIC AND LYRICS), where he finds a now corrupted and dying restaurant named after its formerly famous cook (the aforementioned Gusteau). He also runs into the newly hired garbage boy named (not funnily) Linguini (Lou Romano, CARS). After being captured in the kitchen, Remy is caged and taken to the river by Linguini where he's told to dispose of the rodent in the nearby river. But Remy and Linguini soon realize they can understand one another, and Linguini can't bring himself to the kill the little fella. What does happen, though, is that a bizarre relationship builds and Linguini quickly becomes the soup chef thanks to Remy's ability to identify delectable food. Hidden under Linguini's hat (literally), rat and human become the master-blaster (ROAD WARRIOR reference) of Gusteau's restaurant.Swirling around this story is also a love interest between another chef named Collette (Janeane Garofalo) and Linguini, the battle between thievery and survival that Remy must address when his extended rat family pops in, and, of course, the battle that Linguini must do with a very Tim Burtonesque looking food critic named Anton Ego (the estimable Peter O'Toole, CASANOVA).Not surprisingly, everything works out in the end thanks to human ingenuity and rodent accompaniment.But, again, this isn't something we haven't seen before. It's old terrain covered many times, which is why I'm only giving it 6 stars. Had it not been for the awesome voice of Mr. O'Toole as the food critic, it may not have gotten even that.Kids will enjoy the action. Parents will like the familiar territory. And let's hope that the two can talk about the necessity for rats to NOT be in restaurants.",6,2,9,7 September 2007
American History X," Sitting In Awe Of Norton's Performance And The Film's Message...
","American HISTORY X is so powerful, so engrossing, so well-acted, that I sat in silence for some time after the last credit rolled past. The message of hate and how it affects generations is something so true and ingrained in our culture that it often defies logic. And so goes this film...Based on the true-life story of a white supremacist, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton, THE PAINTED VEIL), the story leads us down a path many would probably not rather see, but must see in order to understand what hateful ignorance lay in wait in America (and beyond).After killing some black men trying to break into his car, Derek is sent to prison for several years, leaving his family to fend for themselves. Most notable is impressionistic brother Danny (Edward Furlong) who practically worships brother Derek. In high school, Danny taunts students of color and creates a few enemies that will ultimately be his undoing.Trying to save both Derek and Danny is high school principal Bob Sweeney (Avery Brooks), a black man on a mission to salvage the men from hatred (a great role for Brooks, too, second only to Norton's amazing performance).In prison, Derek learns a humbling lesson: those that are supposed to be your friends can be your worst enemies, and true friends can be color-blind. Derek becomes friends with an unlikely laundry buddy ...who happens to be black. The two form a bond based on trust and understanding, and a love for sports talk. Derek is surprised when he actually survives his prison term, only to learn that his survival was helped along by his friend of color. Derek has awakened to his loss of hatred of colored people (and Jews), and realizes that he has to try and save brother Danny from a similar fate.But can he...Edging his way back into the family, Derek distances himself from his disturbing past, but will it be in time to save his beloved skinhead brother? Without a doubt, the film's ending can be viewed as fatalistic. We don't know what Derek is going to do but we are left with an inkling of hope that he'll stay true on his new path. Whether he would or not is left up to the audience to decide.Which is why I remained sitting, staring at a black screen after the credits finished rolling. I wanted to see my hopeful thoughts come true; to see Derek rise up and defeat his demons. I didn't want to see what 'might' happen.I hope...An incredibly powerful performance by Norton and an even more powerful message of (possible) redemption ...with a terrible cost.",10,0,3,3 May 2009
Tropic Thunder," Can You Say 'Oscar-Worthy'?
","There aren't many movies that live up to the hype seen on previews and ads. Fewer still in the comedy genre that might have a shot at an Oscar. But TROPIC THUNDER does both thanks to a sturdy screenplay, perfect acting, and some of the funniest dialogue you'll hear this year.Standing out amongst other ridiculous comedies that often go for the cheap-shot, Tropic Thunder hits higher comedic notes thanks to a plethora of items. First is the screenplay. From the VERY BEGINNING of the film, you immerse yourself in these characters' lives. My advice to movie-watchers is to show up early and watch the previews, as you're in for a not-so-subtle surprise. The 'faux-previews' were an excellent way to introduce the characters and get an immediate feel for who they were. And who are they? Ben Stiller (NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM) stars as Tugg Speedman, an actor on the downward slide of success. Having been a big action star (think Sly Stallone), Tugg is having difficulties procuring decent roles. Although Stiller does a fine job as the actor-turned ...well ...actor, he doesn't hit the mark in terms of losing himself in the part like others did (see below)...Jack Black (NACHO LIBRE) is Jeff Portnoy, a two-bit actor who's comedies are all about gaseous releases ('Everybody laughs at me just because I fart!'). He's also an addict and when he tries to clean up in the jungles of Vietnam, Black turns in some of the funniest bit lines of the film (many of which I can't state here and earned this film its firm R rating). In terms of acting history, Portnoy's follows similar terrain as that of Eddie Murphy in his fat suit films.Brandon T. Jackson stars as Alpha Chino (need I say more? Yes? Okay). A rough, tough, black man with a gentler  shall we say  feministic side, Jackson battles his sexuality as well as his ethnicity.Jay Baruchel (KNOCKED UP) comes on as Kevin Sandusky, the only 'normal' guy in this cadre of demented and damaged actors. He envies their acting histories and has a bit of hero worship going on with one of them. He also turns out to be the glue that helps hold the gang together. Think Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and you'll be close.And saving the absolute best for last, we have bad-boy Robert Downey Jr. (IRON MAN) as Kirk Lazurus, a confused white man gone black, and lost amidst his multiple character personalities. Watching him peel back his personas toward the end of the film was sheer genius. Lazurus so immerses himself in-character that he doesn't come out 'until the special features on the DVD.' He's also tough to deal with. And he's an Aussie. And he's a great actor. Sound like anyone you know? Russell Crowe should rapidly come to mind.The screenplay must get notice here, too. And mentioning that Justin Theroux had his hand in it. This is the same Theroux who starred in the sensational series SIX FEET UNDER. He seems to have understood how to come up with comedy that isn't DUMB AND DUMBER, and hits the mark head-on.The dialogue is simply astounding, especially when coupled with these well-knowns in the comedic field. But Downey Jr. is the real star here, delivering his lines with flawless precision and in a voice that irritates the crap out of Alpha Chino, a real black guy who finds Lazurus' constant in-characterness to be grating and insulting.This is truly a phenomenal piece of cinema, with action and comedy meshed so well together that there's not a single moment for the mind to rest.Oscar worthy? Yes. But will it make it? Let's hope so.",10,4,10,30 August 2008
Enchanted," Disney Making Fun Of Itself? Wow! Imagine That!
","Let me make it immediately clear that I'm not a big fan of Disney films. Most (if not all) of them are overly-schmaltzy, teach kids nothing about the real world, and are so simple a chimp could follow them. But my twin 19-year-olds (boy and a girl) wanted to check out this latest mouseketeer event. It isn't hard to imagine someone of my nature grudgingly slapping down hard-earned cash then grumpily sitting with an overpriced and over-sized box of popcorn, ready to be bored out of my mind and intellectually insulted.What I got instead was a big shock. I'd obviously seen the ads for the film on television and thought, 'Ugh. Another no-brainer.' My initial concerns seemed justified as the film started and was quickly assaulted with the 2-dimensional animation we've all seen during early Disney tellings. I sank further into my chair, grumbling, 'This is super-lame.' But as the film progressed, and the animation gave way to live action characters, I began to realize that Disney was ...poking fun at itself? No. It couldn't be, could it? But yes, they did, and they did it right! This is a melting pot of animation, live-action, and animation within live-action that is seldom seen. That's a nice score for Disney. Added to this is the retelling of old fables that've become part of our movie history. A combination of Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and several other commonly seen films are incorporated into ENCHANTED to give it a familiar yet equally unique story.Amy Adams (TALLADEGA NIGHTS) stars as Giselle, a soon-to-be princess recently swept off her feet (literally) by Prince Edward (James Marsden, X-MEN); it's noteworthy to mention this all takes place in the early animation portions of the film. But Prince Edward's mother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon, ELIZABETHTOWN) doesn't want to give up her queenly title and throws Giselle down a 'wishing well' on her wedding day. Giselle anti-magically reemerges near Time's Square in New York (we've now entered the live action portion of the film). Searching high and low for her castle and her future groom, Giselle quickly learns that New York is no fantasy world. Jewelry is stolen off her person by the homeless, her dress quickly becomes soiled, rain drenches her, and no one is saying friendly things or breaking into happy song.Divorce attorney Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey, FREEDOM WRITERS) and his eight-year-old daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) are on their way home via cab when they discover poor Giselle. She (again) literally falls into Robert's lap and he and his daughter feel pity for this seemingly deranged woman and take her home with them to help her find a way home (via cab, subway, etc.). Robert is less than thrilled about having an attractive woman in the house as he is prepared to pop the question to his longtime girlfriend Angie (Samantha Ivers, INSIDE MAN). But Giselle falls asleep on Robert's sofa and he's forced to let her stay the night. Come morning new discoveries await Robert and his daughter. Giselle, who can normally call up all the cute and fuzzy animals of the forest to help her with household chores, decides to do the same here. But her sing-song doesn't bring cuddly rabbits and dainty deer. She's in New York City, and when her enchanting voice reaches the creatures of this land, they come in the form of cockroaches, sewer rats, and pigeons. They still help her clean up Robert's apartment, but when Robert awakens, he finds the invasion of his home by insects and rodents too much and shushes them out of his plush home. He also finds that Giselle has made a new outfit for herself out of his expensive curtains. At wits end, Robert takes Giselle to work and thrusts her needs onto the company secretary who can't find out where her home is let alone who she is.In the meantime, the now unanimated Prince Edward comes to the real New York City, too, and finds it terribly difficult to locate his lost love. With him comes an assistant of the queen, Nathaniel (Timothy Spall, HARRY POTTER), who's job it is to make sure he and Giselle never meet up. Failing that, he's supposed to give Giselle a poisoned apple (in the tradition of Snow White).When all fails the queen, she's forced to come to the real world, too, and does so with frightening ferocity. But can even her powers stand against true love's first kiss (a theme that runs throughout the movie)? It isn't necessarily the fairy tale items that grab movie-goers but the failing of those items by those that come from such a land where things exist and are forced into a land where reality is more brutal. The reverse obviously becomes true, too, as those who live a hardened life in the real world come to accept that having a bit of fantasy fun and believing in the unbelievable can have overwhelmingly positive results on your life, love, and your happily ever after.The movie is funny beyond mention, too, with some perfectly executed scenes (including a dance sequence in Central Park, watching Prince Edward break into song only to be stopped by bicyclists plowing into him, Giselle's continued clothing designs by utilizing various items in Robert's home, Prince Edward believing a television to be a kind of magical looking glass, just to name a few).The film is touching and, in the end, pretty predictable. But that didn't stop young and old from applauding when the film ended. I even found myself clapping a few times. Wow. Imagine that.",9,0,1,2 December 2007
The Duchess," A Really Good Historical Costume Drama
","A historical costume drama with some powerful performances, THE DUCHESS is the study of The Duchess of Devonshire and her battles with The Duke during their strained marriage.Little known director Saul Dibb gets a dream cast in Keira Knightley (ATONEMENT) as The Duchess and Ralph Fiennes (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) as The Duke. Thanks to Fiennes' uber-talent as a powerhouse actor, he helps pull the entire production up several rungs. Knightley shines unexpectedly bright in her role as the clothes-designing Duchess who steps into royalty and a marriage of the times; that is to say, something completely foreign to those of us in today's world.By contract, she is to be honorable and deliver the Duke an heir: a son. But three girls later and the Duke is becoming restless. He finds lust wherever his loins take him and the Duchess must simply bear it. A friend and confidant, Bess (Hayley Atwell), soon turns into a lady of conflict as she sleeps with, and then moves in with, the Duke. The Duchess tries to settle the matter but the Duke's power won't allow her any leeway.When a past love arrives in the Duchess' life, a powder keg erupts. Mr. Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper, MAMMA MIA!) turns the Duchess' life upside down, and when she becomes pregnant with his child, the Duke's orders force her into an impossible situation: give the baby up (and give up Mr. Grey) or never see your children again.The terrible power wielded by The Duke is pulled off exceptionally well thanks to the high performance of Ralph Fiennes. Surprisingly you loathe him and then, as the film progresses, you actually pity him when he says things like, 'Look at them. To be that free.' His job and title have strapped him down and drove him into this role.The forced and eventual consummated acceptance of the Duke's power is probably Keira Knightley's strongest reveal for her since I've been watching her flicks.The costumes and sets are stunning in their elegance and appropriateness, as is the believable love that future Prime Minister Grey (yes, he actually becomes Prime Minister) and the Duchess feel for one another, even when forced apart by society and their own lives.This is a wonderfully done film with plenty of eye-candy sets and dark characters to make most movie watchers delight.",8,0,0,2 January 2009
Quantum of Solace," Overly Complicated For A Bond Film
","Daniel Craig IS the new James Bond. He cemented that position with his opening volley in the 2006 release of CASINO ROYALE. A bit more hard edged. A bit more gloomy. But just as dangerous, Craig gives us a Bond we're probably going to enjoy for several years to come. We get the same tough guy here in QUANTUM OF SOLACE but with a story that has problems.The good is that it picks up right where we left off with Casino Royale. We learn that a secret organization threatens the very government that Bond works for. Even to the point of shots being fired at M (Judi Dench, CRANFORD) by one of her own double-00s.Bond, still pining and hating his old love Vesper, finds himself enjoying his work too much. Killing is becoming a habit ...and M and her superiors don't like it. But when Bond begins to dig up dirt on political higher ups, M pays quiet attention. It all starts in a third world country and Bond's fascination with a beautiful girl (no surprise there) named Camille (Olga Kurylenko). She's after the man who killed her family. Bond's after whoever it was who shot at M. Their two paths intersect in an unusual way: Bond feeling sympathy for her and wanting to help her get revenge. Her feeling a unique pull towards Bond's unflagging search for truth, regardless of the cost. All of this is taken up by an evil man named Mr. Greene (Mathieu Amalric, MUNICH) who's trying to control the world's most valuable resource (I won't give that away) while giving super-politicos whatever they want. But Bond is on to him, and with his help, Bond aids Camille in getting her revenge, while also getting Bond closer to Mr. Greene.The biggest issue with the film, however, is the multiple threads that intertwine with Bond's actions. They are confusing in the extreme, making the watcher wonder what, exactly, is going on at various times. For instance, during a scene when Bond has to kill a man who happens to work for the British government, we never learn why this man got involved in the first place nor even who he was working for (clandestinely speaking). There's also a hotel that runs on fuel cells that goes boom! yet we don't know why this hotel is out in the middle of nowhere nor what fuel cells have to do with the storyline (yes, I know that fuel cells run on hydrogen, which can be gotten from water, but it still doesn't explain why it was out in a desert and not, say, along a river valley or near the ocean). There are other threads that also lead nowhere, but I'll leave you to discover what they were should you choose to watch this.But make no mistake, it IS an action-packed, 007 flick in the vein of what we've come to expect from Bond films. But it's a bit overly complicated. Something to be aware of.",6,1,6,20 May 2009
No Country for Old Men," You Don't Get Perfection Like This Very Often
","If you're a Coen brothers fan, you're gonna be extremely delighted with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. This is Ethan and Joel at the pinnacle of their directing careers, something that should not be missed by anyone interested in film or entertainment. Forget FARGO. Push aside THE BIG LEBOWSKI. Move over O' BROTHER WHERE ART THOU. No Country is leaps and bounds beyond those. In fact, it reigns supreme as 2007's best film.I don't always agree with movie critics but this time they got it right. It is the first time that Associated Press reviewers David Germain and Christy Lemire have both selected the same film as their #1 pick. With more award nominations than you could shake a stick at (including four Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guilds, probably a gaggle of Oscars and many, many, many others), No Country will undeniably have directors, actors and screenwriters jumping up on stage come awards ceremony time.Equal parts thriller, western, crime-drama, and action, No Country weaves a tapestry of excellence throughout its length.The first note of excellence must be directed at Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Probably not very well known to most American audiences, Javier has cemented himself as the leader in portraying a psychopathic killer and (dare I say it!) has surpassed that of Anthony Hopkins in his SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lecter role (something that I thought would never happen). Ruthless, unforgiving, sociopathic, and in desperate need of a new hair style, Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is flawless. Every time he showed up on-screen I felt a chill run through my bones ('Call it'). Absolutely perfect.The next note of excellence must go to Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin, PLANET TERROR) is the lucky/unlucky soft-spoken Texas cowpoke/hunter who stumbles across a veritable fortune in drug money only to be relentlessly pursued by killer Anton. Mr. Moss' gradual decline in health (mainly due to wounds inflicted on him by Anton) is painful to watch up until the very end. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. He doesn't understand all of the death and destruction laid at his feet. He longs for a time when murders were easy to track and solve, not these new-fangled deaths where bullets aren't used (air-guns do just fine) and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their patterns.The fourth (perhaps this should've been first) note of excellence goes to the Coen brothers for their perfect adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name. Many lines of dialogue were lifted verbatim from the novel itself, including the ending monologue by Tommy Lee. It's noteworthy to mention here that the Coen brothers not only directed but wrote the screenplay, too.The final note has to go Cinematographer Roger Deakins (he's worked with the Coen brothers on many occasions and also did the exemplary JARHEAD work). Every scene was so well thought-out and so convincingly filmed that viewers are carried freakishly easy through this incredible story.It's difficult to do justice to this film with one short review, simply because there are so many great elements to it. The casting was spectacular  with Woody Harrelson (NORTH COUNTRY) and Kelly Macdonald (THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ) pulling in exceptional supporting roles  as was Carter Burwell's haunting original musical score and Mary Zophres impeccable costume designs.If you missed this film at your local cineplex, you may have gypped yourself from experiencing this amazing cinematic event. Now you've gotta wait for the DVD to be released and then ...it's your call.",10,196,334,3 January 2008
Mamma Mia!," 'Take A Chance On' Mamma Mia...
","Who'd of thought that Abba songs could be so operatic? Certainly not me! The fact that I hadn't seen the stage-play (by the same name) probably added to my surprise.Being no fan of that Swedish rock group of the 70s and 80s, I was doubly surprised to find myself enjoying this film so much. In no small measure was my enjoyment thanks to the all-star cast, no doubt, but also how well incorporated the songs were within the story.The story is worthy of a Shakespearean comedy with high confusion, paternal bonds in question, and lady-love finding its way into the audiences heart in unusual ways. The story, this time, revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried, HOUSE M.D.) and her desire to find her true father before her wedding. Stumbling upon her mother's diary, Sophie finds three candidates that might be her dad. Her mother Donna (Meryl Streep, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA) has no idea that her daughter has invited three of her former loves to the wedding. And when they arrive, paternal sparks go a-flying, as do the flickers of old romances. Harry (Colin Firth) comes to the wedding out of fear that he'd done something and then left it undone (i.e., not properly fathering his daughter). Bill (Stellan Skarsgard, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END) comes simply because he's curious. But Sam (Pierce Brosnan, THE MATADOR) arrives with a burning love-gone-by for Donna. And when Donna finds out all three of these old flames have arrived for the wedding, chaos ensues ...mixed with some toe-tapping music (Gah! Toe-tapping to Abba!).The other element to the story are two old work friends of Donna's (they were a trio of singers at one time) who arrive for the wedding and find Donna in a frazzled state. Rosie (Julie Walters, BECOMING JANE) is the active and playful one with plenty of spunk, while Tanya (Christine Baranski) is the sexual over-achiever who has to fight off the advances of a few young island boys.Surprises abound as the movie winds down. One person comes out of the closet, while two others find love (even though one is running away from any possible commitment). Donna herself might find love in the arms of one of those old flames. And Sophie's wedding gets a change of venue.One of the final songs on the track ('Take a Chance on Me') is extremely funny and well thought-out. And as the credits roll, there's some laugh-out-loud moments as we get to watch Colin Firth try to dance in a skin-tight, sequined outfit (along with the other main players in the film).The final positive note for this movie has to be that the director Phyllida Lloyd was also responsible for MAMMA MIA's huge stage production success, and her translation of it from stage to silver screen was exceptionally well-rendered. This one's a surprisingly good film, even for those folks who aren't into Abba.",9,3,6,31 December 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Too Long And Too Muddled, But Great Characters
","THE ASSASSINATION OF JESSE JAMES BY THE COWARD ROBERT FORD is a perplexing film in scope, subject, and style.The first thing that hits most people is the title. I mean, how long does a film's title have to be? Although I understand WHY they settled on it, I still feel that alternatives must've been out there.The next is the length of the movie itself. At over 2 hours and 40 minutes, it's a behemoth in terms of size. I understand, too, that the original uncut version was a bit over 4 hours. Four hours! Thank goodness they cut it down. But I feel more cuts were needed and a better direction taken with the movie as a whole.The biggest issue I have is that the entire production seemed to have difficulties deciding on who the main character was. Was it Robert Ford (Casey Affleck, GONE BABY GONE)? Or was it Jesse James (Brad Pitt, BABEL)? You can, on occasion, have multiple main characters, but with this film the muddling of who was doing what to who and why got seriously confusing. I attributed this to the fact that half the time we were focused on Jesse and the other half on Robert. The problems this caused was a lack of consistent story flow and a lengthy film that could've easily held more interest if it would've focused on either one character or the other. Personally, I would've liked to have seen the film start near Jesse James' assassination and then lead us off on the life of Robert Ford afterward. But that portion of Ford's life is quickly skimmed over and we never get the true feeling for what he went through after being labeled 'the coward who shot Jesse James in the back.' I also have to comment on the repetitive use of time-lapse photography during scenes meant to show the passage of time. The constant showing of clouds skidding rapidly across the sky got a bit tiring; time after time after time after time.Regardless of title and movie length, and the lack of a consistent character, the acting was pretty much perfect. Brad Pitt played the confused, dangerous, paranoid, and nearly psychotic Jesse James exceptionally well. And Casey Affleck as the disenchanted Jesse James fan-boy came across as creepy and not-just-a-bit pathetic.Although this film received plenty of praise (including two Oscar nominations), I found it to be slow and the first hour confusing with regards to understanding which character was doing what and why.But the acting saved it for me. Although I wouldn't necessarily recommend this flick for those who are ready to head off to bed (as this might put them to sleep before bedtime), I would suggest it as a good character study of the times surrounding the life of Jesse James and the poor sap who shot him.",6,1,5,2 May 2008
Cars," Another Animation Success
","Pixar has proved its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by hearkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win 'The Piston Cup.' But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on 'the highway.' Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout.",9,1,1,20 November 2006
2012," Oh Look! More CGI!
","Having very little to do with the Mayan calendar and its supposed threat of global doom in 2012 and more interested in being a CGI spectacle, this movie will most likely desensitize you to any impending crisis and make you wonder why you bothered watching it. Oh look, a CGI disaster. And another. And another. And ...oh look!...it's another one! Going to see a Roland Emmerich (director) film can be dicey at the best of times, and downright ugly if you're unfortunate. Arguably his greatest film was STARGATE which was spun off into a highly successful TV series on the SciFi Channel. But some fans are divided on others such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, GODZILLA and THE PATRIOT. Then we get into the 'bad' category with MOON 44, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and 10,000 BC (I think a little vomit came up the back of my throat for that last one).If you've seen any world doom films in the past 15 years, you'll not see anything that'll surprise you here. Things like DEEP IMPACT and Armageddon are pretty much a dime a dozen nowadays. And so goes 2012 ...but with a really poor script and some serious miscasting.Although John Cusack was an early childhood favorite of mine, starring in such low-brow comedies as BETTER OFF DEAD and ONE CRAZY SUMMER, he's grown into much more substantial roles in subsequent years, shining in HIGH FIDELITY, WAR, INC., and the astounding IDENTITY. But here John appears to have gone after the money. Reading the script, one can't help but wonder why anyone would choose to be in it. It really has no viable characters and relies solely on its massive special effects budget. But the actors did come. And not just Mr. Cusack.Chiwetel Ejiofor (can anyone pronounce his name?) tries to give some additional star power but can't grab any traction, either. Too bad. He's become quite a versatile actor, going from the feminine KINKY BOOTS to the rugged SERENITY.Thandie Newton (CRASH) gives the film even more eye-candy as the attractive daughter to the President. But here she is more caricature than character, giving some of the worst lines in the entire film.Oliver Platt (FROST/NIXON) tries to play 'the bad politician' and his lines, like Thandie Newton's, are so ridiculously contrived as to be laughable.The only saving grace – acting-wise – was the role of Charlie Frost, a conspiracy theorist, played by Woody Harrelson (ZOMBIELAND). He so over-played the character that it made him fun to watch and not a chore.So if you're looking for a good disaster movie, this ain't it. It has nothing for you to grab onto, except maybe pieces of the planet's crust ...and we see that more often than the actors themselves.",2,0,2,17 April 2010
Peaceful Warrior," The Cocky Upstart And The Sage Meet Up On The Zen Plain
","More of a self-help guide for the Zen needy, PEACEFUL WARRIOR does have some good acting, a solid (albeit schmaltzy) message, and some amazing filming using light and shade.Loosely based on Dan Millman's autobiographical novel 'Way of the Peaceful Warrior', the film focuses on Millman's over-inflated ego during his time as a super-gymnast yet having dark dreams related to failure. Unable to sleep, Dan (played by Scott Mechlowicz) frequents the streets of Berkeley, California in the wee hours of the morning only to stumble across a wise Zen-like master with no name whom Dan labels as 'Socrates.' Socrates (Nick Nolte, OFF THE BLACK) sees Dan's misguided spirit as a challenge and eventually allows Dan to see a path to inner enlightenment via the 'here and now.' Initially Dan sees this as shamanistic rubbish but quickly learns that he can apply Socrates' knowledge to help better his gymnastic abilities. Still focused on selfishness (wanting to win Olympic Gold) Dan finds himself injured after a horrific motorcycle accident and must come to terms with the fact that he may never walk again.With the help of Socrates, Dan not only walks but does the impossible.The message of the film is valid if you believe in such things as focusing energy only on the 'now' and 'throwing out the trash' that rattles around in your head every minute of every day. Doing so, according to Millman's philosophy, will allow you to become not only a better person, but a better whatever-you-are in your professional life.Mechlowicz and Nolte play well off each other, one being the cocky upstart and the other a wise and patient sage (perhaps even a ghost).But the real winner here is the light and shading of much of the film's images, especially whenever Mechlowicz enters the gas station where Nolte's character works. The dark aspect of the station gradually lightens up as Millman comes to accept what he's being taught. Also the motorcycle crash that injures Millman is done in fine slow-motion action with acrobatics to stop the heart of most movie watchers.All in all it's good film. Not great. But visually it certainly is a treat to watch.",7,3,5,3 January 2008
Ghost Rider," Burn Baby Burn!
","GHOST RIDER is another of the comic-book-to-film ideas that cinema audiences have been inundated with as of late. BATMAN, SPIDERMAN, SUPERMAN, THE HULK, have all made it from the graphic childhood page to celluloid, and some of them have done it well. But Ghost Rider sputters and dies.The most 'inflaming' issue for me was Nicholas Cage (THE WICKER MAN). He's, what, 43 years old? And he's playing an Evel Knievel-esquire, motocyclying hotshot who jumps everything from cars to spinning helicopter blades? Puhleease! He's getting too old for these roles and it's showing. Someone younger and with a cockier attitude could've pulled of a much more believable Johnny Blaze (perhaps Heath Ledger?) The love interest of Roxanne Simpson played by the exotically pretty Eva Mendes was nice to look at, but stood out as a mere cardboard character delivering unbelievably clichéd lines. Other than showing off her constant cleavage, she didn't hold any acting power.Peter Fonda as Satan (aka Mephistopheles) was okay but he's seen so little that we don't really give a 'damn' about him.The over-the-top evilness of Satan's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) was weak and his motives never fully explained (other than he wanted to have a 'Hell on Earth' via a forbidden city that is likewise never explained at all).My only soft spots for the film were the wickedly awesome bikes, the laughable (and appropriately so) Ghost Rider CGI moments, and Sam Elliott's intoxicating narrative. I've always enjoyed listening to Elliott's voice  it's syrupy smooth and deep baritone was a great dichotomy against an ancient tale turned modern.But the film as a whole is exceptionally weak. The love story feels and looks forced (again, Cage is just too old for someone the likes  and looks  of Mendes), the character's interactions are whisked aside in favor of action that isn't explained, and those characters that are interesting are given so little screen time that we just don't care about the story at all.Aside from the cool motorcycles and Sam Elliott's voice, this one should have you burning rubber back to your local video store in order to return it as soon as possible!",3,0,2,28 September 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Men Probably Won't Be X'd Out
","Learning how to keep an audience enthralled is one of the essential curves for good cinema. For me, it's all about the characters. Always has been, always will be. And on many levels, this third installment in the X-Men movie series succeeds.After having watched Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) die in the second film, I felt that the series directors, screenwriters, producers, etc., were beginning to understand what audiences need. But then we have Dr. Grey return in X-Men: The Last Stand. The emptiness of her passing was now miraculously refilled as we learn that Jean is not in control of her faculties. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) had previously held Jean's mind in check by separating her destructive side from her more controllable one. Jean was (is) a level five mutant, one with unlimited power. But with that power comes a fractured mind. Something called 'The Phoenix' (uh-boy, not that name again) lives inside Jean's head and refuses to be reigned in. A path of destruction and death reels before Jean as The Phoenix part of her mind takes control.Against this we have the discovery (by humans, of course) of a 'cure' for the mutant gene. This cure lives (naturally) inside the body of a little mutant boy who's kept out of harms way at a new facility that rests on old Alcatraz Island in San Francisco.Magneto (Ian McKellen) sees this as a threat to everything he stands for. It's only a matter of time, he believes, until the government makes it mandatory for all mutants to be 'cured' of their 'disease'.A personal, social, governmental, and worldwide movement begins on three fronts. First is Magneto's group of mutants who want this 'cure' threat destroyed before it falls into the wrong hands. Secondly, we have the government who says that the vaccinations are strictly voluntary and want to protect the child/cure. And in-between them we have the X-Men. Battling amongst themselves as much as any external threats, we begin to see the extreme price the X-Men are willing to pay in order for peace.New mutants abound in this third film. First, we have something called 'The Beast' (Kelsey Grammar), a blue cowardly lion with anger management issues that acts as a Presidential aide between mutants and humans. I don't know why, but I half expected to see Lilith from Cheers come stomping in and pull him out of a scene by his ear. Go figure. Secondly, we have The Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones), a bulky um guy who gets rolling and can't be stopped. And finally, we see Angel (Ben Foster), a winged boy whose inability to accept the 'cure' ends up saving someone very close to him.Although this film is subtitled 'The Last Stand', I seriously doubt if it'll be 'The Last Film.' An end scene with a 'cured' Magneto opens up an entirely new miasma of questions: Does the cure really work? Or is Magneto immune? Will mutants need to be re-vaccinated every so often? I feel pretty confident that X-Men movie aficionados haven't seen the last of Wolverine or Storm.",6,0,0,30 May 2006
P.S. I Love You," Unusually Formulated Chick-Flick
","P.S. I LOVE YOU is one of those films that falls firmly into the 'chick-flick' category. The story surrounds the grieving widow, her mother, and her friends, and how they all come together to help heal after the death of the studly husband. Sound schmaltzy for you guys out there? It might be.But it is unique for a couple of reasons...First is that one of the main characters, Gerry (Gerard Butler, 300) is dead. Although we meet him for a brief moment early on and during a series of flashbacks, he is, in essence, not there. We also don't get to watch him die. The death is startlingly quick, and it jerks the viewer to full attention because it is this sudden loss we see and feel via Gerry's wife, Holly (Hillary Swank, FREEDOM WRITERS), who also senses the loss of Gerry as extremely sudden  due to a brain tumor, or so we're told.The other interesting thing is that Holly learns more about her husband after his death than during their short marriage. She travels to Ireland (where they initially met) at the behest of Gerry who, during his illness, arranged for Holly to have a life after his demise. He does this post-mortem trickery by arranging for messages to be dropped off to her at various times and from various people around New York. Initially seeming to be macabre, the story rapidly evolves into ...something more. Holly's trip to Ireland with her two best friends Denise (Lisa Kudrow) and Sharon (Gina Gershon) reveal to Holly that there's a lot more life out there after losing your soul-mate. And she finds it in unique and disturbing places.Another unique quality was that Holly's mother, Patricia (Kathy Bates, THE GOLDEN COMPASS) turned out to be an accomplice within the entire story's machinations, something that took even me by surprise. Pleasantly. I also enjoyed the eventual dead-end relationship Holly ended up having with Daniel (Harry Connick Jr., THE IRON GIANT) that I thought would turn out very differently. And Holly's Ireland love interest, William (the hunky Jeffrey Dean Morgan, WEEDS) figures heavily in Holly's past and, possibly, her future.But even with all of this uniqueness, the story as a whole turns out fairly predictable. The grieving widow heals (albeit unusually), friends help her, mother helps her, and new friends and lovers make her grope for reason and what her life now means. It is schmaltzy, so just be prepared for that. Your wives and girlfriends will probably love it if you rent it for them, though.",7,0,1,23 December 2008
Across the Universe," Beatles Songs Get The Silver Screen Treatment
","ACROSS THE UNIVERSE is a musical for those who love the Beatles and/or the Vietnam War era anti-war protests. Specifically, it's for those who love the Beatles though.Paying homage to almost all the Beatles' songs of this era, Across The Universe paints a set of narratives across the silver screen against the lyrical backdrops of such greats as 'All My Loving', 'Let It Be', 'Come Together', and 'Hey Jude' to name a very few. All of the character names are also either pulled directly from Beatles tunes (Jude, Maxwell, Lucy, Sadie, etc.) or from the times (JoJo as Jimi Hendrix, etc.).Although very cleverly put together as a whole, the first forty minutes of the film are scattered and much of the music forced into the plot in order for it to make sense. The constrained script plugs along, trying to take wing but more often than not, falling back to Earth and trying again.About an hour into the film, however, Across The Universe finds its wings and gets aloft. After Max (Joe Anderson) gets inducted into the military, there's an incredible sequence in which we see a platoon of soldiers carrying the statue of liberty across the jungles of Vietnam. Never have I seen something so contrasting yet beautifully explored with regards to how the U.S. felt as boys were sent to fight in Southeast Asia ('Liberating' the Vietnamese by trampling down their country). The song 'I Want You' is interspersed here with the lyrics 'she's so...heavy!' cut from it. Amazingly done.The story is really about love and tolerance during a time of incredible bloodshed and governmental turmoil. Lead actors Jim Sturgess (as Jude) and Evan Rachel Wood (as Lucy) do a fine job of making us care about this conflicted couple and how in love they eventually become thanks to their similarities but also their differences. Jude wants to stay out of the war and focus on his artwork, while Lucy is forced into the Peace Movement when her brother (Max) gets drafted and shipped out. Lucy finds that peace at any cost is too high a price, while Jude's eyes are awakened when he pulls his head out of the proverbial sands.The drug culture is explored in-depth as our would-be lovers trek across the U.S. in a psychedelic bus after drinking some 'purple punch.' The visuals are wild, and the colors even wilder as their 'experience' drops them into the hands of Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard, MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND) who sings, not surprisingly, 'Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.'' His blue buddies are indicative of the LSD experience for those who wanted to 'turn on, tune in, and drop out.' The ending is well rendered if a bit predictable. Love cannot be denied amongst these terrible times, so Jude and Lucy must find a way to make theirs work.If it weren't for the terrible beginning, this film would've gotten an easy five star rating. But it faltered so much in those first forty minutes that I'd be lying to myself if I said the middle and end made up for all of it. It didn't. But Across The Universe is still a musical worth watching. Just get past the beginning and you'll be swept up in the nostalgic music and characters.",Null,1,3,14 February 2008
The Mist," A Mediocre Film Based On A Fantastic Novella
","There has been  and probably will be for some time  speculation about the end of this film and how it strayed from Stephen King's novella by the same name: The Mist. There's good and bad in equal measure, depending upon your stance on Hollywood Horror versus the literary kind. But let's back-up and look at the beginning before we rush to the end...Equal parts supernatural thriller and science fiction yarn, the novella (published in 1985 in a short story collection entitled Skeleton Crew) was, well, phenomenal. It is the type of story most horror fans associate Stephen King with. Compartmentalized. Freakishly different. Plays on morality. Just flat-out good writing. King did well back in the 70s and 80s, but he has floundered as a writer in recent years with his horribly bad From A Buick 8 and the equally putrid Dreamcatcher (which was made into a very unfortunate film starring Morgan Freeman). What exactly happened to Mr. King, I'm not sure. He hadn't had his brush with death (yet) and his earlier work sent the proverbial chills up my spine (most notably the excellent The Shining and It). Regardless of past or more present works, Mr. King did get lucky with THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION in that he got Frank Darabont to write the screenplay and direct. The Shawshank Redemption has been labeled one of the top 100 films of all times by nearly every film critic in the world, and it is one of my top ten favorites. The transfer from book to film went exceptionally well, and this was in no small part thanks to Darabont's work. Darabont did similarly nice work on THE GREEN MILE, but it didn't quite reach the heights that Shawshank did. But when I saw that Darbont was attached to this film, I leapt at the chance to watch it.Needless to say (because of my cool acceptance rating), I found The Mist to be entertaining but sadly lacking in several areas. But let's start with the good...The creature effects. The combined work using CGI and stop animation was excellent. KNB EFX Group as the Special Effects crew and CafeFX doing the Visual Effects showed us some eerily nice work. The ominous cloud of mist was perfect enough to shroud any early identification of the creatures within it and the actors reacted to the mist just as you would expect.Marcia Gay Harden (INTO THE WILD) stars as Mrs. Carmody, the bible-thumping, old-testament wielding, blood-seeking, Christian hypocrite that we all enjoyed in the novella. I hated her in the novella and I hated her here, meaning that Gay Harden pulled off a very good performance.Any further positives however (save one), get blurred by the ridiculous nature of the scripted characters. Too many times we get the 'shock' effect simply for shock effect, rather than sticking with the compartmentalization of the situation (i.e., people of differing backgrounds at each others' throats in a supermarket during a crisis situation). Characters act as if they are surprised to see death and destruction after it has already been shown to them just a few hours before. People leap for weapons when a creature is nearby ready to skewer them. Main actor Thomas Jane who plays David Drayton could have been played by just about anyone, meaning that I didn't find his portrayal of this character memorable (whereas Gay Harden nailed her role) And the list goes on...Getting back to the ending  and my final positive note  I have to say that it was hampered somewhat by my enjoyment of the written word versus this visual medium. In the novella, Mr. King leaves the ending fairly ambiguous. Which I liked. I liked a lot. And here, in the film, that gets changed to a much more somber ending. Although I liked the fact that Darabont didn't sugarcoat the final act, I do think he could have kept King's original ending and added a few more fans to his legions. But let's make it perfectly clear that this ending is absolutely in-line with the true horror genre, which is why it got a semi-positive rating from me.",6,0,1,18 June 2008
Stardust," It Ain't The Princess Bride
","Having met and spoken to Mr. Gaiman about his writings and, specifically, about this film, I had extremely high hopes for it. For those not 'in-the-know,' Neil Gaiman is the author of the novel STARDUST, as well as many other award-winning stories.There's been a bit of buzz about comparisons between Stardust and THE PRINCESS BRIDE. And although I can see a few points, Stardust is really its own animal. This is both good and bad. The good comes from the fact that it's original and almost epic in scale. The bad is that it strikes a few funny chords only to reign itself back into serious territory where much of its umpf! is lost. The Princess Bride played off its ridiculous nature so well that you knew nothing was to be taken too seriously. It never went for the serious angle (much to watchers' delight). But Stardust loses quite a bit of its power by jumping back and forth, as well as having a beginning that lagged.If you're looking for an honest retelling of Gaiman's Stardust novel, please don't go and see this. Just as if you enjoyed Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick, I wouldn't expect that you'd go see BLADE RUNNER and applaud its accuracy to the novel. That is to say that both mediums have their good points, just try not to compare them too closely.What we have here is a smidgin of Neil Gaiman's story taken out and revamped for movie audiences. And this is a good thing. Trying to be too strict to a novel's plot can stymie creativity when it comes to film time. Thankfully writer/director Matthew Vaughn realized this.Although there are peeks into Gaiman's story, most of it is Hollywoodized to appeal to a larger audience. The mysterious town of Wall, the beauty of Star/Yvaine, the evilness that appears when sudden beauty arrives, etc. These are nice incorporations. Where it fell down a bit is the overly long opening which was used to describe the goings-on around Wall, the addition of certain characters/parts in order to add the 'blockbuster' talent (which wasn't all bad), and the on-again off-again seriousness that went a bit too far.The biggest letdown for me was the main protagonist Tristan (Charlie Cox, CASANOVA). His role wasn't the most inspiring. Unfortunately neither was the beautiful Star/Yvaine (Claire Danes, THE FAMILY STONE). She played just well enough to keep me watching her, but that was about it. The supporting cast held my attention MUCH better. The wily old man who guards the entrance/exit to Wall (David Kelly, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY), the wickedly wicked witches  especially Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who plays the part so over-the-top as to be delicious  and how could we forget Captain Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro, THE GOOD SHEPHERD), the flamboyant captain of a sky-ship who captures lightning like fish and keeps his cross-dressing secrets securely hidden in his closet. These supporting characters are what kept me engaged and they weren't what the story was about.Comparisons aside, this is an okay film to check out, but don't let anyone fool you. This isn't The Princess Bride II.For a better Gaiman adaption, try checking out MIRRORMASK.",7,4,6,17 September 2007
I Am Legend," Will The Remakes Ever Cease?
","Oh look, another remake. Wow. Woop. What fun.Do I sound overly cynical? Maybe I am. But can't we see a few more original films on the big screen rather than mulling over the same ones year after year? Is that asking too much? Perhaps it is.The post-apocalyptic science fiction genre has been done to death (THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, NIGHT OF THE COMET, DAWN OF THE DEAD, 28 DAYS LATER, OUTBREAK, THE QUIET EARTH). And here in I AM LEGEND, we get a remake of the Charlton Heston film THE OMEGA MAN. Growing up, I loved The Omega Man. I often wondered what it'd be like to be the last man on Earth; at least the last 'normal' man on Earth. The genre wasn't yet tired in 1971 and I wasn't even into my teens. But since then not-just-a-small-number of similar cinematic films have come out, bombarding movie watchers with the same ol' theme over and over and over again (see my partial list above).Will Smith (THE PURSUIT OF Happiness) takes on the lead role as Dr. Robert Neville, the seemingly sole survivor of a plague that has wiped out 99% of humanity, turning the remaining 1% into cannibalistic zombie-vampires who burn up if exposed to sunlight; they roam New York's desolate streets at night in search of fresh meat. A cure for cancer has sparked a new virus that started humanity's die-off, and these scenes are given frequent flashbacks during the movie. We also get to see Dr. Neville's responsibility for trying to find a cure via the military (whom he works for before everyone keels over).With Dr. Neville is a trusty sidekick named Sam, a German Shepherd with acute senses. His canine abilities extend to detecting vampire-zombies, and to helping Neville battle the complete aloneness that rattles around his psyche. This is undoubtedly one of the strongest elements of the film. Watching Dr. Neville walk into a video rental store and speak to the mannequins he has set up is an honest portrayal that would hit any human who had only a dog to speak with.SPOILER ALERT!!!! When Sam-the-Dog dies (or rather when Dr. Neville is forced to kill him), it is a blow too deep and the good doctor goes out to meet up and kill as many of the nightstalkers as he can before they kill him. That's when he meets up with two young people (an older sister and younger brother) who save Neville from himself and tell him of a fantasy safe zone somewhere in the hills of Vermont. Neville has to decide what to believe in as the monsters close in on his home and threaten not only himself, but his two new god-fearing humans. The ending is pretty weak but set up nicely in a visual way.END SPOILER ALERT!!! Having hoisted such terrible news as 'unoriginal' on I Am Legend, one cannot deny two key elements that make this film a positive experience. First is the extremely creepy feeling one gets when looking at a vacant New York City. The weeds growing up from cracks in the pavement. Wild deer migrating through empty car-riddled streets. Everywhere there's a vision of what once was human inhabitation and is now just a rotting shell. That was a painfully great set of scenes. Secondly is Will Smith. Similar to Tom Hanks' CASTAWAY, Smith carries the entire film and does so with effortless precision. The losses he experiences are tremendous, and Smith pulls us in and forces us to feel the pain of one man left alone for far too long. This is most evident when dealing with Sam-the-Dog and his encounters with a pretty mannequin that he starts to humanize in his mind.Some might be able to wiggle past this film's unoriginality factor, and if they can, I applaud them. They probably enjoyed the movie (minus the ending) much better than I was able. But if you're like me, and desire something fresh in the cinema, you'll probably have similar feelings.",6,1,1,27 December 2007
Shrek the Third," The Ogre Is Starting To Stink
","Franchise films run the risk of overdoing it. This means becoming stale, predictable, or simply trying so hard to produce something off-kilter that it either alienates itself from its predecessors or, if not, becomes a cliché of sorts.The first SHREK was original, hysterically funny, and witty. Michael Myers' portrayal of a grumpy yet lovable ogre was spot-on. As was Eddie Murphy's (DREAMGIRLS) Donkey. SHREK 2 was helped tremendously by the incorporation of Puss-N-Boots played by Anthony Banderas' (THE 13th WARRIOR) over-the-top voice.All of the above are still in SHREK THE THIRD, and added to the cast are Justin Timberlake as Artie, the lost heir to the thrown of Far Far Away. Also coming in is Eric Idle as Merlin, a washed up magician living away from the shame of his past.What made the previous two Shrek films funny makes this one overly predictable and simply not laughable. It does have its moments, but they aren't thanks to Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, or Puss-N-Boots. Little things like Queen Lillian's (Julie Andrews) head ramming and singing are what sprinkle the film with a few light laughs. There are no belly-jiggling funnies to be found.The forced entry of the story of King Arthur (i.e., Artie) stilts the story terribly with the exception of Eric Idle's Merlin who does a few comical incantations that don't quite work out the way they're supposed to. Whereas the previous two films used other fairy tales to great advantage (the first one incorporated so much you'd be hard-pressed to include them all in one review, and the second one, too, had a few jabs at Disney itself), this one tries to beat the viewer over the head with the magic and it doesn't translate to much of anything .Even so, this is a modestly entertaining Shrekfest. All of the familiar characters are there and most movie watchers will feel right at home. But don't expect much from them.",5,0,1,14 December 2007
The Hurt Locker," That Many Oscars? Really?
","I was beginning to hold out some hope (however little) that the Oscars might have been steering away from political correctness and social appeasement when, last year, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE took home 8 of the 10 categories it was nominated in, including Best Picture. A 'feel-good' movie made on a $15 million budget with no-name actors, it came out of nowhere and blindsided many viewers and Academy voters. Pleasantly surprised, I flipped on the Oscars this year (2010) and watched the who's who for films in 2009.I'm not going to take any large swings as THE HURT LOCKER because it was a good movie. I enjoyed the action, the tension, the acting. It was all nicely pulled together. But, out of the ten Best Picture nominees this year, was it really the stand-out? I felt that the Academy was slipping, once again, into the realm of trying to be 'significant' and 'modern' by voting for something that's on everyone's mind (the war in Iraq). Again, the movie was okay. Good. Adequate. But head-and-shoulders above such films as INGLORIOUS BASTERDS? DISTRICT 9? UP IN THE AIR? I humbly disagree that it was. And there was nothing in it that we haven't seen before: a war movie with internal angst and a man lost amidst society when he returns home. Jeremy Renner (28 WEEKS LATER) did a fine job as the risk-taking Sergeant James but, again, he was channeling every other warrior brought into a tough situation that we've seen on celluloid a gazillion times.From reading what you've read of my review so far, you might think that I'm being more critical of the Academy than the film. That's partially correct. But when so much attention is heaped upon one film (including Best Director ...which we'll cover in a moment) and so many people think that this is 'the film to watch' and not the other nominees that won little or nothing, I believe of informing those who might choose to read this of their folly should they not see something like District 9 or — one that didn't even get mentioned — MOON.Let's hit on the Best Director item...No female director has ever won an Oscar before Kathryn Bigelow did for The Hurt Locker. So what! We never elected a black President before Obama. Does that mean we should give him every break just because no other black man has ever sat in the White House? No! You win because you deserve to win, not because it's never happened to someone of your kind before. Was the directing of The Hurt Locker better than Inglorious Basterds? Was it? Sorry, but I completely disagree if you think it was.I will say that I'm glad AVATAR didn't win Best Picture or Best Director. But to completely blank out such phenomenal films as DISTRICT 9 and other worthy competitors is simply ridiculous.I think it's important for me to say here that I completely support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan; they risk their lives daily so that I can live the life I do over here in the U.S. They risk they're lives so that I can write something like this about a film they may care deeply about. But caring deeply about a subject like The Hurt Locker and elevating it above other films does a disservice to the art of film-making and film-makers when you over-rate a movie based on it's significance in the world today and not on its art.For me, the top films of 2009 were DISTRICT 9, INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and MOON. Two got a smidgin of notice and one never saw the light of the Oscar ballots. Check those films out before deciding where the awards should've landed for movies made in 2009. Please.",6,10,18,12 March 2010
The Illusionist," Trailers Tell All
","Much of a film's interest starts the moment audiences see trailers for it , and such was the case with THE ILLUSIONIST. The dark themes, nice sets, pretty actors/actresses, and supernatural undertones probably drew movie-goers to the theaters after checking out the trailers. But some may be disappointed to find little else behind The Illusionist. Although this disappointment won't fall to the level of despair or hatred of the film, movie buffs may feel as if they were lied to when it doesn't deliver the high-caliber flick they were expecting.The story  Eisenheim the Illusionist is played by Edward Norton (AMERICAN HISTORY X), and Norton does an okay job with a scripted character that seems to have few emotions. Eisenheim's life has focused on his magical craft since he left his hometown and the love of his life, Sophie (Jessica Biel, ELIZABETHTOWN), a fellow teenager who's way above Eisenheim's station. Fifteen years later we find Eisenheim in Vienna only to discover that Sophie, now a beautiful young baroness, slated to marry into the upper echelon of royalty. Her husband-to-be is the dangerous and manipulating Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell, DARK CITY). But when Eisenheim and Sophie try to rekindle their love interest, deadly forces are at play and are ready to rip them apart again. One of these forces is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti, Cinderella MAN), the upstart of a poor butcher who's trying to rise to a power all his own (Viennese Mayor Uhl? Nice ring to it, eh?).Eisenheim and Sophie concoct a plan in which she can detach herself from the Crown Prince, but the plan seems doomed from the start. Sophie's life is put in danger and Eisenheim has to use his incredible illusionist powers to help save their lives and their love. But can it work? As with the title and the main character, much of what is seen is complete illusion. But if one watches carefully, they can pick up on hints of what is truly going on. 'Make us disappear,' Sophie pleads with Eisenheim at the beginning of the film as they cower in a hut. And that he cannot do so obviously affects the rest of his life and the rest of the film.The shinning stars in The Illusionist are Giamatti, Sewell, and, surprisingly, Biel. Although the entire focus of the film is around Norton's character, it's tough to get 'into' him when what he mostly does is sit on a stage and make soulful apparitions appear by looking as if he were having a particularly tough bowel movement.Paul Giamatti really steals the show here. How great it is to see someone of Giamatti's chops FINALLY get the recognition he deserves and star in some great roles. Now he's proving that he's not just a co-star (THE TRUMAN SHOW, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN). His Inspector Uhl character is miles away from well Miles in his career launching SIDEWAYS film. That the audience both roots for Uhl and hopes he fails is evidence of Giamatti's great acting ability.Rufus Sewell is the bad guy everyone loves to hate. He's done it time and again (A KNIGHT'S TALE, HELEN OF TROY, etc.) and pulls in a wonderfully slimy character portrayal here, too.But Jessica Biel is the biggest surprise. Looking both pretty and elegant, Biel goes further than she's ever gone before  far beyond 7th HEAVEN and THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE  and may have cemented herself as an actress with Oscar-caliber potential.The biggest letdown for film-o-philes will be that The Illusionist doesn't expand much beyond what they saw in the film's trailers a few months ago. But it does entertain, and it's visually interesting and well shot. Just don't expect too much from the script and you'll probably be just fine.",7,0,1,17 September 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Shootin' The Tube With The Silver Dude
","The Fantastic Four are back in FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER ...dude.Slipping back into the latest comic-book-to-film wave, director Tony Scott (of the 2005 FANTASTIC FOUR feature) tries to shoot the tube by giving us another character from the original comics.And the story goes...Mr. Fantastic, aka Reed Richards/'Stretch' (Ioan Gruffudd), and Sue Storm, aka The Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba), are trying, once again, to get married. Interruptions have stifled all attempts at matrimonial bliss and this time it comes from another world. The Silver Dude (voiced by Laurence Fishburn, AKEELAH AND THE BEE) has 'surfed' onto Earth to do his master's bidding (see Destroy Planet Plan 101). Breaking through the planet's mantle, The Silver Surfer prepares each planet he visits for the impending arrival of a cloud of ...um ...stuff known as Galactus (the comic book showed this as a giant robot but apparently Tony Scott refused to have any kind of giant robots in his films).Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) stars as The Human Torch and the first of the fabulous squad to interrupt The Surfer's wild ride. Energy transfers between Silver-Boy and Torch cause fluctuations in Johnny Storm's abilities to light up. Anyone who touches Johnny, too, gets a touch of this transference and is quite funny when Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) trades powers with him for a few short moments.Mr. Fantastic has to help the military find a way to disable The Silver Surf all while trying to prepare for his wedding. Time is short for both and when The Surfer shows up near Reed and Sue's hitching place, the waves come crashing down on their celebration (bummer, dude).Racing to save the planet from The Surfer's seemingly incalculable powers, the military enlists surprise, surprise! Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon). You really didn't think he was gone permanently, did you? Victor's able mind and talents help bring Silver-Boy down but oh! you know that ol' Von Doom mind. He's got other plans for The Silver Surfer's powers.Shortened by nearly 15 minutes from the first film, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer feels lessened in two significant ways. First is that there's almost zero explanation as to how the Silver Surfer became the creature he is. The 'love' interest between what was Silver-Dude's woman far, far away doesn't explain much and leaves viewers caring little about him. The second is the rushed story focusing on booms! bangs! and gadgetry rather than the substance of the characters. The other issue some may have is that it ends with no resolution as to what happened to Von Doom or The Silver Surfer's all-powerful board (maybe he sent it out for a nice waxing).Even so, this is a fun, quick watch. It has some hysterically comical moments (almost all of which are thanks to Chris Evans' plucky Human Torch).Just don't expect much character and you might enjoy certain aspects.",6,2,5,25 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Every Man Has His Time
","The curious thing about THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is that no one seems to think Benjamin's case is that ...well ...curious. But I'm jumping ahead of myself.This film is really all Brad Pitt (BURN AFTER READING). He so controls the entirety of it that you simply could not picture anyone else doing that role but him. Pitt is, after all, a fine actor. Probably one of our finest out there at present. Things like BABEL, OCEAN'S THIRTEEN and FIGHT CLUB have helped elevate his cinematic chops. But never before has so much attention and time been given over to a character that is purely Pitt's. He is on-screen for most of the film's substantial 166 minutes. And he is fantastic to watch.The curiousness of it is that Benjamin Button (Pitt) is born old. Really old. Arthritic, full of heart disease and wrinkles, Benjamin's early life is wrought with problems. His mother (Joeanna Sayler) dies giving birth to him and his father (Jason Flemyng) is so distraught and disgusted by Benjamin's appearance that he leaves him on a vacant porch-step. He is taken into a house of elderly people where they are cared for in their waning years. And as Benjamin's time passes, his body mutates into a younger and younger man. He finds himself in adventures on the high-seas, and travels the world. But one thing he never seems to forget is his early love of Daisy (Cate Blanchett, I'M NOT THERE). Their on-and-off relationship is the only thing that keeps Benjamin semi-grounded in reality. His life is odd, but not so much for him. Although aging is a natural process, Benjamin just happens to be doing it backward. The big question for everyone is 'What happens when Benjamin's time runs out?' Will he vanish into a zygote? It is most disturbing (to me as viewer) that no one in the medical community decided to study Benjamin. They just completely accepted the fact that he was aging in reverse and that was that. No news media hype that Benjamin needed to run away from. No pokes and prods by the medical establishment. Nothing. I understand that time was of the essence when telling this story, and that it needed to be more human interest than anything, but I would've liked to have seen SOMETHING or someone curious enough to think this oddity worth studying.Regardless, this film is quite good thanks to Brad Pitt's amazing performance and the incredible make-up effects (Greg Cannom won the Oscar for Best Make-Up and rightfully so). It is also great eye-candy to see the period sets and costumes through the ages as Pitt and the rest of the cast age into the more modern world.",8,0,2,27 May 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Just Enjoy It...
","Based on Judi Barrett's 1978 children's book of the same name, CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS hits the right spot for kids and adults alike. It is whimsical almost to the point of such old cartoons as The Road Runner and Popeye. Which I found to be a refreshing break from the more in-your-face animated features that try to stuff political/social commentary down our gullets (see WALL-E and HAPPY FEET as two that did this to an extreme degree). Now I'm not saying that we shouldn't try and educate little Johnny and Jane, but we should, sometimes, give their minds a break and allow them a moment of sheer entertainment. And CWaCoMB does that.Take one part kid scientist-wannabe and add to the mix an intelligent weather forecaster and a father who wants his son to join the family business, and you get spaghetti tornadoes, cheeseburger hailstorms, and Jello castles. Yep. That's the type of whimsy I'm talking about.Bill Hader (TROPIC THUNDER) stars as the voice for Flint Lockwood, the crazy kid scientist who's creations seem to go wrong more often than not. But his one creation, a machine that mutates water into food, is a resounding success. That is, until something goes terribly wrong. But before it does, Flint meets up with sexy newscaster Sam Sparks (Anna Faris, MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND), who caught a break and is on the scene in Flint's sardine stricken town when his new machine launches itself into the stratosphere and starts making it rain food. Sam is very excited by this astronomical development. But on Flint's other side is his father, Tim (James Caan), who only wants his son to stop these ridiculous experiments and get into the family bait and tackle business.As Flint's machine begins raining down watermelons instead of water, the people of Flint's town become enamored with their new whiz kid and the world's interest in their little corner of the globe. This includes town Mayor Shelbourne (Bruce Campbell, SPIDERMAN 3) who's gluttonous nature (in both food and fame) lead not just their own town, but nearly the entire planet, into ruin. Flint's machine goes into overload mode when too much is asked of it and, in fact, it begins to resemble features we've seen in various science fiction films. Remember the egg layer in ALIENS? Make sure you look at the machine whenever Flint and his crew catch up to it toward the end of the film. And sentient food that plans to destroy its maker? Foodinator! (Ahem... I mean Terminator). And remember the first STAR TREK motion picture with V-GER? How the Enterprise had to go through layers of V-GER's outer 'ship' in order to reach its core? Keep an eye out for those similarities, too.So the film has a few extra bangs for fans that pay attention. But even if you don't, it'll still be very entertaining. And it won't be shoving poli-sci junk down your throat, which ought to at least please a few of us on news media overload.",9,1,2,4 February 2010
Children of Men," Hits You Deep Down
","After watching CHILDREN OF MEN, a very strange thing happened to me in the twenty-four hours since seeing it: I'm actually growing to appreciate the film more and more every minute. That's a distinct strength of this film over others that are trying to crowd it out for your almighty box-office buck. There's no instant gratification, no sex/nudity just for their own sake, no violence for the sake of violence (although there's plenty in here, it's just threaded into the story exceptionally well).Based on P.D. James' novel by the same name, Children of Men focuses on the death of birth in the year 2027. That is, the sudden and unexplained infertility of all women (and possibly men). Birth rates rapidly hit the zero mark, playgrounds fall into ruin, and mankind decides that war is the only answer. This is an interesting paradox as the premise is on the fact that men will fight over anything, including the death of life. Some sort of inherent gene is sparked in mankind whenever a perceived loss is fixated upon (democracy, oil, land, etc.), and when children disappear from that equation, it's time to pull out the gun. This isn't stated specifically in the film, per se, except for once when Theo (Clive Owen, the main character) and Miriam (Pam Ferris, a nurse) are looking out at a defunct swing-set and Miriam comments on how much the world misses the sound of children. 'We never knew how much we'd miss that sound,' she says. And so the loss is given mention just this once, but is 'felt' throughout the movie.But all is not gloom and doom. Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) is the only pregnant woman on the planet and is hidden away by an underground network of freedom fighters who's main goal is to try and gain rights for illegal aliens in Great Britain (many nations have closed their borders in order to prevent the spread of any possible infection that might be causing the infertility). Julian (Julianne Moore) is the leader of these fighters and approaches Theo in order to obtain traveling papers for Kee (Theo having family that can access to such things). Initially Theo refuses, but money enters into it as does Theo's own curiosity toward Julian (they were once married and had a child who'd died during a flu pandemic). Initially Theo is unaware of Kee's pregnancy, too, and once he learns of it you can see on his face the sense of importance that this new life might bring to mankind. Theo plods on through war-torn streets, pulling Kee along with him in an attempt to make it to 'The Human Project.' This project is never fully explained but enough clues are dropped to infer that this is the one place where babies might be born. Kee and Theo must make it to a ship off the coast of Britain in order to secures Kee's safe passage. But death lurks around every corner for Theo, Kee, and her baby. Everyone who comes into contact with this trio eventually dies off, denoting the need for death in order for new life to spring forth. From Michael Cain's pot-smoking persona as Theo's oldest friend, to Julianne Moore's forced martyrdom, no one seems able to escape the clutches of death that surround Kee and this unborn child. Maybe even Theo, our main character.The biggest strength of the film is the screenplay. It seems to have been very well thought out, letting the audience run through the film with the characters rather than forcibly monologuing information to us. The acting is good and the stark city streets are achingly morbid in appearance (shot using lots of gray color), giving the viewer the ability to see and feel humanity's decline.As stated earlier, this isn't your instant gratification-style flick that'll have you applauding at the end. It hits the watcher deep down on a visceral and subconscious level, an appreciative ember that'll grow the further away one gets from the theater.",9,13,26,9 January 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Fear ...it's what's for dinner
","It was with great joy that I finally got to see GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK today. This is film-making and tension at its best. Although there's no bloodshed or external battles, the strain of what was going on during the McCarthy hearings in the 50's is palpable in George Clooney's excellent script.Not having been born until years later, I only remember my parents commenting on how disgraceful the nation felt for letting a bully push around individuals and companies without due process here in the U.S. (where we pride ourselves on a system of justice!) The film is taut with dangerous choices that could have very well ended the careers of thousands of people at CBS. Edward R. Murrow (played beautifully by David Strathairn) pulls off the performance of a lifetime by using every mannerism ever noted in Murrow's early television career. The close-up facial shots were excellent and added tension to the film without any musical score (music is only used as a kind of introduction to different segments of the story but sung in low jazz tones by legendary singer Dianne Reeves). The use of black and white film adds an extra sense of the time period and allowed George Clooney and company to meld together stock footage of McCarthy and other Senators in a very seamless fashion.It is noteworthy to point out that fear was the prime method that allowed McCarthy to continue his ridiculous claims of communist infiltration into the United States (people feared the communists because of the nuclear threat and because they felt that the communists would overrun our beloved country ....boy, does this sound familiar. Are we still in the 1950s? Hmm. Is George Bush and company allowed to get away with lots of things because of the fear of bombings, religious fundamentalists, and those who disagree with America?) The 'you're either with us or against us' mentality is easily focused on in the film by allowing Senator McCarthy to play and hang himself. If you were against McCarthy, you were a communist or, at the very least, a communist sympathizer (watching him attack Murrow as a communist was ridiculous).It's funny to read the mind-numbing reviews of individuals here at Amazon.com who think that there WERE communists in high places within our government. And they still believe it! Even after the fall of communism in the USSR. Grow up gang. It's the 21st century. The only thing we need fear is not questioning our leaders, and this movie is a nice reawakening to that thought.",9,1,2,8 January 2006
Clash of the Titans," Release The Crappen!
","And once again Hollywood proves it has run out of original ideas. Why else would they remake this movie? Back in 1981, when special effects were beginning to take serious root in films, we had the original CLASH OF THE TITANS. It had some cheesy claymation mixed with some less cheesy special effects. But it did have a story. A damn good one. Sure there were action sequences, especially when Perseus (Harry Hamlin) met up with Medusa. But these action scenes were barely a few minutes long. The story of the gods, how they felt about humanity (and how humanity felt about them) dominated the storyline. Yes, there was an ACTUAL story.Fast forward to 2010 and you get this ...this ...this mess-of-a-remake that relies almost solely on CGI and, well, basically nothing else.The brief understanding of the god/human relationship is thrust aside in favor of action scenes galore which have squat to do with the story. There are so many throwaway characters as to be laughable. And 3-D? For marketing purposes only. Save yourself some cash and see it in 2-D ...if at all.My son went with me to see it (he's as much of a movie junky as I am) and we both nearly fell asleep for lack of anything approaching a viable understanding of who was carrying the storyline. We still ask each other, 'What was the point, again?' Sam Worthington seems to be a hot commodity in today's movie market. TERMINATOR SALVATION and AVATAR are two of his more recent accomplishment. And although I found those two to be lukewarm in terms of story, they at least kept me engaged enough not to yawn. And Liam Neeson has also been splattered all over film posters (from TAKEN to KINGDOM OF HEAVEN). But a god? And Zeus for that matter? Not the best casting choice. He just didn't have the presence I was expecting. Perhaps the story (or lack thereof) stifled his performance. Probably.I also MUST caution women against seeing this if they enjoyed the strong roles in the 1981 original. You'll find no such comparisons here. There's really no good female character to be found. The closest was Alexa Davalos (DEFIANCE) as Perseus' love interest, Andromeda. But her role is so laughably short and misunderstood that you won't care what happens to her (and things do happen).My final word of caution comes to those of us (all of us) struggling in today's economy. We need our escapism, and sometimes (occasionally) Hollywood allows us to have it. But not here. You might as well sit on the toilet and release the crappen!",1,86,125,11 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," Less Is More
","I'm sure most of us have heard the term 'less is more.' Alfred Hitchcock helped bring this term to fruition by keeping the forces of evil hidden from us, but obviously with us, near us, and trying desperately to get in.First time writer/director and renaissance film-make Oren Peli took the 'less is more' to heart and decided to do his own version of a Blair Witch Project, but with much greater success in my book.I am not an easily spooked guy. And I've seen my share of horror films that did absolutely nothing for me. Although some of them I still love, they didn't give me goosebumps. One of my favorites, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956), was creepy and it made me think, but it never made me jump in my seat. The same could not be said for PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. It is, without a doubt, a true minimalist horror film that strikes at the heart of our psyche. And when I say 'minimalist', I mean minimal. Made for roughly $15,000, it's first week out in theaters it grossed over $9 million. I can't even imagine how many tens-of-millions its made now that its out on DVD. Peli took the minimalist approach on time, too, as the entire film runs only 86 minutes. And they filmed it all in ten days. And in Peli's own house! The best thing about the film is that it gradually builds tension, never letting us in on what it is that's stalking Katie. This unknown is frustratingly freakish, and we can really feel the stress Katie and her boyfriend Micah are under as they lose sleep, hear doors slam, see footprints appear out of nowhere, and helplessly watch as more and more 'things' begin happening to them.Those who hate the hand-held camera movements of The Blair Witch Project and CLOVERFIELD, will want to avoid this one, as it, too, uses a hand-held. But if you love to feel your heart beat faster, your breathing speed up, and to cover your eyes when you know something really bad is about to happen, then by all means please watch this.I heard rumor that a sequel is in the making. Hmm. Let's hope they don't ruin a good thing by trying to make a big budget block-buster with M. Night.Let the shrieking commence.",10,3,6,11 June 2010
World Trade Center," Little Grist For The Milieu
","When most movie-goers think of Oliver Stone, they usually think of cutting edge (Born on the Fourth of July), or visceral film-making (Natural Born Killers), or even historically disturbing cinema (The Doors). But few  if any  would consider Stone schmaltzy or an opportunist. Watching WORLD TRADE CENTER, though, one can't help but feel a touch of the latter and a significant amount of the former.UNITED 93 was similar in that it took the recent horrific events of 9/11 and reintroduced Americans' fears to that awful day. It utilized (for better or worse) those feelings we all have and made money off of it. This isn't as terrible as it sounds, though. Cinema has been doing this for as long as celluloid has been running through projectors, but never has the filming been so close to the actual date of the events (or at least rarely).One can't help but think that Stone must've been desperate for film material or somehow felt closely connected to the events that day. Either way, the script (although based on actual events) was lackluster at best. There are just a few exceptions that we'll cover in a moment.This is the (true) story of the port authority police officers that responded to the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11, and is specific to the two men from the port authority who were trapped and later rescued from under the rubble. Nicholas Cage (National Treasure) stars as John McLoughlin, a gruff Sergeant who was around during the first bombings on the trade centers several years earlier. His entrapped fellow officer is rookie Will Jimeno played by Michael Pena (Crash), a family man with a new baby on the way. Both men have to deal with their isolation and near certain demise as they lay pinned and stranded only a few feet from one another. The story jumps between the rubble strewn men, their wives and families, and a retired marine who feels the call of duty after the attacks and risks his life to find survivors in the buildings' wreckage (the schmaltzy portions are firmly entrenched here as we're spoonfed everyone's tearful response to that terrible day).It is this 'marine' that most might have the biggest trouble with script-wise. He seemed almost inserted into the story to give some grist to an otherwise empty milieu. His need for 'revenge' felt hollow amidst so much emotion. And although this may be 'the way it was,' it didn't translate well to film.Interestingly, Nicholas Cage gives an admirable performance even though he's not jumping into and out of danger, or battling evil-doers with deadly weapons. He's confined as is co-star Pena and their concern for one another is touching, as is their concern for what will happen to their families as they lay thinking/dreaming about them (these were some of the best parts of the screenplay but only a small portion of the whole).The most powerful part of the film was its sound editing. When the buildings collapsed and then later continued to creak and groan, they took on an ominous characteristic that brooded poorly for our two main characters and gave movie-watchers a great sense of dread.But when the sound becomes the most impressive part of a film, there's more problems than applause.",4,0,3,27 December 2006
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," An Inch Just Ain't Enough
","Hedwig Robinson (John Cameron Mitchell) is a rocker. And she's got The Angry Inch beside her (and in her pants). As a young man, Hansel/Hedwig lived in East Berlin, right before The Wall came tumbling down. His sexual identity was always in question and when a cute, black, American soldier gives him a way out of the Eastern Bloc, Hedwig jumps on him (literally and figuratively). But he can't get to the other side of The Wall as a man, so an operation takes place to remove his vital functions below the waist ...if you get my meaning. Needless to say (if you pay attention to the title of the film), the surgery gets botched and leaves Hedwig with his 'Angry Inch.' The anger is twofold. First is the failed operation; second is Hedwig's fury over stolen musical material by someone named Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt). Tommy is a rock-n-roll sensation, but it's all because of what Hedwig taught him in his early days. So Hedwig, in true bitchy fashion, follows Tommy's rock tour around the world. But instead of playing in theaters and high end places, Hedwig and his Angry Inch band play at lowbrow restaurants, often to the dismay of its patrons who've simply come in to eat.Hedwig's decline into obscurity is well played by director/actor John Cameron Mitchell. The musical soundtrack is very well done and the catchy tunes will have most movie watchers tapping their toes along to the rockin' beats. That he also remains angry at some of his band members is quite funny, actually holding them hostage by keeping their passports hidden away.Revenge is the meal of the day as Hedwig finally meets up with Tommy again, eventually leading to Tommy's career demise and launching Hedwig into the spotlight. But is this what Hedwig really wanted? Not realizing the sacrifices she'd have to make, Hedwig decides to re-open her/his closet and show the world his/her true identity. He also sets free one of his band members who turns out to be a woman masquerading as a man, too.Those willing to watch a film without sitting in judgement of the material will most likely eat this story up. It's quite funny, well acted, and has a rippingly good soundtrack. But if you're a staunch conservative or  god forbid  homophobic, you might want to pass on this one.",8,0,1,29 March 2007
The Dark Knight," Did Ledger Deserve All The Accolades? Oh yes!
","Batman is back. And so is director Christoperh Nolan who directed the amazing BATMAN BEGINS. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's previous Batman film, I felt confident he'd never be able to surpass it. I was horribly wrong.The dark sets. The amazing acting (with one exception). The wonderful dialogue. It was a sheer joy to watch. And the fact that it was 152 minutes long didn't bother me in the slightest. The action was practically nonstop with enough plot twists, explosions, and funny lines to make one cringe and laugh at the same time.The big question, though, on many people's minds (including my own before I watched it) was 'Is Heath Ledger's performance that good or are the critics just being nice after Ledger's unfortunate death?' Hollywood has a history of doing this where they honor someone for an achievement that really wasn't deserved, but they felt sorry for the performer's family, etc. and decided to throw them a bone by overly-praising a performance or a life that wasn't particularly notable. I was concerned that this might be the case for Ledger's Joker. But my worries were immediately stripped away as soon as The Joker made his appearance. Creepy. Funny. Line delivery that'll blow your mind ('See, I'm not a monster...I'm just ahead of the curve.'). Ledger's performance put all others in his shadow (yes that includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman).Christian Bale (3:10 TO YUMA) has now become synonymous with what Batman means to movie-goers and comic book fans alike. He plays the cocky, rich, and uncompromising Bruce Wayne with the perfect amount of grace and toughness the role deserves. The only downside is his heavily whispered Batman voice that grates on the nerves after a short while.Michael Caine (CHILDREN OF MEN) and Gary Oldman (HARRY POTTER) reprise their roles and do so with the talent we've all come to expect from these two fine actors. Morgan Freeman (GONE BABY GONE) returns as Lucius Fox, Batman's weapons designer and conscious. Although not particularly riveting, his performance did help move the plot along.An addition to the cast was introduced with the arrival of Harvey Dent/Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart, CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN). Exquisitely incorporated into the story, the uncovering of Two-Face's origins is masterfully pulled into the story and given ample screen time.The only less-than-stellar performance came from Maggie Gyllenhaal (STRANGER THAN FICITON) who replaced Katie Holmes (FIRST DAUGHTER) in the role of Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's love interest. Although no fan of Katie Holmes, I found Gyllenhaal's performance to be relatively unmoving in comparison to the rest of the cast. That's probably not a knock against Gyllenhaal considering the entire production held some of the strongest roles I've seen this year. But no one came close to Ledger and his wonderful performance, least of all Gyllenhaal.If you're looking for the action film of the year with one of the best performances by an actor that is no longer with us, The Dark Knight is the ticket. No Jokin'.",9,5,11,24 July 2008
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Disneyfied ...But One Of The Better Golf Movies Out There
","Watching a movie about a kid's struggle to play golf I'd assumed would be about as appealing as sticking hot needles in my eyes. But I'd heard a few good things about THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED and found out that it was directed by Bill Paxton (ALIENS, 1986) so decided to give it a go. I ordered it from my online rental company and, to my additional horror once it arrived, discovered that it was a Disney film. Oh Lord, nooo! Not having anything else to watch, I swallowed my Mouseketeer bile and slid it into my DVD player.Well, it ain't too bad. Shia Le Beouf stars as 20-year-old Francis Ouimet, the historically amazing young man who had a knack for the game of golf and beat out two 'veteran' British players (Harry Vardon and Ted Ray) for the U.S. Open, and did so using a preteen caddy with a loud personality but a love of the game.There have been a lot of films made featuring golf at their cores and I've seen many of them. TIN CUP was probably my favorite. HAPPY GILMORE was funny but in a gruff, teenage sort of way. CADDYSHACK: 'nough said. THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE was modestly entertaining. And now we have THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED. Being 'Disneyfied' the film takes this historical golfing event and puts a gushing feel-good face on it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; just something you might want to brace yourself for. Francis is at odds with his father, who believes that golf is a waste of time and is outside their class. Francis and his family aren't wealthy and struggle to get by. So the tensions get moved up a few notches as Francis and his father find themselves in the middle of a generation gap. There's a love interest in a woman who's waaaay beyond Francis' means. And there's the growing attraction of the down-and-out toward Francis as they read about his success in the papers during the pre-depression times.The acting was okay. Nothing outstanding with the exception of Francis' little caddy, Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND) who steals almost every scene he's in.What made this film a success was how it was filmed. Cameras perched on top of golf balls as they're hit. Special effects that make the crowds vanish and leave the golfer all alone on the fairway with nothing between him and the green. The slow-motion swings of these men and how clean they were. That's what really helped move this flick along and didn't linger on putts, bad lays, or other golfing intricacies that easily could put many watchers to sleep.If you're a Disney fan you'll probably fall on your knees and give praise to such a high quality film. And even if you're not a big bolster of the Mouse Man, you might find this to be a relative gem amongst their more overly-sweet works.",6,1,2,1 July 2006
Into the Wild," Leaves It To You To Decide...
","At first, I wasn't sure how to feel about INTO THE WILD. I'd read the book a few years ago and enjoyed it, but it left me feeling a bit bitter about someone as privileged as Chris McCandless (the main character/person in Jon Krakauer's nonfiction novel by the same name) who shuns his upper echelon possibilities after graduating from Emory and disappears into America, leading the free life of a moneyless vagabond.Certainly we've all thought about what it would be like to be completely unencumbered by the shackles of 'things.' No cars. No mortgages/rent. Nothing but the open road and endless options spreading out before us. And this is what makes us care for Chris McCandless, the unfortunate (and very misguided) young man who's fate is tied to his own ignorance of what that kind of life entails.If you speak to anyone from Alaska, most will tell you what an idiot McCandless was. He went into the wild with only a backpack and a rifle, supposedly 'ready' to live the life of a hermit on a decrepit and abandoned school bus. The Alaskan wilderness (or any comparable wilderness really) is unforgiving. If you aren't prepared, you're going to die. And McCandless, with his lofty dreams of wildlife living, was ill-prepared in the extreme; his life cut short due to his own ignorance.So why the high rating, you may ask? Well, I'm not here to support or degrade what McCandless did or didn't do. I'm here to rate the film, and on that, you can't help but appreciate what director Sean Penn has given us. Showing McCandless' strengths and weaknesses, Penn guides us through the life of Chris without telling us how to feel about it. Actor Emile Hirsch pulls in an extremely powerful performance as Chris McCandless. The fact that the Academy didn't recognize him is a shame; they did note Hal Holbrook's supporting actor performance (which was damn good), but a far cry from Hirsch's awesome job (he lost 40 lbs during the filming so that he could show McCandless' starvation). Penn's screen writing and directing are flat-out amazing, giving us a story that allows the viewer to make his or her own judgements about this very enigmatic young man.I feel compelled to mention that some may compare McCandless' actions with those of another dead Alaskan visitor, Timothy Treadwell of the nonfiction film GRIZZLY MAN. Although both certainly had their failings, Treadwell was definitely mentally ill, while McCandless simply seems to lack life goals and instead substitutes vagrancy in order to run away from problems back home.In the end, I finally came to the conclusion that Penn did exactly what all great film makers do: he gave us a story that many people probably would've found pretentious and plopped into our laps without any filters or rose-coloring. That put the burden on the audience to come to terms with what McCandless' life really meant. Fool? Free-Spirit? Ignorant preppie? Loving brother? Easy-going drifter? Or perhaps a mesh of many of those.You decide.",10,1,4,11 March 2008
Green Street Hooligans," Crimson-Fisted Football Fans
","Violence for the sake of violence is probably one of the most unappealing things most people can think of. But other forms of violence are often just as suspect. To war over ones religious beliefs, cultural differences, or natural resources is just as insidious. So try to imagine fighting over ...nothing. Well, maybe not nothing. Perhaps your pride was at stake. Is that worth beating your fellow man over the head with a blunt object? This will be the toughest thing to understand when watching GREEN STREET HOOLIGANS.Matt Buckner (Elijah Wood, LORD OF THE RINGS series) just got kicked out of Harvard. He was only two months shy of graduating with a degree in journalism when drugs were found in his university apartment. But Matt shared the place with another roommate who'd been hiding his drugs within Matt's closet. And this roommate belongs to a powerful family (the Van Holden's). His roommate promises to give Matt a job if he just holds out for a little while. So Matt, being a bit of a scrawny weakling, accepts his disgrace and leaves Harvard (it should also be noted that Matt had little chance of beating the wrap even if he notified the appropriate authorities because of how powerful the Van Holden's were).Matt flees to his sister's house in England where he tries to hide his shame from his journalist father, too. And an accidental run-in with a football (don't call it soccer!) fanatic will alter Matt's life forever. Pete Dunham (Charlie Hunnam, NICHOLAS NICKLEBY) is this football fan who heads a group of hooligans on Green Street. They have what they call 'A Firm' which, in reality, is nothing more than a gang of thugs parading around as local football devotees. When games are played at home or on another team's turf, the Green Street Hooligans are there, mocking the opposing team's 'Firm', thus igniting bloody-fisted brawls. The winner of said brawls receives pride points as word of their successes spread from Firm to Firm. Matt becomes one of the Green Street gang and learns to strengthen his knuckles as well as his pride. As the blood spews (and there's crimson-o-plenty), Matt falls deeper and deeper under violence's spell.It takes a bitter fight to free Matt from the Hooligans' clutches, and he heads back to America where he finally confronts his old Harvard roommate with the drug problem. But now Matt isn't afraid. His mind is sharp and his fists scarred. His hallelujah moment arrives just as expected.Although predictable too, the ending is a righteous event. Elijah Wood pulls in an excellent performance as a completely believable wuss who eventually turns his life around via questionable tactics. This is what gives the film its positive rating, too.The tough pill to swallow is the extreme violence that gushes across the screen and the all important 'why'. Why do they fight like this over seemingly nothing? Part of it is a sense of belonging. To anything. Even if that 'anything' is beating on someone's face whom you know nothing about.The reality is that there ARE things like this out there (just read the newspapers about football fans brawling in parking lots, or little league parents beating up umpires for bad calls), which is why you'll see positive reviews of Green Street Hooligans. But that doesn't make this any less a sad statement. But a statement isn't why we're here. We're here to see if the film was entertaining, and it most certainly was. But separating the message from the entertainment may be too difficult for some viewers.",6,1,1,7 December 2006
Blood Diamond," DiCaprio Has Earned His Chops
","Not being a very big Leonardo DiCaprio fan in the past, this year I've had a growing amount of respect for this young man as he proves his acting chops again and again. First it was within the excellent Scorsese film THE DEPARTED, and now he does another great job in BLOOD DIAMOND.For some reason, this film stands out above The Departed for me. Where the Departed had an ensemble cast, Blood Diamond can make no such claim (although there is a sprinkling of well-knowns). Many African actors lend their previously hidden talents to the film, giving it a bit more authenticity than The Departed. Most notably among them is the buffed Djimon Hounsou (AMISTAD), a quiet man living in a quiet village that is torn apart by rebel fighters trying for a piece of the region's diamond trade. Djimon plays the smart and tough Solomon as he races to find his family and his son. After being imprisoned via slave labor by the rebels, Solomon finds a huge, rare, pink diamond and quickly buries it. Having been seen with the diamond, the rebel leader tries to hunt him down.In the meantime, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio, THE DEPARTED), a young opportunist from South Africa, is completely immersed in the illegal diamond trade. He runs into Maddy (Jennifer Connelly, DARK WATER), an attractive journalist from The States who infuses Danny with a sense of morality. Uncomfortable around Maddy, yet still attracted to her physically and emotionally, Danny sets out to find if the rumor he's been hearing about the large, pink diamond are true. He meets up with Solomon and the two form a tenuous bond; Danny wants the diamond so that he can escape Africa and thus his past, while Solomon sees it as a way to possibly save his missing son who's been captured and brainwashed by the rebels.As Maddy's views of right and wrong spin Danny on his head, and Solomon's race to find his son sparks memories of his father, Danny's not only in for a physical battle, but one that'll force him to deal with his own immoral and prejudicial history.Part nonfiction, part fiction, Blood Diamond forces the viewer to realize that the rocks they wear on their fingers may have come at a very bloody cost. The movie spares nothing to get its message across; there are children being dismembered, children carrying guns and spraying bullets onto innocent villagers, torture, explosive governmental flaws, and it's all surrounded by one terrible little stone: the diamond.A very compelling film with DiCaprio dominating the screen (and rightfully so). His South African accent was spot-on and his internal battles of right and wrong are pulled off effortlessly.This one's a must.",10,0,0,28 March 2007
Pride & Prejudice," A Good (Not Great) Adaptation
","Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice has been translated to film several times now  from Robert Leonard's 1940 'attempt' starring Laurence Olivier, to the 1980 and 1995 TV miniseries', and now on to a new theatrical release here. Having read the book and seen all of these adaptations, I feel I can comment objectively on what does and doesn't work with regards to director Joe Wright's newest version.Let's start with the positives. It's beautifully filmed (from gnarled old trees to stunning sunsets against old English mansions) and the cast performs well. I even liked Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods, FOYLE'S WAR TV series) and the rest of the actors. They seemed to be able to grasp the internal dynamics of their respective characters and pulled in fine performances. Keira Knightley (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, 2002) does a good job as Lizzie Bennett but appears upbeat far too often during a time when love and loss went hand in hand. Matthew Macfayden (WUTHERING HEIGHTS TV series) does an admirable Mr. Darcy but being up against a giant of the English acting world from a previous adaptation made his character representation a bit tougher when it came to comparisons.Now let's get into my main problem: the pacing. I usually don't mind fast-paced films, but Jane Austen's book is anything but quick (checking in at around 500 pages depending on which publisher you choose). Books of this size tend to be difficult to translate to the silver screen (or TV) because of their scope, and this was the big 'ouch' for this film. Clocking in at 129 minutes, condensing the book in such a drastic manner meant clipping out chapters and causing a bit of confusion. The confusion comes from the lack of understanding a new viewer might have IF they've never seen any of the previous TV/movie versions or IF they've never read the novel. When Lydia runs off with 'the wrong man' it is a vital portion of the story that is only touched on and could seem disorienting to the new Pride and Prejudice viewer. We never see what happens to Lydia in London, nor do we see the wedding and where Mr. Darcy's pressure exerts itself.Comparisons will obviously be made between this theatrical release and the 1995 miniseries (which many, including myself, feel is the penultimate adaptation of Mrs. Austen's book). Some might complain that it isn't fair to make such comparisons because one was designed for television while the other was meant for theater. I'll grant that. But with the lengthy films that've come out of Hollywood lately (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, etc.), I don't feel that this new version would've suffered in the slightest by lengthening its running time and thus adding a better sense of coherency to many of the side stories. The 1995 miniseries also had an incredible benefit in that Mr. Darcy was played by the estimable Colin Firth (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, 1998), and it is THIS Mr. Darcy that many hold as the high standard for such work. Try putting Matthew Macfayden up against Mr. Firth and you'll see what I mean; there's just no comparing them.I did give this film a positive review because a) I liked the cinematography, and b) the acting was generally well done. But for emotional impact and excellent character portrayals look to the 1995 miniseries.",7,1,3,20 April 2006
The World's Fastest Indian," A Man And His Dream Are Nothing To Mess Around With
","The World's Fastest Indian is NOT a Native American. I was naive enough (when I first saw the title) to believe this might be about that. Oh well. Even so, I wasn't disappointed. Indeed, I was educated. Never having heard of the astounding accomplishment of this aged New Zealander, I now feel honored to have been privy to a man of unique stamina and determination.Burt Monro is this manone of indeterminate age but obviously old enough to collect his pensionand has been working on his 1920 Indian motorcycle for four decades. His goal is to make it go faster ...and faster ...and faster. But his methods appear substandard. He works (and lives) in a shed without appropriate casting material. His gas cap is a whiskey cork, his brakes non-existent. But Burt has a dream. He wants to set a land-speed record in Bonneville, Utah at the salt flats. Thus our journey begins. But getting from New Zealand to the U.S. is costly and Burt doesn't have much money. So we watch him struggle with finances and dilapidated equipment in order to make his dream a reality. Once in the States, Burt befriends everyone he meets with his easy-going manner and his dogged determination. He runs into crooked car salesmen and horny older women (Burt is somewhat of a 'hound-dog' himself). But through it all, regardless of where he stops, he has the underlying need to keep moving toward Bonneville. And, finally, he makes it there ...only to be told that he should've registered months ago and can't participate in the speed ceremonies. Crushed beyond words, Burt musters the support of the local speed freaks and finally gets his day on the salt.And, much to the surprise of the officials (who thought he'd crash and burn or maybe hit 100 miles per hour), Burt accomplishes the impossible: a new land speed record! At one point, his Little-Indian-That-Could went over 200 mph! This is an extremely entertaining film for two basic reasons. First is because it's a human interest story that everyone can identify with: going after your dreams regardless of what others say or how old you are. The second is because of Sir Anthony Hopkins. His performance was the fuel that drove this film. His mannerisms and accent fit Burt Monro's to a tee (you'll discover this if you watch a few of the DVD's extra features).There were a few blips and bumps in the film (the rapid telling of a relationship with a woman in the U.S. which felt forced for time, etc.), but these were easily overlooked by Mr. Hopkins performance and the incredible story. My hat's off to director Roger Donaldson. His passion for Mr. Monro (and this material) shone through like sun on a silver platter. Nicely done!",8,0,0,9 July 2006
Avatar," Dances With Pandorans
","AVATAR is a visual feast. And at an estimated $280 million to make, it had better be. James Cameron, best known for spending as much money as he can on a project (see TITANIC and his other flicks that have given him the nickname 'The $200 million dollar man'), leads the way again as writer/director. And with him comes Aussie actor Sam Worthington who also starred in Cameron's TERMINATOR SALVATION film.As stated at the beginning, this is a highly stylized, visual film that has 3-D effects galore. You feel like you're riding on the back of some faraway creature as it dives through clouds, brushes the forest tops, and skims floating cliff faces. It is THIS that gives most, if not all, of the film's entertainment punch. If you didn't see it in 3-D, then you're missing out on the best part of the movie.But where the film falls down is its story. This film is basically a rip-off of two ideas: DANCES WITH WOLVES and Frank Herbert's lesser known Pandora series of books. In fact, Wes Studi, who starred in Dances With Wolves as a tough Pawnee Indian, holds a similar role here in Avatar as the roughshod Eytukan. Granted, this is a space epic, but the transfer of ideas from Dances With Wolves still holds very true: A white man comes into native country, battles with them, learns to respect them, switches allegiances, helps save the natives from complete annihilation. This is pure Dances With Wolves.As far as Frank Herbert's Pandora series goes, there's quite a few similarities. The first big one is the planet. In both Frank's and Cameron's universes, the planet is called Pandora. Nothing to get in a fuss about since the mythology of Pandora is well known since the time of the early Greeks. But where the similarities merge is with the planet itself. In both universes, the planet is alive. Literally. And this living force has a name. On Frank Herbert's Pandora, it is a life force known as Avata (hmmm, that sounds familiar too). On Cameron's Pandora, it is known as Eywa. Both planets are hostile to humans but are valuable in their own way (for Frank Herbert is was the expansion of humanity, and for James Cameron a rich mineral source).So for those out there that are touting how 'original' this is, I think you just haven't remembered (or weren't around) when actor/director Kevin Costner filmed his western epic and/or haven't read Frank Herbert's Pandora series (starting with Destination: Void and going through The Ascension Factor).All this being said, Avatar is entertaining. It has that big-screen appeal and escapism that so many movie-goers pine for. And it has some of the best visual effects you'll ever see. But just don't tell me it's 'original.'",7,0,3,5 January 2010
Invictus," A Political Sports Film? Who Would Have Thought!
","It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul. These words, this verse of the poem by William Ernest Hensley in 1875, was the mantra of Nelson Mandela during his imprisonment in South Africa. He refused to give in to hate. He refused to give in to revenge. But how do you pull along an entire country with you? Especially a country as racially divisive as South Africa where Apartheid was a part of the landscape and politics for nearly 50 years?Risking everything, Mandela achieved greatness by focusing not on politics, but on a sport: Rugby. Wanting to win the World Cup and thus unite a country, Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freman, WANTED) sets out not to divide and conquer, but to unite and calm the racial tensions raging through his beloved South Africa. With him, Mandela must convince Rugby captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon, THE DEPARTED) that their poorly performing team can do the impossible: win the World Cup.As most of us now know, that is precisely what happens, and South Africa, for a while, forgets her bloody black-and-white past and turns everyone flush with excitement for simply being South African. Clint Eastwood has proved in his waning years that he should remain (mostly) behind the camera and not in front of it. With the exception of GRAN TORINO, I've not been much of a fan of his as of late. However, when it comes to his directing chops, I've been fairly well pleased. Probably my favorite acted/directed Clint film would be the lesser known HEARTBREAK RIDGE. But that might just be me. Many have already said that this was 'the role Morgan Freeman was meant to play,' and I won't contradict that. He was completely believable as Mandela, getting the look, verbal cadence and movements of The Great Man down perfectly. Matt Damon on the other hand ...didn't really strike me as the bullish and larger-than-life Francois. Although I think he did 'okay.' I believe that a search for a more stylized actor could've easily resulted in a match more adequate to the part. Regardless, the filming is enthralling because of Freeman's performance and the fact-based situations that this movie is based upon. For those looking for a sports film in-line with HOOSIERS, ROCKY or RUDY, you might want to look elsewhere. For those with an interest in human history and how politics can sometimes take a dive toward the goal line, this one will run straight at you.",8,0,0,17 July 2010
Up," The Human Element Makes Animation Watchable...
","Many people disagree with me about this, but I'm sticking to my guns because of the level of enjoyment I received from these films. The disagreement is that WALL-E was some sort of exceptional film and THE INCREDIBLES was only so-so. I had the exact opposite experience. I found WALL-E to be so-so and The Incredibles to be a wonderful film because of the human element attached to it. Also, both The Incredibles and this film, UP, had a PG rating and not a G, which might mean that deeper, perhaps disturbing things, made this film carry more emotional weight. And it most certainly does.Edward Asner plays Carl Fredricksen, a man who's loved and lost. Yes, we ACTUALLY get to see an old person pass away at the end of their life ...in an animated feature. Imagine that. Reality. This gives Up more bite and we empathize with Carl on a very basic human level. Whereas with Wall-E, we're trying to gain empathy for a machine that's acting like a human. Not the same thing.Into Carl's lonely life comes wannabe boy scout Russell (Jordan Nagai), who's trying to earn a merit badge. But Carl wants none of his help, nor does he want to help Russell gain the badge.Amidst Carl's life is his understanding that his now dead wife Ellie never got to have any adventures. She married Carl and bought a home, which took over their lives and made them home-bodies. They both grew up worshipping adventurer Charles Muntz and wanting to go and find out what happened to him. But Ellie never made it. So, when Carl's house is being threatened by developers and his life steered toward Shady Oaks retirement facility, Carl attaches a mass of helium balloons to his house and floats away. Trouble is, that pesky boy scout is on-board, too.Eventually they make their way to South America and discover dangers, foes, friends, and, yes, adventure. Talking dogs with an obsession for squirrels add a high amount of hilarity to several scenes, as does a unique bird that befriends Russell and loves chocolate.More telling is the friendship that blossoms between Russell and Carl as the generation gap closes, and Carl learns to open his heart (and mind) to new experiences. Also learning to let go of Ellie's memory adds an incredibly deep plot-line to an amazing story.The animation, like most 3-D style animations, is impressive. The colors, shadows, and depth made the scenes come alive. But it's the story that makes it all worthwhile. Just like The Incredibles, this is a tale about human beings doing unique things but with regular challenges and mental hurdles. It is this that drives me to see complex animated films, not a robot .",9,0,1,24 January 2010
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Stangers In Their Native Lands
","THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY is about on-par in the UK as the troubles the US has accepting its treatment of Native Americans. Mother England has calloused hands, and it's not all from hard work; some of it is from taking up arms against neighbors and suppressing democracy in favor of holding a death-grip on the finances of other countries. Which brings us to the formation of the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and this film's point.Anyone with a working knowledge of history knows that northern and southern Ireland aren't exactly peaceful toward one another. And it isn't just about religion. Dating back to the 1920s and beyond, England flexed her mighty muscle over the Irish in order to keep a tight hold on its foreign provinces. The 'emerald island' suffered incredible oppression and financial destitution at the hands of UK law and its enforcing military. This divided Ireland and its inhabitants on multiple levels. Peace versus non-oppression. Catholic versus Protestant. The rich versus the poor. It is an incredibly complex situation.What this film does it put the perspective entirely on the IRA and why they became a force to be reckoned with. The story it surrounds is basically a microcosmic study which focuses on Damien (Cillian Murphy, BREAKFAST ON PLUTO), a student off to medical school but pulled up short by the atrocities he witnesses from English troops on Irish men, women, and children.Damien's brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) is already an IRA member when the film begins, and Damien's transition into their ranks is easily done. Teddy is a higher-up in the IRA and Damien is seen as second-in-command. The difficulties Damien has in turning from healing doctor-to-be, to that of a war-hardened killer are excellently filmed. The love between Damien and his brother is fraught with peril as the two eventually find themselves on opposite sides after the ratification of a peace treaty. Damien's descent into questionable morals (enabled by his brother) are handled very well by director Ken Loach who has an eye for panoramic vistas littered with fields of barley.The barley is important to the film if a bit too obscure for most watchers. The title implies a 19th century poem by Robert D. Joyce in which young men fighting for Irish independence in 1798 would carry barley strands in their pockets. When they were killed, their bodies were buried and from there a barley patch would later emerge. With all of the barley sprouts visible around Ireland, there's little doubt how many young men died.Although pretty lopsided as far as historical recountings go, the story of a young man's dedication to his country, his brother, and his own damaged morality are something rarely seen in a short 127 minute film. Most of the time it would take years of filming documentary material to get this sense across to an audience. But The Wind That Shakes The Barley really does shake up the watcher. Let us just hope that no more pockets need be filled with grain again.",8,1,5,25 March 2008
Inside Man," Spike Lee's Hit Came Close To A Miss
","Is INSIDE MAN supposed to be a mindlessly stimulating bank heist film? Or a thought-provoking take on urbanism, race, money, power, and history? Blending the two would've been a spectacular feat, but INSIDE MAN too often misses the mark or simply stretches credibility to the breaking point.The story starts like a basic heist flick but with a few subtle quirks. Clive Owen stars as bank robber genius Dalton Russell who takes over a bank in Manhattan, hostages and all. But why he's there is the big running question. He makes no move to dash in and out with the money, and seems content to sit and wait out the police.Enter Denzel Washington as Junior Detective Keith Frazer. Being a hostage negotiator, the detective decides to play by the book, waiting out Dalton's gang and making false promises of arriving buses and planes. But Detective Frazer soon realizes that something is amiss. Dalton is delaying everything, too. And none of the hostages have been killed, even when deadline demands come and go.Into the fray comes Christopher Plummer as Arthur Case, the banks founder. He has secrets in a safety deposit box that he'll do anything to keep secret. In rapid (and confusing) fashion, he contacts Madeline White (Jodi Foster, FLIGHTPLAN ), a woman who has contacts in high places and can usually get whatever a client wants. Bending the ear of the mayor, Ms. White gets on the inside with the police and secures a private meeting with Dalton, who quickly advises her that he's already opened Mr. Case's safety deposit box and retrieved ....Okay, I'm not going to let the cat out of the bag.Suffice to say there are good qualities about the film (thus my positive rating). The acting is spot-on perfect (from Willem Dafoe's grumpy street cop persona to Clive Owen's questionable bank robber status). Filming was exceptional with director Spike Lee incorporating the darkness inside the bank in contrast to the white masks of the hostage-takers/robbers (White masks? Hmm. Think he's trying to tell us something?) The movie's pace was satisfactory, too. It perhaps got bogged down in some of the overly-developed plot devices that were extraneous or outlandish (the cops would NEVER let a citizen  Foster  into the bank with armed suspects regardless of her contacts).There are also a lot of irritatingly undeveloped items. Most notably were Jodi Foster's character and the basis for Clive Owen's gang. There is no history surrounding Foster's character so we don't know how she got started in this business (whatever her 'business' was) nor how Christopher Plummer's character knows how to get ahold of her. Clive Owen's gang must've been some sort of modern day Nurembergers, still tracking down Nazi and Nazi sympathizers, but why and where they came from remains a mystery throughout.In recent typical Hollywood fashion, the good guys aren't so good and the bad guys are better than all. Christopher Plummer plays the dark figure we so love to see him play that it is, unfortunately, almost a cliché. Denzel is the black detective trying to advance his career while at the same time battling prejudice within his own department (another cliché?).Still, it was fun to watch. The fact that there's really no bloodshed makes this bank heist film unique by current day standards. Most have explosions with bodies flying through the air and clip after clip after clip of ammo being loosed. Not here.If you've got a few hours to kill at home, you might consider plopping this into your DVD player and checking it out. Just don't think too hard about the INSIDE MAN after it's over.",7,1,1,10 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Like The Book ...Good But Not Great
","The trouble with making a movie out of book so wildly popular as The Da Vinci Code is that we all knew (just knew!) it'd have problems. Detractors will lambaste it for the pages of the novel that had to be cast aside for the sake of film time (the movie is still 2 hours and 29 minutes, though) and any changes to characters or plots (all of which have happened.) But when you transfer a book to film, a certain amount of trust has to go to the screenwriters; a level of trust that basically says, 'Please don't screw this up! But give us a good story that'll engage film audiences!' I've read The Da Vinci Code and I must say that the book was interesting, but I felt it didn't live up to the hype surrounding it. I was continually astounded to see it on the best seller list month after month after month. I kept asking myself, 'Did I miss something? Was it really THAT good?' Maybe. Either way, however, I approached this film with a fairly high level of trepidation. 'Will the movie be over-hyped, too?' I'm happy to say that this is an adequate film (thus my thumbs up rating.) But I don't believe it'll stay in theaters as long as the book stayed on the best seller lists.The film DOES follow the book surprisingly well. Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He's in Paris autographing his latest book when a police officer approaches and asks him to come to the Louvre. Once there, Mr. Hanks discovers that a murder has taken place. A curator that Mr. Langdon was supposed to meet that night was murdered and his body desecrated. But it appears the dead curator desecrated his own body. But why? Sophie Neveu, a young detective played by Audrey Tautou, arrives at the scene and soon Mr. Langdon's life begins to unravel. Trapped by the French police, a murder investigation in which he is the prime suspect, a secret society of ultra-worshippers known as the Opus Dei, and a group of Templar Knights in hiding, Robert Langdon is quickly whisked into a life of puzzle solving in order to find a secret that could unravel Christianity as we know it.Much controversy surrounded the film before its release. The main controversy was from albinos. Amazingly I heard nothing from this group while the book was out, but now that the film is here, they've emerged from the woodwork. Why? I'll let you all think about that one on your own.There have been complaints, too, that the film is 'too slow to get going' or that Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou gave wooden performances. I didn't see that.I will complain about Tom Hanks in this role, however. I'm sure Ron Howard and he work together comfortably after their previous collaborations from SPLASH to APOLLO 13. But I just couldn't swallow Mr. Hanks as the prime character. There was zero chemistry between him and Mrs. Tautou, and his long hair was well nasty looking (like it needed a good washing.) He's getting up there in age and I think Clive Owen or some other up-and-coming actor would've been a wiser choice. My two-cents",7,1,6,19 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Growing Up Hogwarts-Style
","The Harry Potter film franchise takes off with another wizardly tale of growing up at Hogwarts with all of its interpersonal banter and dark underpinnings.Watching the young actors age on the screen is probably becoming one of the more satisfying things for me. It makes it seem more 'real' even though this is just a fantastic fantasy.Coming back to the wizard school this time, we see that Ron, Hermione and Harry have hit their growth (and hormone) spurts. Dancing, love, friendship, and danger are now forever linked as we're introduced to the Goblet of Fire TriWizard competition. Normally set as a triad competition (between three individuals of different schools) this time there will be four contestants, obviously including Harry. Angst and anger are the melange of the day as Harry has to deal with his lack of knowledge about the competition and grapple with his growing affection for girls his own age. Oh yes, and he's still be chased by the evil Lord Voldemort (the wizard responsible for his parents' death and the unusual scar forever emblazoned on Harry's forehead).Harry's not old enough to compete in the competition and his fellow Hogwartians aren't happy with the fact that Harry seems to be outgrowing his own shoes. Is he too cocky? Harry never entered the competition and doesn't know how his name got picked but his fellow classmates don't believe him.As the Goblet of Fire contest continues, we see Harry battling dragons, saving one friend but unable to rescue another, and then meeting face-to-face with true evil.Perhaps it's the dark qualities of these latest Potter films that drags me in, or perhaps I'm just a fan of the genre (junky?), but whatever it is, I find the dangers and limited successes of Harry and his friends comforting and realistic (not overly done with a 'Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes' attitude). This one's rated PG-13, too, so keep an eye on the kiddies.Like the Prizoner of Azkaban, this one has very dark over and undertones. And clocking in at two-and-a-half hours, it's one of the longer in the series but well worth the sitting time.",7,0,1,22 April 2006
The Happening," M. Night? What The {bleep!} Happened?!
","I have to shamefully admit something here: I'm an M. Night junkie. I love just about everything he's done. Yes, even LADY IN THE WATER, which had a heartfelt message at its core and a great actor (Paul Giamatti) leading the way. And there were at least some creepy creatures in it. Lots of things were 'happening.' Unfortunately, you can't say the same thing for THE HAPPENING (I've given it the unfortunate new title of 'The Unhappening').Let's see where to begin I guess the story is as bad a place as any First off, if you're going to make a thriller, it needs to be scary. The Happening isn't. The story has an enemy that we never see. And although unseen enemies can be psychologically frightening if done right (a bit caveat), they can be hard to pull off. The simple fact that not only was The Happening's main antagonist(s) not in the least frightening, it was seriously lame and completely unbelievable as to how the main protagonist comes to understand how it's 'chasing them.' Second problem Acting. Although I'm no die-hard fan of Mark Wahlberg (THE DEPARTED), I have enjoyed previous films with him as a main character. But here he pulls in a very wooden and careless performance. Perhaps the script stymied him, perhaps not. But I think the bad script/story is definitely to blame, because also in the cast were John Leguizamo (ICE AGE) and Zooey Deschanel (FAILURE TO LAUNCH), both of which I consider high prizes in Hollywood and often underused. Their stilted line deliveries ('Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it!') and equally wooden performances seem to point toward story problems of epic proportions.The final stone...I'll cast the final stone and mention the complete lack of anything approaching a character we can sympathize or identify with. Again, pretty much a script/story problem. People die. They fall off buildings, stab themselves with hair pins, allow themselves to be run over by a riding mower, hang themselves, crash their cars, and die in fairly gruesome fashion (earning the film it's first R rating for M. Night). And I think this is where he screwed up. He must've equated gruesomeness with theatrical tension, but that wasn't the case. There needs to be a human element to the story and up until now, M. Night has been able to deliver it.But here, it just ain't 'happening.'",2,3,7,2 November 2008
The Fountain," Attention Sci-Fi Geeks: Take Your Women To See This Flick!
","Okay all of you sci-fi geeks out there. It's time to drag your spouse, girlfriend, or significant other out again. They'll hem and haw about going to see 'yet another' science fiction film with you, but this time redemption is at your feet.THE FOUNTAIN is, for all intents and purposes, a love story built around an SF theme: immortality and the future. But there aren't any magical conjurers or any time machines. The story is all too human, spanning eons as we witness the immortality of ...love. It may sound a bit offish to some SF fans, but don't let it be. There are still amazing scenes shot using bizarre methods (micro-photography of petri dishes?) instead of the usual CGI, a remarkable coherency between the vast time scales, and some damn fine acting.Hugh Jackman (X-Men) stars as Tomas, a man in love with his queen (during the Spanish Inquisition), his terminally ill wife (present day), and the symbol of his wife's immortality (in the distant future). Tomas' queen/wife/symbol is none other than the amazing Rachel Weisz (THE CONSTANT GARDNER) known throughout the film as Izzi. Tomas, in the earliest time of the Spanish Inquisition, is trying to save his beloved queen by finding the tree of life (something hinted at in many religions, including Christianity where Adam and Eve eat from the tree of knowledge causing God to yank away the tree of life and hide it).We then jump to present day and find Doctor Tomas desperately searching for a cancer cure in order to save his wife, Izzi. Again, the tree of life plays a part as he and his research team uncover a strange piece of bark from a long forgotten tree. It's healing properties are astounding, but will the cure come in time to save Izzi? The most distant time is that of Tomas on an existential journey through space with a tree as his only companion. Again, the tree of life, but this time the tree is appropriately a symbol of his wife.Weaving the conquistador past, with present day medicine, and an uncertain future, director Darren Aronofsky has really given us a piece of poetry as art. This isn't too surprising coming from Aronofsky, the same director of such mind-benders as PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. Don't expect a formulaic plot or for things to be spelled out. You know better than that if you've seen any of this director's work. But that's part of the big draw. You move along with the story rather than being forcibly dragged through it. It flows on its own ethereal plain, never stopping, never letting the viewers' eyes rest. Each scene is shot to near perfection, using dark sets, lighted doorways, and golden globes to exquisite advantage.But it's the love story between Izzi and Tomas that holds the entire movie together. Their dedication to one another is palpable, and when Izzi sits near death's doorstep, you can feel Tomas' overwhelming need to save her, his beloved for all time.So it's time to haul your spouse/girlfriend/significant other kicking and screaming into the theater again. And they'll love you for it later. Perhaps you might even 'get lucky' after the film...",10,6,12,8 December 2006
Zombieland," The One-Line Zingers Just Kept Coming And Never Let Up!
","I'm a pretty big RomZomCom fan. Loved SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Thought FIDO was brilliant (kind of mix of Zombies meet PLEASANTVILLE or Lassie). So I was pretty hyped to get a look at ZOMBIELAND.The premise is really nothing new: Zombies show up. Take over the world. A group of survivors has to make their way through the maze-like brain-eaters on their way to ...somewhere. But this time we get some seriously dysfunctional people who are forced to ban together and become a gun-blazing family. The patriarch of this unusual gathering is none other than Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN) who supposedly lost a puppy that's caused him to go a bit loco into Zombie slaughtering. He'll pound 'em to death with a banjo (while strumming a little ditty from DELIVERANCE ...and you might even catch him saying a few lines from that unique film), cut their heads off with pruning sheers, or just fill them full of lead. The son of this disturbed family is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg, THE SQUID AND THE WHALE), an introvert shut-in who has difficulty forming human connections because of his excessive nerdiness (think Mountain Dew drinking, World of Warcraft playing loner and you'll be right on the mark ...literally). Columbus has survived by alienating himself from everyone and everything ...and by creating a laundry list of rules that have helped him stay Zombie-free (Rule #1 – Cardio. Rule #3 – Beware of bathrooms ...which have contributed to Columbus' irritable bowel problems. The list goes all the way up into the 30s and you can occasionally see the rules placed at varying intervals throughout the movie whenever their usefulness is used within its framework). Columbus and Tallahassee team up as they head across the USA – from East to West – and eventually encounter two scam artist sisters: the lovely Wichita (Emma Stone, SUPERBAD) and her younger sibling Little Rock (Abigail Breslin, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE). The two girls steal the mens guns and transportation only to later meet up and join with them on this cross country trek.The great thing about Zombieland is that it really isn't dramatic at all. It is purely comedic, even when you feel they might be heading toward the dramatic. For instance, once Columbus discovers why Tallahassee if really messed up (not because of a dog), the audience is lead to believe there will be this sweet, touching moment. But don't be foolish! Tallahassee comes up with another one-line zinger that keeps the film's comedic timing right on track.The romantic portions of the film are confined to Columbus' desires to brush Wichita's hair back over her ear ...and one little kiss. So, again, the comedy just kept coming.It was also great that the film never went overboard in terms of time. At only 87 minutes in total, the movie moves along at a pace and doesn't wander in the slightest.Comparisons between this flick and SHAUN OF THE DEAD are already being made (no surprise). They both have their strengths. Shaun of the Dead ruled because it wasn't one-liners that kept it going, but a continuous montage of comedic events that spilled one on-top of another, and just kept snowballing. But Zombieland has the zingers. The one-liners are excellently placed within the story. My favorite one was 'Thank God for rednecks!' And you can't not mention Bill Murray, the surprise pseudo-Zombie guest star. His short but extremely funny part was vital to the story (and remember to stay in the theater until after the credits finish rolling for a special treat).So some might want to weigh which was the better RomZomCom: Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland. But there's no need. They're both in firmly in the genre, and are excellent portrayals in their own comedic right. Enjoy them both. I know I did.",10,5,12,4 October 2009
Glory Road," A Shallow Disneyrama Flick That Doesn't Slam-Dunk
","Nothing should take away from the amazing circumstances that led coach Don Haskins to defy southern standards and start playing a mostly black NCAA team in El Paso, Texas during a time when the U.S. was rife with bigoted undertones. But then you watch this Disney film and wonder what went wrong...The legend of 'The Bear' (Haskins) lives on in the El Paso community and should leave little doubt in anyone's mind that this great man accomplished something extraordinary in 1966 by leading his black and white Texas Western basketball team to the national title. But in the hands of screenwriter Bettina Gilois, the film falls far short of rousing entertainment.The movie stars Josh Lucas (SECOND HAND LIONS) as Coach Haskins and Lucas pulls in a good role from this languid script. Matching 'The Bear's' attitude toward discipline and basketball basics, Lucas' performance was the cherry on this otherwise melting, gooey mess. When we first meet Haskins, he's the coach of a girls high school basketball team and is approached by the tiny NCAA school of Texas Western. Hungry to advance his coaching career, he and his family move into the dorm for the Western team, only to learn that there's little hope for success from such a small community with a crumbling stadium. But Haskins won't give up. He travels around to various states with his coaching team, hoping to find some successful players. But all of the Great White Hopes refuse to join up. So Haskins' search takes him to Harlem, Detroit and other less-than-appealing locales, digging up some of the best black talent the streets have to offer. He meets with much resistance upon returning home, too. People call him and his team the 'N' word, as well as other unseemly titles. But these taunts soon turn to amazed cheers as Haskins leads his team to a near undefeated first season. And when Haskins team makes it to the NCAA finals, he starts a pure black team, something never heard of in basketball up to that point.There's nothing wrong with this awesome historical story, but its execution was lacking on so many levels as to make it a yawner. The audience is jerked from one set of circumstances to the next and they never get to focus on one particular character nor care about any of these wonderful kids (most viewers will probably feel fairly detached rather than anything approaching familiarity).Comparisons between HOOSIERS and GLORY ROAD can easily be seen (although one is about high school ball while the other is NCAA), and the former still rules the high cinematic ground. Gene Hackmans' coach Dale far outclasses Lucas' portrayal of Haskins, not to mention Hoosiers excellent cohesive story, something completely absent in Glory Road. And this is a sad statement. Someone as important in the racial arena as 'The Bear' should have had a much better film made about him and his brave team. But instead we get this snoozer, a lackadaisical Disneyrama film with poor character development and shallow entertainment. Stick to Hoosiers; you'll be glad you did.",4,4,8,19 September 2006
The Holiday," Predictable But Still A Good RomCom
","Romantic comedies abound in cinema. Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry Met Sally, French Kiss, Bridget Jones' Diary, and The Whole Nine Yards are just a few of the more recent ones in this genre. THE HOLIDAY certainly falls headlong into this category, but does so with the addition of it taking place around the Christmas season. Writer/director/producer Nancy Meyers is very familiar in the RomCom arena. Her repertoire contains such gems as Private Benjamin and Father of the Bride (we'll forgivingly overlook the Father of the Bride II debacle for the moment).What The Holiday has going for it is some good dialogue and even better acting. Cameron Diaz, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Jack Black round out the prime roles. The story starts with Amanda (Cameron Diaz, In Her Shoes) as she ejects her live-in boyfriend from her home. She's an intense young woman who's the CEO of her own upstart company that makes movie trailers. Her lifestyle is getting the better of her and she decides she needs a holiday.Iris (Kate Winslet, Finding Neverland) is in love with one of her close working colleagues and decides she needs a mental health getaway from the constrained English countryside. But what to do. Ah! House swap! Iris and Amanda fly across the Atlantic and take over each other's residences. Iris lands in L.A. to find a beautifully manicured house with every possible accouterment, while Amanda drags herself up the snow-laden driveway to a cramped but quaint English cottage. Initially Amanda hates what she finds. The quiet life doesn't suit her. But then she runs into Iris' brother Graham (Jude Law, Closer) and a one-night stand turns into something Amanda never thought possible. Iris, in L.A., struggles with falling out of love with her ex-beau who is soon to be married but won't stop bothering her (he calls, sends emails, etc.). But Iris develops a unique friendship with Miles (Jack Black), a sound mixer for films, and she sees in him the same failings her own relationships have.Although very predictable, the powerhouse actors and actresses with the superb dialogue made this flick enjoyable. The handsome Jude Law will make young viewers swoon and the sexy Cameron Diaz will appeal to men who still have an inkling of testosterone flowing through their veins.Jack Black has toned down his hyperactivity and settled into a fine role (although some may miss his outlandish behaviors of ol'). His 'breast graze' lines are funny and poignant, making us love him for his calmly delivered antics this time.Kate Winslet sheds her Titanic persona and goes back to what she knows: being a regular English actress. Her simple demeanor was quite well pulled off for someone who tends to have a more haughty acting history, showing that she can ugly down a bit and act in ways we may have forgotten.All-in-all this is a pretty predictable romantic comedy but the script is so strong and the acting so well done that it deserves plenty of accolades.",7,1,2,27 December 2006
30 Days of Night," Not For The Romantic Dracula Fan
","Looking for love from the Ol' Toothy Guy? Want desirable vampires that women can't resist? If that's your take on Dracula, you best look elsewhere. This is a true, blood-and-guts, horror film, so that's what awaits you when you pay for your cinema ticket for 30 DAYS OF NIGHT.Director David Slade of HARD CANDY fame is becoming known for the psychological aspects of his films. The aforementioned Hard Candy was shockingly excellent, with the story turning the tables again and again on a pedophiliac relationship that made viewers squirm in their seats.And here, again, Slade shows us that he can jump into an old legend and put a new spin on things. Vampire movies are a dime-a-dozen, most of them severely romanticizing the toothy villains. But Slade gives them no sway. In 30 Days Of Night they are brutal, strong, extremely old, and after only one thing: fresh meat to satiate their insatiable hunger.The unfortunate victims of their bloodthirst is the Alaskan town of Barrow. Anyone who knows anything about geography and oil knows that Barrow is at the 'top of the world,' cradled on the edge of the arctic ocean where the Alaskan pipeline is the dominant feature. It also means that this little shanty-ish town is well above the arctic circle, a place where the sun disappears entirely for many winter weeks. Sounds like a buffet brunch for the ancient fanged cohorts, no? I mean, they don't have to worry about the sun, and there are hundreds of these weak humans running around in the dark. What's not to love! Problems quickly become evident as Sheriff Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett, LUCKY NUMBER SLEVIN) runs into a sudden rash of crimes. All of the cell phones in town are discovered burned on a hillside. Every last sled dog is found murdered. The sole helicopter in town is found dismantled and destroyed. And a lone Stranger (Ben Foster, HOSTAGE) wanders into town with gloom and doom surrounding him. This Stranger runs afoul of the local constabulary and is rushed to a jail cell ...which is when things really start going downhill for the people of Barrow.The last day of sun comes and goes, and a Russian ship sits idly in a hidden bay. Off this ship comes pure trouble. With no need to hide from the sun, these ancient vampires are free to roam and kill at their leisure. The people of Barrow are easy pickings.During all of the ensuing chaos, Sheriff Oleson is also battling a separation from his wife Stella (Melissa George, DARK CITY), who is forced to stay in Barrow after having an unfortunate car accident. It is her, her husband, and a small band of survivors who are the final holdouts within Barrow. Discovering that the only way to kill these vampires is to behead them, the Sheriff and his shrinking townspeople are forced to do the unthinkable, sometimes to friends who have been 'turned' into vampires.The ending is a bit sappy but filmed pretty well. The psychological aspects of it are impressive considering what the Sheriff is forced to do in order to save the town and the wife he now loves again (who needs marriage counseling when you've got human-devouring bloodsuckers to worry about?) But this film isn't without its problems. From the very beginning, it is obvious that the film makers spent zero time researching how the sun sets above the arctic circle (it doesn't come straight down onto the horizon but slants into it at an extreme angle). And the sun doesn't stay up for long during the last day before it vanishes. It's probably up just a few moments before it sinks below the horizon again and is NEVER up very high in the sky.The acting is so-so with Hartnett pulling in an okay lead performance. Ben Foster as 'The Stranger' is creepily menacing and filthy, enough to send a few shivers up your spine. The vampires themselves were the most interesting, their communication often being more of a clicking sound than words, and some of them looking almost neanderthal-ish, giving them a very ancient appearance.But the film is good in that it doesn't spoonfeed the audience any information. We're not exactly sure how old these vampires are, nor exactly how many are left (although it appears these are 'the last of their kind'). We're also never privy to the Sheriff and his wife's marital difficulties, it being internalized by the characters and only felt via them (which was quite refreshing ...we didn't need to know this information, only how they were going to survive for a month against these monsters).This is a gore-fest, too, with plenty of crimson for the hardcore horror fan. But it doesn't go over the top. Only one beheading is truly shown and it was a powerful scene meant to shock you. And, like the movie, it's an assault on your senses. A good assault, that is.",7,8,14,25 October 2007
Wedding Crashers," Funny, but has Some Problems ...
","A lot of hype surrounded this film while it was in theaters and continued with its recent release onto DVD. I've lately halted when I hear resounding praise lavished on films with nary a single negative comment to be found. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was one such film that I enjoyed but didn't live up to the brouhaha surrounding it.And such was the case with WEDDING CRASHERS ...Although pleasantly funny and entertaining (note the 'thumbs up' rating I gave it for sheer entertainment), the film lost much of its lighthearted punch as the story bogged down in the drama surrounding its two main characters, John Beckwith (Owen Wilson, STARSKY AND HUTCH) and Jeremy Grey (Vince Vaughn, DODGEBALL).The basic premise is about these two longtime friends who enjoy crashing as many weddings as possible. They have hundreds of rules that each of them follows ('Rule #1: Never leave a fellow crasher alone', etc) ...that is until John falls for a beautiful woman named Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams, THE NOTEBOOK) and all bets are called off.John and Jeremy's friendship appears to be on the rocks as John falls harder and harder for Claire. But problems quickly arise for him. Claire is the daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken, THE PROPHECY), an authoritative man who wants his daughters to marry into families of wealth and power. The Cleary family is also pretty dysfunctional ('putting the 'fun' in dysfunctional'). They have a son, Todd (Keir O'Donnell, IN YOUR FACE), who wants nothing to do with the family's politics and prefers painting evocative scenes in 'his own blood.' The Cleary mother, Kathleen (Jane Seymour, DR. QUINN, MEDICINE WOMAN), is sexually deprived and wants young men to 'touch her surgically enhanced breasts.' John clearly has a lot of obstacles to overcome ...and not just within the Cleary family. Claire's long-term boyfriend, Zack Lodge (Bradley Cooper, ALIAS), wants to know who John and Jeremy are and how they became so close to the Cleary family so quickly.As John's love for Claire grows, Jeremy is dragged further away from his friend by the surrounding circumstances and by another Cleary daughter with serious psychological issues that he later finds endearing.As you can see, there's a lot going on in this film. At two hours in length, it's one of the more long-winded comedies I've seen.Mixing drama, romance and humor is always a challenge, and director David Dobkin admirably tries to hold it all together, and on some levels he does, but the ending fell flat with no laughs and zero character growth (they just expand their wedding crasher community from two to four members).I will say that seeing Jane Seymour in such a different role surprised me. She played the part of a bored politician's wife extremely well. But Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn were just Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn; men who never grew up. Whenever they're on-screen together, however, there were definitely some great comedic moments ('Oh. You didn't hear. My brother had a diving accident and he's retarded now.') But if you're looking for a high quality comedy, this isn't it. It is funny at times, but when compared to such masterpieces as THE BIG LEBOWSKI or OH BROTHER WHERE ART THOU, it seriously pales.",6,0,0,5 February 2006
There Will Be Blood," It's All Daniel Day-Lewis ...And Rightfully So
","Similar to the film CASTAWAY in which Tom Hanks carries the entire production, THERE WILL BE BLOOD has that same air due to the phenomenal performance by Daniel Day-Lewis ...with one big exception. Hanks was alone, so there really was no other supporting cast to compare him against while on his little island (unless you count the volleyball, 'Wilson'). Daniel Day-Lewis was surrounded by a fine cast, but he outshone everyone of them by leagues.Not surprising, Day-Lewis won every acting award in every awards ceremony in 2007 (from the Oscars on down).More of a story about greed, There Will Be Blood is also a battle of wills: one with god-fearing faith and the other without. The faithful is represented by a fire-breathing preacher named Eli Sunday (Paul Dano, LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE). Apparently an identical twin, Eli's brother Paul finds the successful oil tycoon Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) and offers up his family's ranch in California as a place where 'oil runs on the surface of the ground.' Daniel and his 'son' head onto the ranch and discover that there is, indeed, a lot of oil to be had. Making an initial promise to Eli that they'll 'build a new church' for the local congregation, Daniel sets to work buying up all the surrounding property and dropping his first rig into the ground. Problems quickly arise with Eli, however, who has his own form of greed: the greed of religion. Wanting his money to build his church, Eli inserts himself into Daniel's business and the two quickly bump heads. Bad things begin happening around the new oil derrick: a well-man dies, an explosion and fire, and the sudden head injury of Daniel's son, H.W. Plainview (Dillon Freasier).The greed of Daniel Plainview knows no bounds, and the internal corruption that it causes is eked out in terrible portions. When Daniel put his son on a train and abandons him, we see that there's much more beneath the surface of this fractured man. Morality isn't something he's familiar with. Eli quickly zeroes in on this and all but forces Daniel to be baptized and saved in order to continue his successful drilling of the area. This is something that will come back and haunt both Eli and Daniel at the end of the film.Again, it is the awe-invoking performance by Day-Lewis that carries the film throughout its 158 minute length. The other actors do fine jobs, no doubt about it, but they pale in comparison to Day-Lewis' John Huston inspired performance (his voice was impeccable).This is a pretty dark film with not-just-a-few allusions that lean toward biblical text (many of the character names are taken straight from the bible, including Abel, Mary, Daniel, and Eli). The allusions go deeper than simple names, however, and watching There Will Be Blood one can't help but see them. The great part about this is that the ending doesn't wind up where you think it should. Forget redemption. You'll know how harsh Daniel Plainview's life has become when you hear him say, 'I'm finished.' {shiver!}",9,4,7,25 May 2008
The Last King of Scotland," Acting Perfected
","When an actor gets 'into' a role, it can often make or break a film. If they've researched and prepared and are ready to give 100% to the production, then you're more than likely going to have a successful movie. Movie-goers saw this with Phillip Seymour Hoffman in his portrayal of CAPOTE which won him the Oscar, the Golden Globe and so many other accolades that it'd take up half of a page to list them all. Not surprising, Forest Whitaker has mirrored Hoffman's success with last year's astounding THE LAST KING OF Scotland.When you don't see the actor and only see the character, the person doing the portrayal has bottled solid gold for viewers, and Whitaker certainly did this. His breathtaking performance as the deranged dictator General Idi Amin, former president of Uganda, was perfect. Mannerisms, voice, those strangely vacant eyes, they were all eerily present.Although a fictional representation on real events, The Last King of Scotland holds more fact than fiction. Even though one of its main characters (James McAvoy as Dr. Nicholas Garrigan) never really existed, the film inserts him in order for us to see what it was like being on the inside of this bizarre man's government. The brutality of 300,000 slaughter Ugandans is never seen but only hinted at because Dr. Garrigan and the rest of Amin's advisors are never privy to such information, being held tightly to the General's chest. As Idi Amin's paranoia begins surfacing more and more, Dr. Garrigan realizes how dangerous a position he's in  that being so close to such an unstable figurehead.The cracks in Amin's persona are brutally and perfectly presented by Whitaker. His mood swings from friend to foe happen in the blink of the proverbial eye, and Whitaker makes it all completely believable. The stress Dr. Garrigan (McAvoy) feels is ratcheted up as he realizes he's not really the President's doctor but the prisoner of a genocidal maniac. This added an excellent level of texture to the film, giving the audience someone to care and worry about.Probably the strangest thing about this entire time in history is that many Ugandans still view Idi Amin as a 'great President/leader.' This is focused on in the extra features of the DVD, making many watchers scratch their heads in dismay, no doubt.Regardless of your views on the man, Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin is so impressive you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen.",10,0,2,19 April 2007
August Rush," Too Sweet For Some
","Schmaltzy and predictable, AUGUST RUSH will still manage to please most movie-goers. The basic ingredients make this so: a healthy helping of a cute young kid (Freddie Highmore, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY), a dose of a busted-up, romantic, musical couple (Keri Russell, SCRUBS, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, MATCH POINT), and the sprinkling of a slimy vagabond (Robin Williams, HAPPY FEET).Highmore has come a long way in his short life. Having immensely enjoyed his portrayal as Peter in FINDING NEVERLAND, I have followed the career path of this super-young-star with interest. Most recently he's starred in THE GOLDEN COMPASS and THE SPIDERWICK CHRONCLES, two blockbuster films. Whoever his agent is, they've done a fantastic job.But Highmore has never taken on a role quite as focused as August Rush before. He tended to be overshadowed by the larger than life actors that played beside him (Johnny Depp, Anjelica Huston, etc.). But this time, the focus is all on his character, Evan/August Rush. His name change from Evan to August is affected by the wayward homeless musician 'The Wizard' played by Robin Williams. The slime-factor is high for Williams here, higher than I've ever seen from him. This also made the story much more interesting and made you dislike Williams' Wizard character in the extreme.The love story between Lyla (Keri Russell) and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is executed well if a bit distant and unrealistic. Their one night stand that results in a pregnancy becomes the culminating factor that binds all of the characters together. Well ...that ...and music, of course.Evan (Highmore) is lost amidst the U.S. orphanage industry until he eventually makes good his escape. He carries with him only his belief that music will somehow connect him with his unknown parents. He's lived music his entire, short life, so whenever he comes into contact with an instrument (be it a guitar or a piano) he quickly grasps its workings and can play it within moments. A prodigy, he's soon called by those that know him. Pulling him away from his dreams, however, is The Wizard, a man who wants to personally capitalize on Evan's astounding abilities by prostituting him to the highest bidder ...the highest bidder willing to pay his manager (i.e., The Wizard).Juilliard is offered up to Evan, and he quickly surpasses all those before him. But he still hasn't found his parents (who are also musicians), and a concert in New York's Central Park soon beckons them together. It's so sweet it'll make your eye-teeth ache.Even with its overly-sweet beginning, middle, and end, August Rush is something of a must for those who enjoy unique musical playing and the process of melodious discovery.Just don't eat any chocolate while watching it.",7,1,3,13 March 2008
Stranger Than Fiction," A 'Wow!' Moment For Will Ferrell
","Will Ferrell fans now have a very good reason to stand up and cheer. Myself not being much of a Ferrell champion (although I modestly enjoyed TALLADEGA NIGHTS), I came into STRANGER THAN FICTION wondering if he might try some over-the-top antics or just give another mediocre performance. Amazingly, Ferrell gives a thoughtful and insightful portrayal of a conflicted man who believes he's being followed by a narrating woman's voice.What gives Stranger Than Fiction its emotional heft, too, is its clever script and fine performances by Emma Thompson, Maggie Gyllenhaal (SHERRYBABY), Dustin Hoffman, and even Queen Latifah.Falling partially into the fantasy category (but only slightly so), the story is of Harold Crick, an IRS agent who one day begins hearing a woman's voice narrating the more mundane portions of his life ('Harold brushed his teeth 32 strokes up and down and 72 side to side'). Initially Harold fears he may be having some sort of mental break. He goes to see a shrink who eventually (and reluctantly) refers him to Professor Jules Hilbert (Hoffman). Some of the most entertaining dialogue is heard here as Hilbert and Crick try to decide whether the voice is narrating his life as a comedy or a tragedy (or maybe some other genre). When Hilbert asks Crick what he does for a living and if there's anyone that might want to hurt him, Crick replies, 'I'm an IRS agent, everyone hates me.' To which Professor Hilbert responds, 'Well that certainly sounds like a comedy to me.' Eventually, Harold discovers who's voice is in his head. It's a novelist named Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson), and it appears that Harold is simply a fictional creation of her's that has somehow come to life. Harold races to find Ms. Eiffel before she finishes her novel, strictly because he knows that he plans to kill her (she narrates to him this simple fact, much to Harold's dismay). Once they meet, Ms. Eiffel is somewhat freaked out by the prospect that one of her creations has come to life, and Harold is even more freaked to learn that she's finished the novel (the ending isn't typed yet, but is handwritten and awaiting the plunk! plunk! of the typewriter keys).The ending is bittersweet for both Harold and Emma. Can she change her masterpiece of fiction? Can she not kill Harold and still retain the essence of her work (she's killed off her main protagonist in all her other novels)? Ferrell's soft-spoken tax-man performance was something of a marvel. His witty line deliveries and his tender relationship with Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal) goes way beyond anything we've seen from him before. Again, much of this can be attributed to the brilliant script by Zach Helm. But Will Ferrell's performance cannot be denied. He's in almost every shot, proving that he can be a great leading man if given the right set of circumstances. Now let's just hope that he continues on this upward swing.",8,1,2,26 February 2007
The Reader," Mixed Morality
","Maybe it's just me, but I'm sort of surprised that the Jewish community hasn't gotten a tad up-in-arms over this film. I mean, it really sets a seriously sympathetic tone for a death-camp guard with unfortunate circumstances. I realize she wasn't well educated and had to make tough decisions in order to survive, but so did many people who came out of the holocaust ...Germans among them. But usually NOT death-camp personnel who were the overseers of those who went into gas chambers.Still, this film is well-acted thanks to the amazing performance of Kate Winslet (THE HOLIDAY) as Hannah Schmitz, the guard in question. Although I won't take anything away from the other actors in this film, particularly young David Kross as Michael Berg, the boy turning into a man with the help of Hannah's sexual appeal, I will say that, without Winslet, this film likely would've fallen flat, theatrically.Set across generations of Germans and Germany, the story is loaded with historical interest surrounding the holocaust courts that were set up after WWII. Hannah, not surprisingly, is a keystone for the courts as they uncover what they think is her sole involvement in the ordering of the deaths of Jewish women in one of the camps. Circling back to her time at the camps as a guard, it is quickly surmised (by the movie watcher and Michael, but not the courts) that Hannah has never learned to read, so has those she's about to condemn read to her.The condemnation is set up in a way that allows Hannah to remember those she's let loose into the gas chambers; a sort of penance for what she is 'forced' to do. In a similar manner, she condemns young Michael to a life of lovelessness in that he can never forget her, his first true love. And when Michael goes to school to become a lawyer, he and his classmates are soon brought into the case involving Hannah, but only as spectators. But for Michael, much more is apparent. He has the chance to save Hannah from the courts but is forced into a moral conundrum: Is she worth saving? Is she deserving? The story continues as we watch Hannah's prison years pass by. With her age comes knowledge and words. Michael sends her packages containing books on tape that he recorded for her, emboldening Hannah to learn to read on her own. Which she does. But is it too late for personal forgiveness and redemption? The ending hits pretty hard at these core issues. Personal responsibility. Moral condemnation. Rule of law. Historical atrocity. All of these are intertwined to form a patina of the past that blurs the future.The film is watchable mainly for the purposes of Kate Winslet. Her performance is absolutely stellar. But the pacing and mixed moral message were tough to swallow for me. I'm not Jewish, but I believe that the holocaust happened. And I believe those associated with it, in any way, do not deserve our sympathies. Even those supposedly 'forced' into these kinds of situations. Where's the morality in that?",6,0,1,21 September 2009
The Wrestler," How Much Does It Cost To Make A Great Film? Less Than You Think!
","Known more for his visual appeal along with intriguing stories, director/writer/producer Darren Aronofsky shows a different, and perhaps better, side of his mastery in storytelling.I first became aware of Aronofsky after seeing his impressive REQUIEM FOR A DREAM back in 2000. Engulfed in that film's unique visual telling, I moved on six years later to see THE FOUNTAIN. Extraordinary in just about every way, especially the special effects and how he integrated them into the plot, I then went out and tried to find everything I could by this unique man. What I found was very little. A few minor productions prior to 2000, Aronofsky is an enigma; he's not out there making a movie every eight months like some directors.So when I heard praise being heaped upon THE WRESTLER, it was with great surprise that I found out Aronofsky was both producer and director. I wasn't surprised because it was him, but because the story just didn't sound like something he'd do. I mean, where's the visual appeal in the story of a washed-up pro wrestler? Time for me to eat some crow...The visual appeal isn't there but doesn't need to be. This is a myopic view that focuses its entire lens on that of one man, and does it so powerfully, with such an amazing story, that fans of such things as ROCKY, RAGING BULL and BRIAN'S SONG would be proud to rank it among their favorite sports-related films of all time; it's in my top five.Much of the excitement has been directed at returning film star Mickey Rourke. Returning, you ask? Where had he been? Strangely appropriate, Rourke had taken a hiatus from acting and returned to one of his earlier loves: boxing. From 1991 to 1995, Rourke had become a professional boxer and won a string of matches. But he also received some crushing facial injuries that required reconstructive surgery. These injuries are still noticeable in The Wrestler, but they also give the filming of Rourke's face a unique appeal since we're talking about that of a spiraling down wrestler who's failing body can't keep up.Wearing hearing aids, reading glasses, and having to work at a supermarket in order to make ends meet, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) is discovering what lay ahead for him, a previously successful wrestler with a fan following that's dying off ...kind of like himself.Beside 'The Ram' is a stripper who's also on her downward swing. Getting older and nudged aside by younger, prettier strippers, Cassidy (Marissa Tomei, WILD HOGS) spurns The Ram's romantic advances. She still feels like she's got some stripper time left in her, even though the clientèle where she works seems to say different. The power with which Tomei pulls her battered, sex-object body around only to learn that she needs something more than a pole to dance around is incredible to watch. But can Cassidy learn that The Ram's love for her is something she needs before it's too late? This is where the crux of the story really pulls the viewer in and holds us to the very, very end.The side story of The Ram's estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE) also adds a very human quality to the main character, and gives us more of the in-depth character analysis so many films lack. It also reinforced The Ram's loneliness in a world where aging sports figures learn of their early mistakes, and that trying to make amends often results in old habits cropping up and destroying any such possibilities.Finally, I have to mention the gritty film style that Aronofsky chose for The Wrestler. Hand held camera's and grainy looking film stock all added to a years-gone-by feel that was very appropriate. It also saved a ton of cash. In fact, The Wrestler cost only $7 million to make but has, apparently, made over $70 million as of this writing. The shocking fact for me is not that it's made back ten times what it cost to make, but that Aronofsky did it without any significant special effects like he used in The Fountain (cost = $35 million to make), proving that this director has the potential to make just about any film, under any circumstances, with minimal expenditures. Although this information may not be terribly interesting to movie-goers, I find this extremely admirable considering the multi-gazillion dollar films that get greenlit and then flop at the box office.Aronofsky is the man. And he's got a resume to be proud of, too. And The Wrestler should rank high on his list. It should rank high on yours, too. See it for Rourke's performance. Enjoy it because Aronofsky did a fabulous job.",10,0,1,17 February 2009
Hancock," Are The Critics Wrong?
","I find myself in complete disagreement with the critics and their take on HANCOCK, Will Smith's (I AM LEGEND) latest Summer release. I'd heard all kinds of drastic problems with Hancock, which kept me away from the theater. Most notably that the latter half of the film sank it to obscure and muddy waters, and thus made it a bomb. Again, I couldn't disagree more.If you're looking for the standard Hollywood fodder and its take on superheroes, then I might see where you could run into some snags. But if you're looking for a bit of a twist on the superhero image, then you're in for a treat.Anybody who watches TV or has gone to the movies in the past few months knows Hancock's premise: a drunken superguy (Smith) is lost amongst humanity. He knows not where he came from, nor how he's supposed to fit in with people who are so different from himself. He tries to do good, but more often than not does millions of dollars of damage in the process, incensing the Los Angeles population. Roads tore up. Highway signs obliterated. Monuments defaced. Train cars derailed. It's all a bit much for our wayward (and intoxicated) hero. Until one day he meets up with Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman, SMOKIN' ACES). Hancock saves Ray's life in that infamous train scene that many of you have probably seen in the trailers. What results is a friendship of sorts thanks to Ray's chosen profession (pubic relations). Convinced that he can clean-up Hancock's messy image, Ray convinces the superman to ease up and fit in. In the meantime, he suggests that Hancock go to prison for his many warrants, and Hancock eventually agrees. The idea for this is twofold. First is that it'll keep Hancock out of trouble (with the exception of one episode of cranial-rectumitis); second is that the crime rate in L.A. will go up and people will demand his return.Intermixed with this is Ray's family and how they interact with Hancock. Ray's little boy Aaron (Jae Head) is lovingly appreciative of Hancock, and this helps show cracks in Hancock's otherwise indifference toward ...everything. But more interestingly is how Ray's beautiful wife Mary (Charlize Theron, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH) deals with Hancock's sudden arrival. Not giving away too much, I will say that this surprise ...well ...surprised me in a good way.The story arc is excellent in that the focus is never on Hancock's superpowers but on the man himself and how they affect him and those around him. It is this 'human' element that shows director Peter Berg's ability to take a solid action film and put its focus squarely where it belongs: on the people, not the powers or the special effects (although both of these are done very well). And speaking of story arcs ...It was refreshingly revolting to watch the 'asshole' comment that Hancock so loathes come full-circle, right up to the very ending credits in the film. I was laughing myself silly at the end (Hint: stay until the credits are nearly finished rolling).Comments about the 'funny first half' and the 'serious second half' of the film just didn't jive with me as a criticism. The film had laughs throughout, with spikes in dramatic flair (appropriately) and some nice doses of science fiction/fantasy that held a cohesive whole.Perhaps I'm prejudiced because of a few insider things that I know about Mr. Berg, but putting that aside, I've found that almost all the film's he's directed to be very human (I'm being repetitive, I know, but bear with me a moment). From Friday NIGHT LIGHTS and it's focus on the members of the team and not the sport itself to THE KINGDOM, which showed us the internal struggles of the war in Iraq and not the war itself, Berg has a good eye for what makes cinema an effective medium. And the people seem to agree with him, even if the critics  on this one  do not (coming in at a cool 37% approval rating). People are speaking with their wallets, and Hancock was #1 at the box office until this last weekend when HELLBOY II finally knocked it off the top. But it's still holding strong at #2, ahead of WALL-E (97% approval), KUNG-FU PANDA (88%) and THE INCREDIBLE HULK (68%). Perhaps the critics should take another look?",9,4,8,14 July 2008
Shooter," Too Many Holes To Be Entertaining
","Bobby Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg, THE DEPARTED) is a disgruntled vet. Ultimately left for dead on a sniper mission toward the end of his career, Bobby survives while his spotter-partner 'takes one for America.' Several years later we find Swagger living a life of self-imposed exile in the Colorado Rockies, his only friend a mutt who guards him and his home. He has no plans to re-enter society until...Enter Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover, DREAMGIRLS), a 'patriot' who claims that the life of the President of the United States is in danger. Knowing Swagger's history and his righteous defense of everything American, Johnson approaches the sniper-extraordinaire with a proposition: help them find out how an attempt on the President will take place and thus they can defuse it.Come to find out, Johnson isn't working for the President at all and is in the pocket of a U.S. Senator named Charles Meachum (Ned Beatty). Their plan isn't to kill the Prez but to eliminate another threat that stands near him during a speech in St. Louis (naturally money is involved).Having utilized Swagger, the Colonel attempts to off him but fails, much to the chagrin of Senator Meachum.Swagger is now on the run, wounded and bleeding, his face plastered on every television screen claiming he attempted to kill the President. Knowing that he has to get away no matter what, Swagger runs afoul of Secret Service agent named Nick Memphis (Michael Pena, CRASH). Hobbling him in quick, military fashion, Agent Memphis is just 'glad to be alive.' Which brought up a unique question: Why didn't the sniper just kill him? This drives Agent Memphis to make some terrible discoveries about his boss, his job, and what America values most.Double-crossed for the last time, Swagger seeks out those who framed him and uses his sniper training to ultimate advantage. Anyone less than 1,000 yards away is surely in trouble now. He even eventually brings Agent Memphis into his fold and teaches him the fine art of Sniperdom.SHOOTER's details are more interesting than the whole, as are the DVD special features. How a shooter positions himself. The effects on his shot from weather and wind to the curvature of the Earth are brought into play, making the mechanics more fascinating than the story.There's also the fact that some HUGE holes develop later on. Swagger nearly gets killed, then suddenly BANG! we're somewhere else where he can eliminate a threat to himself. There's no rhyme or reason to this showing that director Fuqua needed a little help come editing time. And then (drum roll) the big problem: Swagger is in custody and then, without clear reason, he's set free. The ridiculousness of this event is mind-boggling, even while watching a fictitious film where one must suspend disbelief.This film might appeal to military types who like to watch long shots being made at moving targets, but other than that, it's probably a safe pass.",3,6,14,14 August 2007
Defiance," History Can Be Stranger (And Grander) Than Fiction
","Hidden amongst the multiple film histories that litter the movies, occasionally you'll find a gem of a story that surprises the hell out of you. And DEFIANCE is definitely one of those. Based on the real-life story of the Bielski brothers who helped hide and save over 1,000 Jews from the Nazi death camps, this story is told in an unflinching narrative with brutal acts alongside those of extreme courage.We often hear that reality can be stranger (and grander) than fiction, and here this holds doubly true. For not only did the Bielski brothers do this amazing ordeal, they also didn't ask for any recognition, reward, or medals. They married and immigrated after WW II ended and decided to live out quiet lives in their little corners of the world (with the exception of one brother who was conscripted into the Soviet army and died in battle).But fate has a strange way of finding heroes, and this time was no exception. A documentary in 2006 entitled The Bielski Brothers: Jerusalem in the Woods was aired on the History Channel, and two books about them can easily be found, too. As word of what they'd done passed down through generations of survivors (now numbering in the tens of thousands), Hollywood took notice and sought out their history. Not having to embellish much (if at all) this incredible story, a screenplay was rapidly approved, director Ed Zwick (BLOOD DIAMOND) attached, and the rest is ...well ...history.Daniel Craig (QUANTUM OF SOLACE) takes the lead role as brother Tuvia, a man with a military past and Jewish roots. When his parents and friends are killed by Nazi hunters and sympathizers, Tuvia and brothers Zus (Liev Schreiber, THE PAINTED VEIL), Asael (Jamie Bell, KING KONG, 2005), and young Aron (George MacKay) head into the woods for safety. But vengeance versus fear drives what will come next. Tuvia kills his parents' murderers and then ducks deeper into the forests around Belarus. And with him comes other Jews fleeing the Nazi slaughters. Playing a game of hide-and-seek with their tormentors, The Bielski brothers and their followers didn't just cower in fear, but stood up and launched occasional attacks against the German troops. But their greatest victory was surviving and thriving in their forest hideouts. By wars end, they had not only survived, but multiplied and thrived.Fascinating.To this day, I often wonder if Hitler is turning over in his grave over this. I think he is. And what a wonderful form of revenge that is. Not because it took some violence on the Jews part to achieve it, but because violence wasn't their primary goal. It was survival. Surviving 'The Final Solution' was the one thing Hitler most certainly wouldn't have wanted. And not only did the Bielski brothers and their followers achieve it, they added to their numbers. Sweet revenge! Daniel Craig does a superb job as Tuvia, including a very believable accent. As does Liev Schreiber as his embittered brother Zus. In fact, I can't think of a single actor/actress that didn't live up to their part in this film. It was a gem to find amongst the forest of other movies out there.",9,2,5,8 January 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Holmes As Doyle Wrote Him
","There aren't many movies around that dare to reinvent something both literary and cinematic that is beloved by readers and movie-goers alike, but action director Guy Ritchie has dared in a big way ...and succeeded beyond my expectations.When Sir Arthur Conan Doyle created Sherlock Holmes (A Study in Scarlet, 1887), he made Holmes a roughshod, drug-addled genius with keen deductive powers. This made him a person that lay-readers could identify with. A man with problems, but with unique abilities that were much in demand. Coming off the heels of the Victorian era, too, Holmes was – in a very real way – a person coming out of that stuffy time period and into the more loose and modern one. Again, something readers of the time could identify with.Although the books live on in perpetuity, most of the population over the age of 40 are probably more familiar with director Roy Neill's television series starring the estimable Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson (if you're under 40 you're probably hooked on the hit TV series HOUSE M.D. which has more than just a passing familiarity with Doyle's character). Basil recreated the character of Holmes and also cleaned him up quite a bit. No drugs. Clean shaven. A real gentleman. In Doyle's literary works, however, this is far from the case ... which brings us to this new manifestation: the 2009 cinematic work starring Robert Downey Jr. (TROPIC THUNDER) as Holmes and Jude Law (REPO MEN) as Watson.Downey Jr. is one of our great new actors. He is a chameleon in every sense of the word. Which is why I found his Holmes to be extremely well played. From his migraines to drugging Watson's beloved dog, Downey Jr. truly encompassed everything that Doyle wrote about. He's both brilliant and prone to folly; seeks a new case that's semi-interesting but is just as likely to seek out a new drug to make him feel more interested; and only has eyes for one woman, the lovely Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams, THE FAMILY STONE) who is just as much trouble as any drug or migraine.This film is, hopefully, a reawakening of the Sherlock Holmes mystique; but a reawakening with Doyle's truly flawed character and not some scrubbed clean version. The ending of this movie certainly leaves open the possibility of a sequel. Let's hope that happens.One final word of warning in case you didn't get what I was saying: this isn't your grandmas Sherlock Holmes. If you want Rathbone, go watch him. If you want Doyle's Holmes, check out Guy Ritchie's newest (and more accurate) interpretation.",9,0,2,16 May 2010
WALL·E," Doesn't Come Close To Other Pixar Flicks...
","It is my understanding that director Andrew Stanton (along with screenwriter Pete Docter) had a couple of ideas that came to fruition prior to WALL-E. Things you may have heard of like, oh, FINDING NEMO and A BUG'S LIFE. Wall-E was the final 'idea' in the animation pipeline for Disney/Pixar and it is obvious to me why this was so after watching it. Let me explain...Let's start with the aforementioned Finding Nemo. Here was a story that was 95% focused on the main characters: fish and those around the fish (crabs, seagulls, pelicans, etc.). The dentist  a human  was a side-story; a vehicle for the plot, sure, but he wasn't what the film was about. The audience became enamored with Marlin (Nemo's father) and his adventures to find and save his son. Again, a great character scheme that got the audience attached to the title character and his father (and we can't forget Dori, the forgetful sidekick).Moving ahead several years we get to Wall-E, a story that isn't so well-formulated as far as characters go but has a decent message at its core: the survival of our planet.If the story had stuck to Wall-E's adventures and his need to connect with someone (anyone!), the story would've turned out just fine. True, the decent message may have gotten lost but film makers need audiences to feel empathetic toward the characters, and that's where Wall-E short circuits. The humans don't come into play until 20-plus minutes into this 98-minute feature and then we're completely given over to them and lose sight of Wall-E altogether ...for a while. This extreme detachment from the title character made the film feel more like two separate ones than a consistent whole.There are, however, some profoundly funny moments ...and some just plain profound things, too. Fred Willard (DATE MOVIE) is the first human we see (but only through billboard displays) as the loathsome Shelby Forthright, CEO of the BnL corporation. His last name is a cautionary note to not trust someone just because of their name. John Ratzenberger (RATATOUILLE) is John, an Earthly human in an un-Earthly ship where his every whim is cared for by automatons, turning him and his spaceshipmates into worthless sloths (another cautionary note to not let computers or technology run rampant over us). The spaceship's computer voice is probably one of the funniest of note, because it's narrated by Sigourney Weaver (THE ICE STORM). Anyone who's seen the ALIEN series and GALAXY QUEST knows how Sigourney's previous characters feel about computers.Better known for his sound work in the more recent INDIANA JONES 4 flick, Ben Burtt lends his electrified voice as the main character, Wall-E. Although not much speaking takes place from Wall-E's standpoint, he does have some human moments of loneliness and tenderness (once another mechanical being arrives). EVE, Wall-E's love interest, is also electrifyingly voiced by voice actress Elissa Knight (she was Tia in the other Pixar hit, CARS). Her arrival on Earth heralds new hope for Wall-E that his life of loneliness might come to an end.Despite all its character and whiplash faults, Wall-E is a movie of environmental importance. It shows us what we as humans might do to the only planet we can call home, and what might happen if we allow ourselves to go too far in damaging her. That, at the very least, makes this a watchable film.",6,3,6,18 November 2008
The Good Shepherd," A Fantastic Espionage/Spy Flick -- Just Don't Look For James Bond
","It's amazing that this film is so highly regarded, especially since we have Matt Damon as the lead character. Damon isn't known for his exciting acting abilities (with the exception of GOOD WILL HUNTING which I consider his quasi-breakout role). He's established himself as Jason Bourne in the BOURNE IDENTITY franchise, but that doesn't take much acting ability and is almost purely a physical job. His character in the OCEAN'S series just seems to go through the motions. He's had limited success in films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and THE DEPARTED. I say 'limited' because it was the other characters and screenplay that brought him recognition more than his own abilities (try imagining Saving Private Ryan without Tom Hanks or The Departed without Leonardo DiCaprio and you'll see what I mean.) So I wasn't drawn to this flick simply because I knew Damon was our main man. But I was wonderfully surprised.Damon was the perfect choice for this role, and that isn't necessarily a compliment. His portrayal of Edward Wilson is flat, ineffectual, and unremarkable, just like the character was supposed to be. Just like many of Damon's previous portrayals. It is this absurd, unemotional character that drives the entire film, and thanks to director/actor Robert DeNiro's relentless pursuit of this movie (it was his pet project for over ten years) we have a gem.Beginning with Robert Kennedy's disastrous Bay of Pigs debacle, the film shows Ed Wilson (Damon) trying to overcome an American/Cuban historical event that many find shameful. The CIA had a leak somewhere that blew the entire assault, and Wilson has to find out who and how. It will take him back to the very beginnings of the CIA, pre-WWII, and then slowly catch up to the1960's.Battling the Cold War with a very worthy Russian opponent, Ed must come to grips with the death of his father (who was an OSS spy in WWI), the loveless relationship with his wife (played by Angelina Jolie), and what he's prepared to do for his son (Eddi Redmayne) when he learns of ignorant betrayal from within.The film really looks at the development of the CIA, how it came to be, what spying is REALLY like (not James Bond-ish), and one man's unwavering support for his country. Dark corners are everywhere, including Ed Wilson's own home. Life and business blur. Separating the man from the mission becomes impossible. A panoply of scenes greets each moment of Ed's life, from the shadowy corners of Post-WWII Berlin to the recesses of his home sanctuary. It's an incredible display with truly gripping photography and a frightening descent into the world of phantom spies.A powerhouse cast graces the screen, with fine performances from such greats as John Turturro (THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING), Joe Pesci and William Hurt (SYRIANA).Surprisingly THE GOOD SHEPHERD has made it up to one of my all-time favorite spy films. But a warning call must be sound here. This isn't your typical spy flick. It won't be for everyone. But if you like to think about where the CIA came from and how espionage jobs really work, this one will be high on your list, too.",10,1,3,9 June 2007
The Blind Side," Sandra Bullock Finally Makes It To The Top
","Making schmaltzy movies is a thing Hollywood is overly good at. Music rises telling us when to get that lump in our throat. Actors talk softly with a glistening eye. And the love-fest ensues.If you abhor these types of films, then you might want to avoid THE BLINDSIDE. Not because all of that is in here, but because some of it is ...but only mildly. If you despise the 'great white person saving the {insert minority here} other person from certain doom' theme, you might want to avoid this flick, too. Yes, some of that is in here, too. So why, oh why, did I rate this film so highly. Well, it's not overly schmaltzy nor overly great-white-hope-ish either. It is a (relatively) true telling of NFL star Michael Oher's early, troubled life in Memphis, Tennessee.Homeless at 16 (and without parental guidance), 'Big Mike' is seen wandering the streets by the affluent Leigh Tuohy (Sandra Bullock, THE LAKE HOUSE) and her family. They do 'the good Christian thing' and offer the big guy a place to sleep for the night. But as the strong, silent Michael attempts to leave the next day, Leigh decides to have him stay another night. And so goes his induction into the Tuohy family.But before he gets into the NFL, Michael (Quinton Aaron) must first pass high school and then get into college. He must overcome the whitewashed system of academia in upscale Memphis to do it, too. He soon receives help with the arrival of a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates, CHARLOTTE'S WEB) who toughens up Michael's mental muscle and prepares him for his college days.Most of this is just backstory, however, for the main event, which is Michael's immediate rise onto the football circuit. His size and speed shock all those who watch his games, making him a prime candidate for college scouts.The film isn't without its funny moments, though, most of which are thanks to S.J. (Jae Head, HANCOCK), the Tuohy's youngest – and very small – son who helps Michael navigate through all of the college offers that come his way. There are also some combo touchy-feely and comical moments. The one that comes to mind is when the Tuohy's ask Michael to become a member of their family and he says, 'I thought I already was.' The main draw here is, finally, Sandra Bullock. Not known as a powerhouse actress and more as one who goes after the money, Bullock may have gotten lucky and found the part she could play so well that it grabbed her an Oscar. Her Leigh portrayal was truly excellent. But was it as good as, say, Gabourey Sidibe's PRECIOUS? Or Meryl Streep's Julia Child in JULIE AND JULIA? Some think not (Does Meryl need another Oscar? I mean, really!) Regardless, I think sports movie fans will gobble up this one just as much as HOOSIERS and ROCKY.",8,0,1,16 May 2010
Music and Lyrics," Saved From Depravity By The Dialogue
","Although terribly predictable and not just a bit trite, MUSIC AND LYRICS is saved from depravity by some good acting by lead actors Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, and by the excellent usage of dialogue and music videos from bygone days.Falling well into the category of romantic comedies, Music and Lyrics starts out with a bang by showing Grant in tight leather pants with the heavy 80s hairdo during an MTV-style music video with his old band 'Pop!'Although not the lead singer for the group, Alex Fletcher (Grant) is second-in-command during the band's heyday. But like many rock-n-rollers, their group disbands and the first-in-command launches out on his own, leaving Fletcher as a has-been.Jump ahead a few decades and we find Fletcher grasping at anything he can to keep his name in any sort of musical light. Suddenly an offer comes his way via his failing manager Chris (Brad Garrett, EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND TV series). He must compose one song for a superstar named Cora (Haley Bennett). She's 'bigger than Brittany' Fletcher is told and she needs a song with some umpf! to wrap-up her latest album. A lyricist is quickly dispatched to Fletcher's apartment but they immediately clash. As they try to agree on the lyrics and the music, a young and somewhat neurotic house plant caretaker begins humming the song and coming up with her own lyrics. Fletcher catches her words and incorporates them. And thus Sophie (Drew Barrymore, CHARLIE'S ANGELS) becomes his new lyricist.Grant really steals the show here, his line delivery flawless and his portrayal of an aging rocker pulled off exceptionally well (when he nearly dislocates a hip on stage, it's laugh-out-loud funny). Nothing can be taken away from Barrymore, however. She plays fine beside Grant but just isn't up to his level. But this is probably the best role many viewers have ever seen her in. She's not throwing punches or high-kicking some bad guy in the face. She's a character here and not simply a vehicle for action.The supporting cast also pulls this common storyline up a notch. The previously mentioned Brad Garrett is terrifically funny as Hugh Grant's manager, and so is Kirsten Johnson (THIRD ROCK FROM THE SUN TV series) as Barrymore's older sister and someone who was obsessed with Grant's old 'Pop!' band. Newcomer Haley Bennett plays the airheaded pop star to a tee, rightfully making you cringe every time she opens her mouth ('We need to go to the roof. That's upstairs') or puts on some sleazy piece of clothing.Keep your expectations on an even keel, though. The ending is straight out of Hollywood's happy ending catalogue but the dialogue will keep you engaged enough for an enjoyable ride.",7,0,0,17 May 2007
The Queen," Is It a Hit? Or a Miss?
","Sometimes it's a hit or miss with directors, and with Stephen Frears at the helm the odds of a film being a success versus failure are about fifty/fifty. He has given us some excellent cinema such as High Fidelity, Dangerous Liaisons, and The Grifters. But sometimes his movie eye misses the mark or lacks an intriguing or well-rounded story. Mrs. Henderson Presents, Mary Reilly, and Hero are just a sprinkling of Frear films that had a good shot at being great, but ultimately failed in coherency, pacing, or some other aspect.THE QUEEN is certainly a film with some great acting. Helen Mirren is spot-on as Queen Elizabeth II, as was Michael Sheen in his portrayal of Tony Blair. But from here the cast sags quite a bit. James Cromwell picked up the part of Prince Philip, but seemed very out of place since he has been typecast in such things as The West Wing TV series and The Sum of All Fears flick. And Sylvia Syms (as The Queen Mother) and Alex Jennings (as Prince Charles) were difficult to see in their respective roles since they are still in the public eye. Although Queen Elizabeth is still in the spotlight, Helen Mirren's strong portrayal made that role much easier to swallow.Fresh subjects are tough to hit upon anyway, and you have to give credit where it is due; Stephen Frears certainly deserves some acclaim for simply attempting to make a film about the Royal Family and their reaction (or non-reaction) to Princess Diana's accidental death. But herein lies another problem: plot. There isn't one. The Queen is a reactionary tale, focusing mainly on Queen Elizabeth and the newly installed Prime Minister Tony Blair, and how each of them views the country's response to Di's death. Of course, the Queen deals with it by not dealing with it. While Mr. Blair continually tries to save the monarchy from self-destructing due to their own ignorance of the peoples' grief. But there isn't a definitive beginning, middle and ending to the story. It's character study of the monarchy will probably be boring to many, especially in the beginning. Most viewers may feel like dozing off after the first twenty minutes of disinteresting royal uppityness.Although the beginning and middle of the film lag, the ending picks up just enough to make it watchable. The excellent shots of Balmoral Castle and its Scottish surroundings were fairly awesome, as were some analogies regarding the royal deer that roam the outback wildlands.If you enjoy a good modern day character study, and are interested in the current monarchy, you'll probably eat this film up. But if you're eager for something plot-driven and deeply intriguing, you best look elsewhere.",5,5,7,27 December 2006
The Iron Giant," Friendship. Love. Respect.
","Friendship. Love. Respect. Growing up. These are the themes that run throughout THE IRON GIANT, an Oscar Award winning animated film from 1999. Kids films without substance are very familiar to most parents, but The Iron Giant hearkens back to a time when family and friendship meant everything.Although unusual in the sense that a boy named Hogarth (voiced by Eli Marienthal) befriends an alien robot simply called The Iron Giant (voiced by Vin Diesel), this animated feature still teaches kids the responsibilities of friendship and how devastating it can be to lose one.The set-up is common in that we see the military and government agents as bumbling morons who misunderstand the intentions of something as large and as powerful as a nearly indestructible robot. But understanding eventually reaches them, too, through the actions of Hogarth and his new alien buddy.More interesting than previous animation films for kids, this one shows not just the upside of this friendship, but the dangers ...as well as a fatal ending (sort of). Parents should be prepared to comfort their kids when The Iron Robot launches himself into space in preparation to save his best friend (Hogarth). The words 'Superman' are uttered as The Iron Giant makes contact with the powerful and deadly rocket, and I'd be willing to bet that there's not an adult out there with any heart that won't swallow hard at those words.But there are plenty of fun and funny scenes to counter the more stark ones. Watching fellow humans complain to the local constabulary about suddenly absent mouthfuls of trucks, towers, and other metal munchables is pretty comical, as is a great scene where The Iron Giant does a cannonball jump into a favorite swimming hole of Hogarth's.A fun and serious film with themes that most parents will find a positive influence on the pliable minds of their young ones.",8,0,0,17 February 2008
Iron Man," A True Blockbuster
","With a meteoric rise from first-time film making Marvel Enterprises, we get to see an action-packed, funny, and eye-popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.To start with, IRON MAN needed a great lead character. Tony Stark is known to be cocky, good-looking, and an all-around bad-boy. So who better to inhabit this persona than Robert Downey Jr. (GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK). I think most people know Downey Jr.'s difficulties and run-ins with the law over the past several years, and I could think of no one better to pull off this character than someone who has some of those very same flaws. You also need a good villain, and Obadiah Stane was the perfect stab-in-the-back. Played very well by the surprising Jeff Bridges (TIDELAND), I found myself repulsed by his money-mongering ways that Tony (Downey Jr.) wants so badly to be rid of after considering (and witnessing) the human cost. We get a bit of romantic/sexual tension, too, in the form of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, PROOF), Tony Stark's life secretary. The drop-dead gorgeous dress that Potts wears to a dance and the subsequent almost-kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic-book-to-film venture.Another huge plus for the film is the amazing CGI. Never once will the audience believe they aren't watching real life. This is, in part, thanks to Downey Jr.'s incorporation into these scenes as he tries and often fails to get his Iron Man suit off the ground. It's also hilarious to watch Tony Stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).I also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue: Stark: 'Okay, seriously, I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest...'Jimmy: 'We can talk, sir.'Stark: 'Oh, I see. So it's personal. Alright.'Ramirez: 'You intimidate them, sir.'Stark: 'Good god, you're a woman! I honestly couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.'Ramirez: 'I'm an airman.'Stark: 'Well you actually have excellent bone structure there. I'm having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?'This kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.Plenty of times movie-goers have seen films with a lot of action and no substance, but Iron Man happily  and easily  gives us both. It's well-deserving of the title 'blockbuster.' And if you really want to see what lay ahead for Iron Man, please stay til after the credits have finished rolling. You'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.",10,1,3,15 May 2008
Casino Royale," How Bond Became 007
","How did James Bond become a '00' agent? What makes him so good at his job and so distant to the beautiful women he often encounters? Wrap your mind around those questions and then go and see director Martin Campbell's latest Bond flick, CASINO ROYALE. That someone could pull off such a fantastic film whilst giving us the Bond-background is something of a marvel. Leave aside (for the moment) that Daniel Craig isn't as debonair as previous Bonds, and you just may enjoy Casino Royale on a level never before seen.It's simply a fact that Craig isn't the dashing, clean-cut, and uppity Bond audiences have come to expect. He's rougher, tougher, and a bit naive. He loves instead of lusts. He learns to kill with a conscious (in the beginning), but still delivers pithy lines ('That last hand nearly killed me.') The question of James Bond's beginnings have always been in question and Casino Royale gives them to us while also delivering the action, a few gadgets, a kick-butt automobile, and the curvaceous women we expect.Director Martin Campbell first cut his teeth on a Bond film with GOLDEN EYE in 1995, so he knows the lay of the land. He also went on to direct the stylish THE MASK OF ZORRO in 1998. From there his repertoire stammers with several duds, but came back in glaringly fine fashion with this year's Casino Royale.From the opening credits with its flashy and somewhat retro poker card graphics, to the black-and-white film stock beginning, audiences immediately realize they're in for something special. We quickly watch Bond make his first two kills, granting him access to his 007 status. Then we get to see him nearly ruin his career by causing an international crisis. From here he's sent on hiatus by M (Judi Dench, MRS. HENDERSON PRESENTS) to get his head together. But of course Bond never lets go of an assignment until it's finished. Continuing his international crisis across borders, he travels to a tropical island where he meets up with terrorists who are trying to advance their causes by selling bomb-making material. He meets up with one of the racketeers' wives in true Bond fashion. But the British Secret Service have their eyes on him and quickly find out what he's up to. They are forced to go along with Bond's plans to enter into a high-stakes poker game with the evil Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen, EXIT), a facially scarred and blood weeping villain who recently lost a ton of money because of Bond's interference in his 'business'. If Le Chiffre wins the $120 million game, he'll have enough money to get back into supporting bombers and bomb-makers.Bond also happens to be The Service's best card player, but he has to convince the penny pinchers of the British government that he's got a good chance of winning or they'll refuse to back him (if Bond loses the British will, in effect, be sponsoring terrorism). Enter Vesper Lynd (Eva Green, KINGDOM OF HEAVEN), a government finance agent who agrees to give James Bond the money to enter the tournament. As the cards fall, so does Bond's chances. As all appears hopeless, Bond wins the tournament, thus crushing Le Chiffre's chances at re-entering terrorist haven, and threatening his very existence because he's lost all of his financing given to him by the dark forces of the world (they'll obviously want their money back at some point and now Le Chiffre is broke). Obviously Le Chiffre is none to happy about Bond winning and kidnaps him and Vesper.By now Bond has grown very fond of Vesper and they form a relationship unheard of in terms of Bondom. He confesses his love for her and eventually (after a dizzying and testicularly funny escape from the clutches of death), agrees to leave the Queen's Service in order to live a life of love and happiness with her. But all Bond fans know this cannot be. A sense of terrible foreboding grips the film as Bond learns the true nature of Vesper.It's wonderful to see how all of this effects James Bond and how it coalesces to help form the Ian Fleming character we've all grown up with. Vesper, through Bond's love of her and her betrayal of him, helps turn James into the tough-loving, womanizer we all know. This betrayal also lets us see why James Bond doesn't trust anyone and prefers to work solo.So Daniel Craig being a bit rougher around the edges in appearance actually fit the script nicely. He IS rougher. He IS tougher. And he IS the Bond we've come to enjoy.(Note: Caution to all those who get this when it comes out on DVD. There is another comedy film entitled CASINO ROYALE starring Peter Sellers, so make sure you're aware of which is which.)",9,2,4,24 November 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Another Hypersexual Film By Woody Allen
","It's official: Javier Bardem (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN) is the luckiest man/actor on the planet! I mean, this guy gets to make out with three of the most gorgeous women acting today. Forget that one of them is his current girlfriend (Penelope Cruz). He also got down with hottie Rebecca Hall (THE PRESTIGE) and ultimate hottie Scarlett Johansson (MATCH POINT). Regardless of how I felt about the rest of the film, there was plenty of eye-candy for guys. And those ladies who think Javier isn't too shabby himself, well, there's that, too.But let me explain why I'm talking about how good-looking these folks are on-screen and why I started my review in such an unabashed way. Director Woody Allen is well-known for his love of beautiful people. Everything from SLEEPER to MATCH POINT has been sexually charged, to say the least. But his take on relationships is exceptionally skewed toward the hyper-sexual, and that's even more true here. Some might compare this to his private life, but I'll leave that alone ...for now.This time we have two women, Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) on vacation in Barcelona, Spain. The two are good friends and Vicky (Hall) is taking a break in preparation for marriage to Doug (Chris Messina), whom she leaves back in the States. Cristina isn't even close to being ready for marriage, and rips through relationships like a laundry woman through sheets. Then the two ladies meet Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem) who approaches them with a unique proposal: fly away with him to his house in the north and have sex with him; both of them. At the same time, perhaps. This doesn't surprise Vicky, who immediately labels him a troll with artistic aspirations. But Cristina is intrigued by his forwardness, and the two ladies go with him to his beautiful Spanish home. But Cristina gets sick after eating some bad food, which leaves Vicky and Juan Antonio together, and opposite sparks fly. Then, after Cristina gets better, Juan Antonio takes her into his bed, too. But then a phone call in the middle of the night leads to Juan Antonio's ex-wife, Maria Elena (Penelope Cruz), coming to stay with them after a suicide attempt. Cristina and Juan become closer. His ex-wife and Cristina become closer. Juan Antonio and his ex-wife reignite their passions ...with Cristina getting involved with both of them, if you know what I mean.Meanwhile, Vicky is struggling to deal with her feelings on the night when she weakened and had sex with Juan Antonio. She begins questioning whether she's ready for marriage. But then Dough, her fiancé, comes to Spain with the option to get married there before returning to the States and 'doing it up right.' There are quite a few twists and turns in the multiple relationships that wind and unwind themselves. And that is what made most of the story interesting (that and the beautiful people surrounded by the beauty of Barcelona). So you can see why I started my review the way I did. It's mainly about how sexually charged relationships can change (or maybe not change) who we are. Which brings me to my next point: Penelope Cruz's Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress. I'm not gonna take anything away from her. She did a fine job. But she wasn't on-screen very much. Personally, I think Rebecca Hall got gypped during the Oscar's. Her battles for her emotional stability were what kept me watching, not Penelope Cruz. Hall's character was so conflicted that I could empathize with her. While Cruz's character only made me laugh because she seemed almost like a caricature.Still, it's an interesting film to watch. But it's really just another Woody Allen sex-take on relationships.",6,1,3,20 May 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A Grand Costume Drama About One Helluva Queen
","ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE is a costume drama based on the factual life of Queen Elizabeth I (played by Cate Blanchett, THE GOOD German). Blanchett reprises her role as the highly successful mother to a nation  England  from the 1998 film, ELIZABETH.With gorgeous costumes and scrumptious period locations, Elizabeth: The Golden Age is a very successful film. The dizzying camera work helps portray the immensity of the structures built for the times, and the dark qualities of rooms during stormy nights or barbaric incarcerations is shown exceptionally well.The focus on this film (versus that of its predecessor) is on the time of prosperity coming due for England as it comes out from under the oppressive thumb of the overzealous Catholic King Philip II of Spain (played by Jordi Molla) during the Spanish inquisition. The ultimate destruction of Spain's navy during a horrendous storm ushers in a time of peace for England. Initially Elizabeth is besieged with matters that demand her attention, all while loving vicariously through one of her women in waiting, 'Bess' (Abbie Cornish) who is enamored (as is the Queen herself) with Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen, SHOOT 'EM UP).Being able to reduce herself to a normal woman for even a brief moment is an incredible pleasure to the Queen, and Sir Raleigh allows her these moments whenever he's around. But both know that they can never be together; the Queen because of what's required of her as a noblewoman; and Raleigh because he's basically a pirate with no royal blood. But Raleigh gets as close as he dares by falling for Bess, and eventually marrying her, much to the dismay of the Queen (who, although she knew she and Raleigh could never be together, still dreamt of it).The end of the Spanish armada signals the end of many things: the end of threats from beyond the sea, the end of Elizabeth's possible marriage arrangements, the end of Mary Queen of Scots, and the end of any hopes for a life with someone the likes of Raleigh. But it also heralded a time of awesome prosperity during the incredibly long reign of one of the most successful leaders of the free world.Watching it, one can't help but wonder what would've happened had the Spanish fleet found purchase on the shores of England. Thankfully that never happened and, as an American, I'm doubly glad for it.This is a very well filmed historical costume drama with plenty of outstanding performances and scenery. But it isn't anything we haven't seen before (the aforementioned 1998 Elizabeth film is the prime example). Although there's plenty to look at, most viewers will probably say, 'Yeah. Seen it. Been there.'",8,1,3,9 February 2008
Beowulf," A Hybrid of Live Action And Animation. But Is It For You?
","A $150 million budget. A realistic Healthow voiced by Robin Wright Penn. An even more realistic Hrothgar voiced by Anthony Hopkins (BOBBY). John Malkovich (BURN AFTER READING) as Unferth. Ray Winstone (THE DEPARTED) as the dominating Beowulf. And the sexiest woman alive, Angelina Jolie (WANTED) as Grendel's deceptive mother. I mean, what a cast! This is what great films are made of. And the realism of the computer animation in terms of how they resembled the actual actors was astonishing ...which begged a pretty big question: WHY NOT SIMPLY FILM BEOWULF WITH LIVE ACTION AND NOT ANIMATION?! Cost was probably an issue, but with the $150 million budget I think they could've done a fine live action film. In 2005 Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarson proved it could be done with his very nicely done BEOWULF & GRENDEL starring Gerard Butler (300). With comparable run times (103 minutes to 114 minutes) and Beowulf & Grendel's much lower budget (I believe it was around $75 million), it can be done and done well if you have the inclination. But, for whatever reason, director Robert Zemeckis (MONSTER HOUSE) decided to shoot it this way.It may sound as if I'm bashing animated films in general, which I'm not. There are some really great ones out there (FINDING NEMO, HOODWINKED, etc.), so animation can be pulled off if care is taken to present it as such. But with Beowulf, it seems they were trying to mix live action with animation in order to produce some sort of hybrid ...which simply didn't work for me. It might for some and that's fine, but, if you're going to show realistic characters that look like the actual actors, why not simply do live action? It's so maddening! It was nice, however, to see some care taken with the source material (namely Neil Gaiman's reimagining of the epic poem by the same name). Beowulf had some shady dealings and it was refreshing to see this brought out in the story and not simply showing him as some flawless hero.Still, if you're into animation, this one might not work for you. Or if you're solely a live action fan, this one might REALLY bug you. So beware. You've been warned.",6,0,0,31 December 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," A Return To The Die Hard Style We So Love!
","Ready. Set. Action! Action being the key word here. LIVE FREE OF DIE HARD (aka Die Hard 4) is an action-fest filled with wonderfully similar themes we've all seen in the first DIE HARD film. Bruce Willis (16 BLOCKS), of course, returns as officer-cum-detective John McClane.He's beat. He's tired. He's beat tired. But family always comes first, and McClane is first seen spying on his college daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, BOBBY), trying to protect for the wiles of the world. Naturally Lucy despises his attempts to protect her and storms off. Later, she will come to respect her father and proudly announce that her last name isn't Genero, but McClane.John then gets an assignment as a taxi. He's told to pick up a computer hotshot named Matthew Farrell (Justin Long, THE BREAK UP) and bring him to a special FBI task force that's tracking a string of computer crimes targeted at the American infrastructure. Once McClane and Matthew meet, it rapidly becomes apparent that somebody wants Matthew dead. Bullets fly. Bombs go off. McClane, again, is in way over his head ...exactly where Die Hard fans want him.A computer heist known as a 'fire sale' is taking place in which everything vital to U.S. survival gets shut down. Traffic. Television and radio. Electricity. Everything that is currently run by high-tech computers is going off-line. Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) is the bad-guy who is initially seen as a terrorist but is later found to have financial aspirations (sound familiar?). When McClane becomes a pest, Gabriel soon turns to kidnapping someone close to the detective's heart.McClane and Matthew race to save America (and a family member) from a devastating computer meltdown. Car and helicopter chases, semi-truck and harrier jet encounters, all build upon the other until the final, fateful end.The dialogue between the computer illiterate McClane and the gurus of the internet are hilariously pulled off. The geeks can't get to where they need to be unless McClane blasts their way through, and McClane doesn't know what to do unless he's told by the geeks.A great fight sequence between Bruce Willis and Maggie Q (BALLS OF FURY) is something to watch for, especially since Willis' character ends up back in an elevator shaft (homage to Die Hard 1). It's also entertaining to see Willis' McClane get his butt stomped by the sexy Asian woman ...for a while.And let's not forget one of the coolest stunts seen on celluloid in some time: a car launch and crashing into a helicopter. Although completely unrealistic, it was amazingly awesome to watch.This is something Die Hard fans have been waiting for; another film that is overly-audacious and loaded with nonstop action scenes. It's flat-out fun!",8,1,3,21 November 2007
Munich," Spielberg May Be Slipping...
","Most people over the age of 40 remember the terrible events surrounding the killing of the 1972 eleven-member Israeli Olympic team by a group of Palestinian extremists. Their abduction from Munich and ultimate death pulled a shroud over the games. Because of this horrific event, security at subsequent Olympic games has been ratcheted up significantly. But that's not why we're here discussing Steven Spielberg's film. We're here to see why I didn't give it a resounding 'Thumbs Up'.Historically MUNICH is interesting. Not only does it show the horrors mankind can inflict upon one another, but it also shows the repercussions of reacting in an equal measure of violence to such an event. When Israel decides to form a death squad and send them out to eliminate the terrorists who dealt the deadly blows to the Israeli Olympians, a message we've heard a million times comes a-smackin' us in the face: evil begets evil.The acting is fairly blasÃ© with the exception of the main character, Avner (Eric Bana TROY.) In fact, I can't recall a single other memorable person in the film. I remember that there's a bomb-maker, a clean-up man, and a couple of shooters, but that's all I remember of them.The length of the film is extreme. At 2 hours and 44 minutes, nodding off was almost inevitable. Mr. Spielberg is, perhaps, spoiled in that he can do whatever he wants in Hollywood and for as long as he wants (the remake of WAR OF THE WORLDS being a prime example.) I don't mean to belittle the atrocious circumstances surrounding this true story, nor do I mean to invalidate the message Steven Spielberg so desperately wants to get across to us. It's a vital and unfortunate part of human history. But I felt the story lagged and was forced upon the viewer rather than coming across in a fluid manner.Although I watched and enjoyed the Oscars this year, MUNICH stood out as the 'stinker' in the Best Film category. I would've much preferred to see HUSTLE AND FLOW in the mix instead of this flick.",3,0,5,5 June 2006
Fantastic Four," Comic-Book-To-Film Goes Fantastic
","There are serious SF films then there are entertaining SF films and, as of late, the film industry has seen fit to adapt several comic book SF characters onto the silver screen. Whether or not these are serious or entertaining is often left up to the viewer's discretion. Some have been great (Spiderman) and some not-so-great (Catwoman). Then we have this movie, the FANTASTIC FOUR.Debuting in 1961 (Marvel Comics), the Fantastic Four hit on new ground: a dysfunctional family of sorts who fight amongst themselves as much as they do against the forces of evil. Unable to decide on costumes, they really had none for several episodes. All of them gained their superpowers from exposure to cosmic rays while visiting a space-station.Jump to 2005 and we get the entire dysfunctional dynamic rolled into a 105 minute film; not an easy task. But director Tim Story does an admirable job with writers Mark Frost and Michael France's screenplay. The space-station, the problems with costumes, the infighting, it's all there (thus my positive rating).The beautiful Jessica Alba stars as the sexy, kick-a$$ Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman. Her powers include the ability to manipulate matter and light. Chris Evans (whom I'd personally give top billing) brings to life the role of Johnny Storm/The Human Torch, Sue's immature younger brother who can spark up any room with his powers and his wit. And Mr. Evans instills some much needed comedy into the flick by playing pranks on the other three as well as having some great dialogue. Ioan Gruffudd bends the silver screen as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, the flexible rubberman who is the defacto leader of the Fantastic Four (and who's also in love with Sue Storm). Then we have Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) who's increased mass and stone-like structure have given him incredible strength and some problems at home. He's uneffectually called The Thing and his wife leaves him posthaste when she discovers his altered physical structure.The great thing about the film is that it really looks at the issues surrounding being a newly developed superhero and how people might respond to such a thing. For one thing, when Ben Grimm's wife leaves him, she pulls off her wedding ring and Ben/The Thing tries to pick it up but can't because of his bulky hands. It's actually a fairly touching scene and we can feel Ben's frustration. Also there's the lost love between Sue Storm and Reed Richards which is always in the background and causes flare-ups and fights constantly. Then there's Johnny Storm's discovery of his flaming superpowers and his difficulty in controlling them (or lack of wanting to control them). He's a cocky upstart who brings an entirely new dynamic to the group which is why I'd give him top billing.The film's faults are easily seen as we're rushed through certain aspects (how they plan to get back to normal using a machine created by Richard) and several convenient plot twists (not uncommon, though, for comic books).This is a fun film. It's not at the level of Spiderman, but it's way, way above Catwoman.",7,0,1,12 May 2006
Click," Is Click A Clunker?
","Watching CLICK is like watching two separate movies. The blatant parallels to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE are transparent, but that's not what makes Click a clunker. Not that it is a clunker in its entirety, either.The story surrounds Michael Newman (Adam Sandler, WATERBOY), an architect who yearns for peace and harmony in his life. Part of the problem is the competition (keeping up with the Jones') that he has going on with his neighbors. They have a new RV, new toys and new cars, while Michael and his family just get by. One evening he hears the irritating boy next door talking about his father's new universal remote control that's patched into everything (garage door, TV, stereo, etc.) and it's all that Michael can take. So he heads out to the mall and stops at (of all places) Bed, Bath and Beyond. It is the 'Beyond' that apparently pulls him in, but once inside all he finds are towels and bedding. He lays down on one of these and then quickly spots a doorway that says 'Beyond'. It looks rather ethereal yet inviting, so Michael goes on in. What he finds is a whacked out looking guy named Morty (Christopher Walken) who offers him a truly 'Universal Remote.' This remote control does it all. It can rewind you to your birth so that you can witness it (or your conception, something we should NEVER have to see), or it can fast-forward you through troubling times, like arguments with your spouse or personal illnesses. The dangers of this Universal Remote aren't evident right away. Apparently, as this magical tool gets used to your requests, it does them automatically for you, without you having to push a button. So when Michael fast forwards through arguments with his wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale), the remote does it automatically for him in the future. Thus, large chunks of what might seem like inane discussions suddenly are wiped away.Michael soon discovers that his life is in constant fast forward. His job, his kids, his wife, even his own body, change in rapid succession as the Universal Remote takes over. Trying to give back this dangerous piece of machinery, we soon learn that Morty is much more than he seems.The great thing about the film is the last 2/3 of it (with the exception of the ending, which we'll cover in a moment). When people learn how important life is, it's truly an eye-opener. And this is where Click succeeds. When Sandler's character learns about death and how important it is to live every second of every day, it is heart renderingly pulled off. We get to witness Sandler rewinding time and again the important portions of his life that he missed. And, near the end of his own life, we witness his evolution into a man of distinction, trying to save his son from his own deadly mistakes related to family.Where the film fails is the beginning and it's horribly clichéd ending. The beginning of the film is filled with bathroom humor (farting in people's faces) and gag jokes that sag under their own terrible weight. This is where one feels like they are watching an entirely different film when compared to the latter 2/3 of the movie. The characters are one-dimensional and utterly unbelievable (quite the dichotomy from what we see later). This isn't a character evolution issue as much as a script failure.The ending of the film is what finally gives it a poor rating. When we see Sandler lay down at Bed, Bath and Beyond, a creeping disgust enters the mind. The film-makers surely wouldn't use one of the oldest clichés in the book, would they? But, oh yes, they did. Grrr! The unfortunate thing about Click is that it really has a wonderful message and some fine acting moments. Special effect make-up artist Rick Baker also deserves much credit for the aging looks he puts the characters through, from Henry Winkler's role as Sandler's father, to Sean Astin's speedo and chubby swim instructor, it was one of the strongest aspects of the entire production.As a whole, the film fails because of its childish beginnings and over-used style ending. But make no mistake, there are some great moments in here. Just not enough to give it a high ranking.",5,0,1,11 October 2006
Pineapple Express," Cheech And Chong Redux...
","After hearing just about everyone I know gush about PINEAPPLE EXPRESS, I finally got around to watching it. Perhaps I waited too long, or perhaps I've seen another movie that leaves it in the dust. But, for whatever reason, there just wasn't much appeal for me.The film I'm referring to that left Pineapple Express in the dust is none other than TROPIC THUNDER. Some might find the comparison unfair, but it really isn't. Both have that Jerry Bruckheimer-esquire action quality to them. Both bill themselves as heavy comedies. And both have plenty of star power. But Pineapple Express started out slow, building up steam before finally getting several guffaws out of me, while Tropic Thunder did it from the first moment the screen lit up.More like a modernization of a Cheech and Chong flick, Pineapple Express shows the imbecility of the marijuana culture but does so by placing it within the vehicle of friendship. Seth Rogen (KNOCKED UP) stars as a 30-something-year-old loser Dale Denton who's job is that of a process server. And he's good at it. He could serve a summons on the pope if he had to. But he's also heavily into pot and gets it from his dealer-turned-buddy Saul Silver (James Franco, IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH). Everything is going along fine (including Dale hooking up with an 18-year-old high school hottie) until he witnesses the murder of a Chinese man at the hands of drug lord Ted Jones (Gary Cole, TALLADEGA NIGHTS) and a female police officer (Rosie Perez). Troubles deepen as Dale becomes paranoid after smoking some of the new bud he'd purchased called Pineapple Express. Saul, his dealer, is the only one in the city who has the stuff, and when Dale panicked and left behind a roach after fleeing the scene of the murder, Ted figures out who the witness might be and sends a couple of thugs out to find him.Dale and Saul flee for their lives, not that they were initially in danger, and into the woods, where they continue tokin' and eventually fall into a deep comatose state. When they awaken many hours later, they formulate a plan to find out if anyone is looking for them. They head out to Saul's distributor, a guy named Red (Danny R. McBride, TROPIC THUNDER) who initially tries to turn them in but later changes his karma and becomes practically immune to bullet holes.Although there are some laugh-out-loud funny moments, they don't come until later in the film. One particularly funny scene involves Red crashing through a burning barn in a car, instantly killing a thug, and then jumping from the car and shooting the dead guys foot off. Both crude and grossly hysterical.The ending is fairly anticlimactic with the stoned-out, burned-out, beat-up, and shot-up trio (Dale, Saul, and Red) sitting in a café waiting for a ride and sucking down food in a post-smoking haze. Not much to laugh about there. Perhaps I wasn't toked-up enough myself....",7,2,5,20 February 2009
Moon," Oscar worthy performance and film...
","Shot in just 33 days for a paltry $5 million by first time director Duncan Jones, MOON is as much of a breakthrough for this unknown director as DISTRICT 9 was for (relatively new) Neill Blomkamp. Yes, it's THAT good.Clocking in at only 97 minutes, the film also gives a sense of urgency to a situation that easily could have been snooze inducing. Instead, Moon will have you on the edge of your proverbial couch, cheering on its main protagonist(s) and asking tough questions about big business, genetic research, and what it means to be human.Sam Rockwell (FROST/NIXON) is in almost every frame and pulls in an Oscar caliber performance (although I doubt he'll get nominated since this isn't a big budget flick and hit only a limited number of theaters before going to DVD). Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a lonely man. In fact, he is the only man at a moon-base that collects Helium-3, a valuable energy commodity that gets shot back to Earth. Sam's only companion is a Hal-9000-ish machine called Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey, RECOUNT) who's sole job is to protect Sam. But not for long, because Sam's three year contract at the lunar base is coming to a close and he's ready to return to his beautiful wife and daughter back home. But an accident injures Sam and he awakens in the infirmary with Gerty caring for him.Memory gaps and surprisingly good physical condition (after such a bad accident) allows Sam to get back to work quickly. But he soon discovers a stranger trapped in a vehicle, and this stranger looks a lot like Sam.As the two Sam's fight, argue and eventually gain an understanding of what they are, a terrible realization hits them both. It is a poignant, graphic and horrible moment that will have many a hair standing up on peoples' necks when they see what has happened and what lengths a corporation is willing to go to in order to minimize expenses.The time spans are fascinating and leave much open for discussion. How long can one truly last living alone on the moon? How much radiation exposure would you get? And how long, genetically, was Sam designed to last? None of the answers are readily available, but most viewers will be asking themselves these things long after the movie has finished running its final credits.Congratulations must be given to director Duncan Jones for chasing after Sam Rockwell to do this role; he was, no doubt, the absolute perfect person to do it. Also, the miniature moon-scape scenes were phenomenal and never looked cheap or forced, as did the lunar station.The music was the perfect mix of creepiness and forlorn so that you really don't know how to feel about Sam and his predicament at the end. Empathy is there for sure, but what good it does is anyone's guess.Looking for a great independent film that you won't soon forget? Shoot for the Moon.",10,5,9,29 January 2010
Slumdog Millionaire," Bollywood Trumps Hollywood?
","I'm going to try and do this film justice by reviewing it with as keen an eye as I can muster, but I fear I'll still fall far short of the mark ...so here goes...SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the best movie of the year for a couple of reasons. The first is that it is both compartmentalized and global at the same time. It harkened me back to my love of another favorite film of mine, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, in which a man sits in a police station and tells his story in flashback. But any similarities between these two ends with the police station and their equally excellent scripts (sidenote: The Usual Suspect remains my top favorite film script of all time but this one's pulling up close).Slumdog takes place at a police station as young man named Jamal (Dev Patel) goes through a tortuous interrogation at the hands of India's police force. Having recently been on India's version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire'  and answered all of the questions correctly so far  he was whisked off to the local constables office on the possibility of having cheated. The show has had lawyers, doctors, physicists, and many other well-educated people on the show who didn't get as far as Jamal, so how did he  a chai tea delivery boy  get so far (only one more question remains and he'll have his million)? The story is complex, funny, grotesque, horrible and loving, all within the same breath. Each answer comes not from Jamal's limited education, but from his time on India's hard-bitten streets where he grew up an orphan along with his brother, Salim (Madhur Mittal). Having watched their mother murdered during a religious uprising against Muslims, Jamal and Salim had to make their way in the world on their own, their paths separating wildly and then re-merging, often years later. But during their younger days as little kids, they encountered a pretty young orphan girl named Latika (the amazingly beautiful Freida Pinto), whom Jamal finds an instant fascination with. And it is his fascination and love for her that will drive him for the rest of his young life ...which include his chances on the millionaire show. Separated time and again (including thanks to the departure from his brother as he falls in with some very bad gangsters), Jamal never gives up his quest to be with her, even when it seems impossible.It is Jamal's remembrances of his street life that are the hardest to watch, making for some gritty scenes (and some funny ones, including a scene where Jamal must jump down a latrine hole in order to escape and get a much-wanted autograph from a local movie star). Forced child labor is nothing new in India's slums, and it is brought into nauseating focus as we watch kids beaten, deformed ('Blind singers earn twice as much') and sent onto the streets to beg for money ...all at the hands of adults wanting to take advantage no matter the cost.The stories back and forth nature (like the aforementioned The Usual Suspects) was a great way to show Jamal's life in a bubble. The audience really, really, really cared for him and wanted to see him win (the show I went to had audience members applauding  loudly  when the film ended), showing how well the script was put together and how well acted the film was by these relative unknowns (the only actor I was familiar with was Irrfan Khan who was in another favorite Bollywood film of mine entitled THE NAMESAKE ...note: see that movie, too!) Hollywood should take note of this film, and apparently has as the Golden Globes have come out with their nominations (2008) and listed it among four categories (Best Director, Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay).One final note: This film is truly an independent, tolling in at $15 million for production costs. I've seen much, much lesser films (in terms of quality) that had a budget ten times that. But one can't forget that filming in India is much cheaper than here in the States. Still, Hollywood, take notice! This is what great cinema is all about.Oscars! Here comes Bollywood!",10,1,6,3 January 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," A Tale Of Two Struggles: Fatherhood And Financial
","If you're not a feel-good person, it's still okay to watch THE PURSUIT OF Happiness. Although it has some of those moments, it stands out more as a story of human struggle than a touchy-feely film. That it's based on the real-life events of Chris Gardner also increases its emotional heft as the story pulls you in. But there is a bit of cheating that must be mentioned....Most of the story's impact comes from the father/son relationship between Chris (Will Smith, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) and his son Christopher (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden). The interactions between these two are so natural and effortless that it makes watching the film a sheer joy. But herein lay the trap. If any other young actor had played beside Will Smith, I don't think it would've come off as easy. But one can't blame the film team for making this decision. Jaden Smith was the perfect choice, no matter how unfair it might seem to other father/son film's that struggle with the easy-going nature of similar characters.Viewing one man's dogged determination to maintain a functioning relationship with his son would be admirable in today's society no matter what. Especially coming from a financially destitute and broken family. That Chris Gardner refused to give up on his dream of becoming a successful father and businessman is felt throughout the movie as Will Smith's Academy Award nominated performance comes tumbling off the screen. Losing everything only to scramble back up and be repeatedly challenged is nothing new to cinema, but Smith's completely believable performance is something of a wonder. The real Chris Gardner put himself on loan to Smith and the production so that everything had that authentic feel. It also meant that there were fewer liberties taken with the story, as Gardner wouldn't allow certain omissions or changes.The big surprise, though, was Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son. His corny jokes, tickle-fests, vivid imagination (dinosaurs?), and touching dialogue all moved the story into brighter territory during the darkest times. Thandie Newton (CRASH) also plays well as Smith's alienated wife but has little screen time.Learning to never give up on your dreams is something we can all take to the bank. And Mr. Gardner certainly did. He's now a multimillionaire who's assisting the poor in the very San Francisco neighborhood where this sobering story takes place. Giving back to the homeless shelters and getting notice out about hunger in our own cities, Chris Gardner is not only a success, he's smart and thoughtful. If for no other reason than that, you should watch The Pursuit of Happiness.(Note: At the very end of the film, the real Chris Gardner has a cameo spot while wearing a very expensive suit. The film makers did this in order to show how far the Mr. Gardner had come.)",8,0,0,18 April 2007
The Proposal," While You Were Sleeping ....Take 2
","Although entertaining to a point, there are too many similarities to other comedies to make THE PROPOSAL anything but ordinary.Most notably I found the plot to be very similar to another, older Sandra Bullock movie, WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING. But this time we have an accomplice in the deceit and he's not in a coma. Seriously. Think about it...A woman who is in need of something (in this case a need NOT to be deported) comes up with a plan to achieve that goal (whether by accident – While You Were Sleeping – or not – The Proposal). Girl falls for the wrong guy. Guy falls for wrong girl. Family gets fooled. Girl confesses and thinks she's lost everything. Guy chases down girl with the approval of the family. Everyone lives happily ever after. Ta-da! The entertainment value in the film comes from the first half of the movie in which we have plenty of comedic zingers flying about, including quite a few from Grandma Annie (Betty White) while trying to dress Margaret (Sandra Bullock, THE LAKE HOUSE) in a wedding dress and losing – then finding – her breasts.The cast is good in their respective roles, including main love interest Ryan Reynolds (SMOKIN' ACES) playing Andrew Paxton, a sort of rich boy playing poor boy in order to tick-off his father, Joe, played by Craig T. Nelson (THE FAMILY STONE). Nelson just seems to be going through the motions during the entire film and never really gains and traction. As does Mary Steenburgen (THE DEAD GIRL) who plays Reynold's mother.The other problem with the casting is that we just don't get that romantic air between Bullock and Reynolds' characters. She is obviously much older than him (can you say 'cougar?'), which isn't always a problem but, again, there just didn't seem much attraction going on. They fight, argue and never really resolve anything before miraculously falling in love ...because of one kiss? Let's get real...Even with these flaws, the comedic timing is excellent and the visual backdrops of Boston and the (supposed) Alaskan countryside can take one's breath away. Also, the Paxton family house is stunning to see.Looking for something original? Not here. Want a fantastic romance story? Not here either. Looking for something entertaining, funny, and visual appealing? Give this one a try.",6,0,2,24 January 2010
Hustle & Flow," A Movie With A Theme Everyone Can Understand
","Before I start in on this review, I think I need to make a few things clear: 1) I don't watch MTV, and 2) I don't like rap music. Hopefully that will help put things in perspective for those who choose to read this because this isn't a tale about a rapper nor about music; it's the story of never giving up on one's dreams, a universal theme that takes on an entirely new scope in writer/director Craig Brewer's excellent film HUSTLE AND FLOW.I didn't much care for BOYZ IN THE HOOD and I felt that 8-MILE was over-hyped, so I was hesitant to watch something with a similar sounding theme. But my worries were unfounded. Although what you've probably heard is true ('It's the story of a pimp and his whores'), chances are you're only getting a snapshot glimpse of this amazing character film by listening to such a basic definition.Terrence Howard plays D'Jay the pimp, a good pimp, struggling to make ends meet by employing three women in his 'crib'. But a chance encounter with a music mixer whom he used to go to school with lifts his spirits and makes him feel as if he's having a mid-life crisis. D'Jay's attempts to cut his own music consume him, even to the point of using one of his employees' skills to obtain a $250 microphone (sparking off a rather heated exchange, I might add).The fact that the story takes place in Memphis added a genuine sense of realism to the film, too (from the down-and-out neighborhoods and on-location shoots near bridges and underpasses).The actors  without exception  reached deep down into themselves and pulled up some of the finest performances of 2005. Every single actor in the movie LIVED those roles. All of the Oscar nominated films in 2005 (although this one wasn't nominated for Best Picture) held a valid message, and I absolutely loved how different yet similar they were. GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, CAPOTE, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, CRASH and MUNICH all had amazing historical or cultural aspects littered throughout them, and HUSTLE AND FLOW is no exception; why it wasn't nominated in the Best Picture category ahead of MUNICH is a mystery to me, though.Never giving up on your dreams ('By any means necessary') is both the message of the film and of the film-makers. Watching the extra features on the DVD, I learned that the producers shopped around Hollywood for financial backing but couldn't find any. Year after year and studio after studio, they got turned down. So, in the spirit of 'let's go and do it ourselves', they put their own money forward (a measly $8 million sunk into it from pre- to post-production).If you haven't seen this movie just because of what you've heard, you're cheating yourself out of an excellent night of entertainment. Just remember, you don't have to be young to enjoy the themes talked about here. This is dreaming at its ugliest and its best. And I still don't like rap music, but I may be buying the music track to this film.",8,0,1,21 April 2006
Cinderella Man," Another Feel-Good Story From Ron Howard
","Cinderella Man is the story of human victory over seemingly impossible odds. Russell Crowe plays legendary boxer James J. Braddock in Ron Howard's well directed film based on the life of this astounding man.Set during the Great Depression the film takes on the tone of loss as we witness Braddock's initial rise in the boxing ring and then his rapid decline during the disastrous economic punch that landed a low-blow to America. Millions are out of work and on the street. Families are ripped apart. But Braddock and his wife Mae (played by Renee Zellweger) will do anything to keep their heads above water while remaining morally upstanding citizens.Like many families, the Braddocks have to sell just about everything to stay alive. And once everything of value is gone, Braddock has to work at the back-breaking docks, but even that's not enough to sustain them. Braddock is forced to beg for money from acquaintances, and this is a terribly humiliating event to watch. But if that wasn't enough, he has to go to the government office for public assistance.Then a glimmer of hope arrives. His old manager Joe Gould (the awesomely intense Paul Giamoti) offers him one last fight with a heavyweight title contender. The assumption is that Braddock will lose, not having trained for months and having eaten only scraps off the street. But Braddock wins, relaunching his career and eventually getting a shot at Max Baer, the champ who's blows have killed two men already.History tells us that Braddock wins this fight, to the surprise of the then boxing commission and to the joy of millions of downtrodden Americans.More interesting than the crunching blows and bloody fights are the surrounding circumstances of what America was going through at the time and how Braddock held his head high (at least as high as he could) in such trying times.Getting a myopic view of family life during this time was a powerful way to present such a rags to riches story. The costumes and sets were spot-on period perfect and completely immersed the viewer in the times. Filming the struggling family pulled the movie-watcher close to the Braddocks and gave a sense of empathy that few directors can match these days. And the brutal boxing scenes were painful to watch. I flinched several times, wanting to look away but unable to for fear of missing something.Having lavished such praise on this film, I have to comment on the cookie-cutout cinema Mr. Howard chooses to shoot (you remember Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind, right?) Although I enjoy these heart-wrenching and uplifting movies, I do wish that Mr. Howard could break out of that mold and produce something beyond the mainstream.But make no mistake, this is an intense movie with graphic depictions of Braddock landing obscenely hard blows ...and taking them, too. The greatness of the actual filming cannot be denied but the commonality of it won't surprise those who've seen a Ron Howard film in the past.",8,0,0,3 April 2006
Valkyrie," The Critics Were Wrong...
","'Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting...' New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.I'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.VALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that 'I was on the edge of my seat' throughout the second half of the film.So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.",8,28,29,23 May 2010
The Soloist," Steve Lopez And The Real Man
","If there were ever any doubt that Robert Downey Jr. is one of our best current actors out there, then this film should put them to rest. Still having doubts? Check out his more current resume: KISS KISS BANG BANG, GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK, IRON MAN, and his amazing TROPIC THUNDER. And these are just a select few that I've cherry picked. This isn't to say that Jamie Foxx (DREAMGIRLS) didn't do a great job. It's just that Downey Jr. is showing up in some awfully great roles and performing them to perfection, as witnessed here in THE SOLOIST.This is a story close to my heart. Similar in theme to LARS AND THE REAL GIRL, this story doesn't circle around a town coming together to help one man's psyche. This story is about two men who orbit in entirely different galaxies and how a passing swipe ends up creating a lifetime friendship. Yes, there's the mental illness aspect to it and Foxx plays the role of Nathaniel Ayers exceptionally well. His schizophrenia is obvious, and living on the streets hasn't helped. And when newspaper reporter Steve Lopez (Downey Jr.) tries finding a story to write about, he stumbles upon Nathaniel's past as a Juilliard Music School drop-out. Nathaniel plays a violin with only two strings, and as Steve Lopez writes about his newfound friend in the paper, a donation comes floating in: a beautiful cello.This cello has multiple draws for Nathaniel, and some of them aren't good. The positives are that Nathaniel can play a beautiful instrument beautifully. And that he finally starts forming a friendly tie with someone (anyone!) It just happens to be Steve Lopez. Steve starts showing him around the current musical scene. But with Nathaniel's reawakening comes the remembrance of his past and how he got to where he is. His mental breakdown comes crashing back into current memory, even as Steve, his new friend, tries to help him out more and more.The side-story of Steve and his wife's reconciliation (Catherine Keener, AN American CRIME) is pretty much fluff for the movie/story and doesn't add much. It is the touching and powerful story of a friendship forming amidst a respect for one another, a love of music, and facing the challenges of an oft-times debilitating mental illness that drives this wonderful film.And the music ain't too shabby either.",9,0,0,21 September 2009
Up in the Air," A Story Well-Told
","Think you've got plenty of frequent flyer miles? Wait until you meet Ryan Bingham (George Clooney, BURN AFTER READING), a guy who flies almost nonstop. It's his job that gets him Up in the Air all the time. He travels around the States firing people as humanely as he can. Trouble is, though, is that this job makes him the most detached person alive. No family ties. Not married. No kids. Not even a real home anywhere. Ryan lives out of his carry-ons and knows how to move through airports like grease through a goose.But things are about to change. His boss Craig (Jason Bateman, SMOKIN' ACES) just hired a hot-shot who's idea to tele-fire people remotely (via computer) has the potential to ground Ryan. But he's not giving up without a fight. This new up-and-comer named Natalie (Anna Kendrick) has a few thins to learn. So Ryan takes her on the road with him to show her why firing face-to-face has its merits.Paralleling Ryan is the female version of him; a woman named Alex (Vera Farmiga, THE DEPARTED) who so mirrors his sentiments that they seemed destined for one another. Sexual sparks fly but their jobs (and flights) keep them apart more often than not. Which initially seems fine for both of them.As Ryan shows hot-shot Natalie the ropes of how-to and how-not-to fire someone, we learn that Natalie is more brittle than previously believed. A broken relationship with a boyfriend sends her reeling, much to the confusion of Ryan who's never had a serious relationship in his life. 'Everything I own can fit in this backpack. Even my relationships.' But as Ryan sees his job changing, he also sees his life moving in a different direction. He's headed for a three-way fulcrum. The first is that he might actually need someone. And as he begins to see that not everything fits so neatly into his backpack, his feelings for Alex change his views. The second is that he has a family member who's about to get married, and he finds that seeing a wedding and how people actually enjoy needing one another changes his outlook. And finally we get to his frequent flyer miles. He's about to hit a milestone that only a handful of other people have made it to. Millions upon millions of miles. And as the realization that he's collected all of these miles alone comes to him, he finds that maybe, just maybe, he needs to make a connection ...not a connecting flight but an actual human connection.It is here that I have to end my summation of the movie and simply say that this isn't going to be some formulaic film where a person finds what they need and everyone lives happily ever after. Life just isn't that cleanly laid out. I applaud writer/director Jason Reitman for having the gumption to not take the road most traveled. Although I saw what was coming for Ryan after he decided to make a change, the impact of it astounded me. Clooney did a great job making us care for a man that we really shouldn't care for. We want to give him a shot at a normal life, but when that option is snatched away, we feel exactly the same way Ryan does: cheated. Even though he's been a complete butthead most of his life.This is a story with no special effects. No tricks. And it pulls no punches. It's just a great story well-told. I loved it.",10,0,3,12 April 2010
Atonement," Best Picture of 2007? Nope. But Does Have 'Best' Items of 2007...
","With multiple award nominations and plenty of news hype, I decided to check out ATONEMENT strictly to see what all the hubbub was about. Is it over-hyped or does it stand out as 'The Best Picture of 2007'? The answer is both yes and no.Visually it a feast for the eyes. The routing of the English army into Dunkirk is nothing short of amazing. Let me clarify that, too. We don't see the battle leading to Dunkirk but do see the aftermath in all its horribleness. The crumpled structures and damaged soldiers are dark and forbidding, and hold the viewers eyes even though one wants to look away from the destruction and seeming madness plastered on the screen. This was the most intense sequence in the entire film. It was also shot in a most uncommon way, with the camera initially following James McAvoy's character and then the camera splits from him and goes off on its own, but returns to McAvoy later. An interesting way to shoot this series of events.The costumes, sets, and props were perfect. There was not a single thing that took me out of the 1930s and 1940s. Specifically I enjoyed the woolen army uniforms, the streets of early London, and the nursing uniforms the young women wore (again, all perfect).The acting was good. James McAvoy (THE LAST KING OF Scotland) steals most of the show as the good-natured but ultimately wronged Robbie Turner, an educated groundskeeper at a wealthy estate owned by the family of Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN). Knightley does a fair job as Cecilia, a young woman in love with Robbie, a man far beneath her station. When Robbie is wrongfully accused of a heinous crime, Cecilia has to decide between her family or her eventual life with Robbie.But more powerful than Knightley was Romola Garai who plays her sister Briony. Briony is the one responsible for wrongfully turning Robbie over to the authorities after witnessing what she believed to be him performing a crime against a child. It is Briony who really rules the movie, giving us her fervent wish for 'atonement' later in life after realizing what damage she's caused both Robbie and her sister.The powerful Vanessa Redgrave (VENUS) plays the aged Briony as the film progresses to the modern day and we learn how futile Briony's wish for atonement are. Although Mrs. Redgrave gives an astounding few minutes on film, it is only a few minutes. There've been rumors that she'll garner some award for this performance, but I hope that these rumors are unfounded. Don't get me wrong; she did a fine job. But her brief performance doesn't warrant any kind of prize.Listing the good above, I have to point out that the story is not an uncommon one. This is a war story, something we've seen time and again. Director Joe Wright does some interesting camera work and manipulations with time, but some might feel this as an attempt to force something new on a genre movie goers are all too familiar with.That said, one needs to be prepared for an uncharacteristic ending. If you're looking for a feel-good, man-returns-home-and-marries-girl-and-they-have-fifty-grandkids kind of movie, this one isn't going to make your happy tears list.This is a mixed bag as far as films go. An overused premise with some uniquely new ideas.But is it 'The Best Film of 2007'? It does have some of the best cinematography and great acting thanks to Romola Garai. But it's not the best. That prize I'm reserving for NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.",8,2,3,8 January 2008
V for Vendetta," Connect The Dots And See Where V Leads You
","A science fiction film with a message. Who would've thought it possible. I don't mean this has never happened, it's just that it hasn't happened in quite some time. To put it in perspective, my favorite SF film was THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Although many people make that claim, here it is noteworthy because The Day The Earth Stood Still was a brave undertaking, commenting on the dangers of nuclear technology during a time when our government and our country felt this was a necessary evil. I'm not saying V FOR VENDETTA rates up on the same level, but it does have its moments, making us question the purpose of government and the repercussions of overstepping those purposes for its own 'good' rather than the individuals it's supposed to serve.Coming from the Wachowski brothers who made THE MATRIX trilogy, V has a good cast realized via the comic book of the same name but takes a while to get on track. The first third of the film was pretty slow and involved, but the latter parts made up for this.The story is about a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving, THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) who was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical company. A group of men and women have hidden their involvement with this distasteful part of history as we lunge forward to the year 2020. A totalitarian government rules England, cowing its citizens by enforcing curfews, limiting religious freedoms, and eliminating homosexuality (if you're a gay Buddhist out after nine p.m. you're in BIG trouble!) Weaving a bit of history into the story, we see Guy Fawkes Day (November 5th) taken to a whole new level. V plans to destroy Parliament because of its wickedness and the fear under which English citizens now live. Not to mention that Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt, CONTACT) is one of the pharmaceutical founders that altered V's life forever; V has no recollection of his past, including his own name, and has an altered body chemistry allowing him superhuman agility thanks to the drugs that were tested on him. This is very bad news for those involved in screwing up his life. V is out for Vengeance, too.But V is also lonely, so when Evey (Natalie Portman, STAR WARS III) helps him make good an escape, he pulls her into his confidence, eventually forcing her to lose all her fears through a set of brutal tests. In Evey V sees the future of mankind, a sign that all may be made right with the world.In a stunning climax, we watch V's vision come to life, as fireworks blow, thousands turn out wearing Guy Fawkes/V masks, and Evey comes to understand how important change is in the world.This film certainly won't be for everyone. You have to think about what's happening to really understand the message. It doesn't smack you in the face with an obvious plot, and instead lets it seep into the viewer's subconscious.There are, as seen in other reviews, a lot of talk about what this film's intent was supposed to be, and I think that speaks pretty highly for the level of sophistication needed to help one grasp V. Is he a freedom fighter or a terrorist? Anyone who wants to destroy a government must be crazy and/or an anarchist, right? How far is too far when a government wants to 'protect' its citizens? These are questions the movie poses but doesn't give answers to, and that is quite refreshing considering what Hollywood usually places in front of us (A + B = C). Connect your own dots and see where V leads you.",8,0,1,19 August 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Spoof Of Southern Lifestyle And Conservatism
","Trying to review and rate a movie like this is tougher than most might think. There are those Will Ferrell fans out there that'll eat up TALLADEGA NIGHTS: THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY. Then there are those that'll snub it as another foolish not-ready-for-prime-time-style spoof designed to engage our dumbed-down society. But there is a third reason someone might enjoy this rather ridiculous film.Hopefully there are those movie goers out there that enjoy watching parodies of various lifestyles, and this is where Talladega Nights gets most of  if not all of  its comedic punch. That we witness a southern Nascar driver with all of his conservative leanings hanging out for everyone to see was absolutely hysterical. Ricky Bobby's (Will Ferrell) big house, multiple gas guzzling cars (Hummers, etc.), a wife who's gauged on breast quality, and two kids named after a horrible action series ('These are my kids, Walker and Texas Ranger') are all over-exaggerations on conservative values; you wouldn't dare see one of them driving a hybrid car, for instance.The entrance of a homosexual Frenchman named Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen, Borat) adds an additional element in the American prejudice category, Ricky Bobby bashing Girard's foreign heritage while making a fool of Americans' naiveté ('America gave the world Chinese food!') The challenge of Ricky Bobby to overcome his fear of driving after a horrendous crash is only minimalist humor added to the film. It is, at its core, a spoof on modern southern lifestyle and conservatism, and that is what makes the movie work.",6,15,31,15 December 2006
