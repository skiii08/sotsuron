Iron Man 3," The trailer is actually a million times better than the actual film! #Fact
","I remember watching the Iron man 3 trailer over and over again thinking 'OMG this is gonna be as good as Avengers maybe even better'. Till today i even still watch the trailer because the 3 minutes of trailer is a million times better than the actual film!!!!Listen, If you are not a comic book fan then by all means this is the film for you to watch, but if you are, I'm telling you, no I'm begging you please, please do not waste your time and money because this film is a fraud. It sickens me that i actually paid money for this film. The best part of this movie is the hot dog i ate. How can you make the Mandarin a stunt actor?!?!? The Mandarin?! Thats like saying the joker was actually a pastor/priest/reverend who just wanted to pretend to be a criminal! Thats like making the General Zod an African who pretended to be from Krypton. So many plot holes in this movie. How did Tony get hit by a truck, causing his suit to shatter....but remained unharmed?!?! Better yet, how can a truck shatter the suit that allowed him to stand toe-to-toe with Thor and his magical hammer. Which intelligent man with a brain like Tony Stark would call out a global terrorist via the media giving him his address just after telling his girlfriend 'I have to protect the one thing that i can't live without, and that's you'. If i was to talk about the rest of the plot holes I'll be writing a 20,000 word dissertation. The Mandarin was supposed to be a formidable antagonist to Iron Man, someone who will test him mentally, physically and psychologically but instead we get a skinny guy who manages to test Tony Stark patience kmmmmttttt. And whats worse is critics are giving this film postitive reviews such as 'film of the year'. That's like saying a paralympian could run faster than Usain Bolt with his eyes closed. Shane Black & Drew Pearce (writers) should not just be fired but should find new employment in the entertainment business. I will not watch a superhero film with those two or any one of them involved. They were lazy and did not care about this project. If they thought what they did was right they wouldn't mislead everyone into thinking the Mandarin was real in the trailers.Good performances from key actors though.",3,20,43,29 May 2013
