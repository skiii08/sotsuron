Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good.......
","If you could categorize this movie using a single term it would be simply 'good'.If you look at it within the context of it being compared to the other Star Wars films you would probably say, not as 'good'.if you look at it for its own merits you would probably say, pretty darn 'good'.All in all it was a good movie.  Some certain things irked me though, which i will bring to your attention:1.  Jar Jar Binks - It probably wouldnt have hurt to have the voice of Jar Jar binks be similar to, the Genie in the Animated cartoon of Aladdin.2.  The Neimodians (Viceroy) rather than sounding oriental (sorta) should have had voices similar to Aslan from the English series of 'The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe'3.  The Lightsabre duel at the end was 'good', but it was WAY too choreographed for the audience to believe it was impromptu4.  There were too many 'bit' actors trying to make their mark in the movie. They obviously weren't realising that they only had 'bit' roles because they're only 'bit' actors5.  Samuel L JacksonBut Like I said, it was a 'good' movie, and I will rent it out when it comes to VHS video",9,0,0,8 June 1999
