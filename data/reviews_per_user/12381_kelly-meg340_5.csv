The Lobster," Bleh
",It was off to a great start but then I suffered through the last half. I wouldn't really recommend someone spend 2 hours watching this unless you're really bored and have nothing left to do. It's weird and kind of funny but there's just not much there.,4,2,4,2 August 2019
Interstellar," Amazing
","I love anything to do with outer space. This movie was entertaining, had good acting and accurate science. It was hard for me to name a movie which is my favorite because I love many movies BUT this one is clearly one of my all time favorites now. I've watched it multiple times and every time I'm glued to the television.",10,0,0,23 August 2018
