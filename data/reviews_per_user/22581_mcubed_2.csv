Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious commentary on the Neandrothal mentality
","Of course, all of the scenes in this movie are 'staged' to to the extent that the director had to arrange for Borat to appear at various events throughout his journey. But anyone who watches this movie objectively will realize that most of the 'supporting' cast were non actors who had no clue that it was all a joke and that THEY were the butt of the joke. The movie is a devastating attack on racism and sexism in America, while still being extraordinarily funny, because Borat himself is so convincingly clueless about it all. There are also some of the most hilarious physical comedic scenes in the history of motion pictures in this film. A 65-ish year old woman sitting directly in front of me nearly went intocardiac arrest from laughter during the nude wrestling scene (I don't think this is a spoiler).",10,5,16,13 November 2006
Lost in Translation," Just Awful
","This film only deserves a brief summation:Wooden acting, juvenile script and dialog, archaic cultural stereotyping, uninteresting central characters who undergo no fundamental changes, plot less, and just plain boring.This could be the single most over-rated movie in the history of cinema.The only positive aspect was the cinematography. Tokyo was gorgeously shot.I am a big fan of Bill Murray, but this was an incredible disappointment.I actually found this film painful to sit through. I only saw it on video, but watched it twice because I thought I had just missed something.Nope.",1,13,28,23 July 2004
