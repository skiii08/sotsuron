Mission: Impossible III," 'What's that on your mantelpiece?'
","There's not really much to say about a blockbuster designed for entertainment, however, this was only barely entertaining, and I shall dictate why. We start off with a somewhat interesting opening, which has clearly messed around with chronology and was actually a good scene to pull people in with. After this it slows down to an engagement party of 'Ethan' and 'Julia' (Michelle Monaghan), and as a scene it felt like it was unnecessarily long due to the obvious prediction that this will be where he's called out for his initial mission to instigate the films plot.Pretty much after this, we move into all the 'whizz-whizz, bang-bang' and it escalates from there with various visually pleasing action sequences throughout the film. There always felt like there was something missing in some of the action sequences, it felt like they were trying to accumulate to something bigger. This wouldn't have been a problem had they been structured around each other better, but the mix of 'half-cocked' and 'fully-cocked' sequences were a bit messy, added to this, my mind kept saying 'wow' or 'cool' but this wasn't felt.Some of the most entertaining parts were actually the build-ups, such as infiltrating into places, preparing their trademark prosthetic masks and voice changers to temporarily steal someone's identity and such. But there was a lot of building up, and mixed in with the 'half-cocked' action sequences, we are left in limbo, hoping for something much bigger and better to come along. The various tension created in certain action sequences were pointless. Being a Hollywood blockbuster we know how the events will turn out so the attempted doubt of 'will he/won't he' is fairly negligible. This goes for most films designed to entertain, but it's a bad sign when it becomes worth mentioning.The emotional scenes between 'Ethan' and 'Julia' were stomach churning as well, and they make you laugh because you simply cannot take Tom Cruise seriously. To date, the only films I've appreciated and liked him in have been 'Collateral' and his bit part in 'Tropic Thunder', apart from this he is never a character, he is always an actor playing a character.'Cloverfield' producer and executive producer of 'Lost' J.J. Abrams makes his feature film directional debut here, and he was clearly a poor choice. If by any chance you're looking to assess Michelle Monaghan's acting talents, don't choose this film. The director and/or writer clearly did not care about her, nor her character. 'Julia' was a very stereotypical weepy housewife type character whose sole purpose was absolutely nothing more than a plot device; a simple prop would have sufficed for her role.The only actor who did stand out, however, was Phillip Seymour Hoffman who played our supreme villain. Unfortunately his character felt underplayed, and this is a great shame because it would have been nice to see more of him. His character, 'Owen Davian', was very shallow and heartless; Hoffman played this perfectly being that the only emotion that came through him was anger, the rest of the time he was always very calm, and had no problem with doing what 'needed' to be done.Jonathan Rhys Meyers, was very strange in this. Perhaps he's spent too much time away from home and has had his natural dialect affected, because his Irish accent was very inconsistent. This is very peculiar considering he was born, and grew up, in Ireland.Simon Pegg also had a bit part in this. He was great in his scenes but his purpose was poorly executed. It seemed as if he was there only to provide some light comic relief to certain aspects of attempted drama, but this failed being that the drama was never very dramatic, it made you laugh more often than feel anything negative.There were a lot of instances of laughing at bits not intended for humour, but it couldn't be helped. It was often during moments of dead seriousness from some cast members, the majority of the time from Tom Cruise, who is irritating from the outset. Sure he can carry a role as an action hero well, but he's the same in them all. In this film, he distinctly reminded me of the character he was playing in the first 10 minutes of 'Minority Report' that I managed to sit through.Unfortunately, it's very hard to care about any of the characters in this film. If any of them were to die suddenly (even 'Ethan'), I'd doubt anything would be felt. The same goes for the story, the introduction was interesting but this is lost during the film because you just want to see the action. Various scenes of dialogue leave you thinking 'C'mon, get on with it!' and this is a bad reaction to have when they've attempted to convolute the plot, but you just don't care.This is fairly typical, and in keeping with the first two 'Mission: Impossible' films, however, they should have just left it at the first film. The second was greatly disappointing, and this one just comes across as a trilogy for trilogies sake to redeem themselves of the second film. It's a fairly standard, predictable and clich√© piece of entertainment, which only just barely gets away with it.I rate this 4 out of 10. Interest isn't sustained, there's a lot of building up with failed tension, a lot of bad acting, lack of care for anything that's going on, and its unimaginative dialogue. The aspects that were good though, were Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Simon Pegg, and the balance of realism between suspension of disbelief. This film was entertaining to see once, but a second time would be purely exhausting. Being that I would have been quite happy to dip in and out of this; overall, the film is more like an ornament on a mantelpiece, which you glance at every so often.",4,2,3,16 February 2009
Watchmen," 'Hello Mr. Snyder, is that another over-hyped mainstream display of laziness in your pocket?'
","The word visionary, is a poor label to slap on Snyder. I would give him credit for it in '300' being that I've not read the book for it, but in the instance of 'Watchmen', I have read and greatly enjoyed the graphic novel. Whilst reading it I was unsurprised that a movie was being made, and was also unsurprised that Snyder would be directing. But from the point I heard his name, my expectations started to drop. Having seen, and been greatly dissatisfied by, '300' and 'Dawn of the Dead' (His biggest previous hits) I couldn't say I was expecting too much directionally from 'Watchmen'.Often when low expectations are in order, they are exceeded particularly easily. However they were matched, and actually having read the graphic novel, I saw exactly what kind of director Snyder is. He is a lazy one. Pretty much for all of his shots, he used the graphic novel as a storyboard. He used practically no creativity in creating his shots; he just took them straight out of the book and slapped them onto the big screen. This does not make Snyder a visionary; this makes him a very lazy boy, as well as a cop-out. I can only assume this was his vague attempt at appealing to fans of the novel, when fans have already been drawn in by the name of the film.The film also lacked a lot of the depth that the book had. The film had an onslaught of flashback sequences establishing characters psyche, and the way they are in the present time frame. While somewhat necessary to the depth of character, there are many more inventive ways of establishing the same sense of character, and this is once again laziness, but on the hands of screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse. However, while these flashbacks gave great depth of character to the cast members who could act well, it detracted very heavily from the main story, which is where the depth is lacking the most.In the novel, the story is a very well executed consistently running undertone. In the film it is a poor one. We start with an introduction to the main plot, and then it seems to be practically dropped for all the flashbacks and character establishment. By the end the main plot is wrapped up far too quickly, with minimal and static development which could easily leave new audiences a little bemused and clueless as to what happened, as well as how and why.The shining performance here is without a doubt, Jackie Earle Haley. Haley plays 'Rorschach', the darkest and deepest character, and his performance throughout is absolutely perfect. Not only does he portray the character well from the book, but he simply performs brilliantly as an actor. Billy Crudup also gave a fantastic performance as 'Dr. Manhattan', his facial expressions and attenuate display of emotion is executed superbly. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for most of the other cast, in particular Malin Akerman, who plays 'Silk Spectre II'. Whilst she is without a doubt the most stereotypical character in the novel, this is no reason why she cannot perform well. She is greatly unimpressive. Patrick Wilson lacked something too. He's not a terrible actor from what I've seen before, but it feels as if he is lacking something as 'Nite Owl II'. It is possible that this is down to Snyder's direction, but could equally be Wilson's fault.Whilst overall depth is lost, with only two exceptional performances, and replicated camera work; it can't be faulted that the special effects are stunning. The effects are quite thrilling, but the thrill isn't really felt too much, it's eye candy with no heart. The fight scenes with gratuitous violence, 'Rorschach's unorthodox methods of acquiring information, and almost anything involving 'Dr. Manhattan' (in particular, obliterating Vietcong with a single thought), made for a visually pleasing set of scenes, even if the cinematography is just an uninventive replication.Though, these scenes are simply not enough. Due to the lack of story depth, it leaves most in-between scenes feeling underdeveloped and a little tedious; perhaps not so much for fans of the novel, but especially for new audiences. It feels like they tried to simply replicate the graphic novel as is, whilst taking odd bits out here and there. For new audiences this will create a feeling of emptiness, due to the fact that there are subtle nuances within the book that might not seem valuable, but add to the character as well as story, and are thus actually important.As a companion to the book, this is pretty entertaining and works well, being that fans will know what is going on and are able to fill in any blanks. But for new audiences, especially those who've never heard of 'Watchmen' before, this will just seem tedious, undeveloped and perhaps just a little bit messy with some visual high-points around. Added to this, the soundtrack was particularly 'try-hard', including Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah' during a notably cheesy love scene. As well as some dreadful rock song over the end credits. This seemed distinctly detached from the rest of the film, especially given the time period.Overall, this works best as a companion to the book and is mostly fan orientated. But for new audiences I don't really recommend it, for there will be disappointment and emptiness. Personally, I must admit that I was reasonably entertained by the film, but I feel this is because I am a fan of the novel, and therefore know the ins and outs of the story. But it doesn't really do the book much justice to be perfectly honest. I'll be keeping an eye out for Jackie Earle Haley, but I won't be rushing out to see this film again. This is a fairly unimpressive 6 out of 10; an uncreative, lazy, near beat-for-beat replication.",6,2,4,8 March 2009
Dark City," 'You Are Not Who You Think You Are'
","A man wakes up in a bath tub, with absolutely no idea of who he is or how he got there. He soon finds himself accused of being a serial killer, and pursued by strange men with bright white faces. He sets out on a mission to find some answers; but before too long, he finds himself part of a much more sinister plot. Director Alex Proyas ('I, Robot', 'The Crow') directs this Burton/Gilliam-esquire portrayal of understanding the essence of being.This is very well compiled movie, with some great undertones to it. The opening is pretty gripping, in which a lot seems to happen and is somewhat subliminal in content. It is very fast paced, and erratically cut together so that it doesn't spend too long on each scene, this doesn't often give you time to consciously take in what happen, but the mind still registers what is going on. These erratic visuals make for an incredibly surreal opening; it is imperative that you allow yourself to suspend disbelief, and brace yourself for science-fiction mayhem. This setup is reflective of the protagonist 'Murdoch' (Rufus Sewell), being that neither the audience nor the main character understand what is going on at all. Lots of questions are asked, and it isn't until about 40 minutes in that the first question is vaguely answered.However, the length of time to answer even one question does not feel like a long time. Due to the pacing and the whole manner of execution in the first 40 minutes, it is easy to forget about time (considering you are at least accepting of such a genre of film). This is aided very well by some fantastically designed sets, lit perfectly to emulate the title and storyline of the film. Due to this, it is onerous to reference parts of the film without spoiling much of the plot.The plot is surprisingly deep for a film of its genre, with certain underlying themes as well as visuals which are slightly reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil'. It deals with the concept of what truly makes us human, and judges how unique we really are as a species. This is not only an aspect dealt with directly in the plot, but also has the potential to make you think about it too. The development of this plot is also superb, amidst the fast pace, the progression seems to be quite gradual. The acting talents were pretty inconsistent around this film, whilst there were some good performances; there were also some bad ones which detracted from the flow of the film at times. The film itself is remarkably gripping due to its pacing and visual intensity. But the acting takes you out of this. In particular, Kiefer Sutherland; while his character is a pretty strong and solid character, Sutherland just simply isn't convincing in his role. He seems to be trying too hard to be disparate to the roles he has performed before, as if trying to set himself up as a character actor, but unfortunately he fails with horrid consequences. Jennifer Connelly is also fairly mediocre; she gives a fairly bland, empty performance and is somewhat disappointing. Despite this, when the acting's good...It is really good; Richard O'Brien for one gives a fantastic performance as a darkly sinister villain, whilst also adequately incorporating his much loved element of camp behaviour. Rufus Sewell shines too, in the beginning he seems fairly unsure, but as the film goes on he gradually emerges to give a very interesting and plausible performance. Similarly, William Hurt gives a great performance too. These performances make for some good tension and suspense throughout; being that the plot is quite secretive in its build-up, it is hard to predict some actions as the film moves along.While there are some great visuals in cinematographic terms, as well as good performances and an intriguing story; there are some parts of the script which don't seem to fit, being that certain parts of dialogue are quite cheesy, in a bad sense. The line 'I have Murdoch in mind' (which doesn't make sense here) is quite a paltry piece of speech. When watching the film it will be obvious why it has been noted.The special effects are also quite enjoyable, but they start to become overused by the end of the film. The climax to this film is somewhat a little dissatisfying and predictable, at which point tension and suspense becomes negligible. It is a surprising climax to have given the nature of the rest of the film, and due to the content of the climax, it is also somewhat tedious in its execution and brings the film down substantially. However, after this there is a great final scene in a visual sense.Overall, this film is pretty entertaining and not a typical film of the sci-fi genre. This is definitely one for fans of the genre, especially those who enjoyed 'Brazil' or 'The Matrix'. With some great performances, and a generally good script this is a highly entertaining and engaging film which requires some brain power to follow (which is often refreshing with a film of this style). This is 8 out of 10, unique, creative and visually enthralling. It is also heavily suggested that it be viewed in a darkened room for optimal impact.",8,1,3,9 March 2009
City of God," 'Fight and you'll never survive...Run and you'll never escape.'
","Based on true events of a Brazilian slum in Rio de Janeiro, 'City of God' tells a harrowing tale of one boys fight to escape poverty and crime. Over the course of roughly two decades, the story is told through the eyes of our young protagonist; 'Rocket', who desperately wants to make something of himself and free himself from the violence, drugs, robberies and corruption of the 'City of God'.It's established very early on in the film that the name of the slum, 'City of God', is blatant irony being that the place is completely overrun with all forms of crime and immorality. The first 20-30 minutes depict how the young citizens of the slum view crime as a necessity, and the only way in which they can make something of themselves and claim respect amongst the local population. It is clear that over time to some characters their 'necessities' have started to become entertaining, and sadly this is passed on to the younger generations who then also aspire to such crimes. 'Rocket' introduces us to many important characters that are well respected in the community. One of which is 'Lil Z√©', 18, and the sole king of the 'City of God'. An inhumane and immoral character who only received maximum respect through murder and drugs. 'Lil Z√©' is an immensely frightening character; it's very hard to find a soul or a shred of humanity within him. He is a prime example of an underlying tone of a vicious cycle; influenced by older boys when he was younger, he aspired to become something greater than those who looked down upon him as a child and made himself the most feared member of the slum. There is one particularly devastating scene which demonstrates this, it is also likely to stick with you forever.Everybody fears everybody within the community, 'Lil Z√©' has a large gang, and to join his side is a symbol of respect, and this is the ideal that all the young people of the slum have been taught. All except 'Rocket', who hopes to become a photographer one day, to form a legitimate career and to escape the hold the city has over him.'Rocket' is a sign of courage and hope, he even quotes that the slum is purgatory at one point, and 'Rocket' highlights this by being the only, or one of few, young people to hope to have aspirations of becoming something worth while and legitimate, where others view money as their only form of escape. During the course of the film, however, he becomes influenced by his surroundings and attempts to turn to the world of crime, but he has too much heart to commit any such acts. Each guy 'Rocket' met on his attempted descent was a 'cool guy', and he couldn't bring himself to do any harm.It's amazing how someone as young as 'Rocket' (also 18) can think like he does within his surroundings. Whilst everyone else desires respect through crime, he desires it through legal methods. This can either be construed as fate, some form of intervention from 'God', or it could be because of the underplayed idea of his brother, 'Goose', wanting better for him and this ideal being subconsciously active throughout 'Rocket's life.Amongst all the various crime and drug use and dealing, it is made perfectly clear that all the main characters involved are but only teenagers. They like to party, hang out on the beach, and our protagonist has a crush on a pretty young girl called 'Ang√©lica', who he wants to sleep with. These are simple lives made extraordinary, and for the most part, nobody wants that. 'Lil Z√©', however, is displayed to be purely business orientated and has very little interest in anything other than his respect and power. If his hormones kick in, he will act upon them illegitimately.Though 'Z√©' appears to be devoid of emotions and humanity, a small amount is shown during the film. He displays a little envy, aggression and a small amount of sadness in one scene, however this is quickly ended. This makes you wonder as to whether he is actually instinctively psychotic, or perhaps just badly damaged from a tough childhood.Visually, this is quite a strange film. It has a somewhat light-hearted aura surrounding it which is sometimes strengthened by an excellent soundtrack. This makes for an extra punch because it highlights how natural and normal this life is for all the residents of the city and can be quite a tough thing to think about. Some of the imagery, however, is very powerful and graphic making them often hard to handle. This imagery is made strong by a wonderful young cast who give excellent performances throughout. I'm sure if I were fluent in Portuguese, I'd find some small discrepancies within their line delivery, but as it stands, everybody seems very natural bringing about very strong characters.The soundtrack is superbly chosen, at certain times of terror, the soundtrack adds an oddly ambivalent sense of joy around the actions going on. It's as if, through the audiences perspective we see tragedy and brutality, but for the characters they see necessity or entertainment.The film is brilliantly paced, very fast, with some excellent cinematographic choices. The pace and overall intensity of the film encourages you to keep involved, and despite the tough imagery in certain parts, it's hard to look away. I can't seem to find much wrong with this film, and feel that it deserves 10 out of 10 for its courageous story matter and the confidence to not shy away from any details of, sadly, what many slums still are today. Even if this doesn't accurately portray life in certain slums, as a piece of art, this is brilliant.",9,0,1,15 February 2009
Munich," An Intriguing Historical Insight
","The cinematography in the opening scene is worth mentioning, it sets a very suspicious mood which gives the audience a very early sense of intrigue. If you know nothing of the 'Munich Massacre', then the graphic nature of this opening scene will have a bigger impact upon you. The tension and suspense created during these early moments of the film set a nice pace to be carried through. Spielberg's portrayal of these events creates a very well executed shocking sense of realism.I couldn't help but feel, however, that to some people interest might be lost within the first 10 minutes. After showing a portion of reconstructed events in somewhat realistic detail, the film shifts to a slower pace with less intrigue with the display of on-lookers watching their TV sets, and reporters at the scene. This can however be construed to be with good reason, setting an authentic mood of how people reacted to the news at the time with a very clueless perspective, which was achieved well with some archive footage of the events. For audience members who remember watching these events on the news, this can easily bring back emotions experienced at the time.There is a great feeling of an independent production surrounding this, with a Hollywood look pasted over the top ¬ñ You can see the money, and with Spielberg in charge, it's no surprise this got a major release into the box office. This isn't particularly a bad thing though; this just goes to show what you can accomplish when a real life drama is granted a healthy budget. Though it seemed at times that the money was used to acquire the best equipment possible rather than considering the mood of the scenery, resultantly, this made several sets visually come across as a studio stage where each scene was, in actuality, shot on location. However this does not distract from the rest of the film too much, maintaining suspense, intrigue and tension throughout.Eric Bana gave an amazing performance, practically stealing the show. It's clear he worked very hard on his accent. Though Geoffrey Rush delivered some great acting too, his accent didn't feel too solid. Everybody slipped up a tiny bit here and there, but I think Rush's accent was the least consistent. Daniel Craig was fairly mediocre in this, a bit semi-natural. He carried his role well but wasn't very consistent ¬ñ There were moments when it felt like he was over-acting, as if trying too hard to grant his character a sense of realism.The other notably great performance was from Mathieu Amalric who plays a character called 'Louis', 'Avner's primary source for gathering names of 'Black September' members. He is a very intricate, well written character ¬ñ There is something naturally sinister about Amalric as an actor, and this aided him well here, making 'Louis' a subtly untrustworthy character. The chemistry between Amalric and Bana was brilliant, they were very natural together and this made their scenes together very captivating.One particular scene to mention shows 'Louis' taking 'Avner' to his father's place for lunch, surrounded by a very large family. 'Louis's father came across as a somewhat contrived character in the things he said. The character was written to portray a certain level of wisdom, delivering various metaphors such as; 'Butchers' hands, gentle souls', and saying to his son, 'You centaur, you minotaur.' The whole scene was an explosion of forced metaphor and felt a little detached from the rest of the film.Structured around attempts on members of 'Black September', 'Munich' is well designed and artistically executed. Each attempt on a member of 'Black September' brings an excellent level of conflicting humanity, evil and power. Their first potential assassination brings about the realisation that they are not only killing people with terrorist involvement, they are killing fathers, sons, uncles and brothers. These people, despite their evil, are people who will be missed. Though 'Avner's team believe themselves to have faith in the operation they are carrying out, their morality often gets in the way as they try to execute their target, and their target alone, bringing about a certain degree of failure with each attempt. The character development is well orchestrated, giving us a group of very compassionate and moral assassins. This is displayed best at the meal time scenes; the main characters always share large home-cooked meals with each other to discuss their execution plans. This is some great symbolism, showing how they can participate in something so tidy and civilised, only to discuss plans of something so messy and monstrous. These meal times gradually display a realisation of potential futility in their operation. As the film moves along, 'Avner' starts to question the morality of what he is the leader of. If what he is doing, is the right thing to do? Whether it is justified? Whether he was manipulated by the government of his own country, to carry out an operation for selfish national objectives or pure revenge? It's a very well orchestrated ambivalent mix of compassion and evil, and the protagonist knows this. Due to this, we ultimately have a traumatised hero who feels as if he has accomplished nothing, making not only the character, but the audience realise the futility of retaliation and terrorism as a whole.I rate this film a respectable 7 out of 10, it's a well worth seeing and is very enjoyable. Great performances, story, script and great historical research. From what I've read of the actual events of the 'Munich Massacre', the film appears to be very historically accurate, and the mix of fiction is superbly balanced. It's great to see an A-Lister like Steven Spielberg tackle such a challenging piece. This is one of those films not necessarily designed to entertain, but to teach us about humanity, and the depth and fragility of human emotion and mentality as well as a bit of history.",7,2,3,5 February 2009
