Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," You'll Love it! or you'll hate it! or you'll be someone kind of in between...
","I've heard a million times that this movie was offensive.I've heard a million times that it cannot be offensive because Baron Cohen himself is Jewish.Well I thought this movie had offensive material, but was downright hilarious. Cohen does a masterful job in this character, to the point no one recognizes him as anything but. His situations do not offend, but they do point out flaws and prejudices in our society. An obvious fact in the men from the rodeo stating 'we're trying to get that (kill gays) done here too!' Borat is hilarious if you take it for what it is, and go in with an open mind. I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard at a theater. Maybe when my sister made me see From Justin to Kelly. But maybe not even that.Go. See. Laugh. Buy. Laugh more. Watch Special Features. Laugh More.",8,1,5,28 February 2007
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," Disappointing. Funny at parts, but disappointing.
","Though there may be less-funny movies that I give a higher rating to, I mark this down because I had higher expectations.Jack Black and Kyle Gass are very funny when put together, but here it just didn't work. Kyle Gass is horrid as an actor, but that is something you expect. This movie had its moments, but it was forced to use 'laser-deactivating genitalia' amongst other stunts to keep us watching.Cameos were used often, but no one really caught my eye and made me laugh.There was a scene where JB was high going down a river, that one clip was out-loud laughable. Aside from that, some chuckles.The music was great. But that's tenacious d for you. Just buy the CD.",5,0,1,28 February 2007
