The King's Speech," A work of art
","This is one of the most beautiful and inspiring movies I have ever watched. The artistry of acting from all characters of the movie is flawless, from the silent encouragement of the wife to the courageous acts of the therapist friend, and down to the face twitch of the archbishop before the final scene. Most of all, Firth does a wonderful job of displaying something many of us have felt time and time again - the pain of believing in yourself. This movie speaks for the tendency of the character to fear, to think lowly of oneself, and to the power human emotion has over every part of our body. Most importantly though, it speaks to the strength of the internal voice to shout out its purpose, loud and clear, and to courageously make a difference. The story is heroic. It demonstrates that violence, action, and emotions such as hate and despise are not necessary to create a good movie. This movie is like a sip of great wine - does everything it needs to, and more, with only what is necessary. A clean interpretation, beautiful script, and amazing cast.",10,3,6,29 March 2011
