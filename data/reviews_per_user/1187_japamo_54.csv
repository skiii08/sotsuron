Despicable Me 2," All Aboard the Minions Express!
","Without a doubt, this is one crazy, clever, and outrageous bullet train of an animated movie that does its energetic best to wring out the laughs (and mostly succeeds). Part of 'Despicable Me 2's' (hereafter DM2) success are its inspired plot borrowings such as 'The Incredibles', the Bond movie series, 'Lilo and Stitch' and even 'Cars 2' to embroil everyone's favorite Uncle Fester/Dr. Evil hybrid ex-supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) in a world dominance plot using cute beasties turned into purple, fanged wrecking balls.Another part of its success is the gradual revelation of Gru's more positive qualities such as his growing, more tolerant, and sometimes excessive compassion towards his adoptive children Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), the eldest and a budding teenager, tomboyish middle child Edith (Dana Gaier), and button-cute unicorn fanatic Agnes (Elsie Fisher), the youngest. We also must not forget the winning, ebullient return of resourceful Anti-Villain League agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig, using her Lola Bunny voice from 'The Looney Tunes Show') who recruits the somewhat reluctant Gru to go uncover with her at a mall bakery to uncover which of the mall proprietors is behind the purple mutant plot. The flabby but suave and mysterious Eduardo Perez/El Macho (Benjamin Bratt), the mall Mexican restaurant owner with an alluring son (Moisés Arias) involved with Margo, also keeps the proceedings hopping. All of the aforementioned stuff, in my opinion, works as smart, coherent entertainment.But what powers and keeps this bullet train together is one of the most insidiously and surprisingly endearing creations of any movie - the little old Minions. These slyly captivating characters prove the old adage that introducing lots of cute, fun, silly, little people in a movie is a surefire, lucrative way to lure people to an animated film. Characters such as the Smurfs, Pokemon, and the 627 experiments from 'Lilo and Stitch' have certainly proved that. They can easily capture young children's interest.But unlike the Smurfs, etc., Minions have crossover appeal to parents as well. Sure they babble childishly and otherwise act like overstimulated, quarrelsome brats. But the Minions are also industrious, satirical and hip assistants with some adult sensibilities, always eager to help Gru with his radically new espionage job, parenting, and love life predicaments. These Twinkie-shaped, blue over-all wearing dynamos keep DM2's pace from ever flagging.This is not to say that the Minions completely detract from the main storyline. I think we want to see Gru surmount childhood disappointments, his uncertainties and his sinister past to be a good do-gooder, better parent, and perhaps a suitable match for Lucy. But DM2 wouldn't be quite the same without the Minions serving as Greek chorus, comedy relief, and (mostly) trustworthy Gru sidekicks AND foster children. No wonder Illumination Entertainment plans an exclusive feature for them. Now if they can only introduce a Minionette.",8,2,3,25 July 2013
The Avengers," I love it when a superhero group (and a juggling act) come together
","Personally, I prefer superhero soloists to superhero teams, perhaps because it is easier to delve into and devote more time to a single superhero's characteristics, psychological motivations, and objectives. Also, I think, by their very nature, superheroes tend to be defiant, isolated loners - they are different from, and surpass the abilities of, common people. Therefore, I was particularly pleased by director Joss Whedon's triple accomplishment in 'The Avengers'. He faced the challenge of plausibly uniting, and coalescing several different actors with different acting qualities - especially when only one of them, Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, has any national recognizability (no knock against the rest of the ensemble group, of course). Whedon faced the challenge of combining and meshing several wildly disparate superheroes resolutely used to being 'lone wolves' and functioning solo. Finally, Whedon faced the challenge of giving each hero equal substantial time to strut their stuff in the spotlight, even the deceptively ordinary, non-superpowered Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). I think Whedon admirably succeeds on all three counts.I also admire Whedon's deliberate, deft restraint in plotting 'The Avengers'. Much as it might chafe adrenaline addicts impatiently waiting for the cataclysmic New York smackdown, the movie takes its time to establish the god of mischief and evil Loki's (Tom Hiddleston') nefarious partnership with the Predator-like aliens the Chitari and their unholy contract (Chitauri, in exchange for the Tesseract's (or Cosmic Cube's) improbably infinite power, send an endless horde of warriors through a space portal to help Loki conquer Earth). There's a lot of necessary exposition in this first half of the movie. 'The Avengers' not only has to gradually reveal Loki's ultimate motives and introduce (and reintroduce) each superhero's personality and conflicts. The movie must also surmount various obstacles (including slam-bang infighting and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s latent exploitation of the Tesseract to develop extraterrestrial pre-emptive strike weaponry) to the Avengers becoming a cohesive fighting unit. With the commanding, no-nonsense guidance of unflappable S.H.I.E.L.D. commander Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson), the Avengers grudgingly but steadily get their act together. They realize that saving the Earth takes priority over petty squabbles, disagreements, and even betrayals (including the one Black Widow uses to bring and unleash Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) into the fold). Yes, that's a lot of exposition to keep straight, but Whedon handles this mammoth task well.Eventually, we get to the global battle, and what a colossal battle royale it is! Again, Whedon displays his juggling skills as all the Avengers make their unique contributions towards fighting the Chitauri threat. The director modulates the rousing fight scenes well enough so you don't eventually feel overwhelmed and worn out. The only three critical observations I have about the conflict are these: 1) the Chitauri, gliding in on their aerial cycles, seemed to serve the same purpose as the battle droids in the 'Star Wars' prequels: gun fodder. In other words, they seemed to go down much too easily. Their only advantage was sheer weight of numbers, 2) it's a major miracle no citizens get killed, and 3) who's going to pay for the clean-up afterwards? Wait, there may be a fourth, shouldn't it occurred to the Avengers earlier that closing the portal was the solution? Ahh, whatever! It's a stupendous spectacle! Beside's the spectacle, there's much to savor in 'The Avengers'. Whedon, especially through the smartaleck banter of the self-absorbed Iron Man/Tony Stark, provides several hilarious one-liners and dialogue that keep this enterprise from sinking into ponderous self-importance. However, ironically, the wrathful Hulk provides the movie's three funniest scenes, especially when he confronts the vainglorious Loki at Stark's phallic tower and dismisses him as a 'Puny god!' Downey and Ruffalo engage in inspired techno-speak when attempting to locate the Tesseract. Even the 'non-superheroes', especially Fury's self-sacrificing man Friday Phil Coulson, demonstrate their heroism. Of course, the CGI special effects, including the way the Hulk resembles a pumped-up Mark Ruffalo and the undulating Chitauri spaceships resembling ancient whale skeletons, are mind-boggling but convincing.I could ramble on and not begin to cover all the facets of this successful production. If you like Marvel, the Avengers, balanced ensemble work, and/or full-throated action thrillers, I think you'll love this movie. If you prefer cerebral, contemplative movies, I think you may find something to like about 'The Avengers'. The Dark Knight and any future adaptation of The Justice League of America should tremble at the high standard they have to reach. So be it! P.S.: If you have the patience to wade through the end credits, you will see a post-scene midway which sets up the sequel, where the Avengers will encounter the embodiment of death itself. At the very end, you will see our beloved superheroes enjoying shawarma in a deli. I looked up 'shawarma' on Wikipedia - think shiskebob or gyro.",8,0,2,26 June 2012
The Incredible Hulk," We'll make a conventional superhero out of the Hulk yet!
","Let me state unequivocally at the outset that in comparing Ang Lee's 'Hulk' and Louis Leterrier's 'Incredible Hulk' movies, I believe Ang Lee's version is superior. My reason for this can be summed up by a paraphrase of a quote from Roger Ebert's review of '1984': '(Leterrier's) version of (Marvel's tormented green character) turned (the Hulk's plight) into a cautionary, simplistic (superhero) tale. (Ang Lee's 'Hulk') penetrates much more deeply into (the character's psychological) heart of darkness.' If you are interested in a more detailed explanation of my reasoning, I refer you to my 'Ph.D. thesis' review of Ang Lee's 'Hulk' on IMDb.However, all that psychological complexity elicited a lot of discomfort and hostility from 'Hulk' viewers. They didn't want to see a tragic, emotionally reserved character struggling with mental and father dilemmas and abuse as well as his gamma-irradiated condition. God damn it, they wanted an unambiguous superhero rising up to beat the bad guys to a pulp and save humanity, the world, or something. They wanted the most unconventional, unlikely 'superhero' of all to follow the old movie superhero formula: 1) Origin of good guy superhero, 2) Origin of good guy superhero's nemesis, 3) Circumstances that bring the superhero and nemesis together to fight. Apparently, the corporate suits listened to this plea and gave the world 'The Incredible Hulk'.Consequently, Leterrier's 'The Incredible Hulk' takes the character nuances and motivations Lee's 'Hulk' worked so hard to cultivate and makes them slicker, simpler and more basic. The Hulk/Bruce Banner no longer is the reluctant or accidental hero who only wants to live a peaceful life and inherits his powers by accident. This time Banner (Edward Norton) is a rash, ambitious graduate student who deliberately subjects himself to gamma radiation almost as a lark, to see what superpowers he'll get and soon rues his choice. The Hulk's/Bruce's anger no longer arises from trauma suffered from years of parental abuse. This time, being chased around by the military because he is 'U.S. government property' as General Thaddeus 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt) puts it, and has a power Ross and many others want to scientifically duplicate, makes Banner lose it and 'Hulk out'. General Ross himself is no longer an ambivalent character, a dutiful soldier bent on crushing the menacing Hulk but also obsessively protective of his only child, Betty Ross. Instead, he is a purely unscrupulous, selfish villain. However, the Hulk himself does manage to keep most of his pathos and sympathy in spite of Leterrier's efforts to steer him into superhero status.Leterrier glosses over the Hulk's creation in a frantic montage, instead of Lee's deliberate, contemplative origin story. Conversely, however, he takes more time following the creation of the Hulk's ultimate nemesis, another gamma creature known as the Abomination (not named in the film). The Abomination is actually Emil Blonsky, a Slavic (?) mercenary Ross retains to help his troops capture the Hulk. Blonsky, a veteran soldier past his prime, is apparently an adrenaline and power junkie. Impressed by his first encounter with the Hulk in South America, and gradually learning from the reticent Ross about his origin, Blonsky is insanely eager to become a match for the Hulk.Meanwhile, chased from his hideout in the Rio favela slums by Ross's troops but escaping to Culver University in Virginia (I think) partly by transforming into the Hulk, Banner reunites with Betty Ross and conspires with her to go to New York and meet with Dr. Samuel Sterns, to whom he has shipped blood samples in hopes of finding a cure. Unfortunately, Banner learns to his shock that the animated Dr. Sterns too has jumped on the 'Super Soldier' bandwagon and has cloned his blood proteins to discover their amazing properties. Before Dr. Stearns can proceed with his research, Ross, Blonsky, and the military arrive. Having received an initial dose of the 'Super Soldier formula' from Ross and already lost to the Hulk in an initial confrontation, Blonsky comes back for Round 2. Blonsky forces Dr. Stearns to give him a booster shot of Banner's proteins, which completely transform him into the Abomination. He goes on a rampage.To save New York, Banner skydives from a military helicopter without a parachute to compel himself to transform into the Hulk. He does so just in time before hitting the pavement. He collides with the Abomination in the night-time New York streets and the two behemoths have a battle royal which culminates on a building roof. After about a half-hour of punishing blows, the Hulk eventually triumphs and jumps away. Humanity is saved (and the Hulk has caused minimal collateral damage).Despite the 'dumbing-down' of this iconic 'monster', I still enjoyed 'The Incredible Hulk' as a well-paced, exciting action flick that makes some improvements on Ang Lee's version. Much as I like Eric Bana in Ang Lee's 'Hulk', he's really too tall and muscular to play Bruce Banner. Edward Norton's slighter build is more suitable to the role. Norton's Banner also projects more vulnerability and desperation. Liv Tyler's performance as Betty Ross reinforces Banner's humanity even as the Hulk even more than Jennifer Connelly's version in 'Hulk'. Tim Roth's manic, driven Blonsky/Abomination promises to give the Hulk more headaches in sequels. And we get to see the Hulk act truly heroic, with hints that he will do so again in the future, if Banner has anything to say about it.",7,0,1,11 March 2011
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Intelligent, Purposeful Toon Chaos Like This Should Never Be Reined In
","'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' (hereafter WFRR) is an exhilarating example of a 'Hamlet Syndrome' movie. I define a 'Hamlet Syndrome' work as one that is so important, revolutionary, and/or complex that it has been endlessly analyzed from multiple perspectives, and therefore impossible to make an original comment upon. In other words, what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before? For example, I'm sure I'm not the only poster who has seen this movie multiple times in the theater (5 times in my case). Also, many posters must own the VHS or DVD version; in fact, WFRR was my first VHS movie purchase and someday I will purchase the DVD. Like many posters, I adore the masterful, seamless, phantasmagoric merger of live action and animation. Sigh! I think I'll comment upon the main factor that, in my opinion, made WFRR such a success - its matter-of-fact, focused intelligence.It seems strange to call the anarchic, partly animated WFRR world focused and intelligent, but it is. The dialogue is whip-smart, sizzling, and meaningful at every moment, even when a toon is speaking it. The development of the murder mystery involving the death of Acme Products's practical joker king Marvin Acme is appropriately convoluted, twisty, and elusive. The detective Eddie Valiant is still street-smart, shrewd, and clever despite his descent into alcoholism and despair over the murder of his brother (poignantly summarized by a photo montage). Likewise, his transition from enjoying to hating toons because his brother was killed by one. The implication of the goofy Roger Rabbit in Acme's murder because of his supposed dalliance with his stunning human toon wife Jessica Rabbit. The stubbornly growing relationship between Roger and his reluctant protector Eddie. The sinister machinations of the cadaverous Judge Doom. Even the toons' fantastic feats which as Roger explains can occur only if they are funny. Every aspect of the film impresses you with its intelligence, because it is smarter than its audience.WFRR is indeed intelligent, and its intelligence extends to pleasing both kids and adults without being condescending or boring to either. Almost inevitably, this means the movie presents risqué dialogue and situations (e.g. Baby Herman's lament about his 40-year-old lust and his 3-year-old dinky, or Eddie's sometime girlfriend and speakeasy owner Delores commenting on the rabbit extending from his pocket). But the movie is agile and lighthearted enough to avoid offending anyone (unlike, say, Rango). The action, jokes, one-liners, and asides are all sharp and really require you to think.The entire tone of WFRR is smart, too, as well as underplayed and low-key. Even when someone acts crazy, as for example in the climax when Eddie attempts to save Roger and Jessica from being immersed in the 'dip' by...I'm not telling, it has a serious objective. Humans interact with cartoons and sometimes even enter Toontown, the toons's abode, but they never BECOME cartoons. The tone bolsters the underlying serious themes of the movie, which are not only will Roger be acquitted, but also whether Eddie will redeem himself professionally and socially. WFRR will also teach you something about '40s film noir and detective movies, if you are observant.WFRR does something more. Its overall craft and brilliance affirms how great human beings can be, when they set their minds to something. Who would expect a collision of flesh-and-blood humans, irreverent Looney Tunes characters, and boisterous Disney characters to do that?",10,1,1,6 April 2011
The Hunger Games," 'The Hunger Games' is a Well-Constructed 'Chimera Movie' Largely Supported by Jennifer Lawrence's performance as Katniss,
","So what is a 'Chimera' movie? Well, in Greek mythology a Chimera is a fire-breathing monster composed of a lion's forequarters, a goat's hindquarters, and a snake for a tail. If you prefer, it's an outlandish 'Frankenstein monster' creature, made of wildly different parts. Therefore, I define a 'Chimera' movie as one created from wildly different but familiar movies. Besides 'Truman Show' ,'Wizard of Oz', 'Logan's Run' 'The Running Man', and 'The Most Dangerous Game,'' let me add to this laundry list by mentioning other movie and literature references like Shirley Jackson's short story 'The Lottery', 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome', 'Gladiator', 'Spartacus' and other Roman Empire spectacle movies, 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' (Elizabeth Banks's character Effie Trinket reminded me of Helen Bonham Carter's Queen of Hearts), 'Robin Hood', and 'Romeo and Juliet' (especially toward the end of the movie when game contestants and 'star-crossed lovers' Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) consider eating some berries).Okay enough of that. Movies borrow all the time. What's important is that they use their borrowings well. So, does 'The Hunger Games' (hereafter THG)utilize its myriad movie parts wisely and effectively? I believe it does, and that it does so due in large part to Lawrence's fairly nuanced and commanding portrayal as Katniss.Without repeating too much of the plot (I hope) since other posters have done that quite efficiently, I felt that Katniss exhibited the proper mixture of tension, resourcefulness, courage, and resoluteness to make THG's portrayal of a sadistic, decadent United States of Dystopia more than halfway believable. We get a glimpse of her pre-Games struggle to keep her and her impoverished mother and younger sister Primrose (Willow Shields) fed and alive with her archery skills. We appreciate her desperate but noble and prudent gesture to volunteer to take Primrose's place in the Games (because we suspect the fragile, terrified Prim would easily have been eliminated). We understand her brusque, standoffish demeanor as she negotiates the pre-Game trials and trainings and subtly introduces us to this bizarre world of the garish elite that control the human sacrifice games. We get hints of her sly intelligence and tenacious will to live as, despite her fiery pride, she does listen to former Hunger Games champion and dissolute current sponsor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) to curry favor with these grotesque aristocrats in order to improve her odds. She does the same with fellow District 12 contestant Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) with whom she shares an ambiguous supportive and dismissive relationship; in other words, are they just acquaintances forced to be uncertain allies under cruel circumstances, or are they becoming friends or something even more? Does Katniss have a plan to defy Panem's masters (her shooting the apple from the roasted pig's mouth during training and her three finger salute to the districts watching the Games sure seem like it) or is she trying to get the odds of her survival more in her favor? Katniss's tantalizingly elusive performance sells us on the seriousness of her strange predicament, and so we become invested in the workings of THG's deliberate, patchwork plot, and the fates of its characters, primarily Katniss's.Without Katniss to guide us, I'm afraid that THG might have become more sluggish under the weight of its movie and literature borrowings. With the possible exception of Peeta, the rest of THG's characters, I feel, get scant time to develop their motivations and goals. The other Games contestants (except maybe the crafty but soulful Rue (Amanida Stenberg)) are simply one-dimensional, sketchy victims. How about learning a little more about them? Lenny Kravitz's sympathetic sponsor Cinna has only about a couple of meaningful interactions with Katniss as he helps her overcome her insecurities and doubts. Banks' Effie gives us just a fleeting taste of the flaky, superficial decadence of Panem's (is that short for Pan-Empire, or All-Empire?) elite. Regarding our introduction to the destitute District denizens, besides Katniss and her soul-sapped family, we barely meet Katniss's handsome beau(?) and fellow hunter Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), who seems to be introduced mainly for a potential menage a trois with Katniss and Peeta. As for Panem president Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland), he is genteelly, quietly menacing and inscrutable, which is okay, but it would have been nice to have at least a couple more scenes to establish a little bit more about his character.THG also seems to have logical inconsistencies. The main objective of the Games is straightforward enough (be the sole survivor), but the rules are certainly arbitrary and changeable from moment to moment. Furthermore, the Game creators are omniscient controllers. Even if a winner emerges and the populace is entertained, the President could arrange to have the winner executed sometime later. Some 'hope'! So why participate? Personally, if I'm a contestant and likely to die anyway, I would defy this rigged deathtrap and die on my own terms. I am surprised that Peeta didn't share that sentiment.It doesn't really matter. THG is a sturdy, involving movie that combines adventure, romance, danger, and social commentary in an agreeable, palatable, almost unsettlingly innocuous way. Without Lawrence's Katniss, I would have rated THG 6 stars. With Katniss's complex but commanding character, THG deserves 8 stars. She manages to make us squirm a little about our ironic enjoyment of kids being compelled to kill each other for the pleasure of a corrupt administration, and to make us reflect a little (though not as much as it could have) about the savage, violent inequalities of our present governments and societies.",8,2,9,3 April 2012
Black Mass," The 'Black Mass' is James 'Whitey' Bulger's Soul – Assuming He Has One
","Although this time we have an Irish-American gangster protagonist instead of the time-worn Italian-American one, 'Black Mass' (hereafter BM) follows the usual rise and fall trajectory of all organized crime movies. However, what distinguishes BM from a lot of these 'Crime Really Doesn't Pay' movies is actor Johnny- Depp's career-zenith performance as that Irish-American gangster protagonist James 'Whitey' Bulger. Most gangster movies manage to find a smidgen of tenderness and caring in their mob boss heroes. In BM, that humanity is just about missing. With his slicked-back white hair, cold blue eyes, and stone-faced sneer, Depp's Bulger seems to be pure, implacable, death-warmed-over evil with no soul at all, or at best a black chunk of coal for a soul.During the mid 70's, Bulger and his 'Winter Hill Gang' consisting of his lieutenant, unshaven and uncouth Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi (Rory Cochrane), newbie Kevin Weeks (Jesse Plemons), and equally poker-faced and sloppy peanut-eating hit-man Johnny Martorano (W. Earl Brown) hold sway over South Boston (or South End or Southie). Bulger took care never to let the public see him rub out his enemies (advice he humorously but chillingly gives his young son, Douglas). Bulger justifies these tactics as necessary to 'protect' Southie from the ambitious mafia-backed North Boston (North End) Italian-American Angiulo Brothers. Of course, it's just a turf war. In this war, Whitey seems to have the edge because he doesn't hesitate to kill not only people who mess with him or betray him, but also people he just SUSPECTS of doing the same. For example, late in the film Bulger strangles Flemmi's prostitute stepdaughter for talking to the cops, even though she swears she didn't squeal on him.Whitey Bulger is not the only one who wants to take out the Angiulo Brothers. A Southie native son, FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) returns home because he is eager to rise in the ranks and thinks that icing the elusive Angiulo Brothers is the way to do it. Thinking Bulger has the 'connections' to bring them down, Connolly wants Bulger to inform on them to the FBI. Even though Bulger's twisted sense of crime and Irish ethnic loyalty makes him initially refuse Connolly's offer, Connolly craftily appeals to that same loyalty to convince Bulger that being an FBI 'snitch' is the only way to get rid of the Angiulos.Slowly and eventually, Connolly realizes that he may have made a deal with a real devil. Bulger blithely and savagely refuses to heed Connolly's warning not to commit crimes and/or kill as he keeps tabs on the Angiulos. On the contrary, Bulger coolly exploits this unholy alliance with the FBI to expand his influence not only in Southie, but even in Miami in a World Jai Alai embezzlement scheme, and as far as Ireland in an IRA (Irish Republican Army) weapons- smuggling operation. Only after Connolly's FBI boss, the demanding Charles McGuire (Kevin Bacon) rides him, and Connolly in turn rides Bulger does he finally get photographic evidence of the Angiulos' criminal haunts, which allows the FBI to nail the brothers through a wiretap.Bulger seems to have it made. His main opponents are out of the picture. His senator brother William Bulger (Benedict Cumberbatch) stays willfully ignorant about Whitey's activities. Helping capture Anguilo should keep the FBI looking the other way. But fate steps in as she always does. Bulger's fragile family life collapses as his son Douglas suffers Reye syndrome, goes into a coma and dies when his mom and Bulger's girlfriend Lindsey (Dakota Johnson) pulls the plug on him despite Whitey's raging opposition. She leave Whitey soon after. Bulger also acts irrationally and threateningly towards Connolly's FBI partner John Morris (David Harbour) in a 'GoodFellas'-inspired 'tell me the recipe' scene, and in an unbearably tense bedroom scene with Connolly's wife Marianne (Julianne Nicholson). Even though Connolly is still in Bulger's corner, Marianne finally gets fed up with his slimy association and locks him out of the house.The beginning of the end comes for Connolly in the form of blunt, all-business prosecutor Fred Wyshak (Corey Stoll), who takes over the U.S. Attorney's Office and brusquely refuses Connolly's bribe of Red Sox tickets and basically tells him to stop his bullsh-t connection with Whitey and bring him in. When undercover agent John McIntyre (Brad Carter) blows the lid on the IRA operation, Bulger kills and buries him. Wyshak also learns the 'assistance' Whitey provided to capture the Angiulo Brothers actually came second-hand from lower-rank informants. In return for immunity, Morris confesses the true relationship that Connolly and Whitey had. When The Boston Globe exposes Whitey's informant activities, the jig is up as the Winter Hill Gang abandons Whitey as a traitor, is arrested, and brings the movie full circle to their taped confessions. Connolly is arrested as well for his conspiratorial crimes. In the epilogue, Whitey becomes a 16-year fugitive, eventually captured by the FBI in 2011.Though cruising over familiar gangster ground, BM is a smoothly-paced, never-boring, and actually unnerving portrait of an unconventional, psychopathic criminal who achieves his murderous ends not so much through flamboyant anger (though Bulger does lose it from time to time) as through inhuman, selfish, enigmatic, unadulterated evil. Even when he is being 'nice', like to his son or mother, it's creepy and foreboding. Again, Depp redeems himself after five movie flops to give an Oscar-caliber performance as a soulless guy that seems to have come straight out of hell. Joel Edgerton nearly steals the spotlight from Depp as the unscrupulous agent Connolly who justifies selling HIS soul by touting his Irish-based loyalty and friendship with Bulger and the old adage 'it takes a thief to catch a thief '. Despite Depp's tour-de-force performance, BM makes me wish for a movie prequel detailing Bulger's young, formative years and the events that led to his criminal career, including stints at Leavenworth and Alcatraz. After all, no one is born evil, right?Right?",8,3,10,24 September 2015
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A Spectacular Blend of Bond Derring-Do, Paranoid Government Conspiracy, and 'Star Wars' Aerial Acrobatics (and of course a Superhero and a (maybe) Supervillain)
","'Captain America: The First Avenger' was generally a hugely satisfying, if somewhat rushed, introduction of a superhuman patriot who forthrightly fights for truth, justice, and the American way. Before we could find out how his '40s and World War II experiences shaped Cap's (Chris Evans) outlook, battles with sinister Nazi scientific/military organizations cryogenically thrust him forward into our shockingly unfamiliar world. Of course, part of the reason for this was that he had to be available for 'Avengers' movies. Nevertheless, this time travel motif set up the always engrossing and recurring conflict between Cap's straight-arrow traditional beliefs and today's more obscure, ambiguous, and even cynical concepts of right and wrong. 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' (hereafter Cap A:WS') explores this conflict, and many others, with soul-stirring action, rousing battles, labyrinthine, twisty, secret government agendas, and the near-Kafkaesque difficulty in telling the good guys from the bad guys in today's world.'Cap A:WS' begins in Washington, DC with Cap (aka: Steve Rogers) literally running circles around his new friend and partner Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), an aerial rescue expert whose alter ego is the high-soaring Falcon, at the Reflecting Pool. Cap is still trying to get accustomed to 21st century modern life in his own unique version of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Sam works at the local VA hospital and invites Steve to hear about wounded veterans' experiences and put his own into perspective. Despite his on-going culture shock, and his suspicions about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s ultimate objectives, Steve/Cap still ably participates on missions under the watchful eye (literally) of the stern, enigmatic Colonel Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson).On Fury's orders, Steve/Cap, along with exquisitely martial-arts trained Russian (double?) spy Natasha Romanoff (aka: Black Widow) (Scarlett Johansson), goes on what he thinks is a routine mission to save some S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel held as hostages aboard a ship by brutal mercenary Georges Batroc (Georges St. Pierre). After a bruising battle, Steve/Cap and Natasha succeed in freeing the hostages, but then notices that the mission had another purpose unknown to him, but quite known to Natasha: retrieve a flash drive disk containing important information. Steve angrily confronts Fury about this deception; Fury responds that the data pertains to the Insight Program, a type of national defense shield programmed to neutralize all hostile threats. However, S.H.I.E.L.D is unable to decipher the flash drive's data, prompting Fury to see an old acquaintance, World Security Chairman Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) to persuade him to delay implementing INSIGHT. Pierce apparently acquiesces.Subsequently, while driving home, Fury is ambushed by mercenaries disguised as cops and led by the Winter Soldier, an unidentified masked assassin with a metallic left arm who has superhuman abilities equal to Steve's/Cap's. Despite grievous injuries, Fury escapes to the sanctuary of Steve's/Cap's apartment, gives Steve the flash drive disk, warns him to 'trust no one', and expires. Now it's up to Cap, Natasha, and Sam to avoid the Winter Soldier and his hordes (and other, unexpected people) and find out what is on the disk. Eventually the trio uncover another organization with a name straight out of Greek mythology (and an apt name, too, if you know your Greek mythology) with short-term plans to seize S.H.I.E.L.D. satellites to kill millions of people, and long-term plans for world domination through promises of security. Not only do the trio have to stop this somehow without getting killed, they have to find out if S.H.I.E.L.D., the INSIGHT program and Councilman Pierce are complicit in this, AND defeat the Winter Soldier and uncover his identity (Hint: It's somebody from Steve's/Cap's past, a most unexpected somebody.)'Cap A:WS' certainly zooms (often literally) above a typical mindless superhero brawl and even a 'Star Wars'-type dogfight, and is certainly more thrilling, emotionally draining, and substantial. As my review title mentions, 'Cap A:WS' is an enhanced, more muscular, more windingly complex (you have to pay attention) and even more relevant update of the Bond movies, dealing with national security and fear and the sometimes tyrannical lengths government will go to preserve one and banish the other. The movie deals with the paranoic effect corrupt agencies have on human loyalty, trust, and integrity and the psychological toll it can take; for example, even though they are effective partners, Natasha's shady, double- crossing, mendacious past makes Steve feel a wee bit distrustful of her. Ditto for Steve's testy interactions with Fury. The movie even finds time for Steve/Cap to encounter reminders and would-be lovers from his past, and the bittersweet, nostalgic feelings they produce. Not least important, 'Cap A: WS' illustrates the strength of friendship, even if one person is more committed to the friendship than the other, and the sacrifices that committed person is willing to make to resurrect that friendship. You'll recognize that friendship if you see the movie.And I most enthusiastically recommend you do see 'Cap A:WS', both a critical and commercial triumph, because it is that oxymoronic rarity, the 'intelligent action movie' It stimulates your adrenaline and emotions, and it challenges your reasoning and your ethics, and it reassures you that despite the lies, deceit, disillusionment, hatred, and betrayals that seemingly overwhelm our modern world, you don't have to be Captain America, Black Widow, or Falcon to have the will to defy these bad things and do the right thing (you'll recognize that scene when you see it).",10,1,3,3 July 2015
Pacific Rim," Take Note, Toho, Dean Devlin, and Roland Emmerlich - THIS Is How It's Done!
","Even to this day, Toho's demented giant creature features and Devlin/Emmerlich's 1998 'Godzilla' remake have their defenders (and I am among them to a limited degree). Yet, every so often, even champions of these 'kaiju' (Japanese for 'monster') flicks, and I, must have wished that these flicks could get a sophisticated big-budget CGI blockbuster treatment and still remain faithful to their roots. To a triumphant degree, 'Pacific Rim' (hereafter PR) has answered our prayers.As it should be, the premise is simple and direct. As PR's prologue explains, for millennia, seemingly countless sky-towering kaiju kept emerging from a fissure or portal at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean and ravaged the earth for food and resources. Fortunately, mankind discovered that heavy nuclear weaponry could repel and destroy these bizarre beasts - at first. However, more adaptable and invulnerable Kaiju emerged from the ocean floor. As a desperate last defense, mankind (through the Pan Pacific Defense Corps or PPDC) constructed skyscraper-sized robots called Jaegers (German for 'Hunters') to combat the Kaiju.These robots are not sentient. Indeed, because of their colossal size, Jaegers require two pilots, each representing the left and right hemispheres of the brain, to operate the left and right sides of the robot body - like a combination of virtual reality and remote control. To make sure the Jaeger functions fluidly (and not like a schizophrenic drunk), the two pilots must establish a neural link (called the drift) that permits telepathic communication and sharing of ideas and memories. The only drawback to the drift is that the pilots may share traumatic memories that inhibit their performance and jeopardize the mission.Among the best of the Jaegar pilots is gung-ho, cocky, but appealing Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and his brother Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff). However, an abortive Kaiju mission costs Yancy his life. His confidence understandably shaken, Raleigh becomes an engineer working to build towering walls in a vain attempt to keep the Kaiju out. After the barriers prove ineffective, PPDC commander Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba, a dependable actor redeeming himself after his underwritten role in 'Prometheus') recruits Raleigh to give the Jaegers (namely Gypsy Danger) another go. Besides his loss of nerve, another obstacle to Raleigh's getting back in the saddle is finding a 'neurally compatible' pilot. Athletic, nimble, and martial-arts savvy Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) seems to be the ideal candidate.Things get off to a catastrophic start. Mako's painful memory of a catastrophic Kaiju city attack that killed her family while she was a very young girl causes the Jaeger to go haywire. As a result, Pentecost benches Raleigh and Mako and sends the remaining Jaeger team out. But when the team proves helpless against a Kaiju Hong Kong invasion, Stacker grudgingly deploys Raleigh and Mako, who get their act together and in a titanic battle stop both Kaiju.Meanwhile, the loudly arrogant and bespectacled Dr. Newton (Newt) Geiszler (Charlie Day) examines cerebral tissue obtained from Kaiju corpses, including the one left in Hong Kong plus its fetus (!), and from a shady, potentially lethal 'Kaiju body parts' black marketer Hannibal Chau. Dr. Geiszler finds he can create his own neural link with the beasts and gradually learn more about them. Of course this two-way reciprocal link means the Kaiju can read and pinpoint Dr. Geiszler's mind, which imperiled the Hong Kong bunker where Geiszler hid with some of the population. With the help of the peevishly skeptical Dr. Herman Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) this all leads to a possible solution to the Kaiju problem: if the Jaegers can infiltrate the Kaiju portal and destroy it from within, no more monsters can pour out. Can the Jaegers -named Gypsy Danger- do it, and can its pilots Raleigh and Mako get out alive?I found PR to be a satisfying but not mind-numbing adrenaline rush, with well-paced but exhilarating human,robot and monster action. And yet PR took the time to develop character motivations and interactions, even if you've seen them a million times before, and to make them affecting and achingly real. Mako's memory of her encounter with a Kaiju was especially shocking, sad, and eerily reminiscent of 9/11. Raleigh was appropriately committed, supportive, and loyal, especially to his partner but (refreshingly) not lover Mako, and strangely both loyal to and defiant of Stacker. Stacker demonstrated both leadership toughness and (almost overprotective) paternal care towards an unexpected adoptive daughter, and can certainly deliver an inspirational fight speech. And oh, yes, the scientists did manage to be funny despite occasional abrasiveness. I look forward to buying the DVD.P.S.: I am dismayed to learn that PR is turning out to be a flop in the States. Initially, I was baffled by this, then I pondered a few possible reasons why: 1) Although there are protagonists in the movie, primarily Raleigh and Mako, I guess they weren't featured often or prominently enough for some people; 2) Almost all of the monster/robot fight scenes were filmed at night, perhaps to conceal some perceived CGI flaws; 3) Admittedly it was sometimes difficult to differentiate the fighting combatants because of some quick, close-up editing, 4) I believe some people have a xenophobic and foreign bias against seemingly 'non-American' movies, and 5) 'Kaiju' movies may have mainly an esoteric or devoted cult status. Oh well, that is their concern. As retribution, I hope PR cleans up overseas, and particularly breaks box-office records in Japan.P.P.S.: I've heard that a 2014 Godzilla remake is in the works. For it to succeed, I highly recommend it have the lines 'He's unstoppable.' and/or 'All our weapons are useless against him.'",8,0,3,3 April 2014
American Sniper," This War Movie is Both Straightforward and Ambiguous, Like Its Protagonist, Who Emerges as a Bit of An Unknown Soldier.
","At least in the post-Vietnam era, arguably, good war movies should make poor military recruitment videos. In other words, they should make you want to stay as far the hell away from the hell of war as possible. By this standard, director Clint Eastwood's 'American Sniper' (hereafter 'AS') is at least partially a good movie. Even though its protagonist, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), appears to be a decent, good-old-boy, patriotic Texan eager to enlist in the U.S. Navy and become a Navy SEAL after hearing of U.S. embassy bombings, his Iraqi Gulf War military experiences, I don't think, would make most people want to visit Iraq and kill terrorists. Nevertheless, 'AS' also seems to retain some of the gung-ho spirit of straightforward pre-Vietnam movies to make the case that this is a 'worthwhile' war in the sense that it was necessary to protect American security. Perhaps AS is both straightforward and ambiguous, both in its depiction of wartime heroics and atrocities, and its depiction of a soldier that revels in, and is damaged by, his role as a sniper.Through the obligatory, practically-cliché montage of boot camp training and bellowing, obscene drill instructors, Chris manages to distinguish himself as a SEAL and particularly a sniper (perhaps the modern-day equivalent of a quick-draw gunslinger). Before shipping out to Iraq, post-9/11, he clumsily but earnestly woos Taya Renae (Sienna Miller) in a bar and eventually weds her. In 'AS', Taya serves as the back-home, civilization counterpoint to the war, and the gauge of Chris's personality changes. Even though some may see sniping as a safe, unmanly way to fight a war, 'AS' convinces us that that is not so. From strategic rooftops Kyle essentially provides a kind of reconnaissance for the other American troops by correctly identifying and picking off potential guerrillas and hidden assassins. It is intense, nerve-wracking work not only because he has to nail the killers before they blow up the troops, but also because he has only a split-second to determine IF they are killers, and not innocent bystanders. It is possible that a mother and son can be a deadly threat.Chris proves adept at killing the 'right' people and earns the name 'Legend' from his grateful squad for his numerous hits. But perhaps to hedge his bets about proving Chris's bravery, Eastwood also has Chris fighting in the streets alongside his fellow soldiers and helping them hunt for the al-Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; during house-to-house searches in abandoned areas. After Chris's and an interpreter's intense, heated interrogation, an Iraqi father and son offer to lead Chris to al-Zarqawi. The search is thwarted by al-Zarqawi's sadistic lieutenant, 'The Butcher' (Mido Hamada) who literally likes drilling soldiers and civilians alike. Chris fails to save the father and son from the 'Butcher', which haunts him after he returns home from his first tour. Although, grimly and humorously, if improbably, Chris keeps in touch with Taya by cellphone during lulls in the action, including learning of his wife's impending pregnancy, he finds it hard to settle into civilian life.After that, 'AS' settles into alternating, occasionally tedious, warzone/homefront scenes as subsequent three tours makes it increasingly more difficult for Chris to adjust back to home life. Guilt at being unable to save all fellow soldier lives, Post-Traumatic-Strees Disorder, and his vengeful desire to kill not only the 'savage Butcher' but a rival, equally-skilled, Olympic- level Iraqi sniper Mustafa (Sammy Sheik) compel Chris to go back to the warzone . Of course this frays his relationship with Taya. Chris generally succeeds in carrying out his vengeance, and through a blinding sandstorm, returns home to stay. It's still a struggle to get acclimated to home, as encounters with a nurse and an overactive hound saw, but Chris, especially with help by a VA hospital, finds peace counseling fellow wounded, maladjusted veterans. But in that healing, counseling process, Chris ironically and tragically meets 'friendly fire'.'AS' is a quite more-than-adequate 'War is Crazy Hell But Sometimes Necessary' movie that also manages to advance the old adage of 'Hate the war but love the soldier.' Despite his alienation from his family and his sometimes racist regard for the Iraqi's, Bradley Cooper manages to depict Chris as a fundamentally solid, good man who may have been warped by his war experiences. Whether that assessment is true for the real, departed Chris Kyle will always be open to spirited debate (hero or barbarian?), because in spite of 'AS' the movie and the autobiographical novel which inspired it, he will always be something of an unknown soldier, even to his grieving, loved ones, personal and public.",8,41,76,9 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A solid, respectable addition to the first trilogy, at least
","After the initial advertisements and generally condescending reviews, I was ready to concede that the only reason I was going to see 'Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones' was to fulfill a societal obligation to yield to the Lucas franchise juggernaut and keep abreast of Star Wars lore so I wouldn't be blatantly ignorant. Well, after leaving a boring birthday party early and going to see it at Showcase Cinemas in Revere, MA at 7:15 p.m. on Sunday, May 19, 2002, my final evaluation of the movie, out of 4 stars, is 3-3.5 stars. Overall, the movie is a well-crafted, intelligent, and worthy addition to the Star Wars canon. I think it falls somewhat short of the IV-VI first trilogy (but then the initial trilogy is beyond emulation anyway), but, as others have noted, it is better than 'Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace'. Even in its own right, as a movie disconnected from the series progression, 'Attack...' acquits itself well.As a brief synopsis, as others have noted, 'Attack...' is a tad slow and ponderous for the first half and exhilaratingly frenetic and dynamic in the second. The backgrounds, CGI work, visuals, other special effects, and general cinematography are superb, especially in the coliseum and final battle sequences. Not once did I feel any artificiality or 'blue matte painting' unreality. It seemed logically real. Despite Roger Ebert's grumblings of vague, grainy, and obscure visuals, the movie looked bright and colorful enough to me (and I didn't see the digital version). The set pieces involving the 'Fifth Element'esque chase by Obi-Wan and Anakin of the would-be assassin, Obi-Wan's battle with Jango Fett on the eternal waterworld, the conveyor belt ordeal Anakin and Amidala endure in the droid factory, and of course the 'Gladiator' beast and droid/clone clash toward the end of the movie were pulse-pounding, energetic, and ultimately convincing.The plot was convoluted and labyrinthine, to be sure, but quite comprehensible if one paid sufficient attention. I agree that the dialogue and other verbal exchanges were prosaic, pedestrian, and dull, but I believe that was so because of the dreaded portent of Anakin's (Hayden Christensen's) future descent into Darth Vader's nefariousness. I think neither the actors nor Lucas dared to add any levity to the movie because of this solemn main plot. I admit the lack of sprightly banter so prevalent in the first trilogy was a handicap, but not a fatal one. Also, Christensen's performance was not as horrendous, IMHO, as others had opined. Sure, he was an impudent, impatient whiner at times, but at others he eerily foreshadowed the monstrous villain he would become (as in the black cloak and sinister Darth Vader silhouette he sported on Tatooine). Also remember, although an accomplished Jedi apprentice, Anakin had not yet attained full knight status; add the facts that he is still in the throes of confused adolescence and identity, and I think one could find his willful, arrogant, conflicted behavior quite natural and expected. Luke Skywalker started out as a confused adolescent himself; remember how mature and serious he became in 'Return of the Jedi'.Aside from the relatively uninspired banter, all the actors performed admirably, nobly and competently, especially Obi-wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), Mace Windu (Samuel Jackson), and of course, the inimitable Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz). I even found Anakin's fitful romance with deposed Naboo queen/current Naboo senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) generally charming, sweet, and pleasant, if awkward, but again, first love is almost always awkward and first lovers are usually not a font of eloquence. C3-PO (voice of Anthony Daniels) had some amusing moments, especially during his mind/body switch with a droid, as did the utterly dependable R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), especially during his flight sequence in the droid factory (question: did he lose his flight capabilities in IV-VI?) Even the universally loathed Jar Jar Binks (voice of Ahmed Best) was rather tolerable and even subdued at times, of course considering he had only three scenes or so. He goes down easy in small bites, but how in the galaxy did he become a Federation senator? Count Dooku (the immortal Christopher Lee) was an imposing villain, especially in his unforgettable showdown with an animated 'whirling dervish' Yoda. I especially found his line 'Obviously this battle will not be decided by knowledge of the Force, but by lightsabers', humorous; shouldn't it be the other way around? Ah, any excuse to rouse the philosophical little gremlin from his Buddist reverie! Yoda, of course, is the most memorable character and by now transcends description. CGI suits him well. My favorite line in the movie comes from him (and I paraphrase): 'A planet Obi-Wan has lost, my students. Help him find it, we must!'In conclusion, 'Attack of the Clones' is a good movie that generally has nothing to be ashamed of. It delivers on all cinematic counts except sparkling dialogue and competently and mostly seamlessly advances the Star Wars mythos. Star Wars purists will most likely cherish it. I'm glad I saw it (not solely due to peer pressure) and it makes me avidly anticipate Episode III.Good show (detractors notwithstanding)!",8,0,0,20 May 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Immensely entertaining, especially during the current chaos
","After reading some of the comments regarding an alleged 'Shrek'/'Monsters, Inc. rivalry, I simply want to conclude that I enjoyed both heartily (bought the 'Shrek' DVD yesterday, will definitely purchase the 'Monsters, Inc.' DVD) and that both are highly accomplished animated features.  On the 'Ebert and Roeper' TV show, critic Richard Roeper somewhat dismissed the film as something the kids would enjoy, but something where the adults would be glancing at their watches every few minutes.  I can assure Mr. Roeper that my eyes did not stray ONCE during the film;  the poor fellow must be jaded by so-called sophisticated movies. I will not rehash the plot.  I will say that all elements that constitute a movie, from background to characterization, were dazzling, convincing, and comprehensive.  Monstropolis emerges as a fully fleshed out dimension uncannily mirroring our own - even up to the minute, with the simultaneously uproarious but sobering scene where a monster returns from the human dimension with a child's sock stuck to his back and he is manhandled (monster-handled) by decontamination crew members. Mike Waslowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. ('Sully') Sullivan (Goodman) move easily through this world.  While the 'Odd Couple' pairing is obviously not new (as admittedly, the plot - BUT WHO CARES?), Crystal and Goodman add spicy spin to their camaraderie.  Despite Crystal's comedic presence, Goodman anchors this movie with his hulking and massive but ultimately sensitive and caring character, well, at least a good part of the time.  Boo gives Sully a run for his money in the  presence department.Despite superficial plot similarities to Toy Story (especially in the climactic dimensional door pursuit - yes, a potential Disney theme ride) and yes, even a smidgen of 'King Kong), 'Monsters, Inc.' stands on its own as a fascinating, well-rendered, multi-faceted piece of work.  It is NOT a sickeningly cloying, sweet movie.  Its moments of tenderness are balanced with some unsettling moments (e.g., Sully's scare demonstration (scared me, too) which terrifies Boo, Boo's restraint in the 'Scream Suction' device by the nefarious, reptilian Randall, and Sully's/Randall's fight, where Sully is being strangled by his invisible enemy).  Sully's and Boo's developing relationship mixed in both laughter and tears  The dialogue and presence of the supporting characters was natural, matter-of-fact, and all the more funny for it.In short, 'Monster, Inc.''s plan came wonderfully together.  Unlike some commentators, the movie DOES have messages, not only of love and devotion and self-acceptance, but also about having the courage to risk altering a lifetime of conditioned thinking and behavior when it proves to be misguided. Pixar, you've done it again.  Keep doing it...please!  'Monsters, Inc. One quibble:  Boo spends a considerable amount of time in the Monstropolis dimension.  I wonder what her parents were thinking when she was missing. Perhaps the Monstropolis dimension is on a different time line, where hours there are the equivalent of minutes in our dimension (time relativity and all). Out of 5 stars, I would rate 'Monsters, Inc.' 4 1/2 stars(a slight demerit to familiarity of plot, but again, WHO CARES?)  Rejuvenate heart, body, and soul.  See this movie!",9,0,1,12 November 2001
American Hustle," The Con Goes On and On and On...and So Does the Hair!
","American Hustle' (hereafter 'AH') is a reasonably entertaining and engrossing variation of the sturdy 'Small-Time Con Man is Pushed Into the Big Leagues' plot. The small-time con man is the paunchy and sleazy-looking Irving (Christian Bale) with ratty hair that has a life of its own. Irving gravitates toward scams and fraudulent businesses because he remembers the racketeers and hoodlums taking advantage of his glass-selling father, and wants to be the on the winning side. Mainly he dabbles in selling art forgeries and using the proceeds to arrange phony loans to desperate customers. Somewhat amazingly, he attracts the romantic attention of a sultry, slinky red-haired distaff con artist Sydney Prosser (alias: Lady Edith Greensly) (Amy Adams). Together they stage more lucrative, but still relatively low-level scams. Irving keeps Sydney as a mistress and comforting muse and morale-booster because he is married to shrill, maritally frustrated, and seemingly dense Rosalyn Rosenfeld (Jennifer Lawrence from the 'The Hunger Games') and has a young son by her. Almost inevitably, Irving and Sydney choose the wrong mark for one of their bogus art sales - excitable, eager, but somewhat meatheaded mama's boy Richard 'Richie' Dimaso, FBI Agent.To avoid jail time, Irving and Sydney agree to help 'Richie' orchestrate an 'Abscam' inspired sting operation intended to expose at least four U.S. congressmen for bribery and, I think, violation of immigration laws since a 'wealthy Sheik Abdullah' (actually Paco Hernandez) offers to fast-track his American naturalization process for a hefty fee. Somehow, all this action also involves 'slightly unscrupulous' New Jersey Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) and his desire to develop waterfront property businesses and casinos to help his constituents. And that's the plot of AH.Besides the reasonable pleasure of watching the scams (and counterscams and double-crosses) unfold and unravel, AH also vividly and convincingly re-creates the outlandish and kooky zeitgeist of the '70s with well-chosen '70s song classics (like Steely Dan's 'Reeling in the Years' and Wings's 'Live and Let Die'), the occasional parties, and introduction of new gadgets like microwaves, which Rosalyn learns are hostile to aluminum foil. Especially, AH does not forget the hair styles. Irving isn't the only one with follicle trouble; his wife Rosalyn's 'do looks like yellow spaghetti; Mayor Polito has the Elvis pompadour; even FBI agent Richie (in a hilarious sequence) shows how he gets all the little curls in his hair as his mother yells at him to fix the fish tank filter. Richie's exasperated and brow-beaten FBI superior and mentor Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.) provides some humorous bits as he tries to stop Richie from squandering funds on an entire hotel floor for the scam, and to relate and finish an ice-fishing experience he had with his brother as a kid. Jennifer Lawrence (as Rosalyn) is a hoot as the complaining 'bubblehead' who nevertheless has valid objections against Irving's treatment of her and even advises him on a Plan B when one of his cons (can't remember which one) starts to go south. From time to time, AH also provides voice-overs (mainly from Irving but sometimes from Sydney) explaining his philosophy, his motivation, and the movie's plot.Thus, AH has its positive qualities, but for me the movie stumbled somewhat because it fails to follow Irving's credo to work on small, simple cons. The straightforward plot starts to wind back upon itself as cons get conned and counter-conned and players get played and counterplayed. Robert DeNiro's fleeting and almost-stereotypical but expectedly effective portrayal of mobster Victor Tellegio wanting a piece of the 'Sheik''s action actually, I humbly think, needlessly complicates matters. Eventually, at about the midway point, AH becomes, as another Amazon.com reviewer puts it, 'yawny', and I momentarily lost track. That was unfortunate for me, because the climax and denouement of AH, with some ironic turns and fates for characters we expected otherwise that the midway point might have explained.Overall, I generally recommend the movie and its various retroactive pleasures (including predicaments that could have been solved by cell phones and Internet access if they had existed in the early '70s), especially the funky coiffures. But try to keep your attention focused, because AH's con goes on and on and on, and might leave you behind if you're not careful.",7,0,2,6 March 2014
Man of Steel," The More You Try to Reimagine Superman, The More He Remains Gloriously True to Himself,
","I must admit I was a bit leery about watching 'Man of Steel' (hereafter MoS) after hearing rumors that he would undergo some sort of dark, tortured, and psychologically probing 'Dark Knight' makeover, or some sort of Spiderman-like brooding existential angst. No matter how eager you are to confirm realistically Superman's importance to our modern jaded times, you really don't have a lot of dramatic wiggle room with the legendary Kryptonian. We must face facts; for over 75 years, Superman has been as close to God as a mortal can hope to get. How do you reintroduce Superman as a new, fresh character without fundamentally changing who he is?MoS addresses this unenviable dilemma by, yes, combining some of that Spidey existential angst with the old 'journey towards your destiny' plot, while still maintaining and elaborately explaining the basic elements of his origin. This time,though, the realization of his Christ-like destiny as mankind's protector and savior is more tentative, erratic, and uncertain.Superman has all the marvelous powers we know and love, but he must learn to control, focus, and use them at the right time. The movie's shocking depiction of young Clark's uncontrolled X-ray vision and how it compels him to hide in his school's janitor's room is a novel illustration of this. Also, his forbearance will be interpreted as wimpiness, so he will be unwisely baited by kid and adult bullies to fight back. Clark/Kal-El (buff but endearing hunk Henry Cavill) will learn from his holographic father/mentor Jor-El (a solemn Russell Crowe) that he is the symbolic AND genetic embodiment of his race and must accept the task of not only setting an example for Earth, but also somehow regenerating Krypton. Furthermore, he must accomplish this task without frightening the suspicious, fearful earthlings. This is indeed a heavy Herculean burden.But, was there any real doubt that Superman could bear this burden? Besides Jor-El, he receives unexpected guidance from intrepid, globetrotting newspaper reporter Lois Lane, no longer the clueless, hopelessly reckless victim of old. She doggedly follows Clark's odd job wanderings and convincingly pieces together who he is and cares about him as a person first (and not a love at first sight). Of course Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) provide the down-to-earth grounding and patient nurturing that Clark needs as an emotional anchor. MoS shows that Superman will need that guidance when the wild-eyed maniacal Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his troops accidentally burst free from the Phantom Zone due to Krypton's explosion, and make a beeline towards Earth as a platform for his own ruthless resuscitation of the old homeworld. There's nothing like a planetary threat to help a superhuman decide what he wants to do with his life.Of course, this will involve epic, world-shattering clashes that would make the Transformers rust with envy. But once the dust and rubble clears, the iconic, and reassuring Superman (and Clark Kent) personas emerge at last. That is why I mainly enjoyed MoS - it respects what Superman represents and is while still exploring his thoughts, feelings, and hopes for the future, and challenging his values and morals. This is a tricky dance, but MoS executed it well.P.S. As other posters have logically and thoroughly documented, MoS does have its head-shaking inconsistencies and plot stumblings. For example, we have the infamous tornado scene; Jonathan should have realized that Clark could have saved him at blurry super-speed without revealing his identity. This could have also applied to the school bus rescue. Jonathan's obsession with concealing Clark's true nature was also maddeningly baffling. And, of course, the destructive Superman/Zod showdown. Superman realistically would be facing a tidal wave of civil and even criminal litigation, and the Smallville/Metropolis populace would be outraged and want these aliens gone. Finally, Superman's deadly resolution of the Zod problem was most likely unnecessary. There were numerous other ways to end the threat before resorting to that uncharacteristic act. Nonetheless, MoS is both thoughtful, introspective, and just plain rousing, slam-bang entertainment!",9,1,8,16 July 2013
The Village," The Ultimate 'C'mon' movie (Spoilers Below)
","To be uncharacteristically succinct, I think 'The Village' was an inept melange of 'The Truman Show', 'The Twilight Zone', 'The Prisoner', and 'Scooby Doo' (the elders would have gotten away with it too, were it not for the meddling kids Lucius and Ivy). Admittedly, its themes of secure utopia (and the lengths people will reach to preserve it) and the 'woods as labyrinthine hell' metaphor were intriguing and thought-provoking, but I felt M. Night Shyalaman's framework for presenting these themes was too contrived, attenuated,inept and inconsistent to be effective. As a 30-minute 'Twilight Zone' episode, the premise would have had more shocking impact. As a feature-length movie, it appeared amateurish and pretentious instead, with too many plot and logic holes. Perhaps Mr. Shyalaman should have presented his themes in a straightforward way, without 'the past is really the present' or 'it was Earth all along - god damn you all to hell' twist, and really achieved the ultimate twist of having no twist.One can forgive a movie's lapses in logic if they are infrequent and the movie is basically intelligent and entertaining, but I felt 'The Village' is truly neither. The dialogue is self-consciously excruciatingly pompous, the characters' actions stupefying (i.e. Lucius has been stabbed twice in the abdomen; his life is dribbling away, will SOMEBODY get the medicine already? and 'Ivy, get down in the cellar already?'), the 'monsters' shoddily anthropomorphic and the ending inert. I did like the atmosphere and cinematography, however, but small compensation for this 'house of cards' movie. To play devil's advocate for a moment, perhaps Mr. Shyalaman deliberately made his movie imperfect to inspire thoughtful commentary and discussion (is THIS the ultimate twist?)Now I present a list of plot/logic lapses designed to prompt 'C'mon' responses:1. Could even a billionaire arrange to prevent airplanes from flying over the woodlands preserve?2. Those poles the villagers were painting the mollifying color yellow sure looked like telephone poles.3. Would you put a monster suit in a cellar where the village idiot would have ready access to it?4. Would any rational, humane person send a blind girl (no matter how stereotypically pure and resourceful, since of course blind people are always above reproach, unflinchingly brave, and possess extrasensory perception - is she Daredevil's daughter?) alone into the woods for medicine? That is cruel and unusual punishment violating the 8th amendment!5. To protect the 'idyllic', 'pristine' village from the encroachment of evil civilization, wouldn't you need an army of security personnel? Only one appears in the movie and, even though he's apparently a novice, he seemed inert.6. Cut off from the outside world, how can the village sustain itself for any period of time? Wouldn't the inhabitants go mad being restricted to the village limits? Curiosity will ultimately surmount fear.7. As my friend Joe Flynn, who watched the movie with me, said, 'Wouldn't some stoned teenagers trespass into the woodland preserve and stumble upon the village?' Exactly.If I had to rate this movie, I would give it a 3/10. Still, in its maladroit way, 'The Village' stimulates thought, which is more than you can say for many movies that are otherwise more efficient and entertaining!",3,0,1,27 August 2004
Kung Fu Panda 2," Kung Fu Panda 2 - The Quest for Balance (or Yin and Yang, if You Like)
","Most of Dreamworks's animated efforts have complacently settled for being rousing, diverting, and knowingly satirical action-and-violence stories, but not especially memorable (thinking about Shark Tale, for example). Occasionally, some of their movies leaven all the crazy action and movement with important themes, like the meaning of isolation and innate virtue and love in the Shrek movies. However, at the pinnacle of Dreamworks's animated features is one that poignantly delves into the character of a seemingly silly, corpulent, and superficial panda who somehow possesses devastating martial arts skills. Yes, Kung Fu Panda 2 (hereafter KFP2) has all the action, color, adventure, and conflict of its lesser Dreamworks cousins, but it is also profoundly different. Besides being a chop-socky martial arts adventure for the kiddies, KFP2 offers food for thought for more mature viewers, namely, the importance of balance (or yes, master, yin and yang) for a full and healthy life.At the beginning of KFP2, it appears that the panda, Po (voice of Jack Black), has that full and healthy life. He is now the accomplished dragon warrior and leader of kung fu wizards the Furious Five, and has the respect and admiration of his sensei Master Shifu (voice of Dustin Hoffman), and the loving supervision of his restaurateur father Ping (voice of James Hong). But in the Furious Five's latest mission to prevent a horde of wolves from looting metal from a local village, Po's confrontation with the Boss Wolf (voice of Danny McBride) triggers a disturbing memory that knocks him off his stride and lets the wolves get away. As the usually cheerful Po solemnly ponders these memories which seem to show a wolf attack on a village and two parent pandas leaving their baby behind, those memories intertwine with the machinations of the latest garden-variety megalomaniac, Lord Shen (voice of Gary Oldman). Shen is a colorless peacock who, partly fueled by resentment against parents he sees as stifling, wishes to conquer China and perhaps the world. Although adept at kung fu, Shen plans to use weapons and artillery to attack, hence the minion wolves' metal raid. Thus, if we are careful, we see both the main protagonist and antagonist (Po and Shen) as 'unbalanced' individuals seeking to stabilize themselves. The genius of KFP2 is its demonstration that, in a way, each needs the other for balance.Nagging at the back of Po's mind is the realization that Ping cannot be his true father. But as his dreams gradually show, HE was that baby panda abandoned by his parents in the radish box as the wolves attacked. That box gradually made its way to Ping's shop. Since Po's parents did not arrive to claim the child, Ping raised Po as his own, with the usual frustrations and complications. Po is grateful to Ping, but he is out of balance because he can't understand why his parents would leave him. A calm, unperturbed, ram seer (voice of Michelle Yeoh) eventually shows Po that Shen instigated the attack on his parents' village and that they had to abandon him for his own safety. But instead of easing his mind, this knowledge awakens feelings of vengeance against Shen and unbalances Po further.Furthermore, the ram seer nominally works for Shen and constantly reminds him that a force of black and white (i.e. panda Po) will be his undoing and that he should refrain from his conquest. Shen petulantly and arrogantly refuses to listen. Who - Po or Shen - will embrace balance and, by association, inner peace as exemplified by Master Shifu? The ram seer advises Po not to obsess on the past but to improve on and develop the present and future. You know, let it go, and go on. Does Po listen? You will see when you witness the climactic confrontation between Po and the Furious Five, and Shen's armed armada sailing down the river to the sea.KFP2 is an astoundingly towering tour-de-force. It takes the standard worn-out martial arts trope, and balances it with respect of ancient Chinese geography, architecture, and philosophy. It shows ALL its anthropomorphic characters with multifaceted, sometimes opposite, characteristics (serious and playful) striving to keep them working together. Finally, KFP2 shows us that balanced inner peace is one of humanity's greatest gifts, symbolized by the familiar black and white yin and yang symbol. Po is of course black and white. Does he eventually symbolize that peaceful yin and yang? Again, watch the climactic battle, and you will definitely find out.With this consoling philosophy, KFP2 is a considerable, Pixar-level production, and promises to continue to do so with its sequel-hinting final shot, which promises more conflict but also more consolation for Po.",8,0,1,26 June 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Peter Parker
","Initially, like many people, my knee-jerk response to 'The Amazing Spiderman' (hereafter TAS) was 'unnecessary and redundant'. I felt that Tobey Maguire's interpretation on the famed arachnoid (and Peter Parker) was thoroughly satisfying and complete. Therefore, I didn't bother seeing TAS at the Cineplex. But recently on cable, Encore was periodically showing TAS and, eventually giving into my curiosity, sat down one Saturday morning to give TAS a chance. Now I wish I had seen TAS in the movie theatre. Although it covers the usual Spidey origin trajectory (nerdy but brainy loner, loving aunt/uncle, bite from genetically altered spider, subsequent infusion of powers and confidence, emergence of outlandish but deadly villain), I think TAS does a more touching, affecting, and dare I say it, grittily realistic depiction of Spiderman, and more importantly, Peter Parker.Too often, superheroes eclipse their alter egos and give us the often mistaken impression that without their powers, they are nobodies ('Hero to Zero', you might say). Many superhero movies seem to reflect that impression and somewhat rush the origin story so that we can get to the exciting hero as quickly as possible. I think Sam Raimi's 'Spiderman' did that to some extent, acknowledging but accelerating Maguire's Peter Parker angst, sorrow, and alienation so that people didn't feel too down and could get to see their high-swinging, inspirational hero as soon as possible. Director Mark Webb's TAS takes more deliberate, measured time in revealing Spidey because I think he wants the audience to realize that Peter Parker is an amazing kid way before the fateful spider gets to him.So instead of rushing through the tense high school drama to get to college, as Maguire's Parker did, Andrew Garfield's Parker remains in high school and emotionally, uncomfortably, but convincingly reminds us how harrowing that environment can be, especially to a reserved, sometimes inarticulate loner and orphan. And yet, Peter is far from pathetic. In TAS, he is a skilled photographer and skateboarder. He is also an accomplished science student, and he proves it when he deciphers his late parents' science papers, formulas, and algorithms, especially the missing formula that completes amputee Dr. Curtis Connor's (Rhys Ifans's) successful but horrifyingly reptilian tissue regeneration. Of course, unlike Maguire's Spidey's organic webs, Garfield's Parker devises the web fluid and dispensers himself. Furthermore, Garfield's Parker conducts extensive research to learn why, as a 4-year old (Max Charles), he was left with his uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Aunt May (Sally Field), and begins to uncover an intricate connection between his parents, Oscorp, and Dr. Connors (and a mysterious stranger).Garfield, however, is careful not to make Parker into a perfect goody-goody. Perhaps because of his 'abandonment' by his parents, Parker has rebellious, mischievous tendencies that would lure him into juvenile delinquency if not for his uncle/aunt and a potential love interest, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Parker can also be irresponsible, spiteful, and distracted, which leads to that life-altering, emotionally shattering family tragedy involving Uncle Ben. Although basically polite and respectful, Parker manages to antagonize and disconcert Gwen's father, Police Captain Stacy (Denis Leary) who (like Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson in Raimi's film), considers Spiderman a selfish, dangerous vigilante, despite Parker's earnest protests.Nevertheless, I think Parker earns the audiences admiration as he begins to rise above his shortcomings and use his natural talents (with a little help with his spider powers) to balance, juggle, and reconcile his personal, romantic, and 'professional' problems. In fact, I believe that Parker is such an intriguing character on his own, the movie would still be involving and entertaining even if Parker tackled his problems without his powers. As Uncle Ben's posthumous voicemail on Parker's cell phone mentions, Peter was always destined for great things. The spider powers just make his life a little more interesting.P.S.: Commenting upon the Lizard's appearance in the movie, I personally had no complaints. As a cross between a Komodo dragon and the Hulk, the Lizard sported a too-human face, according to some detractors. I think that was essential to convey the Lizard's/Dr. Connors latent, if somewhat misguided, humanity and his final, merciful treatment of Parker/Spiderman. If the Lizard had had to speak and show his feelings with a snout like, say, a Velociraptor, I think it would have less effective, and even a bit laughable.",10,32,46,26 November 2013
The Lego Movie," Everyone Is Special
","If the Academy Awards had a category for 'Fastest-Paced Feature', I think 'The LEGO Movie' (hereafter 'LEGO') would slaughter any competition (even 'Hotel Transylvania' – see my Amazon review). 'LEGO' has an interlocking-brick universe to show us, so it hardly pauses for breath as it attempts to show it all – from cities to oceans to clouds to outer space to even, believe it or not, our own human world. The movie demands multiple viewings just to take all the spectacular visuals in.At an initial, casual glance, 'LEGO' just seems concerned with being a movie-length commercial for the classic, versatile construction toy. And that it effectively is, but 'LEGO' is insidiously so much more. Through a nondescript, super-ordinary construction worker Emmet Brickowski's (Chris Platt's) efforts to prove worthy of his 'special' destiny and thwart Lord (President) Business's (Will Ferrell) goal to not only conquer the LEGO universe but also make it permanently in his own image with the 'Kragle' (which is really sticky stuff), 'LEGO' reassures us that we all have individual AND cooperative talents that can and deserve to be used to create great things.For most of 'LEGO' though, we have our doubts about Emmet's 'specialness'. Oh, he's a pleasant and genial enough LEGO figure, but he seems to lead a severely regulated but unproductive and almost invisible life. But then by chance within the rubble of a construction site, he finds the red 'Piece De Resistance', also sought after by Wyldstyle (real name: Lucy) (Elizabeth Banks), a nimble, technically adept 'Master Builder' and street fighter. Because the 'Piece de Resistance' is the only object that can neutralize the 'Kragle', Wyldstyle thinks that Emmet is the 'Special' or chosen one prophesized to defeat Lord Business. Before Emmett knows it, Wyldstyle brings him to meet other Master Builders led by the blind sage Vetruvius (Morgan Freeman) also determined to stop the egotistical tyrant. Despite Vetruvius's and Wyldstyle's encouragement and guidance, Emmett has a very tough time living up to the prophecy. He vainly protests that not only is he not 'special', he's not even a Master Builder.As Emmett and company careen through the LEGO universe, Emmet's ego takes more of a beating as he meets a vast cast of characters from practically every action picture, comic, and cartoon ever made (from Milhouse Van Houten to Superman) who are all talented and/or Master Builders. Most damaging to Emmet's self-esteem is his rival for Wyldstyle's affections, none other than Lego Batman himself (Will Arnett), pumped up with humorless (but funny) self-importance and sense of duty. And these guys are his allies! As for the villains, aided by the schizophrenic Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson), Lord Business cuts an imposing figure as he uses his 'Galactus' helmet, his telescoping legs, and his huge law enforcement army to cement his rule. Maybe Emmet is out of his league.Then things start to click as Emmet sacrifices himself to save all the Master Builders, imprisoned by Business in a Think Tank. He plunges into our dimension and into a basement occupied by 8-year old Finn (Jadon Sand), whose own dilemma mirrors Emmet's and may be even controlling Emmet and the other Lego people (no wonder 'LEGO' seems to be directed by a child's wild flights of storytelling fancy, because it kinda is.) Finn's defiance of his father's (Will Ferrett in real life) stifling of his own imagination gives Emmett the courage to go back to 'LEGOland' and confront Business in a surprising but calm and life-affirming climax.LEGO offers boundless, wholesome (except maybe for the pantsless guy in the situation comedy, but don't worry, he's not anatomically correct.:) ) creative fun for people for all ages. But most impressively, LEGO painstakingly convinces us that we all have special talents and skills that should never be suppressed and that can contribute to the betterment of everyone's life. Yep, everyone is special. And that's just awesome!",10,1,6,26 November 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," As in 'An Unexpected Journey', 'Desolation of Smaug' Still Preserves the Novel's Inherent Spirit and Themes
","Despite 'Hobbit' purists' frenzied accusation of director Peter Jackson's 'Hobbit' movie trilogy's lack of stringent, precise loyalty to the source material, I believe such loyalty is unrealistic. No movie can exactly duplicate a novel's characteristics; if it attempts to do so, it becomes ponderous, sluggish and dull.Take for example the scene near the beginning of 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (hereafter 'Hobbit:DOS') where Bilbo, Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and the dwarfs encounter the ursine, muscular shapeshifter Beorn (Mikael Persbrandt) at his pastoral home. If 'Hobbit:DOS' had copied the Beorn episode exactly from the novel, it would have become mired in redundant exposition, since Gandalf relates to Beorn the adventures he and his followers have already endured in order to enlist the surly loner's aid in their quest. Instead, 'Hobbit: DOS' makes the Beorn sequence more economically streamlined and actually more meaningful. Although Beorn is no fan of dwarfs (which is why he angrily pursues them in his bear form), he decides to help them because they oppose the orcs and their confederates. Beorn hates orcs and their company even more, since they have decimated and enslaved Beorn's bear bretheren in the past (he waves a brawny, shackled arm as proof). Though some may complain that the admittedly fiercely charismatic and 'bada$$' Beorn gets truncated, limited screen time, 'Hobbit: DOS' manages, I think, to capture the sequence's intent in the novel, and even embellish and extend it to the imminent, encompassing evil of the Necromancer and his legions.Throughout the novel's notable set-pieces - From Beorn , through Bilbo and the dwarfs' enchanted, perilous wanderings through the aptly named Mirkwood, through their battle with huge, voracious spiders, through their imprisonment in the Elvish citadel, through their gymnastically stunning and suspenseful escape from the citadel in floating barrels, to their initially furtive and demeaning but ultimately triumphant arrival in Laketown, to their journey to the Lonely Mountain to try to wrest the dwarfs' homeland from the unforgettable dragon Smaug – through all this, 'Hobbit:DOS' continues to preserve each sequence's basic purpose and meaning in the novel despite some tweakings and deviations. Most of the deviations originate from implacable orc Azog the Defiler's (Manu Bennett) Ahab-like dogged pursuit of Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) for causing his deformity, and from the elves' (namely Terminator-like warriors Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) enhanced presence and intercession in the dwarfs' quests. Except for what I felt was a gratuitous, inexplicable (if still affecting), growing relationship between Tauriel and the dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner), these deviations and detours do not detract from 'Hobbit:DOS''s deliberate but fluid, action-packed, and genuinely exciting and involving interpretation. Indeed, I felt the deviations emphasized the 'Hobbit' novel's indirect reference to the looming threat of the Necromancer and its understated insistence that it is the duty of ALL Middle-Earth denizens (including the isolationist elves represented by Elvenking Thranduil) to face this pervasive evil.Therefore, Jackson's 'Hobbit:DOS' does have epic objectives above and beyond the dwarfs' quest. But again, I strongly disagree with the purists and other naysayers who argue that 'Hobbit:DOS' gives short shrift to Bilbo, Thorin, and his band. Even though his transition from reluctant bourgeois homebody to committed adventurer, inspiration to the dwarfs, and even defender seems more abrupt in the movie, Bilbo (Martin Freeman) nevertheless makes his conversion convincing. As in the novel, Bilbo proves his worth and value to the group and even (horrors!) faces the beguiling, mellifluous, but monstrous and seemingly invincible dragon Smaug (Benedict Cumberbatch) even without his ring of invisibility. He even persuades the dwarfs, who fearfully do not encounter Smaug in the novel, to show their true legendary courage and confront the dragon in their stolen lair – which I actually think is a logical, plausible improvement.'The Hobbit' novel touches upon themes of courage, self-reliance, greed, and the duty to resist evil in all its myriad forms. 'The Hobbit:DOS' reflects these themes in its somewhat divergent, wildly dynamic and entertaining but still respectful cinematic presentation of Tolkien's vision and depiction of (as Balin (Ken Stott) would agree) that most remarkably daring and observant fellow Bilbo.",9,1,7,17 September 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," A Left-Out 'Lummox' Learns About His Place in the (Video) Universe and What a 'Hero's Duty' Really Means in 'Wreck-It Ralph',
","or many of the same reasons that the 'Toy Story' franchise has proved to be an enduring masterpiece, the 'Video Game Story' 'Wreck-It-Ralph' (hereafter 'WIR') is certain to do the same. From seemingly dull-witted, destructive, and vilified 'bad-guy oaf' Ralph's (John C. Reilly's) simple wish to earn a medal and subsequent respect from other video game characters, WIR explores prejudice, rejection, the need for acceptance and appreciation, compassion for fellow misfits, and the requirements of true heroism. We've been exposed to these lessons before, but WIR is a nostalgically winning, kinetic, and ultimately poignant refresher course.In particular, I appreciated WIR's subtle reminder not to judge a book by its cover. Resembling a human version of Donkey Kong (no offense, Ralph), Ralph might lead us to the knee-jerk conclusion that if a character is physically impressive, he must be short on brains. Ralph isn't. Especially for a guy whose job it is to demolish a video game penthouse before cheerful carpenter Felix (Jack MacBrayer) can repair it, Ralph is a pretty sensitive, observant, and rational soul. He knows it's not right that the other Fix-It Felix, Jr. characters shun him and relegate him to the nearby dump and won't even invite him in the video game's 30th anniversary party. Ralph has tried support-group villain therapy, but it doesn't really work because the other members are resigned to a fate they think they can't control. Even Tapper (Maurice LeMarche), Ralph's bartender confidant, has no suggestions for breaking out of the rut.However, fate literally collides with Ralph when he runs into an armored infantryman from the 'Hero's Duty' war game, who informs him that anyone who breaches a tower in the game wins a medal. Ralph believes that by winning a medal, he can win others' respect. Ralph takes the infantryman's place and, despite his strength, finds it tough sledding handling the non-stop battle to stop a bunch of attacking giant alien beetles (shades of 'Starship Troopers') AND handling tough, brusque no-nonsense Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun (Jane Lynch). Nevertheless, Ralph manages to scale the tower and win the medal.Through more 'Hero's Duty' mishaps, Ralph lands in a fighter-type flyer with one of the alien bugs, zooms throughout the video universe and eventually crash-lands in another video- game, a candy-land race-car game named 'Sugar Rush'. A crafty, sassy, little wannabe racer and 'glitch' named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) seizes the medal from Ralph and uses it to earn a spot in the 'Sugar Rush' racing derby. As a 'glitch', Vanellope finds it hard to literally keep herself together. If she competes in the derby and finishes the race, even if she doesn't win, Vanellope will become a full-fledged, 'unglitched' video racer.Although Vanellope is even more of a misfit and pariah than Ralph, naturally the two snipe at and antagonize each other at first. Then Vanellope realizes they can help each other; if Ralph can help her build a race car and train as a racer, she can win back the medal for him as well as achieve her dream. Ralph grudgingly agrees and a close (if still contentious) friendship blossoms.But Ralph's actions have opened a Pandora's Box of chaos for the video universe. Without him, the Fix-It Felix, Jr. game is out of order and defunct, compelling Felix to join up with Sergeant Calhoun to seek Ralph and the lost flyer/beetle respectively. Some video characters fear Ralph has become like 'Turbo', a fiendishly rogue racer who has disrupted (and may still be disrupting) other video games. The seemingly kindly and addle-brained King Candy (Alan Tudyk), ruler of 'Sugar Rush' may have a hidden sinister agenda regarding Vanellope. The beetle Ralph accidentally brought with him to 'Sugar Rush' may be multiplying and proliferating and threatening Candy Land's existence. Worst of all, as a 'Sonic the Hedgehog' video image reminds us, a video character who dies outside his game dies permanently. Can Ralph undo the disorder he has wrought and rise above his desires to save not only Vanellope but the whole video universe, even if he has to sacrifice himself?WIR is an unbridled visual, sensory, and mental delight that again vividly reminds that all beings (even 'bad guys') have a purpose in the universe, that we all deserve care, attention and respect, and, as Ralph eventually and spectacularly finds out, that finding redemption and heroism means putting others' needs before our own.",10,1,2,1 June 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Except for two or three 'Lord of the Rings' Detours, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' Stays Rousingly and Faithfully on Cours
","I know this sounds weird, but have you ever refused to watch a movie because you haven't read the book or play that inspired it, and therefore don't feel 'ready' to see it? For example, that's why (with the exception of 'The Sorceror's Stone') I never saw the Harry Potter octology (eight films) based on J.K. Rowling's seven novels. How could my movie impressions compare with those who have immersed themselves in both the Harry Potter book AND movie mythos? Ditto with J.R.R. Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings (LotR)' novel trilogy and Peter Jackson's movie trilogy based on it: I haven't done the LotR 'reading homework' (yet, but I'd like to someday), so how can I presume to watch and fully appreciate and understand the LotR movies? I wasn't worthy, I wasn't worthy.Then Peter Jackson announced many moons ago that he planned a movie adaptation of Tolkien's unofficial LotR prequel, the beloved, durable classic 'The Hobbit', and I subsequently became excited. I HAD read 'The Hobbit' and even critiqued it on Amazon.com, and so felt prepared to watch 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' (hereafter 'Hobbit: AUJ') and even compare and contrast it with the novel, and discuss it with its numerous fans. Then, I found out 'Hobbit: AUJ' would incorporate origins of events (such as the White Council and the rise of the Necromancer) only barely alluded to in 'The Hobbit' novel but more fully fleshed out in the 'LotR' movie trilogy. Furthermore, Jackson planned an epic 9-hour movie trilogy. My enthusiasm wavered. I was starting to doubt I was prepared to watch THIS trilogy either, because I thought it would be altered, attenuated, and mixed up beyond recognition. Therefore, I missed 'Hobbit:AUJ' in the theatres.Recently, however, 'Hobbit: AUJ' popped up on HBO, and I finally resolved to devote the time to seeing it. So, especially to those people who have read only 'The Hobbit', and even those who have read the unannotated, un-appendixed version, I can state with relief and happy surprise that 'Hobbit: AUJ' remains largely and divertingly faithful to the roughly first 50% of the novel it covers. It covers the various set-pieces (e.g. Gandalf's (Sir Ian McKellen) recruitment of the reluctant Bilbo for a territory-reclaiming and burgling adventure, the dwarfs' boisterous visit to Bilbo's hobbit-hole, the encounter with the dull-witted trolls) with vigor, boisterous humor, and exquisitely rendered CGI action. Even the preliminary explanation for the dwarfs' exile from their Erebor home by the barely glimpsed but still astounding dragon Smaug (though not explicitly in the novel) efficiently and rousingly sets up the hobbit's adventure. Yes, there are the lengthy LotR detours such as the wild-eyed, slovenly wood wizard Radagast (Sylvester McCoy) only mentioned once by Beorn in the unannotated Hobbit) discovering the spiders and other evil forces of the Necromancer massing and the White Council including Gandalf, Elrond the Elvenking (Hugo Weaving), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) contemplating the Necromancers rise. However, I did not find them all that distracting, and perhaps even a little bit useful if I ever tackle both book and movie 'LotR'.In general, no movie can be slavishly faithful to its literary source since they are two distinct mediums with distinct advantages and disadvantages. 'The Hobbit: AUJ' is certainly no exception. A movie CAN take dramatic license with a book's plot and characters provided it doesn't deviate too much from its spirit. I think 'The Hobbit: AUJ' largely succeeds in doing this. I felt one of the main themes of 'The Hobbit' novel is that no matter how small, timid, and uncertain you are, you can have the traits and courage to accomplish great things. In 'The Hobbit: AUJ', the younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) expresses that theme very well, and even improves upon it.In the novel, many people might feel that Bilbo was too much of a reluctant hero, too whiny and complaining. Remember in the novel when he practically curled into a quivering fetal position when Gandalf and the dwarfs explain the danger of their quest? In the movie, Bilbo merely comically faints. Furthermore, in the movie Freeman's Bilbo is more refreshingly and amusingly persnickety, fussy, and indignant than in the novel and shows his slowly receding unwillingness to go on the journey more admirably. Still, some 'Hobbit' novel purists may balk at Bilbo's 'uncharacteristic' slaying of a charging orc (also not in the novel) to save Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage). It didn't bother me, because I saw it as the first, spontaneous manifestation of Bilbo's growing Tookish resolve. An even better and touching illustration of Bilbo's resolve comes toward the end of the movie, after the eagles have rescued Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarfs from being besieged in fir trees by the hideous, slavering orcs and their wolf-mounts, the Wargs. Bilbo, a complacent bourgeois home-owner, pities the dwarfs' nomadic homelessness and vows to help them reclaim their mountain home from the dragon Smaug.So in conclusion, if, like me, you have read an unadorned copy of 'The Hobbit', you needn't fear that 'The Hobbit: AUJ' has mangled and twisted the tale into an unknown shape. It hasn't, and unless you are fastidious and nitpicky, you may enjoy some of Jackson's flourishes (such as the grotesque but eloquent Goblin King's (Barry Humphries's) 'fat' beard and his teeming underground kingdom) and still rest assured that 'The Hobbit: AUJ' has mostly respected Tolkien's tale – at least so far.Anyway, I now feel worthy and ready to see 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' in the theatre. If nothing else, I think I will enjoy seeing Smaug the Tremendous, the Magnificent, and the Stupendous!",8,4,7,6 March 2014
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," But If They Didn't Tease the Dinosaurs, They Wouldn't Have a Movie
","'The Lost World' (hereafter TLW) is the epitome of the 'Idiot Plot' movie. As defined by critic Roger Ebert, an 'Idiot Plot' movie is one that has '..a plot that requires all the characters to be idiots. If they weren't, they'd immediately figure out everything and the movie would be over.' Oh, where to start with the inanities this movie's characters commits? From the beginning, I suppose:1. Industrialist Hammond (Richard Attenborough) recruits the decidedly cynical intellectual Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to keep tabs on occasional scientist/girlfriend (Juliette Moore) as she investigates the breeding dinosaur colony on Site B island. Wouldn't more physically adventurous and pragmatic Alan Grant (Sam O'Neill) be a more logical choice?2. Moore's scientist is supposed to study the dinosaurs unobtrusively. So why does she bring a laboratory trailer the size of a boxcar with which to crash through the jungle?3. Moore's scientist startles an infant stegosaurus with a noisy flash camera and nearly gets decapitated by an infuriated adult's spiked tail.4. Ian's high-maintenance brat daughter Vanessa stows away on the trip to Site B and jeopardizes Ian's safety by wanting to go into the 'high hide' (a suspended cage) when two tyrannosaurs decide to visit the lab trailer.5. The two tyrannosaurs decide to visit the lab trailer because solicitous photographer (Vince Vaughn) brings their injured infant for Moore's scientist to set its fractured leg. As a reward for their benevolent humanitarianism, the lab trailer is hurled off a cliff, with Ian, Moore's character, and Vaughn's character nearly following suit.6. Ian and company free the dinosaurs that were captured in the round-up conducted by InGen's mercenaries for transport to a San Diego zoo. As a reward for their benevolent humanitarianism, the animals stampede and destroy all communication with the outside world, forcing the two enemies to join forces to travel to the interior towards an abandoned radar post.7. An InGen mercenary strays from the group into unknown wilderness to urinate. A herd of tiny Compsognathus fatally mutilate him. Another mercenary would have heard him, if not for his MP3 headphones.8. For some inexplicable reason, Moore's scientist takes a blood-soaked denim jacket and hangs it within her tent, allowing one of the tyrannosaurs to track and nearly slaughter all the group.9. Supposedly wilderness-experienced mercenaries allow themselves to be picked off by the original villains in Jurassic Park in tall grass.10. Why wasn't the captured tyrannosaurus properly tranquilized on the abortive trip to San Diego? Moore's scientist mumbles something about not being able to calibrate the dosage properly. However, when the tyrannosaur is corralled back into the ship, Moore's scientist fires a tranquilizer dart. Why didn't she do that earlier and prevent the rampage?11. The tyrannosaur visits a house with a swimming pool to satisfy its thirst. The family inside takes a picture of him with another noisy flash camera right in the eyes. The tyrannosaur roars (and presumably kills the family).12. Hammond's villainous nephew steals the infant brought to lure the tyrannosaur back and brings it to the ship. The tyrannosaur traps him there, cripples him, and lets the infant practice his killing skills.13. Towards the end of the movie, Hammond mentions that the Site B dinosaurs 'require our absence' in order to flourish. Now he tells us!Despite this cavalcade of stupidity, I have a grudging affection for TLW and even own it on VHS. After all, we should be grateful the characters teased the dinosaurs because they were quite spectacular, and dynamic, and were the sole reason for TLW at all!",6,0,2,19 January 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," 'Apes Stupid.' No, Maurice. Humans Stupid. That's why Apes 'Rise'.
","At heart, every permutation of the 'Planet of the Apes' franchise has been a searing denouncement of humanity and its numerous vices, especially basic stupidity. However, 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' (hereafter 'Rise')catapults human idiocy to near-stratospheric levels. Roger Ebert writes in his 'Rise' review, '..the movie has its pleasures, although human intelligence is not one of them.' The simian ascension will be a cakewalk. Consider the examples of human stupidity throughout the movie:1. Gen-Sys, the corporation for which the human protagonist Will Rodman (James Franco) works as a pharmaceutical scientist, boasts appalling security and ethical lapses. Of course, the first transgression involves Caesar's chimpanzee mother, Bright Eyes, who has received an infusion of the mind-enhancing drug, AZ-112. Not only does Gen-Sys lack the facilities to avert her subsequent rampage of destruction, it isn't even aware that she gave birth to Caesar and that her maternal protective instincts triggered her rage.2. Will's well-intentioned but ill-advised benevolence compels him to save the infant Caesar from his mother's fate. He decides to raise Caesar at home like a human child. Bad move. Introducing a potentially wild and destructive beast into a suburban neighborhood, including a chimpanzee, even a gifted one like Caesar is asking for trouble. Remember the story of the woman whose face was mutilated by a neighbor's 'pet' chimpanzee and who required years of reconstructive surgery? Inevitably, Caesar intervenes between Will's Alzheimers-afflicted father Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) and an irate neighbor to protect the former, injures the latter, and is condemned to live at a brutal ape sanctuary in San Francisco.3. Will's love interest, primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) could have provided valuable insights into chimpanzee behavior, intellect, and motivations, and perhaps could have helped avert the climactic 'ape escape'. But instead of acting like Jane Goodall, Caroline merely makes vague pronouncements about how dangerous 'cute' chimps really are and how we really shouldn't mess with them, and with genetic science in general. She turns out to be distracting eye candy.4. Again, good-intentioned but ethically-challenged Will absconds with some of the AZ-112 formula from his security- challenged company to inject into his father to re-enhance his cognitive abilities. It works, but only temporarily.5. Meanwhile, the imprisoned Caesar has to endure yet another shabbily maintained and guarded facility, an ape enclosure managed by two louts, the clueless proprietor John Landon (Brian Cox) and his son, abusive animal wrangler Dodge Landon (Tom Felton), plus a third individual.6. Why are there seemingly only three people managing a vast wildlife preserve containing (improbably) hundreds of chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas? Even without his AZ-enhanced genius, Caesar, I think, would not have had too much difficulty escaping from that minimum-security dump?7. Will manages to synthesize a more permanent, powerful version of AZ-112 (AZ-113, naturally) and attempts to test it on another chimpanzee. Lax security strikes again, the ape writhes on the table, a side-effect virus spreads to one of the handlers present (who has lost his sterilizing mask), and the guy later goes out into public without any decontamination procedures to bleed, sneeze, and spread the virus. Just great.8. Clever Caesar escapes, finds his way back to Will's house, obtains some AZ-113, which Will has again appropriated from his sieve of a company, and uses it to 'brain-boost' his fellow simian inmates, and engineers a jail break.9. Foolishly, the vicious, taser-wielding Dodge allows Caesar to electrocute him with water from a hose.10. Roughly two hundred escaped apes, led by Caesar, romp through San Francisco towards escape over the Golden Gate Bridge. A few cops on horseback with machine guns (and horrible aim) and a couple of helicopters is the best defense the city can muster? Where's the freaking National Guard? No wonder the apes have a relatively easy time making it to the Muir redwoods sanctuary.11. In the movie postscript, the AZ-113 virus (which humans are susceptible to but to which apes are immune) is spread by an airline pilot and becomes an epidemic.12. Thanks, Will. Your good intentions have paved a road to a hell of tort and criminal liability, not to mention the probable extinction of the human race and the subsequent ape ascendancy. At least the dinosaurs had the (arguable) excuse of an asteroid for their superseding by the mammals. And dinosaurs are supposed to be dumb?And yet, despite this relentless parade of dumbness, I really did enjoy the movie. The simian protagonist Caesar (motion-capture animated by Andy Serkis) is mainly responsible. His resourceful intellect, his 'Frankenstein monster' plight, his sufferings, his clemency and his organization of an eventual worldwide revolution is well-paced and gripping. The movie's creators want you to be in his corner and you are. If that involves stacking the deck against humans, well so be it. Humans have had their day. Let the apes have a crack at it. In the next sequels, let's see how they do.P.S. During the movie, an expedition to Mars is lost in space. It is called Icarus. How apt. In mythology, Icarus flew too close to the sun on wax wings, had them melt, and fell to earth. If and when the Icarus crew falls back to earth, what bizarre reception can they expect?",8,1,2,21 August 2011
Django Unchained," Violence's Ambiguity in Django: 'Dead Alive' in the Antebellum West
","The title of my review references Peter Jackson's utterly unhinged zombie infestation cult horror classic. In 'Dead Alive', the unlikely hero decimates zombie hordes until the screen literally floods with blood. In a way, 'Django Unchained' (hereafter 'Django') reflects 'Dead Alive''s 'go nuts with killing until you stop being scared and disgusted and just have to laugh' sensibility. As Django (Jamie Foxx) ascends from slave to bounty hunter to talented gunslinger to determined avenger and savior, the viewer is inundated with so many killings, humiliating tortures, mutilations, and explosions, he/she may stop being disgusted and overwhelmed, and simply laugh at the brutal inanity of it all. I think that was director Quentin Tarantino's intentional satiric objective.Reviewer M. Oleson also alludes to 'Blazing Saddles' as one of 'Django''s inspirations, and I think he is correct. However, satirizing the West's violent ignorance and flimsy attempts at justice were, I believe, Tarantino's secondary targets. Even the abominably shameful institution of pre-Civil War slavery and the unscrupulous but dense Southerners who strained to uphold it is a secondary, easy-bullseye for 'Django''s satire. As other posters here have mentioned, Tarantino, as he has done before, is slyly satirizing our near-sexual fetish for and obsession with and gradual desensitization to violence in general.Many people are shot in 'Django'. The lucky ones die quickly with little blood. The unlucky ones realistically scream with pain as blood erupts from them like geysers. Initially, the audience may recoil or cheer in response, depending on whether the character shot 'deserves' it or not. But eventually, poetic justice does prevail in 'Django' and we laughingly and apparently appropriately cheer as decadent, immoral Southern plantation society is literally blasted to smithereens. But will we necessarily respect ourselves the following morning? No matter how you feel later, I think 'Django' viewers will be entertainingly uplifted, not only by Django's composed, steely determination to avenge his bondage and to be reunited with his abused but beautiful and equally resilient wife Brunhilde (Hildy) (Kerry Washington), but also by the unflappable reasoning and eloquence of Django's own deliverer, the deceptively unassuming Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). But even Django's reprehensible villains are also humorously captivating, such as the unctuously effete but vicious pseudo-Francophile Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), the slimy 'Candieland' (ho ho!) plantation owner who holds Hildy in thrall, and especially the obsequious but treacherous Candieland slave retainer, played by the endlessly versatile Samuel L. Jackson. Of course, they suffer shocking deaths, but Candie and Stephen come so skillfully close to being such cartoonish heavies, again we permit ourselves to cheer and laugh when they die.Tarantino in a sense has it both ways with the violence. We are allowed to enjoy the violence when a villain buys it, but we do shudder with loathing when the 'good guys' suffer. When Hildy is locked naked in a hot box for some perceived slight, or Django is hung upside down naked with castration imminent, I'm sure almost no viewer will laugh. So there's our ambivalence towards violence and death - are they cathartic or poisonous? If violence's victims are faceless zombies as in 'Dead Alive' or foolish Southern whites (who cant even make KKK masks with peripheral vision) as in 'Django', we laugh with relief. If violence's victims are the geeky hero in 'Dead Alive' or suave slave-turned-avenger Django or wily, rational bounty hunter Dr. Schwartz, we cry with despair. Especially in light of recent serial killings, this evocation of violence's dual nature merits further debate.",8,2,6,27 March 2013
Frozen," What If a Disney Princess (and Queen) Were an X-Man?
","Most unexpectedly, Disney's 'Frozen' (hereafter 'D's Frozen') subtly reconfigures and directs the seemingly tiresome tropes and conventions of their romantic 'princess movies' into uncharted 'Marvel comic' territory and themes. The main protagonist (AND apparently antagonist) Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel) is far more than your run-of-the-mill glamorous elder princess, then (Snow) Queen of the kingdom of Arondelle. She possesses nearly unlimited, almost magical power to control and shape ice and snow.In a Marvel comic, she'd be considered a mutant with the combined powers of Ice-Man and Storm. Unfortunately and tragically, she lives in medieval times and does not have the guidance of a Charles Xavier-like mentor to help her harness the power for mankind's benefit. Well, there IS a (literally) stone troll king, Grand Pabbie (voice of Ciaran Hinds) who is aware of the extent of Elsa's powers. However, all he can recommend to Elsa's father (voice of Maurice LaMarche) and mother (voice of Jennifer Lee), King and Queen of Arendelle, is cruel, complete isolation from all humanity until she is mature enough to ascend the Arondelle throne.Part of the reason Elsa is held in quarantine is because in childhood, while using her powers to create a winter playground for herself and younger sister Princess Anna (adult voice of Kristen Bell), she accidentally injured her head. Although non-superpowered and 'normal', Anna heals with the Troll King's help. Having no memory of the incident, Anna is distraught and perplexed as to why Elsa cannot come out to play. Still, the coronation day comes, and Elsa seems to be in emotional control of herself and her abilities. Not for long. Elsa gets upset when beautiful but impulsive Anna immediately intends to get hitched to comely Southern Isles prince Hans (voice of Santino Fontana), a guy she met only minutes before in a boating 'mishap'. Already tense and anxious, Elsa unleashes an ice age on Arondelle and flees the shocked citizenry for the lonely refuge of the mountains.Anna may be a mere mortal, and a bit clumsy, but she is unswervingly determined to locate and reconcile with her sister and convince her to thaw out the kingdom. This sounds like a straight-arrow objective, but many complications come into play. One, Elsa finally finds peace and the freedom to be herself in the mountains, which is celebrated in the ubiquitous, destined-to-be ageless ballad 'Let It Go', and literally carves out an ice palace for herself. Two, although Anna teams up with loner ice-delivery man Kristoff (voice of Jonathan Groff) and his faithful, dog-like reindeer Sven, and a wacky snowman named Olaf (Josh Gad), they at first don't seem to be much help. Kristoff, like Elsa, just wants to be left alone, and Olaf keeps falling apart and foolishly wishing he could move to the tropics. But, with Sven's urging, Anna's tenacity and persistence bring this odd duo around. Third, some in the coronation party, like the Duke of Weselton ('Weaselton') voice of Alan Tudyk) and others, consider Elsa a monster and want to eliminate her. Fourth, Elsa accidentally causes Anna to suffer a 'heart freeze' that could prove fatal. Can Anna achieve this miracle and save both Elsa and herself? According to the Troll King, true love is the key. But what is this true love?'D's Frozen' continues the Mouse House's rise above older cartoon sentiments and happily- ever-after resolutions and marriages (mostly) and explores more advanced, modern emotions and themes. In Marvel Comics 'X-men', mutants deal with adolescent anxiety and confusion about their powers, their fear of losing control of their powers and causing death and destruction, and the prejudicial hostility of a society that can't and won't understand them. Elsa faces these same dilemmas. 'D's Frozen' moves beyond superficial, helpless romantic puppy love (like that of Anna and Hans) into more substantial love and friendship like the one within a family and between sisters. It also moves beyond conventional villains (although there are a few, and at least one unanticipated one) to show that our own worst enemies are our inhibitions and fears. 'D's Frozen' also continues the relatively recent Disney movement to create independent, self-assured women who do not automatically need men to face and overcome danger and obstacles. And naturally, most importantly, 'D's Frozen' helps us figure out what that true love is, with, amazingly, the help of that 'wise fool' Olaf. True love is captured in the phrase that begins, 'No greater love hath a man (person) for another than to.'.Best of all, 'D's Frozen' achieves the weighty themes mentioned above with excellent visually artistry, suspenseful and sometimes heart-thumping action, naturally funny slapstick and verbal humor, dazzling musical numbers, satisfying character development, and happiness that is not dependent upon a 'deus ex machina', but hard-won. Not bad for this Disney/Marvel collaboration. Not bad at all.P.S.: If you have the patience to wade through the end credits, you'll find a funny disclaimer addressing Kristoff's opinion about men and their noses, and the final fate of the abominable snowman Elsa creates to protect herself from attack.",10,8,14,3 February 2015
The Incredibles," With great power comes great fun (finally!)
","For decades the predominant theme of the superhero universe is that possessing super powers is an angst-ridden burden fraught with eternal peril, lack of remuneration, and worst of all, an ungrateful public. The Marvel pantheon has promulgated that realistic but dispiriting notion through almost all its characters (notably the Hulk, Spiderman, the Thing, and especially the X-Men) to such a pervasive degree that DC Comics, home to the uplifting 'god' Superman, had to follow suit. Superman, formerly invincible and infallible, also became lacerated with multiple vulnerabilities, inhibitions, and doubts. Again, this realistic approach is compelling and not a minor contributor to 'Spiderman''s and 'Spiderman 2''s success. But c'mon, if you had a super power, ANY super power, wouldn't you go to town?'The Incredibles' answers this question with an exuberant 'yes!'. I will not dwell upon the movies many immaculate virtues, since other posters have already done a thorough job of that. I wish to emphasize that 'The Incredibles' succeeds to a large degree by inverting the above-mentioned Marvel superhero theory and 'regressing' back to the 50's and 60's and reminding us that, in the final analysis, being a superhero is @#$%^ great. Bob Parr (aka. Mr. Incredible) revels in his abilities and his responsibility to humanity. Unlike with Spiderman, et. al., his powers are not a curse but an unadulterated blessing and his raison d'etre. Unlike Spiderman, et. al. he does not want to be a normal member of the hoi polloi herd, to be equal to them. He wants to be, and is, different, and better. That's why his speedster son Dash (a.k.a. Dashiel's) remark that 'when everyone is special, no one is' resonates and does Mr. Incredible's astounded reaction to the requirement to have a 4th grade graduation. Mr. Incredible was atrophying in Conformityville; to survive, he had to put on the tights.'The Incredibles' is thus not a scathing satire of superheroes, save for a few jabs at Mr. Incredible's spare tire, and Ms. Mode's expostulation and montage on the dangerous absurdity of cape (which Syndrome apparently did not hear or heed by the way). It treats them with respect, and not just Mr. Incredible. As the movie unfolds, it progresses from a stately (perhaps slow) state of domesticity and family to a crescendo of Action with a capital A. The movie is a burgeoning breath of freedom. Of course, 'The Incredibles' just acknowledge and juxtapose super heroism with reality (at least the reality of tortuous lawsuits, oppressive 'Dilbertseque' corporate workplaces, and the unpleasantness of adolescence through Dash and Violet). But throughout the movie, it gloriously breaks free, and so do Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Dash, and Violet!The only 'flaw' I could perceive in 'The Incredibles' is its somewhat derivative nature and amalgamated blend of every superhero, James Bond, Spy Kids, and Powerpuff Girls movie and episode ever made. Good for the movie! I eagerly await the family's next adventure and perhaps the obligatory 'origin stories'. I know it will continue to keep the proceedings fun.A few random observations:1. Mr. Incredible has his foibles (his expanded abdomen, his initial neglect of his family, and his occasional Buzz Lightyearesque imperiousness), but he is no buffoon and no joke by any stretch of the imagination. His family is recognizably human but quite laudable.2. In an early scene in the movie, just before Mr. Incredible in his younger days confronts Bomb Voyage, the illumination hitting his old suit makes him look like Green Lantern.3. The Omnidroids Mr. Incredible and family battle resemble a cross between Dr. Octopus's tentacles and a bathysphere.4. Brad Bird must be a Fantastic Four fan!5. Evangelical Christians will probably be aghast at Baby Jack-Jack's climactic encounter with Syndrome (which got the loudest cheer from the audience I was involved in).6. Though spawned by frustrated geeky fan-boy aspirations, I thought Syndrome made a formidable and even occasionally sympathetic villain, channeling the Joker and an evil Mask (as well as, ahem, Heat Miser of course).7. One cannot trademark a superpower.8. I wonder if Marvel will contract with Pixar to do a comic rendition of 'The Incredibles'.9. Apparently Mr. Incredible possesses strength in the 'Class 100' range, easily able to bench over 100 tons. But does he possess other powers. He cannot fly under his own power, but is he invulnerable, have optic and auditory powers, etc.? What are the extent of his family's abilities.10. I'm glad the Parr's did not have a super-powered pooch or other pet a la Krypto, unless that comes up in the sequel.11. The PG rating is warranted. Pre-preteeners will find the movie by turns a bit too intense and slow-going, as the occasional infantile whines in my movie audience can attest to. Savvy adults and older teenagers will probably enjoy the movie the most!12. Despite Bush's re-election, 'The Incredibles' may signal the advent of a new age, where superherodom is a serious business, but also such a rush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Overall rating, by the way: 9.5! :D",Null,0,1,15 November 2004
Cars 2," Pixar's 'Transformers' Movie
","One prominent notion stood out in my mind after watching 'Cars 2' - it was the Energizer Bunny on speed, steroids, and any other drug that gives you superhuman endurance. From the opening shot where a British spy operative is communicating oil rig coordinates to suave James Bondesque agent Finn McMissile (voice of the ubiquitous Michael Caine) to the last shot in Radiator Springs where Gomer Pylesque tow truck Mater is hailed as a hero, 'Cars 2' hits the ground running (or rather, racing) and almost never stops. Cars zipping around, racing, diving, skydiving, flying, the movie is seemingly an adrenaline junkie's dream. It was exciting, up to a point, then it eventually became too noisy and tiresome - like, some would say, a Transformers movie.(PLOT SYNOPSIS: on a dare from the boastful Italian Formula One (I guess) race car Francesco Bernoulli (sp?) (John Turturro), superstar racer Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) challenges him to three races in Tokyo, Paris, and London. This secondary plot is just a pretext for McQueen to bring his 'goofy goober' buddy and mechanic Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) along just so Mater can unwittingly blunder into a Bondian 'Big Oil vs. Alternative Fuel' spy caper orchestrated by McMissile and his capable young assistant Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer).)The races and the spy caper both move at Road Runner speed, sometimes parallel, sometimes intersecting where a mysterious villain is eliminating race car participants with an electromagnetic field in a plot to blame their crashes on the alternative ethanol they must use and bolster Big Oil. Yes, I know, it's confusing. Besides the incessant action, you also get meticulously rendered depictions of all three cities and bright, splashy colors (if nothing else, 'Cars 2' is visually enthralling). You also get a depiction of what the world would be like if sentient cars, buses, helicopters, and ships ran it (Example: Cars must remove their wheels to go through airport security). There's a lot to process in the movie. Maybe too much.Again, I call 'Cars 2' Pixar's Transformer's movie because it is noisy, busy, stuffed with colorful characters, locations, weapons, and hardware, and sometimes needlessly complex and hard to follow. In spite of all the action andviolence (which should have received a PG rating, at least),occasionally I found my attention drifting. When Mater eventually deduces that Axelrod (the alternative fuel mogul) and not the German mastermind (Professor Z) is responsible for the race car sabotages, and explains his reasoning, it seemed half-baked and vague. Some Scooby-Doo mysteries have more coherent explanations. If adults could get confused by all this, I would imagine that young children watching 'Cars 2' would get bored and tune out completely.So, did I like the movie? Generally, yes. 'Cars 2' does maintain Pixar's record for producing ambitious, intelligent movies with important morals (in this case, stay true to yourself and never underestimate anyone, even a country bumpkin). However, the frenetic action and labyrinthine Bond plot unfortunately weigh it down. Nevertheless, there is more good stuff than bad stuff to make 'Cars 2' a respectable, if not exceptional, addition to Pixar's canon.P.S.: Actually, it would have been kind of cool to have one of the vehicles be a 'Transformers'-type robot!",7,5,8,28 June 2011
Lincoln," Lincoln's Noble Selfishness - A Template for Modern Politicians
","Historical movies, in general and even the most effective ones, are inevitably daunting and biased affairs. No matter how objective a director thinks they are in presenting a historical figure, the period and themes they choose in depicting the figure often betray the director's subjective purposes and interests about him. We can never learn 'the truth' about anyone, especially historical figures we cannot witness first-hand. Despite the lofty mountain of research he has inspired, this is true of Lincoln himself. Spielberg certainly realized this and focused his saga on the final, fourth year of the Civil War, on the beginning of Lincoln's second term in office, and most specifically, upon efforts to ratify the 13th amendment, which basically abolished slavery and by extension all forms of servitude. In reviewing 'Lincoln', I will not relate all the specific characters, settings, and details; so many reviewers, Amazon and otherwise, have thoroughly seen to that (and more authoritatively than I ever could). I wish to narrow my focus on what I see as one of 'Lincoln''s most ironic and prominent themes - the 'ideal' of noble selfishness.I believe that, at heart, we are all selfish, or if you prefer the euphemistic adjective, 'self-concerned'. Even when we do things for and help others, our primary objective is 'what do we get out of it?'. This is not to detract from charitable, magnanimous, and self-sacrificing deeds. What I am saying is that, in my opinion, no one can achieve pure altruism, e.g. complete selflessness. But, I think we can achieve the next highest ideal: noble selfishness, that benefits many others besides yourself.'Lincoln' argues that successful politicians adeptly use noble selfishness to achieve their objectives. Even in our current period where revisionist Lincoln scholars have striven to demythologize and 'humanize' our 16th president, presenting that theme takes no small courage. Lincoln's efforts to compel a 2/3 majority of obstreperous, 'self-concerned' Representatives (2/3 of the Senate had voted in favor) - many of them Democrats (not Lincoln's party, the Republicans, who ironically, to many, resemble today's Democrats) revealed traits that have negative connotations for many of us.For example, as the movie showed, Lincoln exhaustively chatted up, or had lackeys chat up, many 13th amendment dissenters, even to the point of quid pro quo. Early in the movie, we see throngs of supplicants and job seekers waiting to see Lincoln to seek favors, patronage, and legal advice, in order to show that conciliatory, compromising, manipulating tone was part of Lincoln's character. Although historically shown to abhor slavery, arguably Lincoln had another, perhaps paramount, purpose for passing the 13th amendment - to disenfranchise the South, weaken their fighting morale, and accelerate their surrender and the Civil War's end. In the movie, some representatives claimed that a Southern delegation from the Confederacy's president Jefferson Davis wished to see Lincoln to discuss peace terms. The claim seemed dubious but did threaten some representatives' resolve to pass the amendment. In the movie, Lincoln hastily pens a letter and has it delivered to the House, stating that 'as far as I know', no delegation was forthcoming, which some representatives denounced as a 'lawyerly dodge'. Lincoln was even willing to use a type of 'eminent domain' to thwart the South by seizing the slaves as 'property' from the South, then employing the Emancipation Proclamation, enacted earlier, to set them free. Lincoln even tries mathematical logic, stating that if two things are individually equal to a third, then they are equal to each other. This, which incorporated with Thaddeus Steven's assertion in the House that even if all men were not really created equal in nature, they were equal under the law, attempted to circumvent those representatives that thought that African-Americans were fundamentally inferior.And so it goes. The movie shows Lincoln employing every political, legal, and logical weapon to flatter, wheedle, coax, intimidate, persuade, and entice as many representatives as possible (especially the 20 House democrats necessary to achieve the 2/3 majority) to vote for the 13th amendment. Again, some audiences may have been shocked by the seemingly base, hypocritical, self-contradictory, and unscrupulous tactics the 16th president used. Basically, it's a concession to the old adage that 'the end justifies the means'. In any case it worked, of course, the amendment is passed. Tellingly, the deciding vote, by the House speaker, stemmed from his desire to 'make history'.Of course, 'Lincoln' has its other virtues like Daniel-Day Lewis's spellbinding portrayal of the President, Tommy Lee-Jones tour-de-force as the savagely but amusingly brusque, candid, and insulting Thaddeus Stevens, and the re-creation of the oppressive, anxious Civil War zeitgeist. But above all, I think, 'Lincoln' will have relevant, enduring value because of its assertion that compromise, however superficially distasteful and beholden to the innate selfishness of others, is really the only way to get grand political accomplishments. I hope Obama and congressional members see the movie and retain that message.",8,0,1,27 March 2013
Big Hero 6," All Six of 'Hiro's Heroes' Have Brains, Power, and Most Importantly, Soul
","Basically a fusion of 'Teen Titans', 'The Incredibles', and one of those '60s Japanese cartoons featuring a boy and his giant robot ('Gigantor' comes to mind), Disney's Big Hero 6 (hereafter 'BH6') is a large-scale, comic-book action extravaganza that is on a par with any other 'superhero' movie. However, BH6 delivers far more than the usual slam-bang hero/villain battles. The movie illustrates and celebrates 'geeky' creative, scientific, and technological intelligence and its valuable contributions to society. It cherishes familial, fraternal, and even mechanical relationships and friendships. BH6 also examines the unthinking, dangerous pursuit of violent vengeance. Most unexpectedly but reassuringly, the movie is spiritual and convinces us that even robots and machines have souls (in their case, chips).First of all, BH6 shows that without purpose and guidance, even the greatest, genius intellect is wasted and useless. Hiro Hamada (Ryan Potter) is just that person. Gifted in robotics but aimless and unfocused, Hiro is content merely in pitting his creations against other miniature robots in illegal, underground fights. He usually wins, but is nearly apprehended in a police sting operation before his older brother Tadashi Hamada (voice of Daniel Henney) zips by on his motorbike to save him. Equally technologically adept, Tadashi has constantly berated the 14-year old Hiro for wasting his life and has constantly urged him to apply to the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology (SFIT), a scientific academy he attends. Tadashi's proudest achievement is a medical, health-care robot named Baymax (voice of Scott Adsit), a 7-foot tall white walking balloon figure that looks a little like Bib the Michelin Man or a man-sized Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, and sounds like HAL from '2001: A Space Odyssey'. At the beginning, Baymax's sole function is healing and taking care of people, namely Hiro, who initially isn't too crazy about Baymax's protectiveness toward him.After a little hesitation, Hiro, who's already graduated high school, agrees to put on a demonstration before the SFIT scientific faculty to show his credentials. His invention is microbots (nanobots) that work like computerized LEGO blocks that can instantly combine to form almost any object, animated or stationary, from buildings to huge moving hands. A mechanical headband controls the microbots' movements. The demanding SFIT Robotics Department Head Professor Robert Callaghan (voice of James Cromwell) is impressed and urges Hiro to apply. Tadashi had already introduced Hiro to his off-beat, nerdy, but accomplished robotics classmates: GoGo Tomago (voice of Jamie Chung), a brusque, stern, electromagnetics expert and extreme bicyclist, Wasabi (voice of Damon Wayans, Jr) a muscular but somewhat fastidious and cautious laser expert, Honey Lemon (voice of Genesis Rodriguez), an extroverted but sweet-natured chemist, and Fred, a happy-go-lucky (and surprisingly well-off) Valley Dude type who is a comic-book and dinosaur fanatic (and SFITs reptile mascot).Tadashi's friends and the SFIT curriculum finally persuade Hiro to apply. However, the SFIT robotics lab is set afire with Professor Callaghan inside. Tadashi rushes in to save him. The lab explodes. Hiro is overcome with grief at the loss of his brother and he again goes off- course. Tadashi's friends, and the suspicion that Alistair Krei (voice of Alan Tudyk), the Krei industry magnate who unsuccessfully attempted to purchase Hiro's microbots, killed Callaghan AND stole Hiro's microbots, rouse Hiro to action.However, in order to capture the Kabuki-masked villain, who is using the microbots to spread havoc in San Fransokyo, Hiro needs a super-powered team. Tomago, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred have their respective agility/electromagnetic disk, laser, chemical potion, and fire- breathing abilities. But someone extra is needed: Baymax. Baymax has neither the body (though he can lift over 1,000 pounds) nor the programming for super crime fighting. Hiro overcomes these formidable obstacles with carbon-steel armor and a 'fighter' computer chip. The 'Big Hero 6' team is ready to kick some evil butt. But the team has some serious hurdles. First, they are still uncoordinated and unfamiliar with fighting. Second, despite his upgrade, Baymax is still a pacifist healer at 'heart'. Third, and most shockingly, Hiro's desire to avenge his brother threatens to unbalance and consume him. Can the team overcome these obstacles to not only stop the villain, but uncover his true identity?BH6 eventually answers these questions with both vibrant, eye-stunning action and quiet, contemplative scenes that demonstrate that blunt, thoughtless force and vengeance is not only not enough to solve problems, it may exacerbate these problems and cause still others. Planning, logic, and creative thinking must also be used. Even power and brains combined may not be enough. Compassion and caring, as embodied by Baymax, must also enter the mix to solve problems without losing your soul. Speaking of souls, despite Hiro's lament that his brother is gone, Baymax continually reassures him that 'Tadashi is here' and points to his torso video, showing Tadashi's trial-and-error process in creating Baymax. This comforts Hiro (and us) Also, when Baymax is called upon to sacrifice himself to save someone, we realize that all may not be lost, because, as mentioned before, robots and computers have chips for souls. I think BH6's ultimate comforting message is that since souls and chips live forever, people and robots can never truly die. Thanks for that inspiring reminder, Baymax, Hiro, and BH6.",10,57,87,26 November 2014
Jurassic World," It Only Makes Sense for a Hybrid 'Dinosaur Movie' to Have a Hybrid Dinosaur
","I knew it, I just knew it – or at least partially knew it. In my IMDb review for 'Jurassic Park III (which I admired very much, by the way, so there!!!) I predicted that the follow-up movie would involve some kind of dinosaur DNA manipulation and creation of new dinosaur hybrids. Lo and behold, the movie Jurassic World (hereafter 'JW') introduces a hybrid, christened 'Indomitus Rex (I-rex)' which is an amalgam of T-Rex and raptor DNA, plus non-dinosaur DNA such as from the tree frog and the cuttlefish (which is a type of gastropod or squid with chromatophores that allow it to camouflage itself by changing colors). That's why, in addition to its extra knife-like teeth, robust arms, and Wolverine-like claws, I-Rex has the 'Predator' - like ability to blend seamlessly into its surroundings. Basically, it looks like the Spinosaurus from 'JPIII' without the spines. I-Rex came into being, because, according to JW's operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the InGen-owned dinosaur theme park was suffering diminishing attendance as people were getting jaded and blasé about 'ordinary' dinosaurs, (which I found hard to believe) and needed a brand-new, better dinosaur. InGen and JW succeeded beyond their wildest nightmares.As my title suggests, originality and social commentary are not high on JW's agenda. Even as it borrows and copies scenes and concepts (sometimes almost wholesale) from all three of its Jurassic Park movie predecessors, JW doesn't bang you over the head with the ethical implications of cloning and exploiting dinosaurs for human amusement. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) are not present to poke at our consciences. No, JW borrows from yet another movie source, the 'Godzilla' films, to scare both park and movie audiences with a terrifying, practically invincible monster attacking everything in its path, sometimes (as with the apatosaurs) just for the thrill of it.Actually, there is one person who does disapprove of 'JW''s hybridization program. That would be rugged, good-looking, Navy veteran Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) who for some inexplicable reason is serving as surrogate mother and 'whisperer' to a pack of raptors who imprinted on him upon hatching (as implied from the movie's beginning). But for whatever reason he attempts to 'tame' and 'control' his charges, he has no intention of allowing InGen security head Vic Hoskins (Vincent D'Onofrio) to use the raptors as military weapons a la the 'Alien' franchise (I was thinking how Vic would do such a thing; despite their speed and ferocity, raptors can't fire guns and aren't bullet-proof – oh well). Therefore, besides the distracted, workaholic, ex-girlfriend Claire, Owen has to constantly butt heads with Vic.Anyway, before long, the I-Rex uses his chameleon powers and cunning as well as brute strength to escape from his remote enclosure and make his deadly bee-line for the theme park. To complicate matters further, Claire's nephews, dinosaur geek expert Gray (Ty Simpkins) and his hormonally-charged older brother Zach (Nick Robinson) are simultaneously visiting the park. Therefore, the plot simply involves stopping the I-Rex before it destroys the park, kills off or frees the other dinosaurs, decimates the customers, including Zach and Gray, and, horror of horrors, sinks InGen's latest investment!In some ways, besides having similarities to the movies already mentioned, JW resembles 'Independence Day' in the way that it is engrossing, exciting, and involving, just so long as you don't think too deeply about it. Otherwise, you will notice the nagging inconsistencies and foolish, nonsensical behavior like - the I-Rex crashing through walls - a security guard hiding behind a car that the I-Rex can flip like a Tonka toy - Claire running in high heels (even after Owen tells her to lose them) - the raptors switching loyalties back and forth between Owen and the I-Rex - Vic sticking his hand out to pet a snarling raptor - Claire (still in high heels) going to a secret enclosure to summonguess who (no,it's not King Kong) to take on the I-Rex in a pulse-pounding, earth-shaking climactic fight, - the mosasaur (the colossal water creature) demonstrating both the deus ex machina principle and the Chekov gun principle, if you know what I mean (if you don't, you can look up those principles on Wikipedia, as I did).But, hey, it's summer. Who thinks during the summer? 'JW' is the perfect example of the Summer Dinosaur Monster movie. Send your brain to bed and let JW treat you and your emotions to an immensely rollicking good time!",8,7,18,23 June 2015
Prisoners," When It Comes to Holding 'Prisoners', Emotions Can Be Stronger Than Iron Bars
","The movie 'Prisoners' simply starts with two families, the Dovers and the Birches, in a nondescript town, sharing a Thanksgiving dinner. Then the two youngest members of both families, Anna Dover (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy Birch (Kyla Drew Simmons) go to play outside supposedly under Anna's older brother Ralph's supervision. They get close to a next-door neighbor's RV, but quickly leave when a pair of ominous eyes stare at them from inside. Soon after, both nine-year old girls are missing and apparently kidnapped. Methodical, persistent Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), with a perfect case-solving record, strives to find out who abducted the children and why. There are a few suspects, but the most prominent one is Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a child-like young man who lives with caretaker aunt Holly (Melissa Leo) and who is arrested after violently trying to flee Loki and the police in the same RV. So now it's simply a matter of getting Alex to confess to the crime and reveal where the two girls are - isn't it?Perhaps,it's not so simple. 'Prisoners' spins an elaborate, deliberate, and intelligent mystery with its share of clues, red herrings, and frustrating dead ends. But I believe the movie's primary focus IS reflected in its nuanced title and how the characters react to it. Both families, including Grace Dover (Maria Bello), Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), and Nancy Birch (Viola Davis) are understandably psychologically imprisoned by anxiety, suspense, tension, and horror at their loss - almost to the point of inertia. However, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) is not so passive. He is imprisoned by more than just fear; he seethes with vengeance and wrath. He is not satisfied with what he sees as cursory treatment of primary suspect Alex by Loki and the police and is enraged by Alex's release from custody due to insufficient evidence. Insufficient evidence, hell! Keller, a home renovator, has his own ways of making Alex talk...As the mystery progresses, 'Prisoners' takes the time to explore Keller's struggle between justice and revenge and the viewer's attitude toward his actions. As Keller retaliates with his own kidnapping and subsequent torture of Alex, I think many viewers will simultaneously sympathize with and be repelled by Keller's behavior. If we lost a child, of course many of us would rage, and swear, and be spurred to some kind of action. But would we do the things Keller does to Alex, things that begin to border on the sadistic? As it winds toward the kidnapping resolution, the revelation of the culprit, Alex's fate, and, surprisingly, Keller's ironic fate, 'Prisoners' reminds us that no situation, even a kidnapping and possible torture, justifies letting ourselves being imprisoned by mindless and perhaps misguided vengeance. In this regard, Detective Loki provides contrast. Even though he gets violently frustrated by the case, Loki's professionalism and logic keep him on course and help him progress in his investigation. Keller does not do the same for most of the movie until it's too late. Like Loki, he learns the truth of the abduction, but his emotional prison may end up leading to a literal one as well.",8,1,1,22 October 2013
Hotel Transylvania," The 'Groovie Ghoulies' On Speed – You Don't Just Watch 'Hotel Transylvania', You Ride It!
","In case you weren't a Saturday-morning cartoon show freak during the '70s, the 'Groovie Ghoulies' was a Hal Sutherland/Filmation animated production featuring nice, family friendly versions of Dracula, the Frankenstein Monster, and the Wolfman (Drac, Frankie, and Wolfie respectively) plus a few other legendary monsters. The cartoons spotlighted their wacky, episodic adventures in a castle called Horrible Hall and also in the 'real' world – or at least the world of Archie, Veronica, Betty, Reggie, and Jughead. They also did 'Laugh-In' jokes and skits.Hotel Transylvania' (hereafter 'H-Trans') borrows a fair amount of that 60ish, freestyle 'Groovie Ghoulies' vibe (plus the vibes of movies like 'The Croods', 'Monsters vs. Aliens', and even the Harry Potter series, and of course TV series like 'The Addams Family' and 'The Munsters'). But that's good, because 'H-Trans' uses its borrowings skillfully to spin out a wildly enjoyable, supersonic story about an extended nuclear monster family.The main theme revolves around widower Count Dracula's (Adam Sandler ) frantic efforts to safeguard his only child, surprisingly fetching and independent-willed vampire daughter named Mavis (Selena Gomez) from the ignorant terrors of the human world. Having reached the age of monster maturity (118, or 18 in human years), Mavis is eager to explore the mysterious world beyond the creepy, eerie walls of Dracula's castle. However, Dracula goes to extravagant lengths, even fabricating a Balkan village populated by the undead pretending to be hostile humans, to keep Mavis safe at home. Beyond that, Dracula has renovated his castle to be a hotel/retreat/refuge for all sorts of kooky, 'domesticated' monsters, from good-natured husband Frank (Kevin James) and his nagging wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), to harried wolfman Wayne (Steve Buscemi) and his pregnant wife Wanda (Molly Shannon) and their unruly canine brood, to the narcissistic, bespectacled Invisible Man (David Spade), to obese but hip and swaggering mummy Murray (CeeLo Green), plus practically every other monster in creation.To keep the meddling humans out, Dracula has converted the hotel/castle into a seemingly impenetrable, booby-trapped fortress. Nevertheless, a back-packing surfer dude type named Jonathan (Andy Samburg) stumbles into the castle and is somewhat terrified by but far more curious about the place and its odd denizens. Aghast, Dracula tries EVERYTHING he can to either hide the human Jonathan from his suspicious guests, especially Mavis, or to disguise him as Frank's 'right-hand' cousin 'Johnnystein', who is also a 'party planner'. Of course, this fails and Jonathan and Mavis meet and find a 'zing' of love and affection exists between them, so much so that in a calm, sweet break from the action, they climb to the hotel roof and Jonathan shows Mavis her first sunrise from beneath the shade of a chimney, since of course vampires and sunlight are not friends.Eventually even the obstinate Count and his guests realize that Jonathan is a pretty decent, trustworthy fellow, especially for a human, and knows how to liven up a bunch of cool, party-hearty but somewhat out-of-touch, antiquated monsters. Dracula even confesses to Jonathan in an emotional sequence how a bunch of torch-and-pitchfork villagers killed his wife and embittered him against humanity. Jonathan and Mavis get closer and even kiss (which bugs Dracula so much his face turns red and his fangs grow, which always cracked me up) and may even start on a path of wedded independence.But chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz), instead of his expected gentle personality, reveals a nasty but funny desire to serve Jonathan for dinner. Naturally, this drives Jonathan away from the castle. Formerly biased and cautious Dracula (and company) must now brave the outside human world AND daylight to intercept Jonathan's airplane flight from Transylvania and convince him to return. Can he do it, and reunite him with Mavis? As I said, 'H-Trans' is a supersonic, roller-coaster delight of a 'monster' movie that will almost give you a whiplash. Despite the pace, however, the movie is a clever, respectful homage AND parody of famous monsters (even the 'Twilight' vampires) which also obtains its laughs from common domestic themes such as parent-child interactions, the search for autonomy and freedom, the need to let someone you love go and find his/her destiny, and the unexpected power of forgiveness. 'H-Trans' also displays its humor through sharp dialogue and one-liners, slapstick pratfalls, and juvenile humor. In other words, just about anyone, from ADD patients to reasonably sophisticated cinema lovers, can find something to like about 'H-Trans'.These characters, monster and human, lead interesting lives, and deserve a sequel!",10,1,1,14 June 2014
Avatar," 'Avatar' is a 'Star Wars' avatar
","By definition, an avatar is a descendant who is a modified reincarnation of an ancestor. The definition really doesn't apply to the characters in Avatar who assume alien form to survive in a hostile planetary environment; they're more like participants in a virtual reality environment. Rather, the definition applies to the movie 'Avatar' as a whole. As I saw it, 'Avatar' is an avatar, in a way, of Star Wars. While 'Star Wars' took the framework and concepts of King Arthur and Camelot and placed it in space, 'Avatar' took the framework and concepts of cowboys and mystical Native Americans and placed it in space.Therefore, you have, as I believe Boston Herald critic James Verniere put it, 'Dances with Giant Blue Ewoks', which is a rather comprehensive description. The only tweak is that instead of traditional cowboys, we have the traditional bullheaded military/industrial complex obsessed with conquest and pillage. So, as a majority of the posters here have sagaciously observed, originality is not 'Avatar''s strong suit. But then again, was 'Star Wars' original? The only original movie is arguably the first one ever made, and even it had to borrow from oral and written folklore and stories.Okay, enough digression. 'Avatar' is certainly derivative, but is it any good? It's astonishingly very good I think, because James Cameron is not only a master of technology, but also good storytelling. As you felt for Luke as he journeyed toward adulthood and his Jedi destiny, you will feel for quadriplegic Jake as he gropes his way forward towards physical independence, love, and defense of a higher spiritual good. Sure, you've seen these morality tales before, but seldom with such impeccable CGI (and 3D) depictions, intense characterizations of both human and the alien Na'vi, unrelenting adventure and violence, and compelling spirituality ('God does not take sides, but preserves the universal balance'). 'Star Wars' had these elements, and of course soared to popular and critical acclaim. 'Avatar', 'Star Wars''s avatar, of course duplicated this feat, even more so.P.S.: Pandora strongly reminded me of a planet you would find in the 'Star Wars' mythos. Wishful thinking, of course, since they are separated by immense time periods, but I would find a 'Star Wars'/'Avatar' crossover interesting.",8,2,4,26 June 2012
Super 8," A Collision Between 'The Goonies' and 'The War of the Worlds', with 'E.T.' as an afterthought
","Under producer Spielberg's assumed tutelage and inspiration, director J.J. Abrams has constructed a more-than-serviceable homage to the master in 'Super 8'. Okay, here's the umpteenth reiteration of the plot - a group of charismatic junior high adolescents shooting a zombie film for a contest stumble upon a train wreck, a government space conspiracy and deception, and a monstrous alien that escapes the wreck. Therefore, as I said in the title, you have an amalgamation of 'The Goonies', 'War of the Worlds', and 'E.T.', but not in equal proportions.Abrams handles the 'Goonies' component skillfully and appealingly. The preteens are spirited, energetic, clever, occasionally profane, but always endearing and sympathetic. I especially appreciated their accurate, amusing speeches, especially the exchanges between the sweet, Elliott-like Joe home movie special effects artist) and his bossy, portly friend Charles (the home movie director). The budding relationship between Joe and the older, more mature, but demure Alice was also convincing and engrossing, especially since both have the loss of a mother in common. All the kids' reactions to and investigations of the train wreck/alien mystery were finely tuned and interesting. Abrams does not neglect kid/adult interactions either. Joe and Alice each have to deal with distant, emotionally reserved fathers and somehow manage to connect with them.The 'War of the Worlds' component was handled nearly as well, although some logic lapses do occur. The train derailment is suitably spectacular, but as another poster pointed out, it's highly unlikely that a pick-up truck, even ramming into the train head-on at full-speed, could cause such damage. It's like trying to trip a giant with a toothpick. The train would have stayed on course, but the pick-up and its passenger would have been throughly mangled. Therefore, the pick-up's driver, Mr. Woodburn, would not have survived to give the kids the dire but cryptic warning about the train and its contents. Nonetheless, the infiltration, evacuation, and surreptitious behavior of the nefarious, devious U.S. into the Ohio town where the train collision occurred are workmanlike, efficient, and well-handled. Many of the military adults, and some of the townspeople, may be corrupt and selfish, but they are not boobs. And Joe's dad, the deputy sheriff, is neither corrupt nor foolish, as he tries to penetrate the military's cone of silence regarding the crash.Unfortunately, the 'E.T.' aspect of the film, despite being its focal point, is the least developed. Abrams keeps the elusive alien beast largely concealed for most of the movie as it smashes its way out of the box car, randomly attacks the townspeople, and burrows underneath a cemetery for refuge. This suspense-building works. However, it leaves the audience (and the kids in the movie) little time to bond with or even communicate with the alien. (MAJOR SPOILER WARNING ABOUT THE BEAST'S ORIGIN AND APPEARANCE). The alien and his crashed spaceship (now broken down into magnetic cubed components) was being transported from a Roswell-type military base. The roughly 12-foot high (I guess) alien looks like a hybrid of Alien, the 'Cloverfield' monster, the Transformer Optimus Prime (especially about the face), and the Ymir from '20 Million Miles to Earth'. And, oh yes, a spider. It's described as frightened and distrustful because of the mistreatment it received from the U.S. Army, and actually benevolent. But throughout the movie, he acts malevolently, smashing cars and buses, apparently killing at least two people, and hanging people (including the kidnapped Alice) upside down in his subterranean cave apparently for food! Joe's short, calm confrontation with the alien in his cave seems to change its mood. At the movie's end, he assembles a new spaceship out of magnetized metal (including the locket containing a picture of Joe's mother and him as a baby), and takes off. See, very inconsistent and abrupt. Was the alien inherently sinister, or benign? Why didn't the alien construct a new spaceship immediately, as soon as he escaped? Why bother terrorizing the townspeople? 'E.T.' gets shortchanged here.Nevertheless, I do recommend the film as a funny, suspenseful, kinetic good time. If you are a Spielberg fan, you'll probably enjoy it even more, and be more inclined to overlook its flaws.",8,2,5,14 June 2011
Thor," If Thou Hast Not Seen 'Thor', Rectify Thine Grievous O'ersight and Hasten to Do So
","I saw 'Thor' on Monday, May 16, 2011 and I was generally pleased. Consequently, I should forget filing a future Mensa membership application. So be it. The movie probably lacks that precious moralistic profundity the Academy Award Committee purports to seek in its cinematic viewings. Nevertheless, I found it intelligent, competent, engrossing, AND respectful of its source material - namely Stan Lee's interpretation of Norse Mythology.'Thor' is not a mindless fantasy romp. It addresses various themes such as simmering sibling rivalry, filial fealty, overweening presumption and haughtiness that comes with power, resentment, self-sacrifice, and the wisdom of self-restraint. The overbearing, overreaching warrior Thor is thrust upon the road to humble self-redemption, and what better place to do so than upon an unassuming New Mexico hamlet on Midgard. Perhaps a tad too quickly (but that's all right), he learns of a warrior's, a god's, a being's true worth - forgiveness (of Loki's tortured treachery) and self-sacrifice (to protect Jane, her friends, and the New Mexico town) from the Destroyer juggernaut. In short, I found 'Thor' ultimately uplifting.Flaws do exist. Occasionally the luscious, staggering Asgardian and cosmic backgrounds seemed like scale-model work. Thor becomes acclimated to Midgard customs a bit too easily; more 'Man from Mars' encounters would have rectified this. Some of the S.H.I.E.L.D. security personnels' behavior was implausibly lenient. Nevertheless, 'Thor' serves as a more than adequate introduction to the God of Thunder and Lightning, the devious but surprisingly conflicted God of Mischief and Evil Loki, the imperious but circumspect Asgardian lord Odin, the Asgardian plane (NOT planet) and the richness of Norse mythology. It takes itself seriously enough, but not too seriously, because it's a rollicking, energetic adventure, too.Furthermore, the very last end credit whetted my appetite for 'The Avengers' movie. Overall, 'Thor' is a quite satisfactory accomplishment.",8,0,1,21 June 2011
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Latest Ice Age 'Odyssey' Proves the Franchise Still Has Legs - to Some Degree
","Ice Age 4 - Continental Drift' (hereafter IA4) is an ideal example of what I like to call 'Cinematic Dissonance'. I define Cinematic Dissonance as the sensation when, watching a movie, your brain is telling you 'This is really silly and/or stupid!' but your emotions are telling you 'I'm having a great time!'. Therefore, I can understand and even somewhat agree with the 1- and 2-star reviewers of this movie who complain that IA4 is basically more of the hackneyed, predictable, improbable, and homogenized capers of Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and company. And yet, I side with the 3- and 4-star reviewers who enjoyed IA4 as an energetic, dynamic, funny seagoing adventure with allusions to Homer's 'The Odyssey' that somehow still reinforces the themes of family, adolescent angst, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and home.With each succeeding 'Ice Age' movie, logic and natural reality have been left further and further behind. For example, by now, to appreciate the franchise, you have to accept that Scrat the obsessed saber-toothed squirrel's acorn pursuit will lead to more and more global catastrophic changes. In IA4, he has caused the surprisingly fragile Pangea's fragmentation into the continents we know today. We also have to accept that Manny is obstinately determined to keep his now-teenaged daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) safe, when actually male elephants hardly take part in raising offspring, and that Peaches' best friend is a mole/hedgehog ('molehog') hybrid named Louis. Of course, Peaches has also inherited her prehensile tail and tree-living abilities from her mother, Ellie (Queen Latifah). The only other complication in our gang's essentially stable lives is the sudden abandonment of feisty Granny Sloth (Wanda Sykes) to Sid's (John Leguizamo's) care by his fly-by-night family. Granny has a friend called 'Precious', but it's certainly not a ring. Hey, these are familiar domestic dramas, but IA4 still makes them interesting.But the continental shiftings and movements interrupt the drama and gradually separate Manny, Sid, Granny, and Diego the sensible sabertooth cat (Denis Leary) from the others. Set adrift on an iceberg, Manny and friends encounter another iceberg - a 'pirate ship' commanded by a Gigantopithecus (according to Wikipedia) named Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his zoo crew - including a blubbery elephant seal, a rabbit, a kangaroo, and an able-bodied first-mate female Smilodon named Shira. So now the plot is established with several resolutions to be made: 1) Can Manny and his crew escape Captain Gutt's grasp? 2) Will Shira mutiny and change alliances? 3) Can Manny and his crew weather turbulent seas, fierce narwhals, and even (!) sirens to get back home, AND save a kidnapped Peaches and Ellie?, 4) Can Manny defeat Captain Gutt in battle? 5) Can klutzy Sid get along with his grandma and be a hero, 6) Can insecure Louis help save his friends, and finally 6) Is Precious real, or just Granny's hallucination? Oohwee! I think you know how all the above resolutions will play out. Even so, I enjoyed them because I felt that all of IA4's characters were cheerfully giving their utmost to entertain us and having a grand time doing so. Besides the vivacious characterizations, IA4 continues the breathtakingly solid and weighty photorealism of its backgrounds and animation. Most importantly, IA4 continues to resist the self-consciousness of acting in a madcap, surreal story. The characters believed in the story and told it well, and made me believe it, too.P.S.: One other resolution - Scrat finds a treasure map that leads him to a legendary acorn paradise called 'Scratlantis'. Does Scrat find the acorn of his dreams? Wellll,.....P.P.S.: By the way, Gigantopithecuses really did exist about 1 million years ago. They were huge apes over 10 feet tall. Therefore, it is quite plausible that Captain Gutt could fight and even toss around Manny.",8,0,0,24 June 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," If People Valued Friendship and Loyalty Above Gold and War, What a Pleasant World It Would Be
","The title of this review, of course, paraphrases probably the most important quote of either the 'Hobbit' novel or movie trilogy. Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage) regretfully utters the important quote when he finally realizes what devastation his quest for his mountain home of Erebor has wrought. That regret gives the final movie of the Hobbit Trilogy, 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' (hereafter 'Five Armies') its sad, emotional weight. 'Five Armies' delivers the sword/axe/spear wielding and battling excitement of its two predecessors, but this time the mind-spinning, heart-pumping action is tempered by a sobering thought: much of the fighting and devastation was a shameful waste.Why? Well, with Bard's slaying of the rampaging dragon Smaug (mellifluous voice of Benedict Cumberbatch) with the Black Arrow that finds his Achilles heel (an unprotected opening in his neck), Thorin, the thirteen dwarfs, and Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) have cemented their claim on Erebor and the ocean of gold and other treasures within. However, Smaug's attack on Laketown and his death throes after the arrow pierces him have effectively obliterated the town. All Laketowners, including the devious, pompous Master (Stephen Fry) and his sniveling toady (i.e. brown-noser) Alfrid Lickspittle (Ryan Gage), are now homeless refugees. After the Master's shocking but funny death, Bard the Bowman (Luke Evans) becomes de facto town leader. Bard goes to the Erebor stronghold to not only provide food and shelter for his people, but also to claim the town's rightful share of the dwarfs' treasure.But some insidious sickness has altered Thorin's normally sensible and noble nature. He has contracted the dragon's ailment: acute gold fever. In fact, Thorin's mad thirst and greed for gold surpasses even Smaug's. Despite the pleas of the dwarfs, and especially Bilbo, Thorin refuses to negotiate at all with either the Laketowners or the elven army led by the imperious Thranduil (Lee Pace) who have come for THEIR rightful share. Men, elves, and dwarfs settle in for a long siege. Bilbo attempts to broker a peace with all three forces by offering the priceless dwarf jewel the Arkenstone (which he DID recover from Smaug) as a bargaining chip. Of course, this infuriates Thorin and leads to Bilbo's banishment from the dwarfs. Battle becomes dangerously imminent when Thorin manages to contact the Iron Dwarf Dain (Billy Connolly) and his mighty hordes to even the odds. Before long, though, the squabble over the gold escalates to fighting for sheer survival as the brutal, relentless, Azog the Defiler (Manu Bennett), Bolg (John Tui), and his deformed bunch of warriors, giants, and overall freaks catch up to Thorin and company. Needless to say, war breaks out.As with the previous two movies, and despite purists' groans of protest, 'Five Armies' largely adheres to the novel's structure. Two deviations, the turbulent confrontation of the wizards Gandalf (Ian McKellen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), and Saruman the White (dearly departed Christopher Lee) against the personification of darkness Sauron (Benedict Cumberbatch) and the still-baffling but tender relationship between female elf warrior Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly) and the dwarf Kili (Aidan Turner), continue from the previous movie. There are two others. One, Bard, on his own, discovers Smaug's weakness without Bilbo's help. In the previous movie, Bilbo spotted the dragon's weakness earlier. However, unlike in the novel, there is no thrush or any other messenger, human or animal, to convey that knowledge from Bilbo to Bard. Why the omission? I'm not really sure. It seems to deny Bilbo's instrumental part in getting rid of the dragon. The second deviation is the long-awaited, final showdown between Thorin and his relentless pursuer Azog, who whale on each other over a frozen river. Oh, yes, there is a third; the kryptonian fighting machine elf Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) defies gravity to mix it up with Bolg. As with the previous two movies, the deviations mostly did not bother me, except, yes, not giving Bilbo credit for finding Smaug's crack in his scaly armor. Come to think of it, why didn't he tell Thorin and the dwarfs in the second movie about the weakness, to give them the chance to kill the dragon before he left for Laketown?No matter; Bilbo acquits himself in other ways. Although many moviegoers felt Bilbo was marginalized, all three movies, including 'Five Armies' demonstrate that he made a difference, even though in the novel, Bilbo's participation in the final battle was 'rather unimportant'. As already mentioned, he tried to broker a peace. Second, he does not desert his dwarf companions even after gold-mad Thorin tries to toss him off the ramparts. Third, his rock-throwing abilities, referenced in the novel, come in handy as he beans Azog's orc warriors like David slaying Goliath. Using his invisibility ring, Bilbo accompanies Legolas and Tauriel to warn the dwarfs about Bolg's army. Finally, his loyalty to and friendship with Thorin give him comfort after his recovery from gold fever and battle with Azog.'Five Armies' paradoxically shows the cruel uselessness of war, especially for inherently useless gold. Evil beings might be vanquished, but good beings can also lose everything, including relationships and even lives, unnecessarily. However, as in the novel, 'Five Armies' suggests that the only 'good' war is one where evil IS vanquished or at least kept at bay. Through Bilbo's mere presence, 'Five Armies' reveals that the way to a better, happier world is steadfast loyalty, friendship, and a desire for peace. Oh, good food and drink don't hurt either.",8,7,12,21 August 2015
Inception," It all boils down to 'The Dream Shall Never Die'
","Everyone and his schnauzer is commenting on 'Inception'. I'll chip in my two-cent criticism as well.I viewed this movie with my friends Mark and Ron at the AMC Theater in Framingham on Flutie Pass (yes, named after Doug). All of us came out stunned. Ron thought it was the stupidest movie he had seen and Mark opined that it was some really 'f**ked up weird sh*t'. I tried to be more thoughtfully diplomatic by describing what I thought the movie was trying to do. Basically, I thought 'Inception' tried to take the ancient themes of 'What is reality, what is dream?' and 'Is it all a dream' into convoluted, tiered, and entertaining directions.I disagree with Mr. Ebert's assessment in his review that 'Inception' is 'wholly original'. 'Inception' will remind you of many other movies; for example, it obviously evoked 'Dreamscape' and 'The Matrix'. But did I 'like' it? Well, in past blogs I alluded to the concept of 'cinematic dissonance' (which I believe should be included in Mr. Ebert's movie glossary, by the way), a simultaneous experience where your intellect regards a film as garbage while your emotions regard the film as great fun. With 'Inception' I somewhat experienced the converse; my intellect appreciated the straight/convoluted logic of the plot while my emotions simultaneously and eventually surrendered to impatience and boredom, in spite of the phantasmagoric special effects and intense action. Well, it was late, and I am more of a morning person.Like other movies in the 'dreams/reality' genre, 'Inception' sucks you into deciding which exciting, involved scenario is a dream or not, even when we are apparently 'told' which one. This 'trees at the expense of the forest' view is, I think, meant to be beside the point. Like all good movies in this genre, 'Inception' is saying that the basic idea to retain is 'It's really all a dream' and 'Reality is a subjectively chosen point on a circular continuum'. Three scenes illustrate this: 1) Ariadne shows Cobb the old 'infinite mirror' phenomenon in the Paris construct, 2) Cobb points out Ariadne's circular maze is the proper architectural dream construct, and 3) the entire film's circular, 'this is where I came in' structure.'Inception' cleverly distracts us from this unsettling overall view with its noisy plot spinnings, the deceptive '3-dimensional chess' structure (recall Ariadnee's choice of a bronze pawn as her 'reality marker') of the putative idea-planting plot, and the more emotionally involving dilemmas of Fischer's and Cobb's family issues. Nolan also realizes that these distractions also make the potentially alienating and disquieting notion that nothing is truly real more entertainingly palatable. In other words, we arbitrarily choose Cobb's and Fischer's situations as the reality to which we want to cling. Michael Caine's character underscores that with his exhortation to Cobb, 'Come back to reality', making him, and not Cobb's top, the actual arbitrary 'reality marker'.In other words, Inception asks, 'At what point does the circle begin?' Even though the movie gives you an 'answer', the real answer is 'Any point you choose.' Some would say 'Inception' demands repeated concentration. If you want to go on a metaphorical and symbological scavenger hunt (and there's nothing wrong with that), go right ahead. I don't think it's strictly necessary. One viewing is enough to tell you that life is but a dream.P.S.: I think Nolan wants you to be lulled into happy closure with Cobb's 'apparent reunion' with his children. The muted, static way that reunion scene is shot suggests otherwise. 'The Dream Shall Never Die', which I think would be a good title for the inevitable sequel.",7,3,7,6 August 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," Pet Story (Alternate Title: Underground Zootopia)
","Yeah, I know, I'm certainly not the first reviewer to realize that the plot of the animated'The Secret Life of Pets (hereafter 'Secret Life') closely resembles that of the 'Toy Story' trilogy. Hence, the first title of this review. Nevertheless, the borrowed plot is an ideal vehicle for answering one of the baffling mysteries of our time: what do pets really act like when their owners are away (you can solve that problem with security cameras, but never mind)? The unsurprising answer is: when the cat's away the mice will play, so to speak. In other words, the cats, dogs, birds, and other assorted domesticated animals in a New York apartment building cut loose and party, stuff themselves, and basically wreck the joint.Except for one brown-and-white Jack Russell terrier named Max (voice of Louis C.K.). Little Max is generally liked and respected by all the other apartment building animals, even by the obese, sarcastic, misbehaving tabby cat Chloe (voice of Lake Bell). In particular, the fuzzy, hyperactive, but gutsy Pomeranian Gidget (voice of Jenny Slate) harbors an unrequited crush for Max. Max is content being a kind of 'top dog' and the apple of his owner Katie's (voice of Ellie Kemper) eye. The only downside is that Max suffers acute separation anxiety whenever Katie is out of the apartment, and is willing to stare at the front door all day until she returns.Katie seems to realize that Max is lonely, so she brings home a new dog – a huge, brown, generally good-natured Newfoundland named Duke. Max is none too thrilled with his new roommate, despite Duke's efforts to make friends. In fact, Max is so eager to get rid of Duke, he breaks apartment items and tries to frame Duke. Max and Duke become bitter rivals. But before the rivalry can escalate, both dogs get lost in New York during one of their walks, lose their collars and licenses during an encounter with an army of fierce alley cats, and begin a frantic run to get away from them AND Animal Control officers and get home.Animal Control catches Max and Duke, but they escape their cages with the help of the maniacal, bitter, abandoned (like Lotso Hugging Bear in 'Toy Story 3') white rabbit named Snowball (voice of Kevin Hart), the unlikely leader of a menagerie of other abandoned animals of ALL kinds, including snakes, alligators, and lizards. Hence the second, alternate title of this review. Snowball frees Max and Duke only because they pretend to agree to help him carry out his vengeful desire to punish humanity for their abandonment. But the ruse can only last so long; Snowball figures out the dogs are domesticated 'sellouts', so Max and Duke have to put their differences aside even longer to escape a third group that wants to capture/destroy them.Meanwhile, Gidget is the first apartment pet to realize that Max and Duke have been gone an awfully long time. Therefore, the fearless Pomeranian rallies the other pets, including the energetic pug Mel (voice of Bobby Moynihan), the stretchy wiener dog Buddy (voice of Hannibal Buress), the confused guinea pig Norman (voice of Chris Renaud), and even a red-tailed hawk with almost overwhelming predatory instincts named Tiberius (voice of Albert Brooks), to mount a rescue mission. On their way to save Max and Duke, they meet an old, cantankerous, handicapped, but New York-smart basset hound named Pops (voice of Dana Carvey) who grudgingly offers to help ferret Max and Duke out. And so were off on a merry, almost exhausting, almost non-stop chase above and below New York to see who will get to Max and Duke first – Snowball and his scary 'henchmen' or Gidget and her motley crew- and to see if the mismatched pooches make it home after all.'Secret Life' is perfect for summer because it is loaded with action, gut-busting laughter, wild fantasy, and memorable characters. But the movie is not mindless because it manages to sneak in lessons about forging alliances and friendships, the sometimes cruel things humans do to animals, and the sacrifices true friends make for each other. There is even pathos, as when former pound pooch Duke tries to locate his former owner and realizes that in one sense you really can't go home again. In short, 'Secret Life' is bound to please both adults and children, but it is rated PG for a reason, because some of the animals, especially the colossal, one-fanged viper that challenges Max and Duke to battle, might terrify impressionable children, and because there is at least one reference to death. Still 'Secret Life', despite its derivative plot, or more likely because of it, is a fun, fitting tribute to pets that deserve human love because of the comfort and devotion they give, even if they make the occasional mess.P.S.: Preceding 'Secret Life' is an animated 'Illumination' short called 'Mowin' Minions' where the little yellow guys in blue overalls perform yard work to raise enough money to buy a blender. The expected, irresistibly hilarious roller coaster ride of chaos ensues.",8,7,12,18 July 2016
WALL·E," WALL-ET, it's time to go back home!
","I do regret missing seeing 'WALL-E' on the big screen, so I had to console myself by watching this 'mechanical', post-utopic, sci-fi romance melodrama on Encore at home. My attitude towards the overall product is somewhat ambivalent. Overall, I am generally glad that I saw it, but I am leery of comments declaring it a complete masterpiece. Make no mistake; WALL-E solidifies Pixar's impressive track record of entertaining movies with something substantial to say, but I felt that in the last analysis it gives its unassuming protagonist a little bit of short shrift.WALL-E (hereafter WALL-ET because of his obvious homage to ET and his beneficial effect upon Pixar's revenues, hee-hee) is a bit of a Frankenstein. In addition to ET, he is also an amalgamated mash-up of R2-D2, Johnny 5 from the 'Short Circuit' films, the gardening droids from 'Silent Running', and even the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. This sentient trash disposal unit lives a near solitary existence on a trash-besotted Earth in the 29th century. Ironically, although it looks like a sepia-toned nuclear wasteland, Earth just choked up on its own refuse. Humans have abandoned the planet and plan to return when Earth is once again habitable. WALL-ET's eternal job is to clean the rubbish one cube at a time. He has done this so long he has constructed cubed junk towers and pyramids. During his eons-long existence he has accrued enough sentience to collect discarded items like a packrat, watch a time-worn 'Hello Dolly' videocassette (what, no DVD?)and to befriend the only living thing left, a surprisingly appealing cockroach (although given their legendary durability, WALL-ET should have had thousands of cockroach friends).The first, rough third of the movie silently records WALL-ET's bleak daily grind. The second third of the movie depicts WALL-ET's encounter with a 'feminine' robotic scout from a reconnaissance ship. Named EVE, her job is to scan Earth for any signs of vegetative life. At first, WALL-ET and EVE's encounters and courtship is tentative and perilous, as EVE basically regards WALL-ET as a hostile enemy good only for shooting and WALL-ET timorously tries to make friends with her. EVE eventually warms up to WALL-ET when he shows her a plant he has transferred to an old shoe (for me, this was a poignant moment that asserted that life will always find a way no matter what). She appropriates the plant to take back to the mothership, the Axiom, for analysis. Upon analysis, the Axiom will determine that it is time to return home with its cargo of dispossessed human passengers.So, for the first two-thirds of the movie I was quietly charmed by stark, photorealistic scenery and themes of loneliness, abandonment, contact, human profligacy, and corporate greed (Buy & Large being the corporate villain - clever name! By and Large, buy and enlarge, get it?) Pixar is our 'American anime' with its meticulous rendition of mechanical and non-organic characters. However, in the third and final act, when WALL-ET follows his new friend EVE to the Axiom, that same 'American anime' showcases the same weakness as its Japanese counterpart - goofy-looking, grotesque humanoids.The Axiom resembles an ultra-modern space cruise ship that caters to everyone's need. However, the passengers have been at space so long (700 years) that they have regressed into flabby beanbags with appendages. They need hoverchairs to get around. WALL-ET encounters both mechanical and human obstacles on his way to meet EVE again, and the overall chase is fun. Yet, the problem I found with the movie at this point is that although nominally the hero, WALL-ET, for all his appeal and pluck, is eclipsed by EVE and the Axiom's captain, just as Bilbo Baggins was eclipsed by more colorful characters in 'The Hobbit'. The captain's struggles against his ship's computer AUTO, and his own physical inertia take precedence. Even when our little reluctant hero sacrifices himself to save the Axiom a la ET, he is still eclipsed. Of course, EVE saves him with the spare parts WALL-ET has amassed on Earth, and the captain manages to bring the passengers back to Earth for recolonization. Uplifting as this ending is, it seemed too pat and abrupt for me.Nevertheless, 'WALL-ET' is much more than a sensationalistic thrill ride and the adventures of the obligatory cute robot seeking companionship. It is also an ultimately somber and disconcerting testimony to conspicuous excess and wretched consumption, which it took a dedicated trash compactor to point out.",8,1,2,12 August 2010
Rango," Nondescript Chameleon Stumbles into his Karma in the Shabby, Parched Satirical West – Some Random Remarks
","1. The above is one synopsis of 'Rango''s plot.2. Speaking of which, will Culture Club's 'Karma Chameleon' make it onto the soundtrack?3. Some moviegoers will have a blast spotting the cornucopia of movie references 'Rango' throws at us, particularly 'Blazing Saddles'. The Star Wars Tatooine saloon scenes, 'The Road Warrior', 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade', and even 'Kung Fu Panda' also come to mind. However,there is another movie from which 'Rango' borrows its premise which I bet nobody ever considered: 'Flushed Away' (except the danger there is too much water, not the lack of same). Check it out on IMDb, and you'll see why.4. If you have young children, instead of 'Rango', where they'll probably fidget, yawn, and whine, take them home and pop SpongeBob Squarepants's 'Pest of the West' episode into the DVD player instead. Same boisterous 'Rango' premise, but much more attention-grabbing.5. In that vein the PG-rating is too lenient. I would elevate it to PG-13 for mature themes, killings, scatological humor, and risqué references. Smart, sophisticated, irreverent moviegoers who appreciate intelligent, polysyllabic, sizzling word play will probably get the most out of 'Rango'. Stoned people, too, though of course I don't advocate this. It will probably be extremely popular at college campus film festivals in the near future.6. Most of the time, Sheriff Rango (Johnny Depp) seems to channeling the late Don Knotts's Barney Fife, or Knotts's character in 'The Shakiest Gun in the West'.7. Yep, the cinematography is even more realistic-looking than that of 'Wall-E'.8. With its menagerie of mangy, unsightly desert critters, 'Rango' seemed to be shooting for a gross-out 'Ren and Stimpy' or 'The Misadventures of Flapjack' vibe.9. I went to see 'Rango' with my mom. She liked 'Rango's' theme of ultimately accepting responsibility. 'But, Mom', I said, 'you were asleep for half the movie!' 'That's okay, I was awake for the climax (the showdown with Rattlesnake Jake), the important part.' 10. By the way, Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy) was my favorite character in the movie. Imposing, malevolent, intimidating, he was like a venomous anaconda. Ironically, he humiliatingly and mercilessly exposes Rango's phony lawman stunt and forces him into temporary, suicidal exile, where he has an epiphany.11. As for the gigantic eye in the tunnel, it was either a heat-induced hallucination or a reference to the 1998 version of 'Godzilla'.12. Now, did I enjoy the movie? Generally, I did because it was ambitious, whip-smart, engrossing to look at, and lively. However, it was also derivative, meandering, a bit self-conscious in its humor, and sometimes difficult to hear. Still, it was worth the $6.25 I paid.P.S.: I think Rango should team up with the gecko in those Geico commercials.",7,0,1,11 March 2011
Prometheus," Lack of Professional (Star Trek) Discipline Prevents 'Prometheus' from Reaching Greatness
","Yes, I'm late to the party. This would-be science-fiction epic has already garnered over 3,100 Amazon.com reviews with little danger of abating. Therefore, I'm probably adding no new insights into 'Prometheus'. This review most likely adheres to the criticism most 1-, 2-, and even 3-star reviews have already observed: 'The movie is just about flawless technically, cinematographically, and conceptually, but juvenile and superficial (for the most part) in character creation and motivation.' Arthur J. Bullock's Question and Answer format Amazon.com review has already ingeniously encapsulated my and many others' views of logic lapses in 'Prometheus'. So, what's left to say? Well, I guess I'll just basically summarize the aforementioned logic lapses with the opinion that the Prometheus crew's lack of professional discipline grievously hinders the movie.Contrary to what others believed, I felt that the numerous cave carvings outlining the Engineers' frequent visits to Earth ostensibly to initiate life were sufficient incentive to organize an outer space expedition to contact these progenitors (even if they DID look like albino bodybuilders). What irked me was the unlikelihood that a private corporation would be permitted, or even have the resources, to attempt this interstellar flight. I would have thought that searching for humanity's origins should be a paramount international matter. And yet somehow the wizened, apparently deceased Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, looking like Goldmember from the third Austin Powers movie) has scraped together a trillion dollars for the half-baked purpose of going to the Engineers' solar system to somehow find an elixir of youth and immortality. Even more baffling, instead of amassing the crème de la crème of biologists, geologists, archaeologists, and other -ologists, Weyland decided to select the motliest of crews for this little space trip. With the exception of the competent, devout but intellectually curious, and surprisingly scrappy Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and the near-infallible but disregarded and even faintly malevolent and enigmatic android David (Michael Fassbender), the crew is an unorganized joke.In actual charge of the gargantuan 'Prometheus' vessel is the sinister, irritable icicle Meredith Vickers, with a gradually revealed connection to Weyland. The rugged, capable Captain Janek (Idris Elba) is reduced to being a passive spaceship chauffeur. Dr. Shaw's colleague and love interest Dr. Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) is cocky, brash, unkempt, and unwisely disdainful of David. Rounding out this ragtag gallery is the really unprincipled doofus duo Fifield (Sean Harris) the geologist and Millburn (Rafe Spall) the biologist, who turn out to be the equivalent of the 'red shirt' officers in Star Trek. What a bunch of winners! No Prometheus crew member - not even Dr. Shaw or David - follows any kind of protocol or discipline, military or otherwise. They seemingly act as if they're on some pleasure cruise, with time to play pool, swig vodka, make bets, and make love. Captain Janek occasionally and vainly issues orders. Usually he's idly staring at the schematic of the Engineer cavern stronghold on moon LV-223 or playing his squeezebox. Everyone else does whatever the hell they want without supervision, including Dr. Shaw's do-it-yourself Caesarean to extract a squid fetus. Therefore, it's relatively easy for David to explore the cavern, decipher the hieroglyphics, get samples of the Engineers' DNA ooze, and 'vengefully' start the mutation havoc onboard the ship. Again, I recommend you read Mr. Bullock's review to get an outline of the genetic blunders the crew foolishly unleashes upon themselves that utterly unravels the mission for almost everyone.Watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking that, for all the time-worn techno-prattle and tired, corny humanistic themes, the Star Trek crew (whether Captain Kirk's or Picard's) would have handled the momentous events on LV-223 more professionally and competently. Certainly some crew members would have been infected and even killed, but the main characters would have thoroughly analyzed the terrain, the Engineer corpses, the caverns, and the pods before going into action. The crew would also have heeded any information from Spock or Data and acted appropriately. Furthermore, the Star Trek crew would have had time to address evolutionary, theological, and even ethical implications of the missions meaningfully. Star Trek naval discipline would have made more epochal discoveries about the Engineers without blowing up their ship. But then again, this discipline would have bored some Ridley Scott or 'Alien' fans who wanted their icky snake/squid/slimy tentacle thingie fix.What a waste of a evolutionary/theological vision! Dr. Shaw is practically the only Prometheus member still curious about the Engineers. Others, like the doomed Dr. Holloway, thought that the revelation of the human/Engineer 100% genetic matchup solved the problem - Humanity comes from Engineers. Dr. Shaw perceptively retorts 'Who made the Engineers?' The mystery continues, and only she and David's head are still around to pursue it (in the Prometheus sequel). Perhaps the sequel will also answer the questions 1) Are the Engineers attempting to correct their run-amok planetary DNA sowing, including that of Earth's?, 2)What did David say to infuriate the resuscitated, murderous Engineer?, 3) Where is the 'Neck-Pillow Shaped' Engineer spaceship escaping to?, 4) Can Dr. Shaw and David follow them in another 'Neck-Pillow Shaped' spaceship?, 5) Can Dr. Shaw really trust David? 6) How will the surprisingly humanoid xenomorph emerging at the end of the film figure in all this? Whatever the 'Prometheus' sequel holds in store, I hope Dr. Shaw and David encounter a space crew that has more in common with the discipline, philosophy, and mentality of 'Star Trek' than that of 'Friday the 13th'.",6,4,6,24 April 2013
Straight Outta Compton," Rap Movie Adds Sobering Dimensions to Standard 'Rise and Fall' Music Biography
","Country star Alan Jackson (I think) once remarked that the music genre 'rap' should have a 'C' in front of it. Besides that, many of us, including myself, have disregarded rap as ear- splitting, cacophonic nonsense. Although I will never become a rap fan, the movie 'Straight Outta Compton' (hereafter 'Compton') successfully demonstrated to me that rap is far more intricate, potent, and meaningful than its harsh, raw surface suggests, because a strong core of societal hardship and shrewd sense of injustice often powers it. Furthermore, 'Compton' dazzlingly reveals that rap can give an intense, hard-to-ignore voice to an entire teenage generation of all races and ethnicities that has been fearfully silent for too long.'Compton' chronicles the progress of five African-American friends Eric 'Eazy-E' (Jason Mitchell), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson, Jr.), Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), and DJ Yella (Neil Brown, Jr.) as they endure life in Compton, CA's run-down suburbs. There, police tanks demolishing cocaine dens, gang leaders threatening schoolbuses full of kids just for calling out to them, and hostile cops trampling 1st Amendment and civil rights with impunity in their zeal to racially profile and harass groups of kids are just tolerated facts of life. However, instead of resorting to crime or joining/forming a gang, these high school guys decide to combine their DJing, lyric writing, and harmonizing skills to form the rap group N.W.A. (N-word With Attitude). Under N.W.A. these young musicians hope to educate the world about their pain and sufferings, especially in a way the current musical trend, R & B ballads and slow jams championed by dance hall owner Alonzo Williams (Corey Reynolds) just can't do.N.W.A., led by Eazy-E, seems to touch a nerve with their musical audience as their song 'Boyz-n-the Hood' becomes a hit. This success attracts the attention of Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) who, sensing a new musical trend, convinces the group to let him be their business and contract manager. Under Jerry's seemingly parental tutelage, N.W.A gets represented by Priority Records and turns out the giant hit album 'Straight Outta Compton'. N.W.A. surges to fame, fortune, and every pleasure money can buy.Nevertheless, many factors conspire to impede, splinter, or stop the group. Because of obscene, militant, anti-authority lyrics, especially in their searing anthem 'F-k the Police', N.W.A. runs afoul of not only their old foes the local police, but also even the F.B.I. Due to their negotiating inexperience, N.W.A. trusts Jerry to stand up for them and get them the gigs. But Jerry has a more unscrupulous side. Because Eazy-E trusts him most, Jerry immediately gets contracts signings for him while the rest of the group waits. Jerry is also less than democratic in ensuring that each N.W.A. member gets his cut of the profits while he himself embezzles more than his fair share. Disgusted, Ice Cube leaves N.W.A. to forge a solo rap career. Ice Cube and N.WA. become fierce (and humorous) rivals as they try to out-insult and 'out-diss' each other in their song outputs. Seeking more artistic freedom, Dr. Dre also leaves N.W.A. and hooks up with rapper Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) to create Death Row Records. While the partnership proves productive ('The Chronic' album, mentoring up-and- coming rapper Snoop Dogg (Keith Stanfield) and Tupac Shakur (Marc Rose)), Knight also proves to be a violent tyrant. Debt, sibling deaths, family strife, car accidents, and the specter of AIDS also hover over N.W.A. Can the group keep it together?Without a doubt, 'Compton' follows the 'Musical Rags to Riches' trajectory closely and indulges in some of its excesses (e.g. scantily clad and nude party goers, hotel and studio trashings, marijuana dealings). However, the movie succeeds in not glorifying these wretched excesses and showing that N.W.A really worked strenuously for their success, especially in the scene when Dr. Dre dares to chew out Knight and his hanger-ons for partying too much and not working hard enough. 'Compton' also details quite well the exploitative realities of the music business through Jerry Heller. Heller may have been a cheating sleaze, but he also convinces us that he cared for N.W.A.'s members and DID help them reach the top. Any other music agent would probably have ripped them off more, and cheated them out of more. 'Compton' also manages to portray N.W.A. three-dimensionally as people who are certainly not saints and swear a lot and certainly have their vices, but who are fundamentally decent, industrious, and caring of each other. Other posters have said that 'Compton' has sanitized and softened N.W.A.'s image (e.g. Dr. Dre. was a misogynist in real life), but then again no movie biography, music or otherwise, tells the whole truth. Anyway, 'Compton' was close- enough-to-life raw enough for me, while vividly and entertainingly proving to me that rap is a legitimate way to 'fight the power' without sacrificing your soul.",8,4,30,11 September 2015
The Croods," Croo-oods! Meet the Croo-oods! An Off-Beat Stone-Age Family!
","Actually, the eponymous family in Dreamworks' 'The Croods' doesn't really have all that much in common with the Flintstones. For example, they don't have the Flintstones' primitive technological conveniences like the Flintmobile. The Croods don't even have primitive weapons like spears and clubs, and sometimes they even run on all fours like gorillas or chimpanzees. What's worse, they live in an otherworldly, dangerous prehistoric environment that makes 'Jumanji' look like a petting zoo. Therefore, in a way, you really can't blame burly Crood father/leader Grug (voice of Nicolas Cage) for being maniacally preoccupied with keeping his family safe.This bunch of pre-Neanderthals - Grug's wife Ugga (voice of Catherine Keener), slow-witted and klutzy middle son Thunk (Clark Duke), fierce and animalistic toddler daughter Sandy (voice of Randy Thom), caustic Gran (voice of Cloris Leachman), and especially independent-minded elder daughter Eep (voice of Emma Stone) - are all agile, swift and strong fighters. Even so, the Croods are so cautious and fearful that they venture out into the wild only long enough to forage for food (as in the energetic keep-away/football game they play with a wild bird-type to capture its egg toward the film's start). Then, it's off to the safety of the cave, with a boulder door to keep the beasts out. Following Grug's motto of 'Life is fear, all the time', the family even sleeps curled up in a ball for mutual safety. Except for teenage daughter Eep, who increasingly resents her family's lack of daring, curiosity, and eagerness to explore and learn.One night, breaking curfew, Eep literally runs into a good-looking Cro-Magnon type named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and his all-purpose miniature sloth Belt (voice of Chris Sanders). Though somewhat inferior to Eep in power and athletic prowess, Guy is inventive, self-reliant, and keen on learning new things. All of Guy's qualities attract Eep to him, although Guy is a bit put-off by Eep's rough and yes, crude, manner. But Guy really doesn't have a choice; Eep brings Guy to meet the fam, who manage to appall Guy even more. Grug is equally unimpressed and a bit wary of Guy in turn, not only because of a budding relationship with Eep, but also because Guy's intelligent and adventuresome boldness reflects badly on Grug's ignorant timidity. Taken aback, Guy at first tries to leave.But natural, seismic upheavals and the terrain change caused by Pangea's splintering force Guy and the Croods to work together to cross the treacherous landscape to find a new home. Can Guy's ideas and experience coupled with the Croods' brawn and agility get them through? Can Grug surmount his shortcomings to help his family get through? Will Grug realize - as Eep and Guy do - that courage as well as exposure to new ideas will help them not only survive, but also prosper? 'The Croods' answers these questions with an unexpected blend of knockabout slapstick, sharp but not harsh verbal humor (not even the death fantasies Grug harbors for his mother-in law Gran), and relevant life lessons about survival, facing your inhibitions, maturing, using both strength and intelligence to move ahead and expand your horizons. Therefore, 'The Croods' will probably enthrall all family members, from fidgety toddlers to thoughtful, sophisticated adults, as they watch the Croods, especially stick-in-the-mud Grug, tackle the challenge of evolution in all senses of the word.",8,0,0,10 September 2013
Monsters University," Even though It's A Prequel, 'Monsters University' Continues to Surprise Us With Profound Insights
","Like 'Monsters, Inc.', 'Monsters University' (MU) won't win any recognition for its originality. Relating the tale of the first encounter between all-eye green cyclops Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and blue, hulking, bear-like James 'Sully' Sullivan (John Goodman) at the titular institute of higher 'scare' learning, MU cribs all over the place. As other posters have noticed, MU borrows fragments of other college-themed movies like 'Animal House', the Harry Potter movie heptology (seven films), and even a smidgen of 'Back to School'. Most tellingly, however, MU is heavily in debt to 'The Hunger Games', since the meets held to determine which monster fraternities will be eliminated from the prestigious 'scare curriculum' and even from the university take up the bulk of the film. MU robustly and hilariously satirizes the aspects of college and frat life you would expect, but later reveals unexpected insights about the limits of desire, determination, and knowledge, and learning what your true place in the world is.'Monsters, Inc.' focused largely on Sully. This time, in MU, Mike is mostly in the spotlight. We first see him as an appealing schoolkid (voiced by Noah Johnston) with huge aspirations to become a top scarer at the scare factory. Little Mike is sharp enough, and studious enough in...'scareology'... I guess to earn a place at the university. However, he faces two tough obstacles. One, although Mike may have nailed the cerebral, technical aspects of scaring, he may not really be inherently scary. Two, the imperious and disdainful Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), a cross between a dragon, a praying mantis, and a centipede, candidly and harshly tells Mike he is not a scarer.There may be a third obstacle. Sully is also attending the university, but he is literally a goof-off party animal because he thinks his family 'scaring' pedigree will get him through. So obviously, and perhaps predictably, Mike and Sully aren't friends at first sight. At first, they're not even dorm mates (at least that cliché is avoided for a while); Mike is first paired with Randall 'Randy' Boggs, the later reptilian invisible monster in 'Monsters, Inc.' That soon changes as an assembly mishap involving a cherished scare canister forces the irate Dean to eject Mike and Sully from the 'scare curriculum' and pair them off as opposite roommates at the unpopular Oozma Kappa (OK) fraternity.OKs members are middle-aged squid-like former salesmonster Don (Joel Murry), the bickering two-headed Terri/Terry (Sean Hayes/Dave Foley), the five-eyed Flounder-like Scott (Peter Sohn), and ex-con elbow-macaroni shaped Art (Charlie Day). Even though OK is kinda nerdy and non-scary, Mike convinces the Dean to allow the OK frat to compete in the 'Scare Games'; if they survive the games, all of OKs members stay in the scare curriculum; if they don't survive, Mike, and perhaps Sully will be sent packing. Will OK be OK enough to do it? Will Mike and Sully realize their 'scare dreams'? Again, on the surface, MU plays with the framework of the college/fraternity movie and seems to be going where you think it's going. But MU is somewhat surprisingly subtler and deeper than that. It suggests that drive, persistence, hard work and book knowledge are good things to have, but do not necessarily take you where you want to go. Sometimes serendipity intervenes and shows you your true path in life (it's a 'Mr. Holland's Opus' thing). Also, those same qualities alone may not predict success; additional qualities such as cunning, cleverness, and 'misdirection' can come in handy. MU also suggests that even the most outwardly self-assured people hide reservoirs of self-doubt and fear. However, teamwork and mental focus can overcome those fears and perform amazing feats than no one person can hope to achieve. Most importantly, MU demonstrates that failure can be the steppingstones to ultimate triumph. We know from 'Monsters, Inc.' that Mike and Sully succeeded in getting jobs at the 'scare' factory. MU shows the surprising steppingstones they took to get there.",10,5,8,3 July 2013
Space Jam," Looney Update of Hanna-Barbera's 'Harlem Globetrotters' has the right 'Secret Stuff'
","As some of you may recall, during the '70s on Saturday morning, Hanna-Barbera's 'Harlem Globetrotters' would dribble onto the airwaves. Led by Meadowlark Lemon (voice of Scatman Crothers), and Granny, the team lived up to its name, traveling the world and taking on the weirdest, most unconventional, and often the most unscrupulous basketball teams - hillbillies, circus performers, surfers, bodybuilders, you name it. Each cartoon would climax with a wild basketball game that stomped all over NBA rules. In the first half, the Globetrotters would be handed their heads; in the second half, they always managed to get their groove together and trounce the opposing team.'Space Jam' (hereafter SJ) is largely a Looney Tune, live-action-animation-mix update of those Globetrotter cartoons. Michael Jordan (wisely playing his rational composed self) is kidnapped from the natural world by Bugs and Daffy in a desperate bid to whip the seemingly hopeless Toon Squad into a viable basketball team against the intimidating Monstars. The Monstars were originally the miniscule minions (called Nerdlucks) of a ruthless cigar-chewing mobster type (voiced by Danny DeVito) ordered to shanghai the Looneys as enslaved entertainers for an amusement park called Moron Mountain on a distant planet. Bugs cons the little Nerdlucks into a basketball game, thinking it would be easy to defeat them and keep their freedom. But the Nerdlucks siphon off the basketball skills of NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and Charles Barkeley to become the Monstars. Uh-oh. Can Jordan (in the Meadowlark role) help the Looneys win? After the critical/popular triumph of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit', SJ at first glance appears to be a shabby, cynical rip-off using Jordan's (and Bugs's) starpower to make a quick profit. While not quite up there technically or thematically with 'Roger Rabbit', SJ is quite diverting, funny, and even bitingly satirical in its own right. Even before the wacky basketball game begins, SJ sustains riffs on athletic fame, greedy sports franchises, athletes' moral behavior, and even Jordan himself, especially his ill-advised foray into baseball. All the Looney Tunes, from Marvin the Martian to Bugs (to even lesser-known 'toons like Sniffles the mouse), get their chance to be sharply humorous. The human co-stars, including Wayne Knight and Bill Murray ('I didn't know Dan Ackroyd was in this picture!') as Toon Squad substitutes, acquit themselves well with their limited screen time. The game itself, free-wheeling as it is, is actually quite exciting and well-executed as Jordan interacts with the multi-colored Monstars.SJ even has some moral uplift. Predictably, the Toon Squad is literally being crushed by their brutal opponents during the first half. Even Jordan's pep talk is futile; it puts the Looneys to sleep. Bugs comes to the rescue with some 'Jordan's Secret Stuff', a liquid that puts fire back into the team. Later, as the 'Secret Stuff' is used up, the 'toons learn that it was really just water, and that they had the ability to play the game all along (take that, Dumbo!). But the game is at the wire, with the Squad down by one point. Can Jordan make the winning basket? Maybe, if he can channel his inner Toon (now Bugs tells him!).SJ is surprisingly satisfying entertainment that makes the extra effort to ensure that Looney Tunes, Jordan, and basketball aficionados -and even many of the rest of us- have a good time.",8,3,4,17 July 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Glorious and Gloriously Preposterous,'Thor: The Dark World' Makes Armageddon Both Dire and Fun
","Successful depictions of mythological tales embrace both their grandeur and bizarre but entertaining illogic. Marvel Comics' 'Thor' recognized this, as did the original 'Thor' movie, and now its more cosmic, world-spanning sequel, 'Thor: The Dark World' (hereafter 'Thor: DW'). Even though not only Earth (Midgard) but all the Nine Realms of Norse legend including Asgard, abode of the gods, are threatened by an existence-ending 'Dark Side' as embodied by the liquid Aether, 'Thor: DW' manages to intersperse and sprinkle dry, understated, but sharp humorous dialogue and situations throughout its epic tale.This is no trivial feat, since along with the expected warrior battles and clashes and imminent Armageddon (or Ragnarok), 'Thor: DW' deals with forbidden mortal love, latent mortal/deity romantic jealousy, incorrigible and enigmatic siblings, obstinate and imperious fathers, self- sacrificing goddesses, unhinged astronomical geniuses, and charting your own destiny. Within each of these elements 'Thor: DW' explores both their serious and light-hearted sides.Pointy-eared but cruelly saturnine Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), the Dark Elves' leader seeks the Aether to bring back the darkness they need to live and extinguish the hated brilliance of Asgard and the other worlds. The Asgardians, led by Thor wielding his enchanted hammer Mjolnir, have managed to wrest the Aether from the Dark Elves and hidden it within what they think is a totally unexpected place. However, astrophysicist and Thor's mortal love interest Jane Porter, incensed by the Thunder God's long absence, attempts to locate a dimensional portal in order to contact him again. Concealed within a London warehouse district, she finds not only the portal, but the Aether as well. The Aether possesses her.Malekith, with the brutal assistance of the ape-like juggernaut (no, not that Juggernaut) Algrim/Kurse, has sought to recover the Aether for over 5,000 years and use it for universal darkness once the Nine Realms are linearly aligned. Realizing that Jane has now become the Aether's vessel, Thor transports her to Asgard in an initial attempt to protect her from Malekith. Nevertheless, Malekith, Algrim, and the Dark Elf armada of dagger-shaped ships soon breach even Asgard's seemingly-impervious defenses.Against the edicts of the Lord of Asgard and Thor's father Odin (Anthony Hopkins), Thor decides that instead of remaining besieged behind Asgard's fortress, he will take Jane to true safety in an obscure dimension. To do this, he must free and make an uncertain Faustian alliance with the God of Deceit and Evil, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), imprisoned in an Asgardian dungeon for crimes he committed in the 'Avengers' movie. To buy time for the escape, Thor asks the omniscient, all-sensing Guardian of Asgard Heimdall(Idris Elba) to risk treason by running interference for him. And so 'Thor: DW' boils down to whether Thor can save Jane and the Nine Realms (including Earth) from Malekith and the Aether.Yep, these are literally deadly serious issues the movie is dealing with. But with effortless skill, 'Thor: DW' sees the inherent overwrought silliness of it all and gently teases and prods it without diminishing the importance of these issues. For example, Thor faces a towering, Goliath stone creature in a scene that might remind you of Indiana Jones and the swordsman in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. As another example, to help the jailbreak along, Loki transforms himself and Thor into various figures including an out-of-left field patriotic one. Back on Earth, Jane's brash intern Darcy (Kat Dennings) sardonically and bemusedly comments on the wild proceedings when the Thor/Malekith battle spills over onto Midgard. Jane's oddball but enthusiastic mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, committed for streaking at Stonehenge, has nevertheless seemed to discover a gravity-shifting device that might avert the alignment, provided Darcy and her own callow but cute intern can get him out of the mental hospital. Finally, loved all the dimension-hopping and throwaway critters, especially in the very last scene.The humor also makes 'Thor:DW' more relatable even to people who are not Thor or Norse mythology aficionados and fans. Without it (and without the introductory exposition) at the movie's beginning, newcomers might be at a bit of a loss as to who these outlandish characters are and what the heck they're fighting for. They might not know who grim Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), dashing Fandral (Zachary Levi), voluminous Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), or the stunning Sif (Jaime Alexander) are, but they know about romantic entanglements (Sif gives Jane such a stare), a son's duty to a father (Thor in Odin's shadow), and perseverance in finding the hidden bravery and self-sacrifice of a previously selfish and treacherous brother (Loki's helping Thor defend Jane), and finding the courage to blaze your own trail in life (Thor resolving to stay with Jane on Earth). Therefore, 'Thor:DW' manages the neat trick of making Armageddon not only foreboding but also satisfyingly enjoyable. 4.5 starsP.S.: 'Thor:DW' is a self-contained story in and of itself, even if you haven't seen the first 'Thor' movie. But I heartily recommend you see the first movie, and watch the credits of this movie, because they continue Thor's story and raise doubts about Loki's reformation, AND connect to a broader Avengers story line involving some powerful stones. Verily, Thor will return.",9,1,1,26 October 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Force Awakens – A Winning Combination of 'A New Hope' and a 'Newer Hope'
","The plot of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' (hereafter 'SW:TFA') is as follows – a group of freedom fighters must escort a beeping 'droid containing information which may be a critical key in defeating an enemy bent on universal conquest. Golly gee, this sounds an awful lot like 'Star Wars IV: A New Hope', doesn't it? Some 'SW:TFA' viewers have grumbled about director J.J. Abrams pulling this 'moth-eaten' plot out of the closet. I think it's a stroke of nostalgic craftiness.Perhaps Abrams sensed that after the arguably grim, depressing, and disheartening trilogy about the descent of Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vaderism, moviegoers needed a bit of reminding about why we still cherish the 'Star Wars' saga/myth. As has been said countless times before, it's not really about the light saber play, spaceship dogfights, or dazzling universal vistas that make this space opera timeless – it's the flawed, complicated, empathetic characters (whether human, 'droid, or alien) who strive to be heroic and/or struggle with corrupt impulses. With this reminder, Abrams (a life-long 'Star Wars' fan) and 'SW:TFA' reawaken 'Star Wars''s greatness.Abrams borrows the 'A New Hope' plot, but does not slavishly copy it. He adds his own distinctive touches to move the old 'A New Hope' plot into a 'Newer Hope' plot. First, he immediately jumps into action by showing former Empire (now known as the First Order) Stormtroopers attacking a Rebel Alliance (now known as the Resistance) outpost on the desert Tatooine-like planet Jakku. The Stormtroopers are seeking the new 'droid' unit containing the secret information: BB-8, who looks like a beach ball with a salad bowl for a head. Ace Resistance pilot, the Hans-Solo like Poe Dameron ('Do you talk first, or do I talk first?') inserted the information disk into BB-8. Poe urges the spherical droid to flee into the desert wasteland and somehow locate former Princess (now Resistance General) Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher).But then, another radically new development (and character) appears. One of the Stormtroopers is suddenly reluctant to continue massacring the Resistance outpost. He doesn't even have a proper name, until Poe finds him and christens him Finn (John Boyega). Poe and Finn attempt to escape in an X-Wing fighter but a New Order pilot shoots them down. They crashland back on Jakku and Poe disappears into some kind of vortex. The confused, battle-weary Finn stumbles around Jakku until he finds BB-8 with 'SW:FKA''s third original character, Rey (Daisy Ridley).Like a Jawa, the orphaned, solitary, self-reliant Rey scavenges Jakku for scrap metal to trade for food. She is on the verge of trading in BB-8, but senses the 'droid is much too valuable. Rey, BB-8, and Finn form a hasty trio and run desperately for transport to get away from the First Order forces. They have to settle for the bucket of bolts that happens to be the Millennium Falcon (remember her?). They manage to escape, largely because of Rey's uncanny command of mechanics and technological devices. Before long, they run into the Falcon's original owner, our favorite intergalactic wiseguy, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his hirsute co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew).Mostly, Han is still the devil-may-care, humorously irreverent smuggler still being chased by vengeful customers, as he is in 'SW:TFA'. And yet, the grizzled veteran has mellowed somewhat; he now believes in the Force more and agrees to help Rey and Finn with their mission. After deciphering BB-8's data as a portion of a map, Han and company all escape to the Endor-like forest planet Takodana to seek a wizened, wise cantina owner Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) who can connect them to the Resistance.The First Order, nominally led by the merciless General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) but ultimately controlled by the towering Emperor-like Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis), track them there and attack. General Leia and her Resistance forces also arrive and counterattack. Maz reveals that Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill's) light saber is hidden in the cantina and entrusts Finn with it. However, Finn wants no further part of the Resistance/First Order war and seeks asylum with other aliens. Meanwhile, Rey shows signs that she would be a more appropriate recipient of the light saber. She shows strange abilities and powers far beyond fixing things. Nevertheless, the First Order captures and imprisons her. The First Order's chief warrior, a fallen, iron-masked, Jedi Knight with anger-management issues named Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) attempts to seduce Rey to The Dark Side on a new, gargantuan Death Star about 100 times the original's size. Han, Chewie, and a re-converted Finn mount a rescue. Do they succeed? Is Rey truly Jedi material? Who is she anyway, and, for that matter, who is Finn? Who are Kylo's parents? Where is the rest of the map and what does it show? Do C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) show up? Did Poe survive the vortex? Just where the hell is Luke, assuming he's still alive? Why is he missing? 'SW:TFA' answers some of these myriad questions and mysteries and leaves others tantalizingly up in the air, for future sequels.'SW:TFA' is, in my opinion, a thorough triumph. It's hyperspeed-paced yet clear and comprehensible. All the characters are serious yet funny and not trapped in self-importance. In fact, the otherwise bold, appealing, and resourceful Rey and Finn are somewhat reluctant heroes, but still game for the danger the First Order represents. Unforeseen, genuinely shocking and emotional confrontations occur. Most importantly, 'SW:TFA' takes the old, seemingly rusty and time-worn elements that distinguish 'Star Wars' and makes them new, fresh, exciting, and more relevant than ever. The eighth sequel can't arrive fast enough.The Force is indeed awake and a 'Newer Hope' (embodied by Rey, Finn, and BB) for the Resistance is born.",10,4,30,31 December 2015
Godzilla," Finally, Finally, FINALLY! A Godzilla (and Godzilla Movie) to Be Proud Of!
","As I have written in my Amazon.com review of 'Pacific Rim', I had always keenly wished for a mega-million, state-of-the-art, blockbuster treatment of the legendary lizard. And boy, is this 2014 spectacular rendition of 'Godzilla' ever IT! To put it succinctly, I think Gareth Edwards and company succeeded in rescuing Godzilla from the emasculating abyss of chintzy camp and restoring him to his mighty symbolic status as not only a nuclear, near-supernatural, vengeful force of nature, but also, ironically enough, of natural, balanced harmony.In other words 'Godzilla 2014' first pays respectful, meticulous homage to the 1954 (cult) classic and then expands the lizard's mythic status. As in the original, to the likely dismay of attention-deficit sufferers, Godzilla wisely doesn't pop onto the screen full-blown right away. At the beginning of the film, we merely get a sepia-toned photographic glimpse of his scaly back towering above the waves as the product of World War II nuclear deployment. We soon move forward to an apparent nuclear accident at the Janjira nuclear plant where nuclear physicist and engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) works. Like in at least some Toho Godzilla productions, Joe assumes the role of the 'Cassandra scientist', which is a scientist who really knows what's going on, but can't convince other, skeptical scientists, government officials, or anyone else of the truth until it's too late.Yes, the plant does emit nuclear radiation, enough to claim the lives of several radiation specialists, including Joe's nobly self-sacrificing wife Sandra (Juliette Binoche) who fiercely urges the tearful Joe to seal the breach so that the contamination doesn't spread. At first, plant officials seem merely to want to cover-up a run-of-the mill nuclear disaster. But Joe eventually convinces his initially disbelieving son Navy Lieutenant Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) that something even more threatening is looming. The power-plant radius has no lethal radiation whatsoever. Also, during the accident, Joe picks up electromagnetic pulses of biological origin, almost as if two creatures are communicating. As the movie ominously and deliberately progresses, the monstrously REAL truth literally comes out. Within the quarantined plant, some weird cocoon has absorbed the ambient nuclear energy. It eventually hatches and a tremendous 'Alien'-like/praying mantis-like insectoid thing goes on its destructive march - and flight (it has wings). With the knowledgeable help of Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe), who seems to know a lot about these monster matters, the U.S. military eventually determines that the big bug male is flying toward a rendezvous with its wingless mate, which was incubating thousands of larva at a nuclear waste containment facility in Nevada. She breaks out impressively as well.Okay, it's time for Godzilla to show up, and when he does, people, honest to goodness, I was just overwhelmed! Magnificent! He intercepts the winged male in Honolulu for a relatively brief but devastating tussle. The winged male escapes somehow and continues toward his rendezvous. The military determines that the three 'things' will converge in San Francisco where at least a contained nuclear detonation in San Francisco harbor should take care of all three, right. But as Dr. Serizawa reminds them, these creatures thrive on nuclear energy (even though the blast itself MAY kill them). Furthermore, he says that it is just possible that the lizard monster is mankind's only hope for salvation and that it may be better to just 'let them fight.' Oh boy, do they ever fight! The humans somewhat predictably recede a little into the background, although Ford resourcefully and heroically does his best to evacuate San Francisco, discover and destroy the insectoids' brood, help detonate the nuclear missile, and return to his family. We may have had to wade through some exposition, mystery, and set-up to get to the battle royal, but I think it was certainly worth the wait. There's no 1998 'Zilla' here. Godzilla's got all the goods, and he'll need them, because the insectoids are both formidable, ferocious enemies. What's the outcome? I heartily suggest you see this for yourself.'Godzilla 2014' through its measured, solemn, deliberate pace re-establishes the 'Lizard King'. It's an infinitely satisfying monster mash, to be sure, but it also manages to allude to mankind's destructive tendencies and its presumption to tame nature, rather than realize that it is at nature's whim, as Dr. Serizawa comments. And it even suggests that while Godzilla seems to side with the humans, that could be a tenuous alliance. Toho, Godzilla, 'Pacific Rim', and monster movie fans should gobble up 'Godzilla 2014'. Others, like my Amazon.com friend and prolific reviewer Andrew Ellington may understandably and reasonably dismiss it as crazy, stupid fun, as he did in his 'Pacific Rim' review. Nevertheless, for its genre, Godzilla is INTELLIGENT, rational, crazy, stupid fun!",10,3,8,20 May 2014
Fantastic Four," The Movie's Only True Shortcoming is -- Shortness
","Although I am a reasonably avid Fantastic Four fan, I continually procrastinated in attending a viewing because of the negatively vehement disappointment 'professional' critics and mere mortals have been heaping on it. However, last night Ifinally plucked up enough resolve to go see it. The verdict? My trepidation was basically groundless.The 'Fantastic Four' (hereafter FF) possesses and displays most of the ingredients for an engrossing 'superhero' motion picture: involving story, appealing and sympathetic characters, lavish and largely convincing special effects and set-pieces, an appropriately sinister and amoral antagonist, a complex but nimble plot, and refreshing humor. No, it is not a brooding, tortured, haunted movie in the overwrought 'Batman' mode, nor is it the FF's modus operandi. Apparently Tim Story decided to adhere to the spirit and tone of the original 60's manifestation of the comic book: an exploration of the ultimate nuclear family. The FF's predominant theme is not the power/responsibility inter-dynamic(like Spiderman), or a psychotic obsession with vengeful crimefighting (like Batman). Instead, FF engagingly channels 'Lilo and Stitch''s and Sister Sledge's theme of 'We are family, where nobody gets left behind.Furthermore, despite its light approach, FF is actually a sensible movie. If cosmic storm energy reconfigured your DNA, you wouldn't (or shouldn't) go running off immediately to fight crime. As our colorful quartet, and even Victor von (aka Dr. Doom) wisely do, they medically analyze their new conditions and powers to see if any potentially deleterious side effects may occur. As even the brash and impulsive Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) observes, and I paraphrase, 'Ben seems to be the only one who can't turn his power on and off. What if that happens to us?' Of course, such introspection can be taken to an extreme, as the pensive Reed Richards (aka Mr. Fantastic) (Ioan Gruffudd) amply demonstrates in the movie, as he quarantines his partners and himself in a desperate attempt to reverse the storm's effects. But such cerebral caution characterizes Reed. Anyway, the FF movie provides counterpoint to the foursome's seclusion with Johnny's impetuous and successful desire to 'bust out' and enjoy his incendiary new powers.The FF movie also plausibly and poignantly details the anguish, frustration, and shocked despair Benjamin Jacob Grimm (aka Thing)(Michael Chiklis) searingly evokes. If you found yourself imprisoned in a granite exoskeleton, wouldn't you do what Ben does - literally break out of the hospital facility, conceal your identity, and gingerly attempt to reconnect with your fiancée? Wouldn't you swim in morose self-pity? Ben does these things, but unlike most of us, who would probably go on an insane rampage or attempt to commit suicide, he possesses enough resiliency (Mr. Fantastic isn't the only one) and nobility to try to come to grips with his grotesque fate, even using a little grim (no pun intended) humor to cope. The encounter with the potential bridge jumper and the saving of his, the trucker's and the New York fire department's lives help illuminate this 'brute''s good soul. Victor's unhinged horror at his own parallel titanium transformation further reflects Ben's nobility and deep psychological resources. Chiklis embraces the Thing's character and owns it. A movie with him alone would still definitely be the price of admission.Admittedly, the FF does deviate from realistic behavior. I would agree that Susan Storm (aka the Invisible Woman) (Jessica Alba) does not show a genetic scientist's demeanor, but she is no flighty bimbo either. She is an alluring but sweet, shy, and caring individual. The New York public cotton to the super-powered quartet a little too rapidly and unambiguously. After all, shouldn't they be a bit disturbed at the Brooklyn bridge accident, even if inadvertent? I suppose Ben's rescue of the FDNY firefighters (symbols of 9/11 heroism)helped sway public opinion. Ben's erstwhile fiancé, I don't think, would be so callous as to unceremoniously leave his engagement ring on the bridge after his heroic act. If she really cared for Ben, wouldn't she more discreetly mail it back to him. Finally (spoiler here), how did Ben Grimm, after requiring Victor's electrical boost in the simulation chamber to revert to normal, find the same power in Victor's absence to transform back to the Thing in a -yes- self-sacrificing act to help his friends? It seems a bit too abrupt.Yet, as my summary indicates, abruptness, as I see it, is the FF's only true weakness. The movie is a bit too breezy at times. For example, Ben's encounter with the blind but discerning Alicia Masters (Kerry Washington) could have been developed more at length. Ditto with Reed and Sue's reconciliation. Victor's Anankin-like descent to tenebrous, Darth-like evil needed a bit more flesh. Both the bridge sequence and the climactic battle against Doom were a bit truncated. Nevertheless, my criticisms are mere quibbles.The FF is solidly rousing, accessible, uplifting entertainment, comparable to the original 1978 movie Superman, which, as you recall, also had its share of social and superpower inuring, goofy action sequences, wholesome humor, and broad, cartoonish villains. FF remains faithful to its origins while simultaneously blazing its own comic cinema trail. It has successfully introduced its inimitable clan to the movie world.Now, in the comic, the FF is not only concerned with family, but also with galactic cosmic concerns, a la Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Watchers, the Skrulls, et al. The FF sequels, and I hope there are a few, should address some of these universal themes. 'The Trial of Galactus' storyline would be ideal, and perhaps satisfy the pretentiously persnickety critics who complain that comic themes are too superficial. If FF can correct its 'shortness' problem in subsequent films, it should dramatically prove those critics wrong.As Stan Lee (mailman Willie Lumpkin in the movie) would say:Excelsior!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1",8,1,3,28 July 2005
Aladdin," Is 'Aladdin' Nothing Without the Genie?
","It's hardly a mystery why the 'Aladdin' myth attracted Disney's animation crew back in 1992. This timeless story boasts everything: exotic locales, a scrappy hero, flamboyant characters, opulent royalty, giddy romance, despicable and devious villains, and, most tellingly, the endless possibilities of magic as epitomized by the genie. However, as Disney's animators crafted this dynamic spectacle of a movie, I think they must have been concerned that one of 'Aladdin''s greatest assets -the protean, boundlessly energetic, and fast-talking Genie, as voiced by the inimitable comic pantomiming maelstrom Robin Williams- might ironically turn out to be one of its greatest liabilities. In the Genie, we have a dominating, omnipotent character who can seemingly do anything. So, once Aladdin gets possession of the Genie's lamp, isn't the movie over? Just three wishes, and it's happily ever after.Besides, doesn't Aladdin succeed solely because of the Genie? You may recall that Aladdin (voice of Scott Weinger) promises to free the unbridled genie with his third wish. However, after the Genie makes him a fabulously wealthy prince on the verge of wooing the Sultan's (Douglas Seale) alluring daughter Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) toward matrimony, Aladdin wants to renege on the deal because he feels he cannot continue this ultimate charade without the Genie's continued help. Understandably, this puts the Genie in a funk and leads to a series of plot twists that place the Genie under the control of the ruthlessly ambitious Sultan's vizier (consultant) Jafar (Jonathan Freeman). It seems that Aladdin goes from hero back to hopeless zero.But hold on thearrrr, as Quick Draw McGraw would say, Disney shows us that Aladdin is not such a hopeless nothing. From the beginning of the film, where we see the penniless orphan and his pilfering simian accomplice Abu (Frank Welker) acrobatically elude the Sultan's security guards led by the burly, irascible Razoul (Jim Cummings), we notice that Aladdin is nimble, clever, street smart, plucky and adaptable. Even after being trapped in the Cave of Wonders by a disguised Jafar (who needs Aladdin to obtain the magic lamp) and finding the lamp, Aladdin tricks the trickster Genie into freeing him without wasting a wish. Furthermore, even the Genie's vast power has its limits. Besides servitude to whoever has the lamp, the Genie informs Aladdin that he has no power over death or love. In other words, he can't be an assassin, or the Messiah, or Cupid. If Aladdin wants to woo Jasmine, he ultimately has to do it on his own. And when Jafar exploits the Genie to become a sultan and sorcerer and uses his power to neutralize his friends, Aladdin again has to find it within himself to defeat Jafar on his own. Instead of false princely status, he uses his courage, sly wit and Jafar's voracious desire for ultimate magic to bring him down.So you see, 'Aladdin' belies its ethereal, insubstantial structure and supernatural fantasy elements to remind us that, after all, even if you have true friends to help you along, the true magic to make your life better lies within you.",8,1,3,26 June 2012
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman Get Their (Circus) Act Together and Give Their Best 'Madagascar' Performance To Date
","The first two 'Madagascar' films are not bad films. They introduced us to an off-beat but likable quartet of zoo escapees who negotiate a crazy, unfamiliar outside world in a madcap attempt to get home. They also introduced us to another quartet - devious but hilarious covert operation penguins sometimes offering 'help' to the other quartet but more often engineering get-rich-quick scams. Finally, we have the boisterous lemur trio led by an egocentric lemur 'king'. They ensured that the first two 'Madagascar' films were at least fun, lively, colorful, and even quick-witted from time to time. But in my humble opinion, the two films lacked a certain something that kept them from being truly memorable.I think that 'something' missing was control. What I mean by that is that Alex the lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) didn't seem to have control of their destinies. They passively let fate (and the penguins, and even a little old lady in Alex's humiliating case) slap them around a little too much. However, I think things gloriously change and improve in 'Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted' (hereafter 'Mad 3'). Alex and his friends not only gain more proactive control in getting home, they reveal previously hidden skills and abilities and even take on responsibility for making others' lives better.I'll try to give just a basic skeleton of 'Mad 3's' plot (yeah, right). The movie begins with Alex and friends still stuck on the African wildlife preserve, perhaps vainly waiting for commando-minded Skipper (Tom McGrath) and his penguin crew to fly back in the rickety aircraft from Monte Carlo after making repairs. Tired of waiting, they, plus the wacky King Julian (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his lackeys sensible Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and the obsequious Mort (Andy Richter), snorkel all the way to Monte Carlo and find the penguins in disguise playing roulette in a casino. Hiding in the rafters, Alex and friends plan to nab the sneaky penguins and force them to fly everyone home.Of course, things go awry and all the animals find themselves relentlessly pursued throughout the city by Animal Control Captain Chantel DuBois (Frances McDormand). A combination of Lucille Ball, Inspector Javert, a bloodhound, and the Terminator, Captain DuBois's true goal is mounting Alex's head on a wall. Despite DuBois's non-stop efforts, all the animals find refuge on a circus train. Learning that the train's tour itinerary includes New York, Alex figures that it can finally take him and his friends home. Before that can happen, though, they must ingratiate themselves with the circus's skeptical members. Gia the trapeze-artist jaguar (Jessica Chastain) and Alex's potential paramour, and Stefano, the high-strung Italian sea lion (Martin Short) and first cousin to Sid the sloth in the 'Ice Age' movies, are relatively easily won over. Vitaly the gruff and sullen Siberian Tiger (Bryan Cranston) is a tougher cocoanut to crack because he is suspicious of Alex and friends' circus credentials. Also, he is a hoop-jumping star in decline because of a fiery stunt gone wrong.The rest of the circus is not in such hot shape. It is dilapidated and playing to smaller and smaller crowds. If Alex and company want to get home, they got to help Vitaly get his nerve back and make the circus acts really eye-poppingly spectacular again. Meanwhile, they must also stay ahead of the seemingly unstoppable Captain DuBois, still on their trail. Can Alex and company accomplish these three goals? What if the circus troupe finds out the truth about their real intentions? Will DuBois get her stuffed lion head? 'Mad 3' is, I think, the best, at least so far, of the franchise because at last Alex and company take matters into their own paws and hooves to improve not only their circumstances, but those of others. And how! Alex's cajoling, encouragement, and athletic skills start to inspire the troupe, especially the smitten Gia. Gloria and the insecure Melman not only perfect a literal high-wire act, but a romantic one, too. Irrepressible Marty helps Stefano with the cannonball act and the circus with a 'rainbow afro'. Even selfish Julien romantically bonds with melancholy bear Sonya and adds new dimensions to her cycling act. All this culminates in a gravity-defying, pulse-pounding circus extravaganza, like Cirque de Soleil to the nth power.So 'Mad 3' certainly has the energy, fire, and comic zaniness of its predecessors. But beyond that, it unexpectedly reveals lessons in friendship, self-reliance, helping others, overcoming inhibitions, self-sacrifice, and what home really means. If you liked the first two 'Madagascar' movies, 'Mad 3' will really make your happiness soar. If you weren't crazy about the first two, I suggest giving 'Mad 3' a try. You just might end up with an exciting, meaningful, and unforgettable experience.",10,3,4,24 June 2013
Jurassic Park," Deus Rex Machina
","You don't need me to tell you that 'Jurassic Park' (hereafter JP) has indelibly ensconced itself in humanity's consciousness. You don't have to be a paleontology or prehistoric animal or dinosaur buff (as I am), or have seen JP in the theater after waiting at 10 p.m. in insanely snaky long lines (as I did) or own the VHS video or Michael Crichton novel that inspired JP (as I do) to appreciate the movie's special status in movie lore as the font of realistically animated extinct beasts. Yep, JP is immortal. But it is not perfect. Why? Well, it's the insidiously asinine and anticlimactic climax! Our intrepid team has cleverly eluded the velociraptors throughout the extended chase sequence at the island center culminating in the atrium with the Tyrannosaurus skeleton. However, the cunning theropods have surrounded the team. How does the team escape? One more brilliant plan? No! The T-rex which masticated and spit out the tour jeeps earlier in the movie materializes behind them out of nowhere to chomp and spit out the raptors and smash his skeletal relative, and provide the necessary distraction for our crew to flee!!! Our toothy savior! Wow, how does a 3-7 ton slavering monster sneak behind you unnoticed? How did he get into the atrium anyway? Presumably, he must have broken through a back wall. But why? What is his motivation? Why follow puny humans when he has his pick of fleshy hadrosaurs, ornithomimids, or ceratopsians? Admittedly, the sequence is exciting, but it really is just a dumb version of the 'dinosaur in the machine'.I understand Spielberg was so enamored of the T-Rex that he couldn't resist bringing it back for the JP climax. Shame on him! :0 He should have resisted the urge. Even the center exploding would have been better.Is it too late to make or discover an alternate ending?",9,4,5,30 December 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Cool Simpsons Universe Takes Movies in its Stride
","With 'The Simpsons', we don't have just a mere earthly empire, we have a universe. 'The Simpsons' reputation for raucous, insouciant, yet human and insightful social commentary has been indelibly established. Only a global criminal scandal along the lines of Rupert Murdock's 'News of the World', or a catastrophic flop could annihilate this universe. Therefore, I don't think there was excessive 'flop' sweat and pressure among the 'The Simpsons Movie' (hereafter TSM) animators, writers, producers, and directors to generate a flawless movie. Oh, I'm sure they cared enough to generate at least a respectable movie. But they also weren't primed to jump off any skyscrapers if TSM didn't win any Academy Awards. The Simpsons universe is cool - almost Bugs Bunny cool. But it also isn't afraid to make fun of itself as well as everything else (hence the 'Itchy and Scratchy' cartoon and Homer's subsequent dismissal of people watching something they can get for free). The Simpsons Universe survives because it does not take itself TOO seriously -- just seriously enough.Now, did the 'TSM' creators manage to make a cool, respectable movie? I think they did, and rather more than respectable. Is TSM essentially any extended 'Simpsons' TV episode? I think so. But that's good, because I have always considered even the most mediocre 'Simpsons' episodes (at least the ones I've seen) to be above-average mini-cinematic events, densely packed with detailed characters and story lines. TSM merely allows more time and breathing room to present its variation of 'Homer screws up, then has to save the day'. It would be redundant to spell out the plot here. Other posters have already done that. Suffice it to say that a lot of the trademark 'Simpsons' TV characteristics appear in the movie.For example, we have the way a 'Simpsons' plot never directly emerges, but has to be backed into. How can you predict that Homer's adoption of a pig initially destined for Krusty Burger slaughter would set in motion an environmental disaster, a federal quarantine, and even imminent destruction? As a second example, we witness the impulsive behavior of a 239-pound id as Homer bonds with a pig, dumps pig feces into Springfield lake even after it's protected from pollution, and prompts the whole town to exile him and his family as a result. As a third example, we see the deeply buried but true affection the Simpson family members have for each other, even at their worst and most despairing. In Alaska, Marge takes the kids and leaves Homer, perhaps permanently, unless he learns to care for others.Within the confines of a movie, even the Simpsons universe can't give you everything. It can't showcase every Springfield citizen in detail for example (you'll have to wait for sequels). The movie was correct to focus on the Simpson family itself and their individual problems, to remind both Simpson fans and newcomers of the real reason why many people adore these crazy people. It goes beyond the jokes, the satire, and the pratfalls (and TSM has more than its share). Again, even when things seem lost, the Simpsons (especially Homer) pull together and acquit themselves well. And they're so cool when they do! TSM does not break new ground, or try to be profound. It would have been terribly wrong to do so. TSM had two simultaneous, interconnected goals: 1) preserve the 'Simpsons' mythos for true believers and 2) explain to newcomers why the 'Simpsons' are so wonderfully enduring. I think it succeeds on both accounts. TSM did what it had to do. And that's just fine!",8,2,3,15 July 2011
The Martian," 'Space Does Not Cooperate', but That Won't Stop 'The Martian'
","Beyond the spaceship duels and friendly/unfriendly human/alien encounters, outer space films like the 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' franchises (and even TV's 'Futurama') draw their appeal from their confident assurance that someday humanity will not just 'conquer' space, it will make it so comfortable and familiar that visiting a new planet will be as easy as taking a walk to the neighborhood grocery store. Perhaps, but that hope is at least decades away. Right now, even now, outer space is cold, dark, and above all, so vast that even visiting a relatively close planet like Mars takes an average of four years. And even when you get to Mars, it's barely more hospitable than the moon. 'The Martian''s (hereafter 'Martian) protagonist, space botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is absolutely right when he states 'Space Does Not Cooperate'. This becomes a problem when he is stranded alone on Mars like an interplanetary 'Robinson Crusoe' (somewhat reminiscent of the 1964 film).Mark is part of the Ares III team also consisting of Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) and astronauts Rick Martinez (Michael Peña), Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara), Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan), and Alex Vogel (Aksel Hennie). While the Ares III team explores Mars, a blinding particle storm forces them to abort their mission and board their ship. The storm violently separates Mark from the rest of the crew who are forced to leave without him, believing Mark dead. The crew is so convinced he's dead that when they communicate that fact to NASA head Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels), he almost immediately arranges an honorary funeral for him.Of course, rumors of Mark's death are premature. Buried in sand, losing oxygen, and suffering a puncture wound, Mark is nevertheless alive. He manages to struggle back to the still-standing planet base, replenish air, equalize pressure, and treat his wound as best he can. However, the obstacles to his survival are just piling up. Can Mark fight Martian weather, radiation, cold, starvation, dehydration, and boredom at least long enough to somehow contact NASA to let them know he's alive, and then stay alive even longer for NASA to mount a rescue mission? Again, given that a one-way Earth-to-Mars trip takes four years, that's a daunting challenge.Meanwhile, back on Earth, Teddy, NASA spokesperson Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig), and NASA mission directors Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) have their own challenges, both urgent and mundane. Besides naturally getting Mitch home safely, Teddy and his team must negotiate the usual treacherous PR protocol to make sure that Mark's inadvertent abandonment does not embarrass, discredit, and eventually defund NASA. And meanwhile, back on Ares III heading back to Earth, the crew, especially guilt- ridden Commander Lewis, must decide, once NASA finally informs them, whether to continue home or return to rescue Mark, depending not only on whether they have enough fuel to do one or the other, but also on coordinating ship/Mars trajectory just right to get Mark.And so 'Martian' oscillates among these three scenarios and dilemmas and manages, in my opinion, to do it without boring and, if you'll excuse the expression, alienating the audience. How can a space movie without aliens (even Marvin), laser weapons, or aerial combat hope to do this? I think 'Martian' succeeds in this by being more knowledgeable than its audience, but in a way that instructs the audience without talking down to them. The movie explains many astrophysical, mechanical, and chemical concepts (including a crucial 'slingshot' maneuver) that help keep the movie going forward and the audience invested in the characters' fates. It certainly helps that Damon's character Mark, in his daily video journal of his ordeals, explains much of this scientific stuff in largely (and often laugh-out-loud profane) layperson's terms.Furthermore, 'Martian' reminds us that no national organization has a monopoly on knowledge. When NASA's attempt to send supplies in a booster rocket explodes into failure, they willingly ignore political tensions to contact chief scientist Guo Ming (Eddy Ko) and deputy chief scientist Zhu Tao (Chen Shu) at Chinese counterpart Chinese National Space Agency (CNSA) to help stabilize the payload. Ah, science rejects borders and embraces diversity. Finally, 'Martian' uses science to ratchet up the intense suspense as Ares III does decide to go back to get Mark by plotting a trajectory and spacewalk, while Mark plots a rendezvous point and prepares a lightened space capsule and 'spacesuit propulsion' system to hopefully get close enough to Ares III to grab him before his oxygen runs out.'Martian''s intelligence also complements the convincing special effects, believably fallible but professional and determined characters (especially Mark), and the realistic depiction of the problems and triumphs of space agency bureaucracy and more importantly space exploration to make an absorbing and involving movie. Not least, 'Martian' succeeds because it respects human intelligence and persistence so much, it convinces us that humanity will eventually surmount space's often deadly 'uncooperativeness'.P.S.: I saw this movie in the theater in 3D? Does 3D enhance the experience? In my opinion, it does to a slight degree, in the depiction of the Martian sandstorms and the flying spaceships. Yet, I felt it was largely unnecessary. Space's grandeur and infinite mystery come through even without the extra dimension.P.P.S.: I especially appreciated how Mark explained how planting crops (like potatoes on Mars) in a new land effectively colonizes that land, and how the distinction between international law and maritime law technically made him a 'space pirate'. Arrrrgh!",10,5,11,7 October 2015
