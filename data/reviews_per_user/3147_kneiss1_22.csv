The Hangover," Unusual and extremely funny!
","There isn't a real flaw in this movie! It's great comedy. I had to laugh a lot! This isn't one of the movies which are simply too silly to be funny. Even though it's comedy, this is no stupid movie at all! Great conversations, a great and unusual story - with lots of surprises. Yeah yeah, of course, a lot is predictable once you understood the logic of the movie, still, it's great fun! And the most fun are all the crazy characters in this movie.So why didn't I give this movie 9, or 10 points? - The main reason is probably, that I prefer different kind of movies. I like movies that try to teach you something, or movies that move you emotionally in an extreme way. Visuals and the music are very important for that. In this movie, visuals and the music hasn't been impressive at all. And beside, I did laugh harder in other movies. Even though, this movie might be in the top 20 of the funniest movies I have ever seen.",8,1,2,9 July 2010
In Bruges," Odd, but great
","After watching 5 minutes, I knew that this will be a great movie. Great conversations, great music, great atmosphere. 3 of the most important things for me when it comes to movies.The only thing that stroke me as a bit odd, was the character Colin has been playing. A naive, childish, conscience-smitten killer with a short temper and a disposition to violence. Even though he was childish and naive, he still was skilled at flirting, and decently witty. An impossible to play character. Collin Farrel made the best out of it.My other problem has been the story. The story isn't too bad, but I found, it had too many coincidences. But, if you don't really pay attention, and if you don't have to analyze everything to death (as I tend to do), you will probably not notice how empty the story is, simply because it is told quite well. If you are a fan of cool gangster movies, like Tarentino movies, this might be for you. It's a great movie, but it's not as witty as a Tarentino movie. And sometimes the conversations seem a bit too odd.",8,2,5,5 October 2010
Akira," A storm of pictures
","This movie is one of my favorite. It's highly intelligent, creative, beautiful and shocking at the same time. I am watching it with thoughts like: 'crazy stuff', 'impressive' and 'wow'. It's a true storm of pictures that will not only entertain you, but also forces you think. It's true art. Drawings are beautiful and on a very high level for 1988. It might actually be the best that was created to that date. The music is interesting, and great the most of the time. Sometimes though, it didn't seem to fit perfectly. Characters are very interesting, especially Tetsuo impressed me.I can't think of any flaw, but that the story sometimes seems a bit chaotic. This isn't so bad though, because it totally fits to the craziness of the movie.",10,2,6,29 July 2010
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Great movie for kids, decent movie for adults
","It's a nice movie, and probably perfect for kids. For me as an adult, it wasn't. I have been missing a lot of things. First of all, I found that the movie wasn't told very well. I don't know the book, maybe the book is told more convincing – the movie simply isn't isn't. Barely anything is explained, the story is full of goofs. Depths is lacking totally. And pretty much every mythical creature shows up. There are centaurs, elves, all sorts of talking animals, unicorns, fauns, gryphons, witches, and even Santa Clause appears. But the fauns, none of that creatures 'explained' in any way, they simply exist. The whole movie felt a bit like Smarties*: Colorful, cheerful, but a bit too sweet. All mythologies are mixed and the result is an empty, too colorful and cheesy fantasy story. A sadly too colorful one to create a real atmosphere. There are way better kid-movies out there. Jumanji, Back to the Future or Harry Potter for example. This movie doesn't even come close the ones mentioned above.*Extremly colorful, German sweets. Google it if you are interested. ;)",5,0,0,24 August 2010
Public Enemies," Overrated and empty
","I have been expecting so much more from this movie. While this movie doesn't disappoint me in the usual way Hollywood does. It is not extraordinary silly, nor cheesy - but nonetheless, it still has one of those really bad Hollywood endings. But the worst is, and this really destroyed the movie for me: The characters. There is 0 depths in them. Jonny Depp was nothing but cool. No fear - barely any humanity was given to this character. So I couldn't feel any sympathy for him. The whole movie was making an empty, dull impression on me. It didn't convince me in any way, not historical and not emotional. The Action: Those constant repetitive gunfights bored, and even annoyed me. I usually don't dislike shaky cams, but in this movie I did. I often didn't like the angle from which this movie has been shot. I even disliked the cutaway in a lot of scenes. I might have to over- think my opinion of Michael Mann.The atmosphere was another thing that I really disliked about the movie. With all the money they had, and the awesome set they have been able to use, this movie could have created an awesome 30's atmosphere. - But, it sadly didn't. The camera they have been using was a digital one. The movie sometimes looked like an absolute B-Movie. Colors lacked warmth and everything looked artificial. One of the worst things for me, has been the jazz-music. It didn't add any emotional weight to any scene. - At max it added some 'coolness' feeling to the movie. Something I personally didn't find fitting. Atmosphere wasn't created by the jazz- music at all. It was as cold, as the movie looked. Only in the end, they used a good musical score - too bad that the ending was cheesy and not fitting to the rest of the movie.",5,1,1,18 November 2010
Black Book," My favorite Verhoeven movie
","This is one of the most moving movies I have ever seen. It has everything: Suspension, romance, shock and tragedy. The story is told in an amazing speed, and changes in an unusual, but very interesting way, from one genre to another. I rarely saw a movie with so 'much' story. 2.5 hours, full of twist, great conversations and amazing action.Sadly the movie isn't without any flaws. A lot was simply too unbelievable. Historical this movie is not accurate. It isn't even realistic. Especially the last half hour felt odd. Quite a few things made me shake my head. You better understand this movie as a great story, not as realism, not as an historical film.I gave this movie 10 points - despite its unrealism. Because its one of the most enthralling films I have ever watched.",10,0,2,17 September 2010
Terminator Salvation," Another one of that well made movies with a horrible script
","I guess I can finally say it this simple: New Hollywood movies become more and more stupid, while they look better and better. I have seen so many new Hollywood movies with a bad script. It really is a pity. The worst in those movies are usually the downright stupid, cheesy, no sense making endings. - Just like in Terminator Salvation. If I give a Hollywood movie 5 points, especially one like Terminator Salvation, that means, that I personally consider it worse. I hate those bad scripts. I don't understand how a movie can go through so many 'hands', without anyone realizing how bad the conversations and the story is. - Objectively, there are worse movies out there. The great action and special effects are enough to keep me entertained. That is why I am still forced to give the movie 5 points. - Even though I personally value a good story a lot more.",5,4,8,8 November 2010
Sleepy Hollow," One of the most atmospheric movies of all times
","I have seen this movie 11 years ago in the cinema. I loved it back then, and became a huge Tim Burton fan. I wasn't sure if I'd still like it 10 years later - but I do. It's one of the most atmospheric movies of all time. While the story can't be taken serious, it is very entertaining and keeps you interested. Actors are amazing, everyone fit perfectly in their role. The set was beautiful. For the eye, there hasn't been the slightest flaw. (But some Computer - effects that can't hold up to todays standards.)I can't see any real flaw in this movie. It could have been a bit more serious and a bit more scary. But it's actually fine as it is: with a few comedic elements and a 'wiking eye'.",10,0,0,8 November 2010
28 Weeks Later," Good movie with lots of ugly zombies that doesn't offer anything new.
","This movie is not exactly bad, objectively I should probably rate it higher than a 5. I personally had several problems with the movie that force me to rate it lower.Problem no.1: Zombies! Zombies are ugly and stupid and that for they get 0 sympathy from me. I like subtle horror, not brain dead zombies.Problem no. 2: This movie failed to scare me. Problem no. 3: There isn't much new in this movie. A Virus turns humans into zombies: The basic modern Zombie story. After that is explained, one person after another dies... OK OK, some new creative ideas can be found in this movie anyway. But they are just not good enough for me, to make this movie worth my time. (Evil dead 2 was worth my time because of it's creativity – despite ugly zombies.)The music in this movie is quite good. Also the actors are very convincing. Even though I didn't know a single one. It really isn't a bad movie if you like zombie movies. If you don't, better avoid this movie.",5,1,2,17 August 2010
Van Helsing," Mindless action, no horror, not even a real vampire movie
","Don't let yourself be tricked, this is nothing but an Hollywood action movie. There is barely any horror, barely atmosphere, barely vampires. If you look for any of this, look somewhere else. If you enjoy expensive Hollywood-breed action-explosions where you don't need to think, you found a movie you might like. Sadly there is nothing special about this movie, but the creative action- scenes. And those are, I admit it, fun to watch. If you look for a good story, suspense, emotions or even depths, you will be more than disappointed. While I like the actors, most haven't been convincing. Especially Kate Beckinsale accent sounded artificial. She did a poor job in acting overall. Her whole character seemed misplaced.",4,1,4,28 November 2010
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Good, but not as good as the 2nd part
","This is a good movie. It has everything that makes the Harry Potter movies great. But it takes a bit of time till things really start moving. The final though is great, and full of good action.I had a problem with some weird scenes and conversations that simply did not make sense. I also found that the movie lacked a bit of atmosphere compared with some of the other parts. Also, I have been a bit disappointed that Voldemort has not been part of this movie. The big story around Harry Potter did barely move forward in this part. Beside that, the movie was less funny, and less witty than the 2nd part. Yet, this movie was atmospheric, beautiful and full of creative great ideas. I liked the map, and how the story was connected to the map, the most.",9,0,1,16 October 2010
Mr. Nobody," A symphony for the eyes
","This movie is absolutely beautiful for the eye and ear. - Especially for the eye. Partly it feels as surrealistic as old Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch or Terry Gilliam movies. I thought this kind of movies died. I am glad to see, that there is a movie from the year 2009 that actually goes into that direction. Don't get me wrong, this movie is still something of it's own, just like Kubrick, Lynch or Gilliam have their own handwriting, so does Jaco Van Dormael. I don't know any other movies by him, but I'll try to find them. If you are a fan of surrealistic cinema, like me, get this movie.I have 2 gripes about this movie. My first one is, that this movie is a bit of a claptrap. - Just like modern music videos or commercials. Everything is super-clean, over-dimensional and beautiful. And because it's absolutely beautiful, this gripe is obsolete.My 2nd gripe can barely be excused. The ending gives a totally trivial explanation for... simply everything. The beautiful symbolism and mysticism of the movie has been destroyed along with this explanation. I don't understand why the director did that. If he would have left the movie be, without the last 5 minutes, I would have totally loved it. No real explanation, just alternative realities beside each other. I would have given the movie 10 points! Like this, I am a bit angered and disappointed. All meaning that could have been interpreted into the movie, is ruined. I guess though, if you really want to, you can still interpret all sort of things into the movie. I sadly can't.",9,8,14,21 September 2010
Big Fish," Beautiful, but imperfect
","This movie is absolutely beautiful and full of creative ideas. The visuals are so great, that alone they make it worth it to watch the film. The fantasy parts of the movie are amazing. - I wished that the movie would have only consisted out of them. The reality part has been my big problem. It didn't fit to the fantasy part perfectly. To me it felt, like the movie was trying to 'explain fantasy'. But isn't fantasy fantasy because it can't be explained? - The cheesy ending destroyed every potential the story had left. Yes, the whole plot didn't convince me.Ewan McGregor and the beautiful visuals still saved the movie. I just hope John August will never again write the screenplay for Tim Burton movies. I absolutely hate how he dismembered Charly and the Chocolate Factory. He did it almost as bad with the Big Fish novel.",8,0,0,17 September 2010
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," And the movies are turning even darker
","With each movie, Harry Potter is more grown-up - and so are the movies. I am damn sure, that I personally wouldn't show this movie to a 6 years old kid. It is aimed at people around 15-17. But it also appeals to older people - like me. Especially if you like fantasy - like me. I also do love the combination of comedy (which is usually appearing a lot in the first half of the movies), and the dark and serious notes of the Harry Potter movies. Those always dominate the end, with a great finale. This 5th part had one of the greatest finales. The action was a hell lot of fun to watch. The movie was full of dark atmosphere and suspension - I loved it.",10,1,4,8 November 2010
Taken," Even Rambo is cooler.
","While the action and the actors are good, this movie lacks everything else that makes a good movie for me. If you don't care about a good story, and like expensive action, I am sure you'll be happy with this movie.As mentioned, I am not happy with the story. The story is as simple as you can imagine. Not only is it simple, it has zero depth and yet it is still full of goofs. Pretty much all that happens in this movie is, that Neesen is running through Paris slaughtering one evil gangster after another. On that way, simply everyone, even innocent people, are shot, hit or kicked. The movie barely cares about morals. Even less than Rambo. (And I am no fan of Rambo.) The moral of the story probably comes down to this: You may kill everyone for the American dream! (Especially non-Americans? Because only foreigners have been killed in this movie.)I am no moralist, and I totally don't want to be one when it comes to art. Maybe I would have liked this movie if Neesen would have been drawn a bit more evil. Most of the time he is looking like some shiny hero. (Especailly in the pathetic 08/15 Hollywood-ending.) And for me that is simply totally absurd. Psychological there is no realism in this movie. - And isn't the psychological aspect in stories the most interesting? Everything in this movie feels as if you have seen it before. Visually it's boring. The conversations and characters are stereotypical. There are no new ideas, totally nothing interesting. There isn't one moment in this movie that will force you to think. There is no: Uh, what did just happen now?' Not even an: Oh, I am so interested in what will happen next.' Objective I should rate this movie higher (maybe with a 2 or 3), subjective I have no other choice but to give this movie 1 point. I can't remember any movie that angered me in a similar way.",1,5,17,29 June 2010
Reservoir Dogs," Great movie in all aspects
","At first I wanted to rate this movie with 9 points. Then I tried to find a reason why not to give it 10 points. And I simply couldn't find a reason to do that. The pretty much only flaws I have been able to find are a few badly chosen camera angles (which simply haven't been to my subjective liking). And one scene where the music started in a too odd and confusing way (The Ugga Chacka song). I also didn't like the slow motion parts. All minor and subjective things that don't make the movie worse as a whole.Of course Tarentino movies are gory and vulgar. I am actually not sure if I like it - but it doesn't disturb me. Tarentino movies themselves are great movies. They are directed and written on a high level of perfection. Only a few other directors play in Tarentinos league. Yes, his skill as a director wasn't as full-grown as it is in later movies, still, it was very impressive, and very unusual. Actors and the characters they play are simply amazing. It's such incredible fun to watch all this characters go crazy. Actors had to go to their limits in this movie. The story is told in a totally unusual way that keeps you interested till the end, giving you one bite of information after another. That way you stay curious through the whole movie.",10,0,0,18 August 2010
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Already a classic today
","I love this movie. The whole series will be one of my favorite for all times. There is so much creativity, so much atmosphere, so beautiful music in it - you simply have to love it. My god, if I would have still been a child when this movie was released, I probably would have become the biggest fan, buying action figures and the books. Sadly I am a bit too old for the movie, so the movie can't work to his full capability. But even as an adult, you will be sucked up by the atmosphere. It'll make you remember how it was to be a child.Only 9 points because the acting of the very young kids wasn't that great. - Which is totally understandable, since they have still been very young in this movie. Also I found it a bit bothering that not everything made sense. That was mainly because some stuff was left out, stuff that is explained in the books. Beside that, I have been a bit bothered by cheesy end and some cheap looking computer effects.",9,0,1,1 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," On pretty much the same level like the other parts
","This movie is on an equal level compared to most of the other Harry potter movies. It is the most comparable to the 3rd part. There is a very similar feeling connected to it. Probably because they are only separated by 1 year from each other. The 3rd and 4th part are more mature, but less funny. In the 5th and 6th part, the movies change even more in that way.In this part, Madeye has been introduced as a character. A greatly played and interesting character. You also see Voldemort again. And I have to say, this has been the biggest disappointment for me. Voldemort did't look, nor act scary. He jumped around like a 3 years old kid, that wants to fight his buddy Harry Potter. And he looked totally animated, and plain bad with his missing nose. I can't express how much Voldemorts appearance disappointed me. The dark lord, a computer animated clown. It's a complete miracle to me, how this was possible to happen.",9,0,2,16 October 2010
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Pretty much flawless
","Some of the gripes I had about the first part, are still to be found, but they are very weakened. The children act way better now. Special effects have been improved. (I really disliked the obvious computer effects in the first part.) And the story was explained better and had a less cheesy end. I am really happy that the Harry Potter movies went into that direction.The sequel is better than the part before. Maybe this is what shows, that this 'series of movies' is actually good. Just as it has been with for example Star Wars. The first movie that has been created, is not yet as good as the two following parts. (I am talking about the old Star was movies from the 80's here.) Maybe that is a sing, that the Harry Potter movies will become classics as well? Maybe it will need time for people to realize how great this movies actually are. I personally have to say, that I found the movies better the 2nd time I watched them. There is so much to discover - so much creativity, beauty and fun. They deserve around 8 points on IMDb, and I am guessing, that they will one day have that.",10,1,3,3 October 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Very entertaining
","Every of the new Hollywood movies I have seen recently made an extremely silly impression on me. In that aspect Transformers 2 has been one of the worst. The story is like a children's comic, the dialog is corny and the humor is silly. There is an unbelievable amount of jokes in this movie, yet, I only had to smile a single time. I didn't laugh once. It's almost like in those really bad comedy shows where one bad joke after the other is being pulled out – simply because they ran out of good jokes...Yet I still liked it. The story felt like the one of a children's comic book. The story is told fast, with a lot of action. And heck, this action is fun to watch - despite all the silliness in the movie. The movie doesn't have a 'realistic' theme, and doesn't care to be realistic. For me, this makes the whole thing a lot more bearable, and like I said, fun to watch.",5,0,7,5 July 2010
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Children of the night, what sweet music they make
","After I have seen this movie, I became a vampire movie fan 12 years ago. Since that day, I have been looking for similar dark, atmospheric experiences. This forced me into an odyssey of bad Vampire movies. Coming back 12 years later to the beginning, made me realize how good this movie actually is. And how hard it is to direct a vampire movie without making it, pathetic, corny or stupid. This movie isn't free of flaws. Actually, I probably would not rate any other movie with 10 points that has as many flaws as this movie. Some special effects look very trashy (for 1992 it was probably very good). Some scenes look odd, maybe too experimental, and don't fully fit into the rest. Some characters motivations haven't been fully explained, especially the end seems a bit incomplete. It is all excused by scenes of unbelievable beauty and a dark (and sexy) atmosphere that is unmatched in any other vampire movie. Visually the movie is very experimental, which partly created those very odd scenes, but overall created beautiful and totally unusual scenes. The music is amazingly atmospheric and catchy. After not seeing the film for around 10 years, I was totally impressed when I noticed that the tune was engraved into my brain cells – this rarely happens to me when it comes to soundtracks.",10,1,4,7 September 2010
Iron Man," Solid, but overrated
","7,9 points, I wasn't expecting that. For a movie to deserve such a high rating, it should have something special, or something new. This is a good movie, no doubt. But it isn't intellectual, it isn't moving and it isn't creative. God, it isn't even extraordinary atmospheric. Yes, it's entertaining, very entertaining - I must admit. Of course it has amazing special effects. - But that just isn't enough for me to give it 8 points. I expect more from movies.The story is bad, and totally didn't convince me. But, and this is the true strength of the movie, it's told detailed and well. If you take a closer look at the story, you will realize how simple and uninteresting it is – but the movie does a great job of hiding it. The same goes for Jeff Bridges. He does a great job of hiding how boring his Character is. Filmmakers have such crazy freedom in Superhero movies, sadly they rarely use it. They could have been so much more creative.7.9 points for Iron man. I still can't believe it. X-men, the Tim Burton Batman movies and Watchmen are all rated worse, but are far superior in my opinion. They are more creative, atmospheric and more fun to watch than Iron Man.7 points from me. Because it's a good movie after all. I'd give it 6.5 if I could. 6 seem to little, and 7 too much.",7,1,3,7 September 2010
