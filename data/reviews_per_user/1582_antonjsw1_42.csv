The New World," Hypnotic beauty that draws you in and leads to an emotionally powerful finale
","As much as I view all of Terrence Malick's films as masterpieces, this, the 170+ minute version of this film is my favourite. The story, of the arrival of the first British explorers in what is now Jamestown, Virginia , United States is less a history lesson, more another of study of 3 characters' life journeys within a lavishly realised natural environment. These are explorer John Smith, played very effectively in an understated, restrained and compassionate way by Colin Farrell; Settler John Rolfe, played in a similar fashion by a surprisingly gentle and compassionate Christian Bale; and a stunning performance by first time 15 year old actress Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocohontas. The film is closer in style to Badlands and Days of Heaven, in that it follows a specific story focusing on these characters, with Pocahontas forming the crux of the plot. The first part of the film is the development of a relationship between Smith and Pocohontas, evolving to a more complicated, but ultimately stronger relationship between Rolfe and Pocohontas.Malick again is very flexible with individual scenes, and it is clear that improvisation is still a key aspect of the actors' performances. Malick also was known to mould scenes further in post production and the abstract and minimalist narration seen in Badlands and Days of Heaven is seen again, albeit we hear more characters narrations rather than just the one. The film is closer in structure to first two films than compared to Thin Red Line, which was more a series of vignettes, rather than a story heading towards a clear denouement, as the New World is. However, unlike Badlands or Heaven, this film is more optimistic, and its ending is has a real emotional impact on the viewer. It certainly made me want to see it again, with the ending staying in my head long after the film ended. Like Kubrick, Malick requires the viewer to be patient, and if so they are rewarded with an emotionally involving story between the characters, and a hypnotic creation of atmosphere and environment that draws you in. On Blu-Ray it looks absolutely magnificent.The film is further assisted with excellent supporting performances, notably from veteran Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport, August Schellenberg as Powhatan and Wes Studi (who always seems to crop up in these sort of films â€“ e.g. Dances with Wolves and Last of the Mohicans) as Opechancanough. The chemistry between Farrell and Kilcher in particular is a real strength of the film. How Malick got such a fantastic performance out of her is a real testament to his skill as a director, but kudos has to also go to Farrell's support for the young actress, as well as a clear talent being brought to the surface from Kilcher herself. While her's and Farrell's scenes are intimate, Malick keeps it seemingly innocent but tactfully and tantalisingly leaves some ambiguity as to whether the relationship is more intimate that what you see on the screen. Malick is too much a class act offer anything gratuitous or obvious, and the film is so much better for it.The action sequences, while few and far between (it is not what the film is about), when they happen, like The Thin Red Line they are shot with real style and panache, albeit they do feel slightly sanitised in this film. The film further benefits from some real trenchant technical contributions. The most significant is veteran Mexican photographer Emmanuel Lubeski, who makes the film look absolutely magnificent, no doubt assisted by Malick himself and clever use of Steadicam (by veteran operator Jim McConkey). James Horner, like Zimmer in The Thin Red Line, had to write most of the score before the film had finished being edited. As a result the music plays more like a series of suites. However, this approach seems to work well and the music also adds to the mood and emotions in the film very effectively. Some Wagner (Das Rheingold) added to the score also works very well and creates a very effective mood and feel. The editing, led by Hollywood veteran Richard Chew is clearly in the Malick style (lingering shots of characters, and shots of the environment playing a prominent role in setting up a scene, sudden story time-line jumps) and works very well. Kudos to the production design crew led by (Malick veteran) Jack Fisk, which totally convinces you what time period you are in. Overall this film is a magnificent achievement. A compassionate and emotional involving story beautifully told. Bravo!",10,0,1,25 April 2011
Walk the Line," A wonderful journey
","Congratulations to everyone involved in this production, which is a superbly made and fantastically well-acted film. Excellent acting by the whole cast is even more impressive because of the tremendous singing and musical numbers performances by the actors. Reese Witherspoon was quite rightly lauded with awards including a BAFTA, Golden Globe and an Oscar. However, Joaquin Phoenix's tour de force performance was the centrepiece and core of the film and easily on a par with Witherspoon's contribution. Surprisingly he only collected a Golden Globe for his performance.There are also excellent supporting performances. Most notably Waylon Payne is superb in a small part as Jerry Lewis, and Robert Patrick (in his second collaboration with director James Mangold) as Cash's father Ray.The film is runs 2 hours and a half hours (director's cut), and while not an action film is incredibly well paced. James Mangold is emerging as the 21st Century's version of veteran Hollywood director Robert Wise. Like Wise, his films are superbly well crafted, this film being no exception, with excellent production design by David Bomba and costume designer Arianne Phillips, which captures the period very well. Other highly competent technical contributions are fused with an excellent script and brilliant performances in a highly skilled but understated style by Mangold. He ensures you are totally captivated by the story and performances, and he ensures that competent camera- work and excellent editing by Michael McCusker help the story fly along but do not draw attention to themselves. Also like Wise Mangold's choices of projects have been highly eclectic, showing what a versatile director he is. The period of Cash's life that are used to form the story inter-mesh very well and drive the narrative along briskly. Despite characters having real flaws, you are drawn to them and Phoenix and Witherspoon always keep their characters accessible and sympathetic. T Bone Burnett's choice of music in the film fits the narrative perfectly.If you are patient you will find the experience of watching the film extremely satisfying emotionally, particularly at the climax. Kudo's to everyone involved for creating an excellent and outstanding character piece.",10,0,0,3 December 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A very entertaining movie for very young viewers, but inferior to the original trilogy
","Having watched the movie, I can say it was very enjoyable, but not in the way that I expected. For a film with a top drawer cast of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Ian MacDiarmid, Frank Oz, Samuel Jackson and Natalie Portman I was hoping that the film would be dramatic, with some dark overtones. Instead the decision to aim the film at under 12's robs a cast of this stature of anything significant for them to do. This is not helped by the decision of Lucas to move away from the naturalistic acting style of the original three films, a style which would have benefited this excellent cast. The only cast members who comes over with any real charm are characters that are played by voice actors, puppeteers and computer graphics character animators! Frank Oz yet again does an excellent job as Yoda. Voice actor Andrew Secombe is terrific as the junk dealer Watto, and his character, thanks to some truly magnificent work by ILM led by animation director Rob Coleman resulted in an animated creature that genuinely feels alive and interesting. Same goes for for the creation of win at all costs Sebulba, who even has some moments of dark humour that don't feel forced or crass. Unfortunately the excellent work done with these characters is partially, but not entirely undermined with the much discussed Jar Jar Binks character. The bumbling nature of the character, and the way his mistakes ended up being heroic deeds was annoying and patronising to the audience. It was also frustrating to get past Bink's accent and actually try to understand what he is actually saying. This character was one of this films major flaws . Also the computer graphics to realise Binks seems much more cartoony as his character is far less convincing than some of the other digital characters seen in the filmAs to the human actors, Liam Neeson comes across by a clear margin as the best of the major players, and is clearly working very hard to get some humanity into dialogue that is too formal and expository in nature. He is very effective with Jake Lloyd, Watto and Pernilla August (playing Anakin Skywalker's mother Shmi). Lloyd, playing Anakin Skywalker , gives a very solid performance for a nine year old actor in a movie of this scale. Credit also has to go to Lucas for getting this performance out of him. The Tatooine segment is by far the strongest part of the film, and apart for Jar Jar Binks's antics the film slipped into a involving and atmospheric mood, culminating in a terrific action sequence in the form of a pod race. However McGregor , playing a young Obi-Wan, Portman (playing the queen of Naboo) and Jackson (in nothing more than a bland cameo)all come across as plot devices rather than genuinely interesting characters. Ian McDiarmid is however, very effective as senator Palpatine is a small but pivotal role. The film's most charismatic villain, Darth Maul is very well played by stuntman turned actor Ray Park, and is an outstanding example of great design work, excellent facial performance and body language, but a crowded narrative doesn't give time for his character to be properly explored.Another of the main problems of the film is the overtly complex plot. While Lucas is trying to set up events for the next films, the strength of the original trilogy was that they worked as stand alone films. Too much is packed into this film, and some characters, notably Darth Maul, suffer for lack of screen time. For example, detailed explanations of the science of the force were unnecessary and too many characters crowd the narrative. The decision to make Anakin Skywalker a young boy was for me, wrong. I believe the film would have played better with casting Anakin as someone in his late teens, who had seen a bit of life, and this would have given the other cast members something better to play against.ILM, Lucas's visual fx company, produced outstanding visual effects and well integrated story telling action sequences, particularly the pod race, which acted as a showcase for what visual effects could achieve in 1999. However the visuals are at their best when they are blended with live action elements such as real locations, sets or miniatures. Certainly the scenes on Tatooine look marvellous and are a genuine and heartfelt homage to Star Wars. Unfortunately the scene's on Naboo don't always come across as photo-realistic due to attempting to try to solve all visual effects problems in a computer. Editing, by Ben Burtt and Young Indiana Jones alumni Paul Martin Smith (and no doubt Lucas) is outstanding and goes a long way to glossing over the films flaws and allowing the film to zip by at a terrific pace. Gavin Bouquet production design and David Tattersall's photography are both impressive and the Tatooine scenes are definitely outstanding in these regards. Trisha Biggar's costume design is also good. Lucas veteran collaborator Ben Burtt also leads the sound effects and sound recording teams with great aplomb.However, the most outstanding contributions comes from John Williams, who yet again produces another brilliant score. 26 years of waiting for a new Star Wars films is rewarded by an outstanding piece of musical entertainment, that even more than the editing, sweeps you along in the film and makes you overlook a lot of the flaws while you are watching the movie. Williams has lost none of his talent for finding the keys themes of story and making them work musically. Overall a very enjoyable and fun film, with a great middle section set on the planet Tatooine. Sadly the film doesn't demonstrate the quality of either Episode IV or V, and falls slightly short of Episode VI, which has a more efficient and streamlined plot, as well better performances by the key players",8,13,24,1 January 2011
3:10 to Yuma," First rate Western
","Director James Mangold, participating in great collaboration with cast and crew, has used the classic genre to tell a contemporary story. The result is a gripping and absorbing tale, in which a great script is propelled forward briskly with great performances, most notably by Christian Bale as the down on his luck ex-soldier turned rancher looking at chance to redeem himself in the eyes of his family (and perhaps himself?); Russell Crowe as the charismatic and yet ruthless robber; and Ben Foster has his loyal but psychotic second in command to Russell Crowe's character.Bale plays his role quiet low key and controlled, and the way his character is taken advantage of at the beginning of the film generates considerable sympathy for him and makes his journey through the rest of the story compelling refreshing and not stereotypical. Crowe is particularly impressive as a clever and ruthless leader of his gang of robbers, but his very subtle take that his character is getting tired of his life, and his gradual bonding to Bale's character is genuinely fascinating to watch. Ben Foster portrays a borderline psychotic in a manner that also avoids stereotyping, and also results in an absorbing performance.These actors are ably supported by good supporting turns by Peter Fonda, Alan Tudyk, Dallas Roberts, and Logan Lerman as Bale's character's son. In fact it is the character interplay which is the driving heart of the film, and keeps you transfixed throughout. This interplay is brilliantly facilitated by writer-director Mangold, who sets it in a spectacular environment and embellishes the story well-handled and exciting action sequences. Kudos go to Phedon Papamichael's photography, Michael McCusker's editing, Andrew Menzies's production design, Arriane Phillips costume work and able support from the sound mixing team and the stunt crew. It really makes a difference that the film accomplishes so much in camera rather than relying on digital effects, and is so much better for it.However the most trenchant technical contribution has to be from Marco Beltrami's brilliant score, that creates to terrific mood and helps propel the story along to its interesting and thoughtful conclusion.The film further cements James Mangold's reputation as one of Hollywood most eclectic directors and one of the best for drawing excellent yet accessible performances from his actors.",10,1,1,23 December 2011
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Exhilarating movie that is still fresh 30 years on!
","This is a film that despite being made nearly 30 years ago, hasn't aged and is still far more entertaining that most of the big budget tent pole movies being churned out today. Credit has to go to creators George Lucas and Larry Kasdan, but the real kudos have to go to Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford for creating an new iconic action hero, and to holding the viewer spellbound with a exciting, amusing and emotionally involving movie, while at the same time paying homage to the Republic serials of the thirties, and elevating the action movie making spectacle much higher than the Bond movie franchise, which was the major action movie brand at the time. The plot moves quickly, thanks to a sharp and witty script by Larry Kasdan, based upon ideas from Lucas, Kasdan, film-maker Philip Kaufman, and Spielberg himself. The film's opening sequence is mirrors the Bond pre-credits sequence, with the viewer thrown straight into an action/thriller sequence with little explanation, followed by a dialogue driven sequence to flesh out the plot. It works extremely well and involves the viewer in the story very quickly. Harrison Ford understands the role perfectly, and the character having moments of fallibility and things going wrong, and having to adapt to the ebbing of success and failure for the character in the story is fun to watch. Ford doesn't play to the character too broadly, and the Indiana Jones character is more fleshed out than Han Solo in Star Wars Episodes IV to VI. Gravitas is provided by an excellent performance by the late Denholm Elliot as Dr Marcus Brody, and a strong performance by John Rhys Davies as Salah. Most of the other parts are very theatrical in nature and are clearly driven by Spielberg's and Lucas's view to have a performance style similar to the Saturday matinÃ©e serials of the 1930s, and while work well within the context of the film, weren't memorable. Spielberg as the director is on top form here, and for me is still his second best action/adventure film (after Jurassic Park). He understands what is needed for an entertaining and enthralling story, and keeps the interest and suspense levels high throughout the film. No scene or sequence is wasteful and everything you see, no matter how spectacular, character based, funny or frightening is there to serve the story and move it along very briskly. Spielberg orchestrates the action sequences with style, humour and panache, but most notably emotional involvement. He gets the audience to follow the character(s) within the action sequence, rather than just show an action sequence for the technical achievement's sake. The stunt-work is still impressive by today's standards, with able support from George Lucas and Michael Moore as the film's 2nd unit directors. Spielberg's editor Michael Kahn edits the footage perfectly to produce and wonderfully entertaining movie, and deservedly won an Oscar for his work. Spielberg's collaboration with veteran photographer Douglas Slocombe was outstanding and gave the film a stylish yet real feel, and they would work together on the subsequent two sequels.The film is also first rate in other technical areas, that also serve to highlight the excellent story and support Spielberg's outstanding directing. Star Wars alumni Norman Reynolds, together with his art direction team won an academy award for the production design. ILM veterans Richard Edlund, Bruce Nicholson and Joe Johnston all won Oscars for the near seamless blend of visual effects into the live action. Richard Edlund had already won Oscars for his work on Star Episodes IV and V would go on to win again for Episode VI, before heading up a highly successful visual effects company (Entertainment Effects Group, which became known later as BOSS film) and overseeing fx a work on a series of high profile films including Ghostbusters, 2010, Die Hard. Air Force One and Charlie Wilson's War. Bruce Nicholson was responsible for the excellent compositing of the visual effects, and has a very successful career in this field, working on many high profile films, including the Matrix and Spiderman sequels. Joe Johnston went on a very successful career as a film director of films such as Honey I Shrunk the Kids! Jurassic Park III and more recently, the Wolfman. Kit West was responsible for the mechanical effects on the film, and has worked on a large body of films since, including Stargate and the Bourne Supremacy. The sound team of Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker, Roy Charman, Ben Burtt and Richard Anderson and did outstanding work and deservedly took home Oscar accolades.Spielberg already had developed a very successful collaboration with composer John Williams, and it was this experience that led to George Lucas working with Williams on the Star Wars films. Williams continues this tradition of old fashioned, rousing scores with another outstanding score. The Raiders March has become almost as iconic as Star Wars in the movie history and popular culture. The music works brilliantly throughout the film, enhancing it wonderfully, and building brilliantly to a superb climax and a gentle but mysterious coda. It is a key part of making this film one of the best action/adventure films ever.Concluding, congratulations must go to Mr Spielberg for delivering a remarkable and piece of all out escapist entertainment, that has stood the test of time remarkably well, and has never been bettered by any of the sequels, even though Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade comes very close.",10,0,1,2 October 2010
Spartacus," A very entertaining movie
","Stanley Kubrick entered the big time here, being asked to substitute for director Anthony Mann, who was the first choice for Spartacus, in and fact did direct the opening scenes of the movie. Kubrick clearly has to work within certain creative boundaries, imposed by either the studio or Douglas, as the films producer. Some scenes are melodramatic and some of the moralising is a bit too obvious, particularly the scenes with Douglas and Simmonds and Douglas to the masses, albeit Olivier does make his scenes with Simmonds more interesting and less saccharine. In fact Olivier, Ustinov and Charles Laughton are the best performances in the film, with Olivier's Crassus oozing power, but becoming more vulnerable when seeing its impact (or lack thereof) on Spartacus; Ustinov's opportunist who nevertheless evokes sympathy as the 'survivor' character and Laughton's character's clever manipulations of gullible senators and his political sparring with Crassus in the 'Republican v Dictator' duel. Douglas is solid enough, albeit in archetypal Hollywood Leading Man mode, and certainly a role that is not quite as interesting as say for example, his performance in Paths of Glory, his previous collaboration with Kubrick.Despite this, and the obvious flamboyant approach to the design and photography, which was to show 'look at the money we are spending on this' ($12 million, a lot at the time), Kubrick brings competent direction and more fleshed out (supporting) characters than usual for a film of this size and scope. Editing is first rate, as is Alex North's music, and the action sequences are generally well handled. The best sequences are the gladiator combat scenes in front of the Crassus character early on in the film, and the arrival of the Roman Legions on the site of the films final battle, where image, editing and music come together brilliantly. The films climax is a bold and interesting choice, and works so well partly because Douglas plays his character in a more understated fashion in this part of the film. Its also interesting to see Crassus try many times, and fail every time to get one over Spartacus, even though at first glance it looks like Crassus does.The plot, while loosely based on history, is the best part of the film, and while there are one or two convenient co-incidences, is doesn't mar the film and is no more than in any populist large scale Hollywood Movie. The political machinations that Spartacus becomes involved in are very prescient and still apply to situations seen by holders of power today, and this key subtext was clearly articulated, especially the handing over of more power to a leader in the interests of 'security'.Overall, a very entertaining action film, with an atypical but highly effective climax. It was Kubrick's last experience of the Hollywood System, and from now on Kubrick would work independently out of England, which would give his subsequent films a very different look and feel",9,1,3,9 April 2010
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Up there with the best of the Skywalker saga films -much better than the Force Awakens
","This is my first thoughts review - and will add to this when I have though about it more. It is definitely up there with the best of the Star Wars films and significantly better than the Force Awakens - puts the 'war' into Star Wars! Gritty, political, tragic and engrossing with some great action and great performances. The film really succeeds in creating a pervading sense of oppression and and all the Imperial characters are seriously nasty, including a certain Sith Lord and a certain regional governor who takes over control on the famous 'its no moon... its a space station' during the story!9/10 Go and see it!",10,3,9,19 December 2016
Alien: Resurrection," Enjoyable and some morsels to chew on
","I have just seen the Quadrilogy special edition, which has a different opening and ending, and some extra scenes that flesh out some of he characters. I enjoyed it much more coming back to it some 3 or 4 years from having last seen that theatrical cut on DVD. The film doesn't have the visceral impact of either Alien or Aliens. However, it acknowledges Alien 3 and the previous films, and is a film with a very original, weird and surreal style typical of director Jean Pierre Jeunet. Unfortunately the KEY characters are not fleshed out quiet as well as the previous instalments, and only Sigourney Weaver, and Leland Orser, who plays the small role of Purvis, shine. Signourney Weaver, as in the previous two movies, is a standout and brings a new dimension to the character as a resurrected clone. In this special edition an interesting subplot about Ripley's past relationships is touched upon, but unfortunately its never developed to its full and interesting potential. The best part of the film is an outstanding sequence where Ripley confronts the reality of her existence as clone number 8, by seeing first hand the prior research, and it is a sequence right up their with the best of anything else in any of the other films. Leland Orser makes the most of a small part, and actually injects his character with pathos, even if the character's climax is way over the top! The story is interesting, but the film's main weakness is that some of the themes set up are not full explored, hence you do not get the emotional payoff that you get in Alien and Aliens, when subplots are carried through e.g Ash's character in Alien, Bishop's character arc in Aliens. Most characters, Wren, Elgyn ,Perez and Gediman(who is an unnecessarily weird character)come across more as plot devices,so you don't really care for them. However, Winona Ryder's Call is quite sympathetic, and by towards end of the film the characters of Vriess (played by Dominque Pinon) and Johner(played by Ron Perlman) are characters you begin to root for, even if the Johner character starts off as being deliberately dislikable.The action sequences are well done, including a standout sequence underwater. The photography and design, like in all the alien films, are excellent. Visual effects are also excellent, bearing in mind this was the first Alien film to fully embrace CG, and is generally well integrated with the excellent live action animatronics. John Frizzell's music is entirely appropriate to the mood, and continues the tradition of excellent and fresh original scores across all four films.The gore is certainly more obvious than in the previous instalments, and those with sensitive stomachs need to be aware that this is the most gratuitous of the four films. This was another small disappointment, as the horror of the aliens is much more psychological rather than the physical and the film is strongest when the horror is geared towards the implied rather than in your face (which for one character is more than just a metaphor!).My final comment is about evolution. The research of the scientific characters in the story that leads to Ripley's Clone 8 raises some interesting thoughts on the ethics of genetic engineering, and links well into the Ripley Clone's issues about her identity. The idea could have been further explored but nevertheless its good to see these issues being layered into a Hollywood Sci- Fi movie. However, the impact of this research in the story of the evolution of the Alien species is controversial and while I really liked the idea, and of its linkage to Ripley, you'll need to make your mind up about the evolution's physical manifestation, which I was unsure about. This character was also on screen for too short a period, and it was a shame that more time wasn't devoted to this.Overall I was impressed - not a classic, but a very well made and thoughtful, if occasionally weird movie.",8,2,4,2 January 2010
The 13th Warrior," Enjoyable Viking Adventure
","A thoroughly enjoyable adventure film. While the film's production problems were well publicised, the final version fits together well, despite some jumps in the narrative and an ending the feels a bit rushed. Furthermore, it doesn't ensure that some genuinely interesting supporting character's development comes to a satisfying conclusion. However, that doesn't overtly mar this story. The film generates a genuine atmosphere of adventure, suspense and fear, and some of the action sequences are thrilling. This is helped by Peter Menzies's photography and above all by Jerry Goldsmith's thunderous score. Greame Revell's original score is interesting, but in no way matches the power of Goldsmith's music, and it was definitely the right decision by producer and writer Michael Crichton to replace Revell's score with a new one by Goldsmith as part of his process of taking over the production and re-editing the film himself as a result of poor test screening results. It is an interesting to note however, what John McTiernan's vision of this film was bearing in mind he left the production before completion when Crichton took over. The story is solid, and the journey is seen from the perspective of Arab poet turned diplomat played very well by Antonio Banderas. One of this films key strengths is the chemistry of the Viking group actors, in particular the towering performance from Vladimir Kulich the leader Buliwyf; the entertaining one from Dennis Storhoi as Herger, and a very engaging one from Daniel Southern as Edgtho. The antagonist is largely faceless and is a collective for most of the film. The device used to keep the audience interested is therefore the excellent interplay between the whole Viking group and Banderas's character.Actions scenes are well done, and work brilliantly with the aforementioned score. But as is the case with these large profile action films, the ending is what lets the film down. This is due to a rush at the film's conclusion, so while the Buliwyf's character's arc is satisfyingly resolved, this isn't the case for the remaining characters. We don't see what the other Vikings motivations or plans are post climax, and even Banderas's character resolution feels rushed and isn't sufficiently built up to a level that is appropriately satisfying. A hint at a romantic interlude with a local Norse woman is never resolved and looks like a potentially studio driven intention to have a quick ending as the film runs quiet long. Audiences however, will accept a good story, even if the film runs longer (e.g. Dances With Wolves, Lord of the Rings, Avatar) and I felt that the film- makers should have taken their time to sign the characters off with satisfying and complete character arcs. Overall though, an enjoyable and exciting adventure.",Null,1,2,23 March 2014
Public Enemies," A solid drama, meticulously made with a first rate performance by Depp as Dillinger
","Led by a first rate controlled, confident but restrained performance by Depp in the lead role, film-maker Michael Mann has crafted another excellent crime drama, albeit its rather restrained and detached nature means that it doesn't quite reach the heights of involvement that a viewer gets with some of Mann's previous outings such as Heat, The Insider and Miami Vice. However, the film is so well made, the script so well put together, and performances so impressive, that it keeps you engrossed even though the ending, based on real-life history, is known from the outset.All key performances are universally impressive, most notably Depp as Dillinger, Bale is nascent FBI lawman Purvis, and while virtually other performances are spot on, there also has to be mention of some excellent performances in smaller parts by Billy Crudup as J Edgaar Hoover, Peter Gerrety as the lawyer Louis Piquett, and Stephen Lang as Agent Winstead (he previously worked on Mann's Manhunter). However, Oscar winning actress Marion Cotillard's performance is not as good as those around her. It's not bad, it's just it feels less involving than the other performances in the cast.As usual technical credits for the film are generally excellent. Regular Mann director of photography Dante Spinotti frames the shots well, certainly the action sequences, which have Mann's trademark slickness and panache, but are also very grounded. However the use of filming this particular story with digital cameras I found an interesting one, as it can occasionally feel unusual to have the video look in what is a period film. Dark Knight production designer Nathan Crowley creates a fine look to the proceeding, and editing is also slick yet subtle.Composer Elliot Goldenthals score is effective if low key, with the focus being on the effective integration of appropriate period music. Michael Mann orchestrates proceedings with his usual skill. However there is one fault in the film that prevents it from achieving greatness. Despite being very well made, the balance between a realistic portrayal of the characters and getting the audience involved in their personal journey was definitely weighted towards the former. While there was probably as much apathy towards the police as gangsters in that time period, albeit there was something of a folk hero persona around Dillinger, it is interesting that the film takes a neutral stance on this, which rubs off on an equally neutral portrayal of Purvis and his team, and does rob the film of a genuinely interesting personal story to invest in emotionally.Nevertheless, it's a meticulously well-made and impressive film.",9,0,0,7 April 2013
Terminator Salvation," Very enjoyable and respectful sequel marred by a rushed ending
","McG continues to show maturation as a director, with a very worthy follow up to his excellent We Are Marshall drama. Terminator Salvation is an excellent entry in the series. While still not on a level of the seminal Terminator, it is right up there with T2, and on many levels is more entertaining and interesting than the very good T3. However, like T2, and unlike T3 and the original Terminator, a really good film is marred by overtly abrupt and unsatisfying ending, that Salvation's case misses a great opportunity to do something really bold and daring with the film's coda, and instead comes out as a rushed cop-out due to the producers' aversion to trying something truly original. Having said that, the film opens at a real clip, and the film never flags pace wise (a failing of the middle of T2) but with a wider span of characters in this story compared with previous outings, some characters have relatively little time to establish themselves in the fast moving plot. Bale is, as usual good value, and plays his character well in a surprisingly understated manner. However, it is interesting that the character's aversion to authority comes across well in this film, something seen throughout both T2 and T3. In fact, the casting of Bale is a better choice than Nick Stahl from the previous film. Other characters give good value in nothing more than glorified cameo's are Michael Ironside, Common and Bryce Dallas Howard. Helen Bonham Carter is very good in an interesting and pivotal, if brief role. However the most interesting characters in this film are Moon Bloodgood's Blair Williams, an idealistic pilot; Anton Yelchin in great form as a young Kyle Reese, and Sam Worthington, who steals the show as the mysterious Marcus Wright. These three characters are the best in the film as they come across as the most human and emotional characters, and I found me being drawn to them more than other performances. The overall story is quite clever and interesting, and plays very well on the audience's prior knowledge of the story. The Marcus Wright character, whose actual identity can be deduced by the audience fairly quickly, is nevertheless a compelling character and is fabulously well realised by Sam Worthington (one can see why James Cameron and Russell Crowe recommended him to director McG) as the character tries to make sense of what is going on around him. In fact, the character's behaviour draws an interesting parallel with the Sarah Connor/Terminator character development from T2. While Sarah Connors character is trying to become ruthless and driven like a Terminator, the Terminator itself is on a journey of learning what it is to be human. Marcus Wright clearly has a streak of humanity in him, and is driven by a need for redemption through trying to locate Kyle Reese and Star (a mute companion to Kyle Reese well played by youngster Jadagrace). His humanity and this drive for redemption and caring for humanity's fate strengthens during the film, and is an interesting contrast with the more unemotional, single-minded , logical and world weary demeanour of Bale's Connor. Unfortunately the downside of the plot is, like T2 a rushed and contrived ending. While the action climax at the end of the film is exciting and entirely appropriate, the film's coda missed a fantastic opportunity to do something really bold and daring. In my view, the John Connor character should have had a more terminal fate, and that what would have been really interesting would be for Marcus Wright to have, in some way, taken on the identity/role of John Connor, and this would have made an interesting 'second chance' for the Wright character. It would certainly have allowed the film to go in an interesting direction, as the actual ending is, in my view, a cop-out to conventionalism. This mars what was up to that point a terrific film. In terms of the look of the film, director McG goes for a 'Mad Max' type dystopia, which is a refreshing look for this franchise and works well. Shane Hurlbut, who had worked with McG on We Are Marshall, gives the film a stylish and slightly washed out look, and certainly the action scenes are very well handled, with a good balance between high quality ILM digital effects, and in-camera animatronics and special effects by the Stan Winston Studio and Kerner Optical. Martin Laing's production design in first rate, as is long time James Cameron and Oscar Winning editing by Conrad Buff. Danny Elfman's score is highly effective and creates an impressive mood. McG marshals everything with style and panache, and the film zips by brilliantly up until the final coda, when it falls slightly apart in having this rushed and boring ending.In summary, an excellent science fiction film that falls just short of greatness down to a rushed and unsatisfying ending.",8,0,1,14 July 2013
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," An excellent comedy about the stupidity of nuclear weapons
","Our political leaders would be well served if they watched this.It brilliantly highlights the stupidity of nuclear weapons. Kubrick's visual style is more obvious, but interestingly its performances that really shine. Sellers is truly magnificent, at his ad-libbing best. From the straight US President Merkin Muffley to the exasperated RAF Officer Lionel Mandrake, to the absolutely crazy Dr Strangelove. However, what is amazing about this film is the excellent performances by other actors, notably George C Scott as Captain Turgidson, Slim Pickens as Major Kong and of course Sterling Hayden as a hilariously unhinged General Jack D Ripper. Satire permeates the movie, from the character's names through to the whole situation itself of unauthorised use of nuclear weapons to the implied jingoistic attitude of the senior US Air Force officers such as the Turgidson character. The narration is clear and efficient, and the structure of the plot is incredibly well put together and moves along at great pace, with a variety of twists to keep the tension up until the films crazy climax.Technical credits are impressive, bearing in mind the films modest $2 million budget, and the fact that the film was made entirely in England. It grossed about 4 to 5 times that amount. Laurie Johnston's music though used subtly works very well, Gilbert Taylor's Black and White cinematography together with Kubrick's trademark camera-work, is excellent, as is Ken Adam's production design and Anthony Harvey's editing. Most notably creation of the cockpit and interior of a B52 is really impressive. Smaller parts, particularly the rest of the crew of the featuring B52, come across well, as does the Russian Ambassador played by Peter Bull. Optical effects by Wally Veevers are also solid.All in all a crazy but accessible comedy that gives you something to think about",10,2,4,15 April 2010
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Very entertaining but flawed finale.
","Firstly, this is a very entertaining film. However, it doesn't reach the heights of the previous two films as story decisions seem to have been influenced by merchandising opportunities and performances by some of the cast are not convincing. The films first 40 minutes is absolutely thrilling, clearly setting up the situations of Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, as well as the final confrontation between the Rebel Alliance and the forces of the Empire, led by Ian McDiarmid in a terrific performance as Emperor Palpatine. It is the trio of Palpatine, Vader (physically played by David Prowse, stuntman Bob Anderson and veteran actor Sebastian Shaw, and voiced superbly by James Earl Jones) and Luke Skywalker (well played by Mark Hamill) that hold the rest of the film together and this 3 way confrontation gives this film is heart and dramatic punch. The director this time around is Richard Marquand, whose previous experience was a couple of low budget, dramatic British films focusing in performances of the actors rather than big set pieces. Most of the action sequences were either visual effects sequences done by Lucas's ILM company or shot by the second unit directors David Tomblin and George Lucas himself. However Marquand seemed to understand what the real dramatic meat of the story was, and arc of the Emperor, Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader where most of his energy seems to have gone into, and in this regard it was well worth it. These scenes play out with the drama and tension they need to, and make for a thrilling and emotional climax to the trilogy. It is also fascinating to watch the sub-relationships in this trio, the Vader vs Palpatine, Vader vs Skywalker and Palpatine vs Skywalker, which build particularly on events set up in the previous film. Hamill turns in a solid performance, and is best in the scenes with Vader, Palpatine and his brief re-unifications with Yoda and Obi Wan Kenobi, again played with grace and gravitas by Frank Oz and Alec Guinness respectively.However, the other characters were given less development. Carrie Fisher was used more as eye candy in the first third of the film, and her character is far more passive and less interesting this time round. In the previous film, the romantic mÃ©nage a trois that is hinted at in Episode V is not explored to the fullness that it could have been. Finding out that Luke is Leia's brother doesn't come off as with the impact it should. Harrison Ford's character is similarly just along for the ride, and both him and Fisher seem less interested this time around, and their performances are either bland or too broad. Plans to kill some of these characters off, particularly Han Solo, would have been a bolder and more dramatic choice and would have built on some of the drama that we saw in Episode V and would see in spades some 22 years later in Episode III. In fact the characters of Han Solo, Princess Leia, R2D2, C3P0 and even Luke Skywalker all suffer because of the decision to have them entangle with a bunch of silly saccharine teddy bears called Ewoks. It seems a decision was made to aim the film at a new, much younger audience, which would buy lots of toys, rather than acknowledging the previous audience, which would have been growing up watching these films. After all, it makes a mockery of stormtroopers with loads of high tech sci-fi technology being bettered by Teddy Bears with rocks and stones! However, the space battle sequences, which is where Billy Dee Williams Lando character ends up (though no proper explanation is given how this outsider who struck a deal with the Empire would be let in so easily by the Rebel Alliance) works well as one of the secondary plots. ILMs work was again outstanding. Not surprisingly Richard Edlund collected his 4th Academy Award for visual effects (having been previously honoured for his work on the previous 2 Star Wars Films and Raiders of the Lost Ark), Dennis Muren collected his 3rd Academy Award, having previously won for Empire Strikes Back and ET. He would go on to win further Academy recognition with the films Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doon, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2, and the outstanding digital work on Jurassic Park. Ken Ralston one his first Academy Award on this film, and would go on receive more for his work on Cocoon, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Death Becomes Her and Forrest Gump. Veteran Stop-Motion Artist Phil Tippett won his first Academy Award on this film, would also win a second for his work on Jurassic Park. The shortcomings highlighted previously are also masked by other outstanding technical contributions. Alan Hume's photography is stylish, particularly the scenes on Dagobah and in the Emperor's residence on the Death Star. The editing team of Sean Barton, Dwayne Dunham, Marcia Lucas and George Lucas did a terrific job of creating a wonderfully paced film, that moves so quickly the flaws whizz by and its only when you think about this film afterwards do you realise that there were some serious issues. Norman Reynolds set design is yet again superb. John Williams who possibly is the artist who most understands these films, producing a wonderfully emotional and exciting score. Unfortunately the later digital enhancements went too far in Episode VI. While for the most part they are fine, the decision to replace Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen, was in my view a major error and for me spoils the ending. After all, how could Luke Skywalker relate to this apparition? It would have been better to leave the original actor in, of if a change was warranted, why not an older Mark Hamill or even a morph of Hayden Christensen and Hamil? Overall an entertaining but flawed finale.",8,0,1,31 October 2010
Alien," An exercise in cool, calculating visceral horror
","Ridley Scott's first mainstream Hollywood film is still fresh and powerful 30+ years after it was first released. The story of a commercial spaceship crew diverted to explore a distant planet as a result of the detection of mysterious signal getting themselves an extremely unwanted visitor and the subsequent horror than ensues makes this a landmark science fiction horror film. A fairly straightforward plot is helped by Scott creating a truly superb visually arresting atmosphere, thanks to great work by production designer Michael Seymour and cinematographer Derek Van Lint. It starts of epic, then transitions to the mundane, before building a growing sense of uneasiness leading to claustrophobic suspense and dread that just keeps building and building until, in the final act it turns into a nerve-wracking horror- thriller as key characters fight for survival. While Ridley Scott deserves great credit in pulling this all together so well, kudos has also to go to the whole cast for creating a wonderfully naturalistic approach to their roles, and being able to define their characters so uniquely and clearly, even if they are archetypes â€“ Yaphet Kotto as the engineer with a chip on his shoulder regarding the preferential pay that the officers get, who nevertheless when the chips are down does demonstrate heroic qualities; Harry Dean Stanton as the fellow engineer who may have some form of brain damage, possibly brought on by historic substance abuse but knows the mechanics of the ship inside-out; Veronica Cartwright as the ships navigator, who acts as the link to the audience as a professionalism is gradually striped away as she is consumed by fear; Ian Holm as Ash, the enigmatic and quiet science officer who has only just jointed the crew at the start of this journey; John Hurt as the curious, fearless and gung- ho second in command, Tom Skerritt as the level headed, approachable but experienced Captain, and of course Sigourney Weaver (for whom this was her first film in a significant role) as what seems to be the young, less experienced but confident and assertive career-driven up and comer Ripley. The growing tensions between the characters, particularly the way that all the character butt heads with Weaver's character works well in the development of the story, and despite relative inexperience Weaver is terrific in the role, and helped create an iconic character in science fiction that would lead to three sequels. Kudos also has to go to the technical crew for creating a terrific atmosphere for the actors to work in â€“ this was helped by Scott deciding to film the movie in chronological order of the story rather than a more typical logistical shooting order. The decision to hire the dark surreal artist HR Giger certainly brought a fresh new look to science fiction, but Michael Seymour's production design is truly brilliant and the way that the Alien is presented on screen is still pretty much the best â€“ keeping its appearances limited and quick â€“ nerves are so shredded by the end of the movie that seeing the monster in more extended full body shots where it is more obvious that it's a man in suit doesn't pull you out of the picture. Credit has also got to go to the brilliant Oscar winning visual effects team â€“ as well as the aforementioned HR Giger, it also included in-camera effects from both Nick Alder and Brian Johnson, and excellent miniature photography from Dennis Ayling. Alder had cut his teeth as a director of effects photography on the Gerry Anderson TV show 'Space 1999'. After Alien, he has worked as an on-set special effects expert on an array of films including Empire Strikes Back, Conan the Barbarian(1982 version), Legend, Jewel of the Nile, Leon, Braveheart, Lost in Space, Behind Enemy Lines, Blade 2, Underworld, Hellboy, Shanghai Knights, Ghost Rider, and would win a BAFTA for best visual effects for the Luc Besson film The 5th Element. Johnson's early credits including work as a special effects assistant on 2001, before also cutting his teeth on Space 1999 as a 2nd unit director overseeing the visual effects. After Alien he would work on a variety of films including Never-ending Story, Dragonslayer, Slipstream, Dragonheart as well as winning another Oscar for best visual effects for Empire Strikes Back and a BAFTA for his work on Aliens. Carlo Rimbaldi was already an Oscar winning special effects veteran of over 20 films prior to working on Alien, and had just prior to this film completed work on both King Kong (for which he had won his prior Oscar) and Close Encounters. He would go on to win a third academy award for his work on E.T, and would go onto work on Conan the Destroyer and Dune. Denis Ayling followed this film as a cinematographer in British Television. Giger's did occasionally work on other films (creature designer on Alien 3, visual designer on Species) but his legacy is that the basic Alien look and design influence has survived through 3 excellent to OK Alien sequels, two poor Alien v Predator crossover movies, two disappointing Alien prequels, a batch of (very bad) Species sequels. Another noticeable contributor to the film's mood was the music â€“ which should have been credited to Ridley Scott and Editor Terry Rawlings. Jerry Goldsmith's original score was extensively edited, cues moved around and classic music from other compositions fitted into the scores, but nevertheless somehow the music works very well. All of this helped make Alien a truly outstanding movie. The atmosphere created is so visceral that the film always leaves you with an impact after when the film is overOverall a landmark science-fiction classic.",Null,3,5,1 September 2015
We Are Marshall," Excellent effort from director McG and the cast
","After two Charlie's Angels movies, you would think a director you would NOT choose to do this film would be McG. Well all I can say is this film-maker has definitely scored a touchdown with this movie! His directing is restrained and he lets the excellent script (by Joe Linden) really shine through great performances from key members of the cast. The true standout is a terrifically charismatic but wonderfully accessible and empathic performance by Matthew McConaughey. He is ably supported by Lost's Matthew Fox, Anthony MacKie, David Strathairn and the rest of the cast who give intense but understated performances. McG wisely lets the performances shine in this movie, but brings strong filmmaking contributions, notably great filming of the football game sequences; the aftermath of a major event early on in the film; Christophe Beck's great musical score, and Shane Hurlbut's stylish but subtle photography.The film's themes are powerful , yet accessible to a wide audience, and some of the emotional reaction comes across as genuine rather than overtly sentimental. Certainly the themes of never giving up, never accepting the status quo, never accepting the easy way out, as well as how people pull together in a crisis to overcome a tragedy, make this a very satisfying and enjoyable film.Congratulations to both cast and crew.",8,2,2,4 May 2013
Barry Lyndon," A cold but beautiful work of art
","While not for all tastes, this is an excellent filmIt has been filmed as if each individual frame of film is a painting.The story is archetypal but interesting, telling the story of the rise and fall of an anti-hero. Ryan O'Neal in the title role is a real surprise and is engaging despite being a character that is deliberately dislike-able. In fact as the character rises up the social ladder, with setbacks on the way, I began to sympathise with the character more. When the character makes it, the film then shifts to be a study of hubris and the character becomes deliberately dislike-able again. Even when the character undertakes a surprising redemptive turn, it is appropriate, and perhaps inevitable that the character becomes subject to the very type the act that he would be more than happy to meat out to other individuals, and certainly does to his stepson, played well by Leon Vitali as his older form, but absolutely brilliantly by in the younger form by child actor, now TV director Dominic Savage. The young Bullingdon comes across as more mature than some of the adult characters that surround him. Other performances are all good and appropriate for the story. Kubrick again makes use of performers he has worked with before, notably Philip Stone as the Lyndon's family lawyer, Leonard Rossiter and the cowardly Captain Quinn, Anthony Sharpe as Lord Hallam, and and excellent Godfrey Quigley as Captain Grogan, the only character with genuine warmth and integrity in the story.The plot progresses at a steady pace. As a viewer, you have to be patient to be rewarded by it. Less patient viewers will see it as boring but then Kubrick as a director expects you to be patient. He was patient with actors in his films, as evidenced by very long shooting schedules and working with actors not to rush when planning their performances; he was patient putting his films together is post production. He therefore expects audiences to be patient. The story is in effect a series of rises and falls of fortune, culminating in a fall at the end of the film. In fact, this major fall is the character's own making, and I did feel frustrated that the character started making a series of wrong choices, not helped by the hubristic attitude of Lyndon's mother, who is well played by Irish actor Marie Kean. Therefore, it was clear that the film had succeeded in drawing me in despite the objective, observational style of the film, with an effective narration by Michael Hordern.Technical credits are outstanding, which is typical for Kubrick films of this period. John Alcott's photography gives great realism to the period, lighting scenes to suggest natural light sources, rather than more typical feature film compositional lighting. Camera-work is more subtle than in previous Kubrick films. However, Kubrick does make very effective use of slow zooms to help tell the story. It is no surprise that Alcott won an Oscar for his work. Design by Ken Adam (as production designer), Roy Walker(as art director), Vernon Dixon (as set dresser) frequent Kubrick collaborator and 3 time Oscar winner Milena Canonero(costumes), and Ulla-Britt SÃ¶derlund (costumes) is nothing short of brilliant and totally convinces you of the time period the film takes place in. They all deservedly won Oscars. Composer Leonard Rosenmann also won an academy award for his excellent work adapting existing classical pieces, but huge credit has to go to Kubrick for his choices, that totally suit the film.Kubrick marshals everything with his usual panache. While the film is a tragedy, the few action scenes, which hinge around Napleonic type warfare with muskets, is brilliantly executed, but doesn't come across as the director showing off, but as being entirely integrated into the story. Be patient, open minded and you'll throughly enjoy it.",10,3,6,6 June 2010
Full Metal Jacket," 1987: A Soldier's Oddysey
","This is an excellent film that shows that film maker Stanley Kubrick has lost none of his skill despite a 7 year break between projects.The film is plotted in two distinct parts, the first half, which is the stronger part is concerned with the impact of brutal training on the wannabe soldiers, with the second part focusing on the story told from the central character, Private Joker, played by an effective Matthew Modine in a deliberate low key and understated manner. In fact most of the performances are subdued, with the exception of Adam Baldwin as a cynical and brutal Animal Mother and particularly Lee Ermey, who steals the show as the ruthless drill sergeant. He is totally captivating in the role, even if his character spends most of his time by humiliating the recruits - though the film posits that there are potentially tragic consequences with this approach as well as the production of a group of lethal killers.The second part of the film is still effective though, even it isn't quite as captivating as the first half. Vietnam is very well realised, particularly since it was shot in London's Docklands, which was derelict at the time! This is a tribute to Kubrick's skill as a director, particularly with his use of steadicam to develop a cold, objective realism peppered with black humour. Huge credit must also go Anton Furst's outstanding work as production designer and Vivian Kubricks score, though minimalist, is interesting and gives a refreshing and different feel to this non-typical war film. Martin Hunter's editing is also first rate.In summary and efficient, and highly effective observation of the dehumanisation of warfare on the soldier made with trademark Kubrick precision",10,4,6,20 July 2010
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Outstanding technically but emotionally distant
","While a outstandingly accomplished film technically, the film suffers from some inconsistent performances from the lead actors leading to a lack of audience involvement with the characters.The story is set ten years after the events in Episode 1, and this affords Lucas the opportunity to make some changes to the characters. Anakin is now 19-20 years old, and he is now a 'rebelling against authority' type character. While in itself not a problem, the decision , for relative newcomer Hayden Christensen to play him as bratty is wrong and leads to the character coming across as unsympathetic , bland, and annoying. Also it seems that Christensen cannot seem to get a clear view of the character's trajectory within the story. As a result, his performance is uneven. In some scenes he is fine (primarily on the scenes set on Tatooine), but his performance seems unsubtle and broad, particularly when in more intimate romantic scenes with Natalie Portman. The decision for the Padme character to play a senator is a much better one, and in that regard Portman's performance is much better this time around and draws an appropriate parallel with Carrie Fisher from the original trilogy. She comes off the much stronger of the two performances when up against Christensen. Unfortunately she is saddled with having to act in a very formal and constrained way, with overtly theatrical and clichÃ©d dialogue that is similar to that of films from the 1930s and 1940s, though in some scenes Portman is clearly trying to bring a more natural take to her character. The decision to move away from the naturalistic acting style on the original trilogy was, in my view a major mistake and alienates an older audience from getting emotionally and viscerally involved in the film. Ewan McGregor's performance this time is less constrained than Episode I, and his character is more central to the story. While not as charismatic as Neeson's performance in Episode 1 it is nevertheless solid. Samuel Jackson has fun effectively playing Jedi Master Samuel Jackson, in a more important and involving role. Temuera Morrison is actually pretty good in a small part as bounty hunter Jango Fett. However, the most impressive human performances are of in two supporting roles, with veteran actor Christopher Lee as Count Dooku, and Australian actor Jack Thompson as Cliegg Lars. It is a relief that Jar Jar Binks character is very much in the background, albeit some of his bungling antics seem to have been transferred to C3P0. Like episode 1, the best performances are digital characters. Andy Secombe is great as Watto again, albeit in a smaller role. However the best performance overall, is Frank Oz , in collaboration with Rob Coleman's ILM animation team in recreating Yoda, now as an entirely digital character. The character is well embedded in the story. His anxiety of what is happening to the galaxy around him is conveyed well, as is the character's growing frustration with not being able to accurate assess who or what is behind the collapsing of the republic. His character's insight in the heat of battle makes him part of the films exciting climax, and a confrontation with Count Dooku, while thrilling, is far too brief. In fact, while the visual effects are for the most part outstanding, lead by Rob Coleman, Pablo Helman, John Knoll and Ben Snow, there are nevertheless a few problems. The digital work in some scenes in my view, goes too far, with sets and whole environments created in the computer when a better balance of digital effects, live action, models, well designed sets and real locations work best. Not surprisingly, some of the Naboo scenes in this film work better because of a better balance between real locations and digital effects (shot in Australia & Italy) and, as per Episode 1, the segment of the film set on Tatooine (shot in Tunisia), while shorter this time around feels more involving because the high quality visual fx, meshing with real locations feels stronger. Interestingly, this part of the story is well written and underpinned by the excellent supporting performances already mentioned, as well as being Christensen's strongest part of the film. Geonosis while very impressive in parts, notably the action sequences, does feel too much like an animation in places. The feeling is that the film was being used moreas a testing of new technology, with filming shot on digital cameras,and Lucas wanting to push the visual effects as far as they can go, rather than trying to optimise the visual effects as part of the overall storytelling experience. As in keeping with the Star Wars films, sound design and effects are excellent, led by veteran Lucas collaborator Ben Burtt. Burtt also served as film editor, working with Lucas. While some of the action sequences are brilliantly edited, most of the dialogue sequences, and some plot based sequences feel pedestrian and un-involving and the pace of the film in these sequences, sadly and unexpectedly for a Star Wars film drags.Production design by Gavin Bouquet is excellent, even if the actual building of the sets is in a computer. As usual John Williams score is first rate, but this time is unable to fully distract or carry you through the less effective parts of the film. Overall, apart from some excellent individual sequences, such as Tatooine and a series of action sequences towards the end of the film, the film makes viewer feel too distant and uninvolved in the proceedings, despite some clever plotting, impressive visual fx and entertaining set pieces towards the film's climax. While the least impressive of the prequels, and weaker than the original series, it is nevertheless more interesting and entertaining than Episode VII, which in my view is, despite the hype and huge box office, the weakest of the saga films to date.",8,12,19,8 January 2011
Predator," Compelling and timeless Sci-Fi Classic
","This is one of the best sci-fi/horror science fiction films ever. In many ways it is like James Cameron's eighties films, Paul Verhoeven's Robocop and Total Recall, a real example of the emergence of the action auteur. Also like Cameron, director John McTiernan has come from basically no-where to make a real impact with a mainstream Hollywood film.The film takes a fairly simple plot populated with stereotypical super-fit soldiers, puts subtly unique personalities on some of the characters, drops them in a jungle on a mission where they are the 'Predators', and then pulls a clever twist and makes them become the hunted by the titular 'Predator'. This works mainly down to an incredibly effective atmosphere and pace from director McTiernan, who patiently sets the plot up by taking the story in one direction, then cleverly working up to switching the genre from an action film to sci-fi horror, which plays out brilliantly for the rest of the film's running time. What is particularly impressive is the flowing camera-work in tricky jungle locations that strikes a balance between helping keep the films pace, dynamism and suspense without drawing attention to itself. Kudos have to go to both McTiernan and particular veteran Australian cinematographer Donald McAlpine.The actors all give broad, theatrical performances with some corny one liners that nevertheless have amazingly become part of popular culture over the last twenty five years. All the characters are good value, and Arnie is entertaining as the leader of the soldiers. As the film's climax builds, his character has less and less to say and it is in this part of the film, which is pure suspense, sees Arnie delivering action through silent physical performance. This is his strongest part of the film.However the best performance of the film is without doubt Kevin Peter Hall as the Predator. Together with truly fabulous and ingenious non digital visual effects by R. Greenberg and Associates, and Stan Winston's truly amazing costume design and animatronics and prosthetics work (the film has its gory moments, but doesn't dwell on them), his physical performance is remarkable and he brings life and an engrossing and compelling personality whose values are clearly otherworldly. This is all the more amazing as he was in a very difficult costume, working in oppressive conditions. He certainly displayed a great deal more commitment than a well known actor who was originally cast in the role! He also has a'blink and you will miss it' cameo as a human character! The film hugely benefits from great technical support. Good production and costume design help contribute the a great atmosphere for the story to play out in, as of course does the aforementioned photography (The film's original cameraman was replaced by Don McAlpine a few weeks into production) and the visual effects (which also saw Stan Winston Studios replace another company after production has started). Editing is solid but the film also benefits from Alan Silvestri's fantastic score which create a fabulous atmosphere;it brilliantly accentuates the visceral impact of the action sequences and helps heighten the tension in the more suspenseful scenes. In fact Silvestri would follow this film with two further outstanding scores in The Abyss and Predator 2 in what has become a long and successful career for one of Hollywood's A list composers.In summary a seminal action/sci-fi/horror film that is still great entertainment even today.",Null,1,2,7 August 2013
U-571," Forget the history, as an old fashioned fictional drama, it's very good indeed
","While this film stirred some controversy regarding its portrayal of history, particular in the media in the UK, this needs to be totally ignored and there was a complete lack of understanding that this was a work of FICTION. Some of the hysteria around the release was to be frank, totally irrelevant and the focus needed to be on whether the film was any good or not as a story.So, as a old fashioned adventure film, it's very good indeed. The film's plot is simple and straightforward, helped a lot by portraying both the American and German sailors in a rounded and grounded way. Performances are solid all round, with Matthew McConnaughey in good form as the lead, with excellent support from both Jack Noseworthy, Jake Weber and Harvey Keitel in supporting roles. The script by Director Mostow, Sam Montgomery and writer/director David Ayer is lean allows that action to zip along at breakneck speed, supported greatly by excellent and authentic directing on the part of Mostow and excellent photography by Oliver Wood. Wayne Wahrman's outstanding editing, convincing production design with Richard Marvin's thunderously rousing score helps create a thrilling and exciting experience full of tension. Kudos also need to go the to the visual effects crew, who make excellent use of life size submarines and truly excellent sets, to highly effective underwater miniature photography. However this film's biggest technical credit is the excellent atmosphere created by the excellent sound work, with Jon Johnson winning an Academy Award for his sound editing. His work contributes massively to creating a genuinely real and claustrophobic atmosphere aboard the submarines that feature in the story, and helps put the viewer in the action. He had already worked on a number of high profile films prior to winning the Oscar, including Star Trek Generations, Independence Day, Breakdown (Mostow's previous film as director), and Payback. Subsequent to U571 he would go on to work on other high profile pictures such as A Knight's Tale, The Rookie, Amazing Grace, Captain American, Saving Mr Banks, The Blind Side and Surrogates â€“ yet another collaboration with Jonathan Mostow. If there are any quibbles, the way the core crew get out of an initial rendezvous with an enemy destroyer does stretch credibility. The fact that a supply submarine would still have space to carry torpedoes also comes as a bit of a surprise, as does the use of a spotter plane that looks suspiciously like a short range Messchermitt (which you would never find out in the middle of the Atlantic â€“ or a German destroyer for that matter â€“ Germany only tended to send it large battleships into this region). However the fun and enjoyment of the film will grab you to will tend to overlook any flaws. So in summary if you just accept and experience it as a work of fiction, you will have a great time",Null,1,5,15 August 2015
The Shining," Well made and ambiguous psychological horror
","Director Stanley Kubrick and star Jack Nicholson collaborated in a very interesting, very well made but ultimate slightly flawed horror film.It is a measure though of Stanley Kubrick that a flawed film still gets 9 out of 10! The film is more populist than most of Kubrick's films, however he still keeps many aspects of the film non mainstream and original, despite this coming from an existing story, in the form of a Stephen King novel.The plot is typically ambiguous, challenging the audience by not having a neat structure, and this applied particularly to the intriguing ending. However, I wonder if a little too much development of the story got lost in the editing as for me this was the area where the films main, and only fault was. While I understand that the time line in the film moves in jumps I found that Jack Nicholson's character psychosis happens too quickly, and I felt it would have been more interesting to see this disintegration of character, which is well played by Nicholson, happen more subtly. Shelley Duvall's performance is very good as the wife who becomes more terrified when she realises what is happening to her husband, but again it would have been interesting to see her change more gradually. Kubrick alumni Philip Stone (as Delbert Grady)and Joe Turkel (as the bartender) are both excellent in small parts, as is Scatman Crothers at the head chef, but for me the real acting kudos in the film has to go to child actor Danny Lloyd as the Daniel Torrance character. He is amazing, especially when performing both the slightly sinister alter ego as well as his Danny character. He carries off his performance with subtlety and charisma. This character is the emotional anchor for the story, and Danny Lloyd pulls it off magnificently. Kudos has to go to Kubrick for getting this level of performance from a young child actor. Technical credits, as usual for a Kubrick film, are first rate. Kubrick alumni John Alcott's photography is complemented brilliantly by Kubrick's signature use of wide angle lenses. This is particularly impressive as Kubrick makes wide and large spaces look really scary, and eschews the more stereotypical approaches of darkness and tight framing of shots to induce claustrophobia with the audience. Mention must also be of Garrett Brown's use of the Steadicam in this picture. As the steadicam operator, he worked this camera system into the production very effectively as for it to be almost not noticeable. Credit however, must go to Kubrick for realising the potential for it to be a storytelling tool, rather than for it to be a practical solution to certain shooting problems, as it had been in previous films. His work here certainly inspired many modern filmmakers to use steadicam in their films, sadly rarely with Kubrick's level of sophistication. Editing and production design are excellent, particularly the work in realising both the Overlook Hotel and Maze, for which huge credit has to go to Roy Walker, another Kubrick alumni. In fact the snow bound atmosphere is brilliantly realised, as are the winter scenes, particularly with most of this film being made in the UK at Elstree studios. Kubrick again chooses most of the music from a variety of sources, both scored and existing music. It works very well with the filmIn summary, a very good psychological horror film which left me thinking long after the film was over, despite some aspects of the characters journey in the film not really working for me.",Null,0,1,19 June 2010
District 9," A taut, engrossing and involving science fiction classic
","This is a superb film.While dark and violent, the gore is not too much in your face. In fact the violence is played for dark humor the film as a more subtle, but similar vein to the way that director Paul Verhoeven used black humour in 'Robocop' and 'Starship Troopers'.The story is this films strength. It is dense and interesting, which rewards the viewer as when seeing it again other things come to light. The social comment is there in spades, from the less subtle metaphors for apartheid (in a general rather than specific sense) to the more subtle comments of creation of a subclass, corporate greed,conspiracy, personal prejudice (and a personal reassessment of it)and the very clever use of the use of cat food as both a plot device and further social comment.The directing is superb for a first time film-maker. While the interspersing of mockumentary recordings with a traditional film structure does take a bit of getting used to ( the cinematography between the mockumentary and conventional filmic scenes is too similar - it should have been degraded it a bit more) this is the only very minor quibble I had with this movie. What is so good is that the directing is restrained and controlled, as is the special effects (kudos to all the companies involved). The alien characters are can be related to, particularly the 'alien son' character. Very impressive when considering the size of the films budget compared to usual Hollywood fare. It is certainly true that this film is a classic example of 'less is more'.The acting really brings the story to life. There is not a bad performance anywhere. Small parts are incredibly well realised and really allow you to connect with all the characters - all I can say is bravo. The actor who plays the reference for the key Alien characters is superb and his relationship with his 'son alien' character brings an incredible amount of heart to the story. In fact, is allows the films climax and pay off to be incredibly emotional and powerful, even though its not a neat stereotypical one.However, the ultimate star in the acting department has to be Sharlto Copley, who performance as a corporate drone who undergoes a transformation both literally, but more importantly psychologically, is a tour de force and I find is really surprising that this performance was not acknowledged sufficiently at formal award ceremonies. It was known that their was a lot of improvisation in his acting, which certainly has contributed to a fascinating character that you end up really caring for by the end of the film. The character's personal journey was what keeps you engrossed throughout the film, and shows you don't need a $200-$300 million dollar budget, a 3 hour running time, and expensive action/special fx sequences in every frame to make a sci-fi movie that lots of people will enjoy, remember and think about after they have seen it.Having said that, the action sequences are extremely well done, with a reality,inventiveness and black humour to them. In fact, they remind me of the low budget inventiveness of films such as the original 'Terminator','Robocop' and 'Predator' from the 80s, which had to figure out what could be achieved without CG. Film-makers had to create a better balance of inserted post production effects with effects on camera filmed live.Design and and cinematography, shooting with digital cameras rather than film was excellent(apart from the minor aforementioned gripe). The music by Clinton Shorter, while similar in style to Terminator and the Zimmer/Newton Howard Batman scores, works very well with the film, particularly with the layering in of native music and sounds.In all a fantastic achievement. I look forward, after 3 to 4 years to the follow up, which will hopefully follow in the traditional of the tradition of Aliens, T2 and The Dark Knight as strong sequels to an excellent initial film.",10,1,5,24 January 2010
The Game," An intelligent, gripping drama, filmed with crisp efficiency
","A very solid, thoughtful and stylish outing from made with great precision that is becoming a hallmark of David Fincher. His interest in 'films that scar' continues, and while this film doesn't top quite the heights of the remarkable Se7en, it is still a very worthy achievement, thanks to a trenchant yet subtle performance from Michael Douglas. The script is solid, but it is really the effective partnership between Douglas and Fincher, as well as great supporting acting turns from Sean Penn, James Rebhorn and Debra Kara Unger, which really helps ground this slow burning but always engrossing psychological thriller. You have to pay attention, but as the plot twists and turns it does work its way to a satisfying if surprisingly climax (especially for a director of Fincher's background) you'll enjoy the way that Douglas's Nicholas Van Orton character is stripped of his layers of reserve and control as the character is cleverly placed in one crisis after another. Technical credits are as usual very polished â€“ production design and Haris Savidies's photography stand out, but its Howard Shore's minimalist score that really enhances the mood of the film brilliantly. While the score has some of the dark overtones of Se7en, it is not as dark as that movie but still works very well to make the viewer fell unsettled â€“ in particular the use of a sole piano is extremely effective in certain scenes. To cap it all it is slickly edited and comes together with a crisp efficiency. Overall another film that firmly cements David Fincher's reputation as an extremely talented and uncompromising film-maker.",Null,2,3,15 August 2015
The Insider," Truly superb drama with excellent performances by Pacino, Crowe and Plummer
","Michael Mann follows his superb Heat with an excellent if more cerebral drama. Firstly, the script by Eric Roth and Mann brilliantly distills a complex story into narrative that is suspenseful, emotionally effective yet highly thoughtful and sophisticated. It certainly has a lot to say about the shady worlds of US corporate, legal and media culture. Despite this complexity the film zips along at a terrific pace, mainly due to the excellent script being supported by great direction and first rate acting by the whole cast, albeit special mention has to go to Pacino, Crowe and Plummer for truly outstanding performances. Certainly that fearsome intangible of powerful corporate forces working to destroy an individual's reputation comes across very strongly, and Russell Crowe's intense performance is key in selling this to the audience. It is also fascinating to see the situation that Pacino's Lowell Bergmann's character is put into by these corporate forces, and these two character's willingness to hold onto their integrity and beliefs is genuinely affecting despite the great personal cost it has on their characters, particularly Crowe's. Crowe's and Pacino's excellent portrayals are well complimented by Plummer veteran reporter/correspondent character, and the journey this character goes through while different, is nevertheless fascinating even if his character doesn't generate the same levels of sympathy for his plight â€“ in fact it is his initial actions at a key point in the story that generate a great sense of disappointment in his character Mann orchestrates proceeding with bravado and panache, though not forgetting that this is a cerebral drama where ultimately it is the actors' performances that will lead to the success of the movie. However, Mann is a master of embedding slick film-making around excellent dramatic performances. Not only does he get the actors to shine, but he yet again draws excellent work from both the photography and editing teams, and huge credit has to go to editors William Goldenberg, David Rosenbloom and Paul Rubell, musicians Pieter Bourke, Lisa Gerrard and Graeme Revell, production designer Brian Morris and particularly Mann regular director of photography Dante Spinotti. It certainly deserved its 7 Academy Award nominations and in my view should have won several.Despite its lack of commercial success, this is a fantastic film, which tells of terrific story through excellent performances from its lead actors, who work in a visual environment that beautifully complements their performances, for which Michael Mann deserves huge credit.",10,2,3,10 July 2012
"Girl, Interrupted"," A thoughtful, touching and excellent film
","A steadily paced but utterly absorbing story about a troubled 18 year Susanna Kaysen, subtlety played by Winona Ryder, whose experience at a psychiatric hospital l in the 1967 makes a real impression. While Ryder was also a producer on the film and worked very hard to get the film made, it plays as an involving ensemble piece with lot of actors getting a chance to shine, most notably Whoopi Goldberg as Nurse Valerie Owens, the late Brittany Murphy as the abused Daisy Randone and Angelina Jolie as sociopathic long time patient Lisa Rowe, for which she won an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.The film, while working from a strong script by Lisa Loomer, Anna Hamilton Phelan and director James Mangold, uses the experiences of the real-life Susanna Kaysen (who was also a producer on the film) from her novel. This film deals with the issue of mental health, and Mangold makes a brave decision to try and make the film as accessible as possible for a mainstream audience. While some critics have claimed that the film is overtly sanitised, it is very unlikely that a more gritty approach would led to the film being green lit on a $25-30 million budget.Performances are all understated but very real, with the notable exception of Jolie's character, who is very confrontational and direct. Kudos must go to all the cast including Goldberg, Murphy, DuVall, Moss, Tambor, and very effective cameos from Kurtwood Smith and Vanessa Redgrave. This is the real achievement of the film. The characters remain grounded and real within the context of the story, and the performers, under the expert and thoughtful guidance of director James Mangold generate warmth and interest that allows the viewer, providing you are patient (pun not intended), to invest in, and care for the characters. Jolie turns in a very charismatic and intense performance, and is one her best performances in my opinion, up there with her performance in Beyond Borders and the Changeling. However, Ryder is the ultimate anchor of the film, and in this regard she succeeds magnificently. One of her real strengths is her ability to tell a story non-verbally. At the start of the film, she clearly communicates to the audience her character being a lonely lost soul, who is initially horrified about going to psychiatric hospital, but nevertheless bonds with the fellow patients. Another strength is that Ryder's character begins to move in a direction which implies she is becoming dependant on the hospital, and her character develops rebellious tendencies, clearly inspired by the character's attraction to Jolie's Lisa. The conflict her character goes through with other characters as a result of this relationship works very well and leads to a satisfying and grounded climax that tries very hard to not be too sentimental or stereotypical.Technical credits are understated but impressive. Mangold's direction is spot on, and he makes clever use of match cuts to transition the story, but also to inform the audience of the lead character's disorientated psychological state. Design, costumes, photography and music are all very effective and contribute to a really polished and well-made film. The film captures the atmosphere of 1967/8 America very well, yet this does not dominate the story, which in many ways feels timeless and totally accessible for a modern audience. In summary, an excellent achievement that is a sensitive yet accessible film about an individual dealing with difficult but common real life problems.",10,0,1,15 August 2011
2001: A Space Odyssey," Visual Poetry - a landmark achievement
","One of the seminal points in the development of film and cinema. Future directors like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron, to mention just a few, were massively inspired by this film. Its easy to see why.Kubrick evolved film making conventions considerably. The plot is decidedly ambiguous and thinly sketched so as to force the audience to understand and interpret it themselves, with very little exposition, and deliberately trivial or even banal dialogue. Compared to Kubrick's previous films, there is no verbal narration beyond the films division into the sections of 'Dawn of Man', 'Jupiter Mission', and 'Jupiter - Beyond the Infinite'. The film if full of ambiguous symbolism, which forces the viewer to invest in the picture viscerally. You then have to reflect on the experience to get anything from it. Albeit this only works as a viewing experience if you are very patient.Acting performances are not really the point of this film, with William Sylvester, Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood giving deliberately controlled, restrained, even bland performances which are designed to create a sense of detachment from the characters. The only character that is genuinely interesting is the man-ape Moonwatcher, played brilliantly by Daniel Richter.Technical credits are really the driver for this film. Production Design by Terry Masters and his team is excellent, working in great collaboration with Geoffrey Unsworth, resulting is staggeringly amazing cinematography, that still looks brilliant by today's standards. He is a genius at simulating natural light and conditions on indoor studios. This is further re-enforced by Kubrick's signature camera-work The visual effects are still hugely impressive, even by today's CGI dominating standards, and for the most part the miniature work is fantastic, as is filming on the simulated centrifuge on the discovery spacecraft. There are some minor quibbles, for example there is a scene set in zero G where the stewardess walks in a circle but seems to walk too far for where you would expect the cockpit to be, and there are some views out of windows that don't seem to correct for the angle that the spacecraft are flying at.These issues are nevertheless more than compensated for by the amazing experience of watching the film, particularly with the marrying of image with existing classical music. Alex North, whom Kubrick worked with on Spartacus, had written 40 minutes of score, but this was discarded when Kubrick elected to use his choices of classical music, which works amazingly well. It leads to an original, fascinating experience, that feels very poetic and highly visceral.In many ways, its the ultimate silent movie, relying more on music rather than dialogue to tell the story from an auditory point of view",Null,6,14,9 May 2010
A Clockwork Orange," Crime and Punishment
","This is a very disturbing, but utterly brilliant film.It very cleverly deals with the themes of morality and the use of psychology as a medical treatment, and its use for good or ill.Kubrick works in a very clever analysis of liberalism v conservatism in terms of crime and punishment, and comes to the conclusion that neither approach on its own is the answer.The film is very stylised, and clearly has evolved from Kubrick's approach for 2001. However, the view of the future is certainly more dystopian and political. The future United Kingdom is socialist/police state, with a 3rd world type gap between affluent and poor. The film focuses on a group of teenage tear aways and the impact of a specific crime on one of the characters, Alex, played by Malcolm MacDowell in a tour de force performance that has you absolutely spellbound throughout the film. His performance is totally charismatic, and he is put through considerable physical challenges in this film, including an eye injury that almost blinded him. Unfortunately, while he gave some good performances later on (Time After Time, Star Trek Generations)he never reached the quality of performance he did in this film again.The film operates in three acts, Alex's life before incarceration, his time in prison and subsequent treatment, and the impact of that treatment on his release from is sentence. The story brilliantly plays on the role reversal aspect, as Alex's victims become persecutors, and Alex himself becomes a victim. It shows society's hypocrisy and tendency for the rule of the mob in terms of punishment of a criminal. It also offers up the notion that you cannot remove criminal behaviour from someone artificially without consequences, some of which are clearly unintended. Its doesn't judge, simply offers up an observation of how politics serves the purposes of politicians, rather than the people the politicians represent. This theme couldn't be more timeless, especially with scandals that have beset the real life British political system in the last year, and an emerging tendency, particularly in the last 5 years, of politicians seeming to want power for power's sake, and being willing to do anything to maintain it, including U turns on policies.The rest of the performances are good, including a very curious and eccentric interpretation by Patrick Magee as the injured writer Frank Alexander, a strong performance by Michael Bates as the chief prison officer, and a clever performance by Anthony Sharp and the ruthless but charming politician.Technical credits are excellent.John Alcott's cinematography is excellent, with Kubrick's signature use of wide angle lenses, clever use of zooms, and excellent and imaginative hand held camera-work. Kubrick also makes brilliant use of both slow motion and high speed to drive the narrative in effective and amusing ways in specific parts of the film. Bill Butler's editing and John Barry's production design are highly effective and the actions sequences are brilliantly put together, including some excellent stunt work.Finally the electronic score, interspersed with classical 'Ludvig Van' as the protagonist puts it, is fresh and works brilliantly with the film, with some scenes clearly edited to the music, rather than the other way around. However this does not detract from the film.In summary a tough, dark, disturbing and amusing masterpiece that has you thinking long after the film is over",10,1,4,31 May 2010
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's final masterpiece
","Sadly this was Stanley Kubrick's final film.Despite not directing a film for some 12 years, and taking some 2 years to shoot and complete this film. Kubrick has lost none of his skill to make a first rate film that deals with a complex human issue is a dispassionate and objective way, yet keeps the film accessible, entertaining and most importantly, staying in the mind of the viewer long after having seen it.Kubrick's film is a study of the human condition, from the perspective of how sex is part of a relationship. It also makes a statement of how human life is viewed in the higher echelons of society, and seems to indicate it is a commodity to enjoy, and then dispose of, with little or any emotional energy being invested. Cruise gives a compelling performance with more restraint than a typical for him and watching his character put himself into temptation is interesting. However Nicole Kidman is more than a match her husband in the acting department with a very effective and charismatic performance - their initial, immature drug fuelled argument in the bedroom is very effective and her character viciously demolishes the world-view and confidence of the Tom Cruise character. While the focus of the film is on the Bill Harford, Kidman's interactions with Cruise are always charged and riveting. As to other performances, they are all competent, albeit Rade Sherbedgia's broad performance is clearly the amusing dark comic relief in the film, which works well and is definitely needed. Actor/director Todd Field and Sky Dumont are engaging in small parts but its the late Sydney Pollack who is commanding as Victor Zielger and is charismatic and totally amoral in the main supporting role. Technical credits, as usual for a Kubrick film are first rate. Larry Smith's photography, no doubt enhanced by Kubrick's own outstanding knowledge of lighting is excellent, especially as this was Smith's first film as a Director of Photography. He had previously worked on the lighting crews on both Barry Lyndon and The Shining. He has gone on to by the lighting cameraman on a wide variety of projects after this film. Kubrick also shows he is the master of Steadicam, ably supported by veteran operator Elizabeth Ziegler. Nigel Galts editing is also very slick and polished. Joceyln Pook's music, supplemented with pre-existing music tracks, no doubt chosen or influenced by Kubrick himself is effective in creating a dark and disturbing mood.However, as with many Kubrick films, its the outstanding production design that is the greatest technical achievement. Led by Les Tomkins and Kubrick veteran Roy Walker they create a world that is totally convincing - after all the film's first unit shot entirely in the UKIn summary this film is an appropriate and final outstanding achievement for possibly the most technically yet sophisticated and challenging visual storyteller I have come across watching movies.",Null,2,3,31 July 2010
Die Hard," A trenchant action film classic
","John McTiernan's second mainstream film manages to amazingly top an outstanding previous effort, Predator. This even better film will resonate will audiences even more than Predator. While Predator was a superbly crafted and fairly straightforward sci-fi action thriller, this film takes the archetypal imperfect everyman loner, saddled with personal issues(in the form as an estranged relationship with is corporate high flying wife) and through a twist of fate has him battling, against the odds an international team of highly motivated and competent) bank robbers while trying to protect his wife, who is amongst the hostages these robbers have taken. It differed from both Predator and other action-thriller films of the period in that the hero was more human in physique, rather than the physical super-men such as Stallone, Norris and Schwarzenegger. He survives through determination and his wits rather than on brute strength, and Bruce Willis was a refreshingly original casting choice.The plot is cleverly structured and sets up all the characters seamlessly. There are good performances from most of the key players. The robbers are all interesting, but clearly most time is spent with Clarence Gilyard Jr. and the late Alexander Gudunov, who are both charismatic, albeit it is their boss, the relatively unknown at the time British actor Alan Rickman, who steals the show and is terrific in this film, and makes for a worthy rival and antagonist for Bruce Willis's John McClane. Bonnie Bedelia and Reginald Veljohnson are also good value, as is James Shigeta as Mr Takagi. However a couple of the characters do stray into caricatures, notably De'Voreaux White and Hart Bochner as Argyle and Ellis respectively. Fortunately the other performances and the film itself as so fast paced and involving you can overlook these slightly over the top performances, and they do not detract from the enjoyment of the picture.The good performances are woven into an expertly crafted film. Technical credits are outstanding. Jan De Bont's photography is stylish, and makes fantastic use of the Fox Plaza Tower to double for the Nakatomi building. He also makes clever use, but not over use of lens flares to create an excellent mood and atmosphere. Frank J Urioste's stunning editing, Michael Kamen's great music and Richard Edlund's brilliant but incredibly subtle visual effects all work together with truly fantastic action sequences and stuntwork, and director John McTiernan deserves huge credit. He draws out entertaining performances from most of the cast, but mixes this brilliantly clever setting up of the characters, and then orchestrating some truly outstanding action sequences with a pervading atmosphere of growing tension and suspense. It has stood the test of time brilliantly, it still by some way the best of the series, and overall comes off as a truly outstanding and emotionally satisfying thriller.Overall a terrific achievement that has not been bettered.",Null,5,5,26 August 2013
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Great fun summer buddy action film
","Number three is this franchise continues to be hugely entertaining, albeit is closer in tone to Renny Harlin's Die Hard 2 than the original. It takes place throughout New York State, as well as having a climax on the Canadian Border. As a result, it lacks the vice like suspense and tension of the first film, and plays much more like a kick-ass crowd pleasing summer action film, which was very much the case with Die Hard 2.This film very quickly pairs Bruce Willis's McClane character with a shop-keeper with 'chip on his shoulder', Zeus, brilliantly played by Samuel L Jackson. This buddying up of two characters who initially hate each other, and then evolve to support and respect each other is straight out of the Lethal Weapon play-book, and while not as quite as entertaining or as profound as that film, was certainly a much better 'buddy cop' that the Lethal Weapon sequels and most other films in this sub-genre.The plot is straightforward but fairly clever, and departs from the previous two Die Hard films by massively expanding its scope, but adding tension through pervasive threat of potential bombs going off across this city that full of semi-permanent traffic jams. Unlike Die Hard 2, the references to the first film are far more subtle, except for the fact that the film's antagonist, 'Simon', very well played by Jeremy Irons (albeit not at the level that Alan Rickman brought Has Gruber in the original) has a strong connection one of the characters in the original. It builds gradually towards a predictable but exciting climax with a very big explosion. However the visual effects around this explosion are surprisingly low budget and poor quality, albeit masked by quick-cut editing. The films actual ending feels rather tacked on and cheap after this previous climax, and sadly lets the film down as this sequence feels a little disjointed and the pace and feel of this sequence is very different from the rest of the film.Bruce Willis as again great value as John McClane, and plays his in a surprisingly grounded and more gritty version compared to the more emotional and frightened character in the first one, and one that feels like bit like a working class James Bond super hero rip off in Die Hard 2. His character is the most accessible of the 3 films at this point, and his dry humour certainly bounces of Sam Jackson brilliantly. One wonders if there was improvisation here and the natural chemistry between these characters is fantastic and rivals the interplay between Rickman and Willis from the first film. It gives a humanity to the film which maybe was less emphasised in the previous two films. Certainly the fact that the McClane character has been through the wringer courtesy of the first two films means his character comes off less frightened and has a more jaded but grimly determined attitude this time around. Jackson's Zeus Carver is fascinating as his character is tough, streetwise, cynical, funny and also grimly determined. However is doesn't know how to use weapons, has no law enforcement or military training, yet as the story goes along is never intimidated by the protagonist or his henchman. Incidentally the films draws compelling villains for the rest of Simon Gruber's team, which is particularly effective has the group is much bigger than they key antagonists from the previous two films, and it could be easy to get lost within the plot, but this does not happen.McTiernan tries to accomplish almost all the action in-camera with traditional stunt-work, and this further establishes the gritty atmosphere of the film. Veteran Hollywood stunt guy Terry Leonard second unit/stunt work deserves considerable credit for refreshing the look of the Die Hard franchise. Peter Menzies's Photography is gritty, though is use of 'shaky cam' in some sequences is quite extreme and yet again the late Michael Kamen's music adds to the proceedings. However the films visual effects are a bit of a mixed bag. They work best when they are at their most subtle (e.g. wire removal) and some of the more obvious visual effects, which was a combined effort by Sony Pictures Imageworks, Buena Vista Imaging, Pacfic Title Digital and Mass Illusion (who did some excellent work on Judge Dredd released the same year) don't always convince, but fortunately the rest of the film is do good it fortunately doesn't pull you out of the experience. To me it seemed like there were similar problems here that also had a similar effect on McTiernan's the Hunt for Red October.In summary, an excellent and highly enjoyable fun summer film, refreshed by a suitably new gritty take on proceedings, but slightly flawed by a too abrupt and anticlimactic ending and some sub-par visual effects",Null,3,4,1 December 2013
Hancock," Ludicrous spin on the super hero mythology is saved by winning performances by Smith, Bateman, Theron, and some hilarious LOL moments!
","This film tries to put a new spin on the super hero, creating an anti-super hero, very well played by Will Smith, and his journey to redemption thanks to a down on his luck salesmen, a terrifically sympathetic Jason Bateman. While the concept is clever, even with suspension of disbelief there are still an awful lot of plot holes.However, what saves the film are great performances, and a tongue firmly enough in cheek to make a subtle nod to the audience that the film's knows and embraces its own ludicrousness. It then has the balls not to care because the cast are clearly having a lot of fun and as the story moves along there are some very amusing set pieces and some huge laugh out loud moments, the best being Hancock's first run in with some prisoners when he voluntarily surrenders himself to the authorities for his own past misdeeds. Theron is also good value as Bateman's wife, and reason's for the character's guarded personality will reveal themselves as the story progresses, though this plot development ends up being a huge contrivance to help sustain the film's concept as at about the halfway point it begins to run out of steam. In fact the films story then veers off at a tangent and becomes a very different film as the climax is surprisingly grounded and intimate, and at this point the films suddenly, and somewhat out of the blue hits you with a face-full of pathos. Weirdly enough this actually seems to work dramatically and pulls you along to the end of the film, which then signs off with a few more very funny set pieces.Technical credits are first rate, with some impressive and very funny visual effects, provided by a team of companies led by veteran outfit Sony Pictures Imageworks and veteran Oscar winning Supervisor John Dykstra. Editing and music work well for the film and Peter Berg's direction is self-assured and confident enough to allow the film to zip past fast enough for you to almost overlook the plot contrivances and holes. However, the film's original theatrical cut is the much better version, and the directors extended version is notably inferior, particularly early on when scenes are either unnecessary, overtly gross and evenly shockingly disturbing and I am sure would have meant an R rating for the film had it been released. Had this been the original version of the film, it would have made it much more difficult for the audience to empathise with the lead character as some parts of the story in this cut of the film actually turn you off the character in a very big way.In summary then, a silly plot compensated for by a film that is genuinely exciting, funny and for the most part very entertaining.",7,1,2,3 April 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Best of the prequels, 3rd best overall
","Episode 3 falls short of the Empire and A New Hope as there are still a few minor weaknesses compared to those films but is much better storytelling than Episode VI, and is a very significant improvement over Episodes I and II.Firstly the plot is the best of the prequel trilogy, and is better than Return of the Jedi, whose otherwise excellent story was undermined by Ewoks. The plot is decidedly Machiavellian. Mostly the film succeeds very well. There are some thrilling and powerful montage/tone poem moments in the film. It seems that for the first time since A New Hope, George Lucas is that exciting and experimental film-maker of the seventies. The are some great moments: Anakin and Palpatine discussing immortality and morality during a opera; a fateful montage cleverly cutting between Anakin and Padme, which is underscored with novel, subtle and highly effective music as both look out windows from different parts of Coruscant; the Order 66 moment; a powerful sequence as a newly formed Darth Vader dispenses justice Sith style on both the Jedi and then the Separatists; brilliant juxta-positioning of Yoda's thrilling confrontation with Darth Sidious and Vader's fight with Kenobi; and a powerful sequence of the birth of ' Darth Vader in the suit' against the birth and Luke and Leia.However there are some minor problems with the plot. Some key plot points, such as who tampered with Jedi archive records in Episode II, and the mechanics of how the Clone Army was ordered aren't fully resolved. Criminally, Christopher Lee's Count Dooku is woefully underused and ends up being nothing more than a plot device to start Anakin's descent to the dark side. It totally undermines the good work setting up the character in Episode II (it was one of that movie's strong points), and is a waste of a fantastic actor. Padme's character, played by the talented Natalie Portman is still saddled with formal, overtly theatrical dialogue, and her scenes with Hayden Christensen early on in the picture still don't feel entirely accessible, albeit they are more enjoyable than in Episode II. She still seems to be working very hard to get some humanity into the character, which only seems to work at the film's climax. The scenes giving birth to Luke and Leia, are in my view too sanitised and far too brief, which is a shame when the rest of the film has an entirely appropriate harder edge. I felt that the resolution to the Padme character could have done with another scene. Audiences, as Lord of the Rings and Avatar have shown, will stay 3 hours if it is a great film, and that this film could have benefited with a bit more running time. I also felt there was a great opportunity to cameo Jedi Knight Qui Gon Gin from Episode 1 in this film. Unfortunately this was missed and just being referred to in dialogue doesn't have the same impact. Yoda's fate, for a character who was so involved in Episode 2 and 3 is left unresolved. I hope that Mr Lucas considers putting the deleted scene from the final part of the film back in for the upcoming Blu-Ray and 3D cinema releases. I was also very pleased the crass bungling by Jar Jar Binks and C3P0 in the previous films is absent.In terms of acting kudos has to go to Ian MacDiarmid in a brilliant performance, pulling Anakin in a very specific direction. Hayden Christensen seems to have a much clearer view of his character, and his relationship with Obi-Wan Kenobi, who is well played by Ewan McGregor. McGregor has got a real grip of his character and his performance is heartfelt, but tinged with moments of dry humour, both verbally and in his actions. His final showdown with Anakin is very powerful and really propels the film towards its inevitable climax. Frank Oz, and Rob Coleman's animation team at ILM excel themselves yet again, with Yoda being even more powerful and captivating than in any previous Star Wars film. General Grievous is well realised and performed, albeit his part is not really big enough to know about his character. Jimmy Smits gives a solid and engaging performance in a small but pivotal role as Bail Organa. Samuel Jackson is entertaining in his role as Jedi Master Samuel Jackson, and the character's fate is appropriate.Technically the film is brilliant. Digital effects are getting closer to photorealism all the time. The film's opening battle is brilliant conceived and ILM's team of Roger Guyett, John Knoll and Rob Coleman deserve credit for maintaining a very high standard throughout the film. The scenes on the planet Mustafar really benefited from the use of real eruption footage which is seamlessly integrated into the visual effects. It is a real surprise that the film didn't win any Academy recognition for its visual effects and probably is showing that ILM is not the only outstanding visual effects outfit out there. Sound effects by Ben Burtt, are as usual brilliant, and working with Roger Barton, Burtt has possible produced the best edited Star Wars film of all six movies. The pace is relentless and even in the few weaker dramatic sequences, the story never drags. There is some great make up work, particularly on Darth Sidious and the natives of Utapau, and credit has to go to Dave Elsey and Nick Gooley.However as usual, the premier technical contribution is John Williams score. He has, over the six movies written a terrific body of work, and this is, without doubt, his best score of the six films. The music is operatic, fresh, and highly charged, building to a wonderful climax that connects the audience beautifully to Episode IV musically, narratively and above all, emotionally.In summary, an excellent film that rounds off a fantastic cinematic journey spanning nearly 30 years.

Paths of Glory," Kubrick the auteur(well almost!)
","This is an excellent film.It shows that Kubrick is really pushing the boundaries of film-making despite the limits of a modest budget and strongly established film conventions of time. His decision to film in Europe really helps this film with excellent b & w photography and the emergence of the Kubrick signature tracking shots shot with a wide angle and large depth of field. The directing is pretty much flawless and the visceral battle sequences are pretty startling for a film made in 1957 on a just a $1 million budget.The story is fascinating, and providing you can get past the American accents, which is not to difficult, the politics of power is well observed. The machinations of specific characters, and their consequences for those at the sharp end, are also a comment of society in general, particularly how the powerful treat those lower down the social layers. Performances are very good, notably Ralph Meeker, Killing alumni Joe Turkel and Timothey Carey as three soldiers key to the story, supporting player George Macready as General Mireau and a thoughtful turn by Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax. Douglas plays understated extremely well, and the character's conflict and frustration with the situation he finds himself are well played. However, there is a determination to not give up his principles and humanity, which is the highlight and anchor of the movie.Production design Ludwig Reiber, costume design by Ilse Dubois, and b & w cinematography by Georg Krause are superb, and Kubrick's trademark camera-work really shows in this film for the first time.Interestingly I did notice a music track early on that sounds strikingly similar to the drum riff that introduces the preparation of the marines for heading down to LV426 in Aliens. It made me think whether a certain Mr Cameron is paying homage to some of Mr Kubrick's films in Aliens. After all Aliens opening is at the very least heavily inspired by Gayane's Ballet Suite from 2001.In summary a outstanding film that sort of marks the end of Kubrick's breakout phase, before he moved on to direct is one and only populist blockbuster.",10,1,2,7 March 2010
Blade Runner," One of the great science fiction films
","This film is a fascinating and involving experience if the viewer has the patience to experience the film properly. It has, despite its age, a tremendous visceral impact, especially if you can see it on a big screen in the dark. The final cut of this film is definitely the best version of this Ridley Scott classic. The plot mainly focuses on ideas and how the key characters in the film deal with the situation they find themselves in. The actors playing the genetically engineered human replicants all give original, fresh, unusual yet convincing performances in their roles, led by the strong and committed central performance of Rutger Hauer is Rory Batty. The journey these replicants are on plays alongside a separate journey of another Replicant Rachel (well played by Sean Young) as a company owned experimental model that, by using human memory implants, is convinced she is a human until forced to question her existence by an interrogation by human detective Deckard. Deckard is played in a surprisingly low key and introspective performance by Harrison Ford. How the Deckard character interacts with Rachel, while he attempts to track down the group of replicants led by Hauer's character (their presence on earth is illegal) is very steadily paced, but interestingly and effectively executed as a dramatic police procedural story, including immersing you the viewer in a brilliantly realised environment of a highly polluted 2019 Los Angeles. While moving through the films plot, the focus is on the gradual climax of the procedural story within the context of looking how these intelligent, super-strong, but emotionally child like engineered humans go on their journey to confront their human creator (brilliantly played by Joe Turkel as a billionaire recluse) about the truth of the nature of their existence. Juxtaposed against this is Deckard's disillusioned and largely emotionless human gradually having his humanity re- awakened by the development of an increasingly romantic relationship with Rachel, as well and questioning himself as to whether there is in fact a difference between humans and replicants. These plots are embedded is an amazing visual experience, largely down to Scott's amazing vision and execution (despite some well publicised problems during shooting), but brilliantly supported in its realisation by cinematographer Jordan Crowenweth, visual effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull and his Entertainment Effects Group Company, editor Terry Rawlings, production designer Laurence Paul and the truly amazing score of Vangelis. The final cut rightly restores an appropriate ending fitting to the noir overtones of the film, the original cut released in 1982 suffered from an out of place narration and ending that was not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the film. It was surprising that ET beat this film to the visual effects Oscar, as in my opinion the work on this film was far more impactful and impressive. Overall an outstanding film experience that has stood the test of time remarkably well. It will be interesting to see what director Denis Villenuve, who in my view is an excellent choice does with the long-awaited sequel Bladerunner 2049. An outstanding achievement.",Null,0,3,1 January 2017
Identity," Interesting idea that leads to an entertaining hour and a half
","This film takes the 'and then there were none' idea and puts an interesting new spin on it. The film cuts between two different stories that then intersect in a clever way, even though a fair dose of suspension of disbelief is required.Performances are universally good, with John Cusack effective in the leading man role, well supported by Ray Liotta and John Hawkes. The rest of the cast give good value, with an amusing, if slightly over the top turn by Rebecca de Mornay.Mangold's direction is very effective, and together with cinematography Phedon Papamichael, composer Alan Silvestri and production design Michael Freiberg produce a fantastic atmosphere that creates the ideal setting for this story to play out.While hardly a memorable film, it is an entertaining, suspenseful and well made one.",7,1,1,18 September 2011
Live Free or Die Hard," Not quite as good as its predecessors, but a fun action movie nevertheless
","After a 12 year hiatus between this and Die Hard With a Vengeance, John McClane is back in a fun adventure. While the film lacks the hard edge of the three previous entries, is unnecessarily sanitised in an attempt to get a bigger audience; lacks the emotionally satisfying epilogues of 1 and 2, and the brutal fun of 3,it is an entertaining outing that does actually play well to McClane's character, with Bruce Willis wittily acknowledging is older years, including typical parental anxieties about his growing up daughter and as a result has a subtly amusing 'I'm too old for this s***' vibe throughout the film. Supporting players are good, Justin Long's and Kevin Smith hacker characters are pretty entertaining, as is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a feisty Lucy McClane. Maggie Q is the standout villain is a ruthless, focused and largely silent character â€“ in fact her boss, head villain Thomas Gabriel (a seriously disgruntled ex-civil servant!) comes off not only weaker and less interesting compared to Maggie Q's character Mai Linh, but does not reach the heights of William Sadler's lead bad guy from Die Hard 2, and certainly is nowhere near the tension and power exuded by both Jeremy Irons and Alan Rickman as the Grubers from the previous entries. As a result of fewer interesting characters this time around, more of the burden falls on Willis, but he carries the film brilliantly, as usual. The plot is actually very clever, but as the film goes towards its climax, it begins to run out of steam somewhat, leading to a rather anti-climactic climax and not hugely satisfying epilogue. However the rest of the film is a lot of fun and very entertaining, with some great action set pieces and some funny wise-cracks. Pacing is very good and the film's interest never flags. Director Len Wiseman keeps the pace zipping along very nicely, and does try very hard to have the action set pieces as in camera rather than visual effects were possible. He also has a lot of reverence from the previous films, are there are some amusing nods to these if you pay attention. The climax with an F35B jet is typical Hollywood OTT and while fun doesn't have the finesse of the Harrier sequence from True Lies. Visual effects of are solid, Steven Duggan's photography is slick, as is Nicolas De Toth's editing . Marco Beltrami produces a very effective score, which stands up very well against Michael Kamen's work from the three previous outings, but brings a new fresh musical atmosphere to the proceedings. Overall and entertaining and fun picture, and while not quite as good as the previous entries is a worthy sequel.",8,3,5,13 July 2014
AmÃ©lie," Its charming, witty moving and hugely entertaining
","This is a charming, witty and moving film.The movie is steeped in enthusiasm, which is clearly driven by the films director, Jean Pierre Jeunet, and has clearly rubbed off on the cast and crew.The script is superbly constructed, and yet is semi autobiographical (re the director) in places. It is clever, multi layered, funny and moving - a rare combination these days. Even coming back to it more than 10 years after its made it still has the power to entertain and enthral. The humour is quirky but entirely accessible, and the film doffs it cap to a older Hollywood and French films - including a really moving and funny Tex Avery type gag.Acting performances are very good. Audrey Tautou is excellent, and anchors the film with a charming, affecting yet controlled and understated performance, despite the heightened reality of the world that it takes place in. Serge Merlin is also very good as the elderly neighbour who is the only character in the story who really understands Tautou's character. Other performances are very good but Mathieu Kassovitz's performance as the romantic interest comes across as a bit bland. This was the only quibble I had with the film.On the technical side, the design and photography are entirely appropriate for the picture, with clever visual effects by French company Duboi. The music by Yann Tiersen is absolutely superb and elevates this film to something really special.However, the ultimate credit has to go to director Jean Pierre Jeunet for putting together a wonderfully personal film with some real flair and charm, and yet making it extremely accessible.",Null,1,5,31 January 2010
Heat," A captivating crime saga
","After developing the proof of concept with the TV movie LA Takedown, Mann takes the idea to new heights in a nearly 3 hour crime epic. Within the confines of a mainstream, big budget Hollywood movie Mann's story is told from the perspectives of a group of bank robbers, the key policeman leading the hunt, and the wives/girlfriends of some of these characters, and the impact that the men's lifestyles has on the women in their lives. Al Pacino, while playing his role a touch theatrically at times, is compelling as the flawed hero dealing with the impending disintegration of his third marriage to a highly troubled and depressed wife(Diane Venora), while at the same time taking on an emerging antagonist in the form of hardened but analytical bank robber McCauley, played brilliantly by Robert De Niro in a realistic and grounded way. However, an interesting extra twist is that while Hanna's marriage is in trouble, McCauley hardened exterior hides a fact that inwardly he is falling for a female artist Eady (empathically played by Amy Brenneman) who is nevertheless not initially aware of McCauley's 'job'. The interplays are further layered by interesting dynamics playing in the film which include the other bank robbers, notably gambling addict Chris (Val Kilmer) and his wife Charlene (Ashley Judd), as well as the rest of the robber 'crew', and how events in the story impact on the crew and their relationship with other criminals who the viewer comes across in the story. I was particularly taken by a small but emotionally involving subplot that involves an ex-con (Dennis Haysbert.)This layering could have severely crowded the narrative of this film, but amazingly Mann pulls it off, producing a film that carries the viewer through the many effective subplots without losing sight of the main thrust of the story, which is a showdown between DeNiro's and Pacino's characters. This is beautifully set up through the much commented upon diner scene, which works brilliantly and prepares the audience for a terrific final two acts, which includes a truly remarkable shoot out in Los Angeles, that leaves the view horrified and captivated all at once. While Mann's direction is outstanding, he is ably supported by several technical contributions, notably photographer Dante Spinotti, and the fabulous editing by Dov Hoenig, Pasquale Buba, Tom Rolf and William Goldenberg. Elliot Goldenthal's music, together with other musical collaborators, creates a fantastic mood and atmosphere for the film, rather than accentuating particular dramatic moments in the film, and is an evolution of the work both Jan Hammer and Tangerine Dream did in Thief and the Miami Vice TV series. Neil Spisak's production design, together with Mann's own attention to detail in prepping the cast, leads to great verisimilitude despite the very slickly shot action sequences, albeit the character development is still allowed to shine through, leading to the films emotionally satisfying if tragic finale. An outstanding and landmark achievement, and together with The Insider, is one of the two best films from Michael Mann.",Null,1,3,6 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A New Hope - for the movie industry
","This was a landmark movie made by an independently minded film maker that ultimately created a blueprint for studio driven, manufactured summer blockbusters.However, very, very few subsequent blockbusters have come close to this. Thirty years on, it is still fresh, and the digital extras and clean up in the special edition work very well. Populist films nowadays do move at a relatively faster pace, but if you are willing to be just a touch patient and absorb the story it's a superb combination of fantasy, mythology and sci-fi, with a thrilling and absorbing climax.Performances are not really the point of this film, but Lucas's penchant for naturalistic acting seen in both THX and American Graffiti is very much present. The young cast works well, with the sparring between Harrison Ford and a young Carrie Fisher particularly notable. In fact Harrison Ford's roguish character plays off very well with all the characters he interacts with. Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing both bring gravitas to their roles and add contrast to the younger actors with a subtly more theatrical style to their performances. James Earl Jones's vocal performance is excellent and really makes Darth Vader work.Lucas's style of directing, which meshes classical composition with a more reality based European verite style of film making, actually works very well and gave the film a freshness when it was first released, supported by Gilbert Taylor's gritty photography . Even now, with some effective digital embellishments, it holds up against today's releases remarkably well. This was helped by the tremendous design work by production designer John Barry, mechanical effects maestro John Stears, and customer designer John Mollo, the former two being Bond movie veterans of the time. This was of course based upon Lucas's fantastic imagination. Lucas's nascent visual effects outfit, ILM produced ground breaking work that was brilliantly edited into the film by Lucas and his editorial team of Richard Chew, Paul Hirsch and some part time help from his wife at the time, Marcia Lucas. They got the right balance of real location footage with excellent production design with miniature optical effects. While the added digital effects are noticeable, (though some blend with the film flawlessly) their modest number added allows the film to maintain this reality based quality, something that the subsequent prequels lost sight of to some extent.Deservingly the film won 7 Oscars, for Art Direction John Barry and his Art Directors Les Dilley , Norman Reynolds and Roger Christian, the former 2 went on to be outstanding production designers in their own right, the latter becoming a film director as well.The landmark visual effects and special effects artists contribution was led by John Dykstra, who was the overall supervisor. He went to work on many more films including Star Trek â€“ The Motion Picture, 2 Batman films (the Joel Schumacher directed ones), and 2 Spiderman films, winning his second Oscar for his work on Spiderman 2. John Stears won an Oscar for his on-set effects. Richard Edlund was the main effects cameraman, and would go on and win 3 more Oscars for his work on Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Return of the Jedi while at ILM and would later run his own effects studio. Grant McCune, a miniature specialist, also runs his own effects company. Robert Blalack won for his optical compositing work and would go on to win an Emmy Award for his work on the famous TV movie The Day After.Building on Lucas's pioneering sound design work on THX 1138, the sound effects team contributed fantastic work in giving this film a reality based feel, with the use of real life sounds. The sound team was Don McDougall, Ray West (who would go on to win 2 Emmy awards for his sound work), Bob Minkler and Derek Ball. Ben Burtt won a special technical achievement award for his sound effects work and would go on to be a regular contributor on many high profile films, winning Academy awards for his sound work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, ET and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.However, for me the stalwart technical contribution has to come from film composer John Williams, with a truly landmark, Oscar winning score â€“ it was his third Oscar at the time and for me has gone on to produce a magnificent body of film score work â€“ present day included. The subsequent Star Wars prequel certainly owed a lot to him, as his magnificent work on these films went a long way to hiding some significant flaws that were largely absent from the original trilogy.Finally, huge credit has to go to Mr Lucas for having the imagination to put this together, and the tenacity to see the production through to completion despite many challenges, which included: a storm which damaged sets and held up shooting on location in Tunisia; some of the actors and film crew sceptical of what they were working on; some difficulties with the camera crew; a cynical studio; a rush to finish the film be a rigid deadline and challenges with getting ILM to finish the visual effects. While I know that the experience meant that Lucas stayed away from directing for some twenty years, he nevertheless became a hugely successful figure in Hollywood as post production guru and pioneer of digital technology, yet maintaining his independence outside of the studio system.A landmark achievement.",10,1,1,29 August 2010
The Thin Red Line," A supreme meditation on war
","After a 20 year absence, writer director Terrence Malick makes a triumphant return with a film that is an evolution of the style we saw in his first two films, Badlands and Days of Heaven. Where these two films were specific stories told in a surreal and subjective way, this movie is a much more of a meditation of war, with no real climax, just a series of interconnecting events.The focus of the story shifts across a series of characters, but starts and finishes with Private Witt, played in an understated, subtle and totally captivating way by James Caviezel. There are also good performances from various characters that move in and out of the story, the most notable being yet more impressively understated performances by Sean Penn, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas. Other characters come and go, with a Nick Nolte offering a more visceral, aggressive but still absorbing performance as Major Tall. Other characters have nothing more than extended cameos, coming and going briefly, the most obvious ones being John Cusack, John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, Adrian Brody(who doesn't utter a word of dialogue in the movie!) and George Clooney. It is impressive to see Malick working with these actors to keep their performances very grounded and subtle, but totally absorbing. This is mainly due to Malick's supreme skills as a visual storyteller, and it is clear that he has lost none of his skill despite this 20 year break. He composes scenes with long duration shots that involve a lot of improvisation, and he requires his actors to tell a lot of the story with expressions, using significant amounts of voice-over that is clearly added later and also improvised. The telling of this very emotionally and psychologically involving story is hugely assisted by some tremendous technical contributions. John Toll's photography, Jack Fisk's production design and Hans Zimmer's score (which seems to have been composed as a series of suites rather that to specific cues in the action) all have huge positive impacts on the film, and take the experience of watching it to another level. While the film deals with war, Malick's approach to the violence is tactful and diplomatic, but still visceral. While the film has long stretches of characters mediating, philosophising and reflecting on their experiences these sequences never drag and the action sequences, when they come, are brilliantly directed, technically amazing, and hugely involving emotionally, making you feel what the characters are going through, rather than a more detached view of 'that was a big explosion!'. There is some tremendous crane and Steadicam work ( the latter by Brad Shield), and it shows that Malick is one of those few directors who understand how to use these camera processes in a way that integrates it into the storytelling, rather than as a problem solving tool to shoot certain sequences, or to show off to the audience. The only other director who uses these approaches this effectively was the late Stanley Kubrick.There are some interesting inferences made in the film. There seems to be this subtext of the spirituality of life, as shown by the capacity of the wonderfully created natural environment to create harmony and peace, the more caring characters' appreciation of the natural environment, and the care of that some of the characters have for each other, including Captain Staros(played by Elias Koteas), and most notably the Private Witt character, who undergoes a transcendental experience through the story - there seems to a spiritual parallel here; and the questioning of the reason for this nonsensical violence by the some of the characters. Fascinatingly this is contrasted with the more brutal aspects of nature such as the fact that humankind is instigating violence on its own species. The selfish, personal motivations of Lt Colonel Tall's determination to achieve (who is driving the instigation of the violence, and points out his prospective brutal interpretation of nature during the film), the selfish barbarism of some of the US soldiers on their Japanese prisoners, and the individualistic motivation of the Mirando Otto's character towards her husband, played by Ben Chaplin, while he is bravely battling at the front. These 'Ying' and 'Yang' elements in the story seem to balance out very well, but even the characters who survive this story, all have scars to bear at the end. The only character who reaches inner peace and enlightenment is Witt, who of course despite his bravery and calm in the face of battle is essentially a compassionate pacifist. These subtexts, as well as the tremendous polished nature of the filmmaking, means that providing you are patient, you will have a terrific experience watching this film. Furthermore you will still be thinking about the themes raised in this film long after you have finished watching it.Overall, a wonderful experience from a genius of a filmmaker.",10,1,3,17 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Outstanding follow up.
","Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his onâ€“set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence.",Null,20,26,12 September 2010
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A fun and whimsical adventure full of heart, humour and character
","After the dark and nihilistic Temple of Doom, this franchise returned to form in a big way with an enjoyable and exciting plot, stylish direction, a real sense of warmth and the best cast performance in any of these films.The film opens differently from the first two, with a prequel prologue that is set up gradually. This sequence is an example of virtuoso visual storytelling, with very little dialogue and the story being told through a montage of David Lean inspired wide and epic landscape shots. It builds towards a superb and highly amusing action adventure sequence that very cleverly adds some character development to Indiana Jones, well played at this stage by the late River Phoenix. It then segues forward some 25 years with a very clever cut to the Harrison Ford incarnation.The strength of this story (a collaboration between George Lucas, Spielberg, and writers Menno Meyjes and Jeffery Boam, with no doubt significant input from Connery and Ford) is the Indiana Jones character finding his estranged father, played in a tour de force performance by Sean Connery. While there is the obligatory search for a lost artifact, in this case the Holy Grail, this search is the secondary plot, with the interplay between father and son becoming the primary plot. Despite just a 12 year difference in ages between Ford and Connery, their interplay works brilliantly and is the genuine heart of the movie. This powerful emotional connection between these characters is an ingredient that is missing from the previous two films and really brings this audience into the story. While the set pieces don't have the same level of ingenuity, relentless pace or sheer film-making bravado as Raiders of the Lost Ark,the film is far more character based, light hearted and emotionally involving than the previous two outings. The film maintains interest in these acting sequences thanks to wonderful performances. While Connery and Ford do dominate the proceedings, Denholm Elliot and Jonathan Rhys Davis offer excellent support again. Irish actress Alison Doody is highly amusing as Elsa Schneider, and it is a shame that her career didn't take off after this film the way it should have done. Veteran British actors Michael Byrne and Julian Glover have fun with their roles, and Byrne in particular is given some pithy one liners. The story builds neatly to a clever and powerful climax, leading to a warm and amusing coda at the end of the movie.Technically the film as accomplished as usual. However, the more character driven nature of the story means that visual effects take much more of a back seat in this film, and ILMs work is more subtle and understated in this film, making use of mainly traditional optical techniques and on set live special effects, with the one exception of a very well realised effect at the films climax which involved the use of stop motion combined the morphing technology overseen by ILM digital pioneers Doug Smythe and Les Dittert. The films centrepiece, a major action sequence set in the desert using horses, trucks, cars and a tank is carried off with usual Spielberg bravado and style, and works due to the audience following what the characters are doing, rather than the set piece itself. Kudos to Oscar winning special effects supervisor George Gibbs, second unit director Michael Moore and editor Michael Kahn and producer George Lucas (who also helped out with the editing) for making the action sequences look so polished and convincing. Spielberg even manages to insert little gems of witty dialogue and some terrific visual gags into the action, particularly one involving Indiana Jones incredulous reaction to using a Luger revolver. They work so well because they fit the situation the characters are in. The sound work is first rate, and Ben Burtt and Richard Hymns won Oscars for their sound effects. What is impressive is that because the sound helps convince you are right there with what is going on, rather than being loud and in your face. Burtt had already won Academy awards for his work on Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and ET. He has continued to work on a wide body of work since and is still one of Hollywood top artists in this area. Richard Hymns, after winning this first Academy Award, went on to win again in this area for Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan and has also worked on a series of high profile films including Avatar. Douglas Slocombe's photography is more understated this time around, but still stylish. The film seems to make a statement that it is the characters rather than the action which is to the forefront, and indicates a maturing of the franchise. John Williams score is, as usual first rate, but is more spiritual, emotional and deft in style, compared with the more militaristic and aggressively visceral style of the previous films.In summary congratulations to all the key collaborators for a warm and thoroughly enjoyable adventure, though particular mention needs to go to Spielberg, Connery and Ford for taking the series and in welcome and involving new direction.",10,4,7,27 November 2010
