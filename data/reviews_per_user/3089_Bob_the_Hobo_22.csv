Moneyball," A Ploddy, Unenthusiastic Look at an Amazing Story
","With the hype surrounding Brad Pitt's newest offering, I took it upon myself to venture down to the cinema to take in 'Moneyball'. What drew me in wasn't the story - I know very little about baseball - but a cast including the amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jonah Hill in a serious dramatic role. It had a lot to live up to.Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Pitt) is desperate to have his team make it to the top when young Peter Brand (Hill) offers an innovative system of hiring (and firing) members of the team based on their individual skill instead of overall talent. Beane sees something that could re-define the game and implements his and Brand's idea, to the chagrin of the A's manager Art Howe (Hoffman) and the rest of the scouting team.'Moneyball' is the second outing by who I considered to be one of the very best in the business, Bennett Miller. Miller gave us Philip Seymour Hoffman's finest (so far) performance in a similar historical film, Capote, which also looks at a flawed man and how his actions affected history. But that's where the similarities end. 'Moneyball' is a ploddy, angsty look at something that could really make an amazing film. Ultimately, it falls flat.All too often, I would catch myself interested in the upholstery of my chair or the size of the screen instead of what the characters were talking about on screen. It's rare that the film offers any analysis of why certain members of Beane's team were good. Instead, the audience is just told that they're good. That's that. I bet I would have loved this film if I knew who the ball players Pitt and Hill spend so much time talking about were. There's no explanation. I'm just expected to know who was a great player on the Oakland A's that particular year.I'm giving Bennett Miller's film five stars because of exactly that: Bennett Miller. I could tell that he was genuinely interested in Capote, but for most of Moneyball I was wondering if I was more interested than he or Pitt or any of the others were. The strongest performance comes from Jonah Hill, who effectively plays a very boring person. I belived that he was boring enough to come up with this system, and boring enough to not really care how everything turned out. Hoffman sleepwalks through a ten minute performance and about one line for every scene he's in.One very bright spot: Arliss Howard plays the manager of the Boston Red Sox and has a brilliant scene with Brad Pitt at the press box of Fenway Park. Howard effortlessly plays a very small role with unparallel grace. One of my rewarded starts is solely his.You're reading a review coming from someone who doesn't actively follow baseball, but likes a good sports film. I didn't find Moneyball to be a bad sports film, yet I can't say it kept my interest long enough to prevent me from dozing off by the seventh inning.",5,0,1,2 January 2012
World War Z," Which Ones Were the Zombies?
","Gerry Lane (that's pronounced Jerry, played by Brad Pitt) is a former UN worker of some sort who finds himself and his family right in the middle of the zombie apocalypse while living in Philadelphia. After being saved by another UN worker who just so happens to be a Deputy Secretary General, Lane and family are put on a UN ship that has also collected far too many other refugees, and Lane is presented with a mission: re- enlist and find out the cause of the virus, or your family is going to be placed in the significantly more dangerous refugee safe zones. Brad chooses the former, and off we go. It has the feel of a really good zombie blockbuster. It has the star, the known and respected director, and the source material. I kept thinking, 'can they go wrong?' Yes, they can. For one, they can deviate almost completely from the source material. Max Brooks's eponymous novel traced a surprisingly realistic account of what would happen should a violent global virus erupt and become a worldwide predicament. But the novel never mentioned the name of the mysterious UN negotiator conducting his investigation. It never introduced a character named 'Gerry Lane', let alone his family. It never introduced the question; 'why did Gerry leave the UN in the first place?' only for it to never be answered. It was much, much better that way.The problems with the film are in the script. The cast does a hit-and- miss job playing their roles but never seem to understand their lines better than the audience does. Just as Lane looks for the stem of the virus, the stem of scripted uncertainty is not in the world of World War Z but in the world of the four people who wrote it. Having more than one or two authors usually means that after the first draft, the script was circulated around and around until only faint hints of the source material are still recognizable when the movie starts filming. Lane flies all over the world, and the audience flies with him, only to find him no longer investigating but solving, shooting, and exploding.As Lane, Brad Pitt plays the role he usually plays of an only slightly less confident Brad Pitt. I kept thinking that the ending would bring about a shocking twist; he was already a zombie! Pitt shuffles through this script with all the interest of watching paint dry, and once an hour passes his ploddy performance grows weary. However forgettable his performance, I always see some of the audience uninterested in plot and only in Tyler Durden's face, so if that's why you buy your ticket, no shame. Just don't think you'll really remember who the main character is or what his mission is. As for his wife, Mirielle Enos turns in equally uninspired work as the only woman in the known world who doesn't seem to be able to create any romantic chemistry with People's Sexiest Man Alive. Following the conclusion of ABC's 'Lost', lead star Matthew Fox could have taken any role he wanted. By now he could even have taken Pitt's role at the helm of this film. But Fox decided to take a break for a few years, and now he is reduced to playing some guy who works on a UN helicopter. He might have even had a line. David Morse, the only other American actor I recognized, plays a toothless CIA spook imprisoned in a US military base in South Korea. Morse's performance was undoubtedly the film's best. Hearing the little whistle as he spoke through his gums was chilling as you read about Edward Snowden, Bradley Manning and the like. His too-brief role emphasizes the possibilities that present themselves when you turncoat the United States. Morse alone deserves a star for his work. Effects-wise, the infected weren't anything special, but how would I know that? What does a zombie truly look like? We never found out if the infection led to death of the host and reanimation. It didn't appear that anything external was actively rotting. Some of the undead appear a bit comical, and their gangly movements were just different enough to inspire scattered laughter in the theater. Some of the best scenes of the film involved Lane traveling to Israel and Wales, the only two countries he actually manages to visit. In Jerusalem, Lane discovers that Israel has built a wall to keep the zombies out. We never get an answer to the facts behind the wall; how big is it? Is it just around Jerusalem, or the entire country of Israel? Regardless, a band of street musicians somehow manage to provoke enough ire for thousands of the undead to scale the wall and attack the city. That band must have been terrible. As a zombie is appetized by the possibility of prey, the audience is intrigued by the possibility of entertainment. The undead eat the zombie for sustenance, but quickly want to move on for more. As part of the ravenous audience, I felt the same way.",4,6,12,30 June 2013
The Town," Tough, Realistic, Well-Acted
","I very much enjoyed Ben Affleck's previous directorial effort 'Gone Baby Gone', set in what seems to be crime filmmaker's paradise anymore, Massachusetts (Charlestown to be exact). This one seemed to be in the same vein and I liked the cast so I gave it a go.Affleck runs a bank-robbery crew that includes Jeremy Renner, Slaine, and Desmond Elden. They've had a successful run so far, but things change when Affleck falls for a beautiful woman (Rebecca Hall) that the crew takes hostage (but releases). Meanwhile, an unrelenting FBI agent (Jon Hamm) is focused on bringing Affleck's crew down, using whatever means necessary. The group decides to agree on a hit by a gangster named the Florist (Pete Postelthwaite), and plan on it being their last.This was a very enjoyable movie as well. I liked the absence of the political message and the move for more the 'Heat'-esque action film. Affleck's style is gritty and tough, and he does a great job with his source material. I've often said he's one of the most underrated people in Hollywood, and 'The Town' reaffirms that belief.While Ben Affleck is tried and true both in front and behind the camera, the rest of the cast is relatively unknown. Jeremy Renner, the up and coming actor who surprised us all in 'The Hurt Locker', does a fantastic job as Affleck's second in command. Jon Hamm is much the same way, he's great on Madmen and he's right at home in the movie biz. Rebecca Hall and Blake Lively are beautiful ladies and wonderful actresses as well. Desmond Elden and Titus Welliver return from GBG as well, playing different characters. Finally Chris Cooper and Pete Postelthwaite only have a handful of scenes (Cooper has one) but they show why they're some of the best there are.'The Town' made a fine one-time viewing but probably won't stick with me as long as I had hoped. It's got great characters, chemistry, and action. Definitely recommended.",8,2,4,24 November 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," I Love This Movie
","Walk Hard traces the life of Dewey Cox, an infamous musician you've never heard of, from his boyhood in Alabama and his last days as a major music celebrity.This is a role the vastly underrated John C. Reilly was born to play. He is absolutely hysterical in this role, and shows incredible musical skill performing the soundtrack. Reilly is just so, so funny in this, it's my favorite role he has ever done. A role you have to see to believe, he embodies Dewey Cox as if he was Dewey Cox.The music is great, all original hits inspired by the different time periods Dewey 'lived in'. I'm not a fan of Judd Apatow usually, but here his efforts are wonderfully concentrated with direction by Jake Kasdan, both of which wrote the script. Kudos on their best work, we see Dewey go through every decade, and the tribulations Dewey faces with love, drugs, and music.Jenna Fischer shows some surprising talent that's a far stretch from The Office, playing Dewey's second wife. Tim Meadows and Chris Parnell, of SNL fame, play hilarious members of Dewey's group. Raymond J. Barry plays disapproving father Cox in spectacular fashion.This is one of my favorite comedies ever, and well worth the ten rating I give it. If you haven't seen it, watch it. You'll love it.",10,1,1,14 July 2011
The Game," Great Film, Buy it Don't Rent It
","I suppose 'The Game' was the first film I ever saw that had a twist ending that was actually twisted. 'The Sixth Sense' was a great movie, sure, but the ending wasn't twisted. A shocker, yes, but not twisted. Even the killer from 'Se7en', Fincher's masterpiece, wasn't a twist ending. A twist, yes, a surprise, hell yes, but a twist ending? No.With Michael Douglas and Sean Penn headlining a cast that also includes James Rebhorn and Armin Muehler Stahl, you wouldn't expect a twist at all. No, with these actors you'd probably expect maybe a nice little thriller or maybe even a comedy of sorts, and that's why 'The Game' is such a masterful film. These actors are so completely taken out of their element it's scary.Douglas is Nicolas Van Orton, a rich man who's unhappiness in life has been noticed by his brother, the care-free, James Dean-ish Conrad Van Orton. Conrad gives an unthanking Nicolas a card for CRS, a company that will make Nicolas' life better. And so begins a long, perilous, and unimaginably entertaining psycholgical mind game where Nicolas' life doesn't just turn upside down, it turns inside out.I loved 'Se7en', so I had high hopes for 'The Game' and this film didn't at all disappoint. In fact it raised the bar so much that I've made a point to see every Fincher film since. (Fight Club and Zodiac are also fantastic films) The camera-work is awesome, with each scene having and holding a growing sense of claustrophobia.The acting is just superb. I don't think Michael Douglas is able to turn in a bad role. He's just as good in this as he was in 'Wall Street', and will be when 'Wall Street 2' comes out this month. Penn is also very good, showing his stripes as the free-wheeling brother. Deborah Unger is beautiful and underrated as an actress, I wish she'd be in more movies like this. Stahl and Rebhorn show why they are also some of Hollywood's most underrated blood.To sum it up, 'FANTASTIC MOVIE.' The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the film as a whole, awesome. The ending absolutely blew me away. Don't just rent this one, buy it, because you'll want to watch it again and again.",10,1,3,5 September 2010
Lincoln," A Masterpiece of Unparalleled Magnificence
","Our greatest President did not come from a wealthy home. He did not have an Ivy League education. Nor was he seen as experienced enough to take the office when he was elected amid one of the most politically volatile periods in United States history. But Abraham Lincoln was a leader of unparalleled strength, conviction, and honor, and Steven Spielberg's film brings to the screen the incredible story of how he united a fractured nation and ended the disease of slavery. 'Lincoln' begins at the start of the sixteenth President's second term. Newly re-elected, he has a unique opportunity to work within an also fresh House of Representatives and see an unprecedented Amendment added to the Constitution to abolish slavery in the country. Lincoln's goal is complicated by his personal life; namely his wife Sally's depression over the death of their first son, and the rising tide of Democratic congressman determined to retain law keeping slavery as is. No matter your politics, your race, or your background 'Lincoln' is a film that unifies us. After a particularly dirty Presidential election this year, it was re-affirming to see how different Abraham Lincoln was than the men who have followed him. Lincoln was calm, soft-spoken and rarely raised his voice. He was every bit a political animal as the others who have lead the United States, but he did so through leadership. So sadly rare is that in any political office. Daniel Day Lewis deserves more than an Oscar for his performance. Lewis deserves to go down in history as one of the finest thespians ever to grace the script. Here he embodies a man that serves as a hero to us all yet remains a mystery, none of us know how Abraham Lincoln spoke, or walked. Yet Lewis is Lincoln. We never doubt for a moment that the man on the screen is anything but our finest President. As his First Lady, Sally Field is as spontaneous and energetic as ever, though keeps with the documented depression and sadness that overwhelmed their family after the death of a son. She more than holds her own on screen with Lewis. Tommy Lee Jones is Representative Thaddeus Stevens, a short-tempered, quick-witted abolitionist on the side of the President to end slavery. Jones hobbles with a cane but portrays Stevens in thunderously strong performance. Hal Holbrook, James Spader, David Strathairn, and countless others are the rest of Lincoln's cabinet, other congressmen, and party operatives. Each performance is perfect to a minute detail. But it is detail that separates Steven Spielberg's film from any other historical biography; 'Lincoln' is as informative as it is entertaining. An enthralling script keeps the audience avidly interested as the set and person come to life. 'Lincoln' is an American masterpiece. No historical film before it has unified its audience while telling a story vital to the freedom the United States is honored to represent today.",10,6,14,19 November 2012
Paranormal Activity," Excellent Horror Film
","You all know the plot by now; a young couple is terrorized by a mysterious presence on their house, and the whole thing is caught on tape for our amusement and horror.Man oh man this was one of those scary movies you just WAIT for! The beginning gets to be a bit overdrawn, with one too many sex references, but once 'Paranormal Activity' gets going, it's on! It's one of the only movies I've cried out more than once on, may have been as many as ten times actually! See it! It's one phenomenon not blown out of proportion by the media! Paranormal Activity is truly scary!",9,0,2,25 November 2010
Elysium," Just Bad
","In a futuristic society, the poor live in squalor on a destroyed earth while the rich live on a beautiful space station called Elysium (hey, that's the title of the movie!). Max, a tough-as- nails but soft-at-heart felon turned worker, is exposed to radiation one day at the plant where he works and requires the treatment of a 'Med-Bed' - the rich way to heal yourself and relax at the same time. So Max sets out to get healed with the help of a scruffy hacker named Spider and a childhood friend who has recently returned (from where?), but only if he can get past the nameless ruthless mercenary hired by evil bad Secretary of Defense Jodie Foster. The one percent living on their own planet, and the poor banding together to exact revenge? Coming off the heels of Occupy Wall Street, this is just the movie the nation needs to heal itself and unite against the rich bad guys. But before the revolution begins, there are some questions we need to ask. How many rich people live on Elysium? The least someone can make annually to be part of the one percent is 300 grand. Lets round that up to 500 for the future...heck, let's round it up to a million. Say you have a couple hundred guys making a million, is that enough to build a giant spaceship capable of sustaining life for a hundred families? More so, how do you keep up with the costs up there? Surely it costs some hefty dough to keep those coal fires burning. Where does the money come from? Jodie hates the bureaucracy of Elysium and aspires to be President, so she hires a sleazy businessman (William Fichtner) to rewrite the space ships code to install her as President. I'm sorry, what? By that logic, anyone could scrawl their name on the US Constitution and claim it to be divine proof they need to be President. Was she planning on all the bureaucrats of Elysium to just blindly accept her? Fichtner is so successful at rewriting this code (it's never explained in any future detail) that he installs it into his brain, only to - you guessed it! - get hijacked by a bionic Matt Damon, who steals said code. I know the movie hates rich people, but come on. Implanting stuff into your brain to safeguard information when someone can easily steal said information? Max gets radiation poisoning. How? He works at 'the plant'. What does the plant create that radiates...radiation? It's never explained. He is told he has five days to live after he is infected. This plot line mysteriously disappears after he is turned bionic - did I forget to mention that? - by Spider. Does turning half your body into the Energizer Bunny save you from radiation poisoning? Damon understandably jumped at the chance to make the evil rich look bad. Never mind the fact that a large part of this movie's $116,000,000 budget went to his bank account. But he gives up not even halfway through this movie. You can see it in his face, that slow realization an actor has that he is in a turkey of a movie. Apparently he was the director's second choice. His first? Rapper Eminem. Maybe it's understandable why he is so demoralized. But the worst part of the film is Jodie Foster. It's as if the audio designer forgot to record whenever she spoke, and decided the best fix would be to use a dubbed voice that sounded as far away from Foster as possible. She starts with a British accent, which turns somewhat French, and ends somewhere in Eastern Asia. Some movies have a character or two that are unnecessary but there for an audience draw. They aren't needed to make the plot line progress. Here, it's as if every character matches that description. The only bright spot is Sharlto Copley, who seems to be the only one who cares about what's going on. This isn't just a lousy movie. It's downright bad. This isn't even worth the price of a Redbox rental. Maybe if Elysium finds its way on to HBO, and you're tired of looking out the window, or you've run out of sleep aids, it'll be worth the drawn out hour and a half.",2,1,4,6 October 2013
Avatar," Beautiful Visuals, Unoriginal Story
","So glad The Hurt Locker won Best Picture this year, much more deserving. I couldn't wait to see James Cameron back in action, like a lot of people, but I was really disappointed.No originality, AT ALL. NONE. Kevin Costner should've gone for a lawsuit, I mean 'Dances with Wolves' was basically the guideline Cameron made while making the movie! The plot was the most ridiculous, so many other stories recycled into this film it was like Frankenstein. Also, 'Unobtanium', or whatever it was called, was the mineral the big bad bad guys were destroying the land for. Cliché, ANYONE? I mean come on, that had to be some kind of joke. Plus, why were the 'evil' humans even after Unobtanium? If it's saving lives back on earth, I'll be honest and say 'Mine Away, Stephen Lang'.As for the acting, Sam Worthington isn't quite as bad as he was in Terminator Salvation, but he's still stiff as a board and uninteresting as a character. Thank God he was in his CGI Avatar most of the film. Sigourney Weaver is her usual tough broad, not minding lighting up a cigarette in the middle of a presumably gasoline filled complex. The only character that I thought was compelling was Stephen Lang's, and what a Dude he was! Ripped and scarred up, he's a perfect bad guy.CGI was good, and that was the only reason I gave this a 4 out of 10, Cameron's million's were well spent on creating Pandora.If you have to see this, go for the visuals and don't mind the giant plot holes.",4,1,4,29 April 2010
Jack Reacher," Intelligent and Engaging Action Blockbuster
","Following the massacre of five seemingly random people, a former military sniper named Barr demands to speak to 'Jack Reacher'. The District Attorney (Richard Jenkins) and the lead Detective (David Oyelowo) meet the mysterious Reacher, a former Military Policeman who has dropped off the grid for the past few years but reappeared on the behest of Barr. Reacher works with private attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) to find out the real question: is Barr actually guilty, or the pawn in a much larger game?'Jack Reacher' is based on an excellent book series by Lee Child. 'One Shot', this film's premise, is actually the ninth book in the series, but had one of the most intriguing premises to make a movie on. Tom Cruise produced the film, and under the direction Christopher McQuarrie we have an action blockbuster that doesn't dumb itself down and keeps the audience asking questions as the intelligently-laden suspense slowly provides answers. Tom Cruise tends to play effectively the same role whenever you see him in a movie, and here he does a great job playing Ethan Hunt's stunt double. Reacher is very smart and uses his military experience to put together realizations no one else would be able to. Cruise is funny and relatable here. It may be one of his best performances yet, especially in an action film. Rosamund Pike is as gorgeous as she is a good actress. Here she is tasked with making conclusions at the pace of the audience, and looking great opposite Reacher (no question as to either of those abilities). The only problem with her character is the lack of much character development. She is the leading lady and that's sadly the extent of her role. The supporting cast is a truly eclectic mix of actors you wouldn't expect to see together. The director Werner Herzog plays a murderous mobster Siberian who spent time in the infamous gulags and was forced to earn his name of 'the Prisoner'. Robert Duvall plays a former Gunnie who befriends Reacher and helps with the investigation. Jenkins isn't in the film much but is as good as he always is. Problems come through where they typically do in an action movie: the script. The Prisoner's connection with the mystery is never laid out in a clear way; we are forced to make a lot of our own conclusions, none of them it would seem are correct. Barr's connections and the reveal of who is 'in on it' don't hang together as well as they should. But none of that really matters. 'Jack Reacher' is an intelligent, comedic, always interesting action movie that kept my attention, and for that I am grateful.",7,4,9,7 January 2013
The Fountain," ...What?
","With the success of Black Swan, I took it upon myself to watch all of Darren Aranofsky's films. I thought The Wrestler was great, Requiem for a Dream was fantastic, and now The Fountain...I really didn't like this movie. In most of my reviews I try to summarize the plot, but I had no idea what was going on during the whole thing. I mean I got that Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz were married, and that they transcended time between three different times. But beyond that I really do not know what was happening in this movie.It's not like it was bad, I was really intrigued by the plot and I loved Aranfosky's previous work, Jackman and Weisz are really good, doesn't hurt to throw in Ellyn Burstyn, Mark Margolis, Cliff Curtis and Stephen McHattie, the score by Clint Mansell is as epic as he always makes it. But it just lacked.The conclusion will probably be different for you, but I just didn't like the plot enough to stay interested. I ended up playing solitaire on my computer, and honestly had more fun doing that.",3,1,3,21 April 2011
Man on Fire," Amazing Revenge film, one of the best I've ever seen
","I saw Taken not too long ago, with a friend of mine who suggested Man On Fire, which had a similar plot. Loved both, but Man On Fire was definitely better.John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an alcoholic with the type of past he doesn't want to think about anymore. (as is evidenced when he keeps hearing/saying 'No more killing') Creasy is given a bodyguard job from his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken). The job details looking after a girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning). Her parents (Marc Anthony & Rahda Mitchell) are afraid of the recent amounts of kidnappings in their home in Mexico City.Of course the inevitable happens, and Creasy goes after Pita's kidnappers with an incredible rage. 'I'm gonna kill them all' he says, and as he does, we feel for this washed up old mercenary.I haven't liked any of Tony Scott's films as much as I liked Man On Fire. The entirety is a relentless look at the character of Creasy, who we never like the way we like Liam Neeson's character from Taken. Creasy is beat up and always inches from breaking point. But when we see Creasy's breaking point and the power he unleashes with it, we have to applaud, and maybe laugh. (i.e. the anus & bomb scene) I would've given Denzel an Oscar for his role. Everyone else is outstanding, Dakota Fanning gave a haunting scream that keeps playing over in Creasy's mind. Walken is outstanding (he always is), and Mickey Rourke's three and a half scenes were great. It's a powerful story about revenge, and it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.",10,0,1,4 April 2010
The Wolf of Wall Street," A Surprisingly Bland Display of Debauchery
","Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an ambitious young Wall Street numbers-cruncher, working under an equally ambitious (though decidedly more corrupted) stock broker named Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey). Things are going well until Hanna's firm goes under, leaving Belfort to create his firm. Belfort throws together some sleazy characters (Jonah Hill, Jean Dujardin, Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal) to create a large securities fraud investigation-in-waiting, finally forcing him to use his conscience to decide between an extravagant life or a way out for himself.'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a nightmare, for both the characters and the viewer. A script that can't fit itself into coherence drones on and on about corruption, while never seeing fit to inform the viewer of exactly how Belfort became what he is. He just, is. We never learn much of anything about him. Nudity, drugs, and violence corrupt his despicable life. And that's what the movie is. In many ways, I would have learned more from watching a documentary about Belfort than watching this movie. For a Martin Scorcese picture, especially one written by Boardwalk Empire scribe Terrence Winter, I was shocked at the utter one- dimensionality of these characters. Belfort is a scumbag. Each and every one of his cronies are equally scummy. The only characters who seem to have any benevolence are Belfort's first wife (despite her many scenes, we never learn her name) and the FBI Agent pursuing the fraud, Kyle Chandler. Chandler might have had a name. If I saw the word 'Cop' across from his name at the cast and credits, I wouldn't be surprised. By far the worst part of 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is the structure. The end result looks like someone took scissors to the reel and haphazardly pasted the final third together. It's a complete mess, trying to force all the character development we didn't get for the first TWO HOURS into the final chapter.The only character who was at all interesting was McConaughey's, who as a powerful broker who loses it all perhaps served as the heaviest foreshadowing the film could offer. Yet we lose track of him after the first twenty minutes, and by the time you're numb from the waist down and your brain is turning into mush, you've completely forgotten McConaughey was ever there. Scorcese and DiCaprio should be ashamed. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is a disaster that engages its audience through the type of stuff I'd expect in a Uwe Boll film.",Null,13,26,25 December 2013
Kingpin," One of the Funniest Movies Ever Made
","Bowling legend Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) loses a hand to a group of drunks after trying to con them with fellow bowler Ernie McCracken (Bill Murray). Now a drunk promoter with a fake rubber hand, Munson is a shadow of his former self until he hears the fateful sound of a strike. Amish prodigy Ishmael (Randy Quaid) stands to be Munson's shot at winning the largest tournament in the country, but the road there is paved with consequence.This is one of the funniest movies ever made. The Farrelly brothers have given us countless laughs, but this is their best. It brings together some of the most unexpected actors, many out of their element in a comedy, to flawlessly turn a script into a comedic work of art. The laughs are typical Farrelly gross out while remaining truly, deeply funny.Woody Harrelson turns in one of his best performances as the down-but-not-out Munson, wearing a ridiculous wig, outdated clothing, and always his fake rubber hand. Each scene he's in is a lesson in how to lead a comedy, and reminds one of his early days on 'Cheers' as the bartender Woody Boyd. His co-star in Quaid is the same; whether it be the murderous, greedy Sheriff is 'Hard Rain', or here as the hilariously simple sure relative of the 'Vacation' movies Cousin Eddie, Randy Quaid proves his ever surprising versatility as an actor.Bill Murray also fires on all cylinders as the over the top McCracken, Harrelson's arch-nemesis. Murray's last scene is one of the best in the movie; with his hair tossed every which way and his eyes flooding with tears he makes you shocked that he's only been nominated for one Oscar. Vanessa Angel is mostly eye candy but she doesn't have to make up for any acting downfalls.'Kingpin' is well-casted, well-written, consistently engaging and always funny. It brings together a diverse cast and a great script to make one of the funniest movies of our time. Strike it off your bucket list.",9,1,3,4 February 2013
Inception," Best film of the Year.
","Christopher Nolan is a man who can't disappoint. Look at 'Memento' and 'Insomnia', his first films where the budget wasn't very high and he focused on character study instead of action. Now 'Inception' is what Nolan can do on a big budget.DiCaprio (one of Hollywood's finest talent, I believe) is Dom Cobb, a man skilled in the 'art of extraction', you could say. He goes in to a man's mind to find ideas and steal them. Cobb and his men (including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy, and Ellen Page) are soon contracted by a powerful businessman named Saito (Ken Watanabe) to infiltrate the mind of business rival Robert Fisher (Cillian Murphy) and make Fisher lose the power in the company, by making Fisher hate his dying father (Pete Postelthwaite).After a mostly dull year at the movies, we get 'Inception', which promised to be (and was) the most fantastic film of the year. Nolan triumphantly returns after 'The Dark Knight', and brings with him the cream of the crop of acting talent.How Leonardo DiCaprio has not gotten an Oscar yet is a complete mystery to me, but perhaps this is his year. His performance as Dom Cobb was the best so far this year, maybe he'll grace the Kodak stage this year? JG Levitt is a great younger actor and shows us that he'll be one of Hollywood's finer younger actors, and we already know that the same is true of the beautiful Ellen Page, who steals each scene she's in as the newest member of the group.Marion Cotillard, what can I say. This woman is a wonderful actress and a stunning beauty whose only fault is that she cannot disappoint. 'Inception' is made all the better because of her. Tom Hardy is another great younger actor and is a joy to watch as the free-wheeling 'Eames'. Cillian Murphy is always great, he's just as good here as he was in '28 Days Later'. Michael Caine and Tom Berenger are classic Hollywood actors and it's great to see them around.See it. The year's best film, and I've got my money on 'Inception' bringing home the Oscars this year.",10,2,6,6 September 2010
Prometheus," Nothing Short of Breathtaking
","Following the discovery of a series of cave paintings all depicting the same other-worldly beings cradling a series of galaxies, a multi-billion dollar mission is funded by the enigmatic entrepreneur Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) for a group of scientists headed by Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) to visit a moon on a planet trillions of miles away investigating the ultimate question: can we meet the Gods that created us?Ridley Scott's finest science (fiction?) epic ever poses a million questions and does something rare in having the audience try to find the answers themselves. Damon Lindelof returns to the same thrills that drew similar viewers to 'Lost' by penning a script with Jon Spaihts that stuns and thrills while never trying to oversimplify its message. Charlize Theron and Noomi Rapace head the cast as strong, independent, willful women who travel light-years away to prove their power. Both turn in strong, Oscar-worthy performances aside a supporting cast including actors such as Idris Elba as the tough captain of the 'Prometheus' vessel and Logan-Marshall Green as a scientist desperate to find the meaning of his life. Michael Fassbender here plays an android, David, created by Weyland to keep maintenance of the people involved and the mission itself. As the humans around him try to find out who created them, he lives his life knowing why he was created, and it torments him. Fassbender's performance alone wins the film ten stars. An Oscar is not enough for his work here. The worlds we may never know in our lifetime are brought stunningly to the screen using breathtaking cinematic effects that are not used strictly as a budget expense, but as a character in themselves. The score written is profound and beautiful, using the entire orchestra to emphasize the profundity of what these characters discover. The combination is pure movie-going magic. There will naturally be a sequel and it will naturally not be as good as its predecessor. Perhaps that will be because it answers the incredible questions asked by the first film. But is that not the question 'Prometheus' asks us to ask ourselves in the first place?",10,11,22,24 November 2012
Taken 2," Clumsy, Ploddy Summer Sequel
","Following the events of the first film, Brian Mills (Liam Neeson) is in Istanbul, Turkey with his ex-wife (Famke Jansenn) and daughter (Maggie Grace) when the vengeful father (Rade Sherbedjia) of one of Mills' victims from the first film arrives with a group of armed men to 'take' them all. Hilarity ensues. Pass the popcorn and drink your soda, 'Taken 2' is as clumsy and ploddy as the first was intelligent and fresh. This summer sequel was made to give people an excuse to sit in an air-conditioned room to get their bodies and minds out of the heat. Friends of mine that enjoyed it saw it when they were wearing shorts. Perhaps the fact that I watched it in the winter made me enjoy it less. Neeson is as good as he always is, returning to his mystical role as a fatherly badass perpetually ready to dole out some deserved punishment to whoever is unlucky enough to want to do him harm. But his eyes are a little more dim, his movements a little less tense. It's the little things that convey to the audience that his heart just isn't in this one.Famke Jansenn and Maggie Grace, both stunningly beautiful women, hold this guy viewer's attention about as much as Neeson. They play the women in this man's lives with as much bravado as they can manage in their mostly listless lines. Rade Sherbedjia, the usual stock Eastern-European baddie, definitely chews the most scenery in a very good performance.Having been to Turkey and Istanbul a couple of times, I can say without any doubt that the nation seen in this movie is markedly different than the real one. The Turkish people are wonderfully kind and the country is as beautiful as anything in Europe. If you're seeing this film because you've seen the real thing, be ready for as much disappointment as bummer.I didn't have too much fun writing this. I would have had more fun watching 'Taken 2' again. Perhaps that is as good as an analogy as I can think of to both end this review and offer my warning.",5,0,0,30 January 2013
Flight," An Emotional Tailspin
","Denzel Washington is William 'Whip' Whitaker, an alcoholic pilot who, after a night of heavy drinking, remains drunk well into the morning he is to fly a plane into Georgia. When his flight goes into a sudden tail- spin, Whip manages to save all but six lives through his crash-landing. Whip is a hero until his toxicology report comes up positive for everything under the sun, leaving the airline, Whip's union, his friends, and Whip in a tailspin of their own. I have often thought that Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors to ever grace the silver screen, and he proves that assertion with a film that is assured to receive him a sixth Academy Award nomination. Here is a man broken beyond measure, stumbling through his lost life until unprecedented new stress is placed upon him. Not even the intervention of those he holds close can stop his self-destructive nature - or can it?Robert Zemeckis has been on a sturdy path with animated films recently, so it was with a bit of apprehension that I saw his most recent live- action offering since 'Cast Away'. But have no fear. The direction here is clean, crisp, and efficient as ever, producing a simple, but powerful script by John Gatins, chock-full of par-none supporting roles by the likes of John Goodman, Don Cheadle, and Bruce Greenwood. Undoubtedly the best part of the film - besides the wonderful cast - was the soundtrack. Joe Cocker, Bill Withers, and more are used expertly to mold into every emotion, sometimes emotional roller coaster, Whip experiences. Each song (some used more than once) slips seamlessly into the background and keeps the audience following more than the script. 'Flight' is a powerful, dark, character study about a man who has fallen to his darkest depths, and finds out how to fall farther. It sees Denzel Washington in top form and Robert Zemeckis' triumphant return to the live screen.",9,120,150,19 November 2012
The Purge," Brilliant Concept Bogged Down Under It's Own Weight
","In 2022, the United States has been overtaken by a new legion of Founding Fathers who implement a twelve hour period of near-complete lawlessness aimed at allowing citizens to properly vent frustration built up over the year. The Sandin family, led by patriarch James (Ethan Hawke) has a fancy security system designed to keep the violence out and the family safe inside, but that all changes when son Charlie allows sanctuary to a homeless man fleeing a band of murderous freaks.'The Purge' is an absolutely brilliant movie concept that gets so bogged down in the weight of its own message that it reverts to an average-at- best action-horror flick. The script sees fit to introduce a fascinating idea, that of a night of pure terror sanctioned by the government, and the ramifications that bad decisions can bring. It tries to prove violence as an answer to pent up emotion, but gives little payoff for the few humane enough to say 'no' to the destruction. The biggest problem here is simple explanation. Just throw in a sentence here and there to explain the following; Is it really beneficial to the economy to allow people to use extreme measures to do whatever they want? If buildings collapse or manual workers are killed, what happens to profits? Are taxes at sky-high rates to pay for all the wounded receiving treatment afterwards? Little things so unexplained. Why is the rebellious boyfriend even in the script, what did he do to advance the plot? He is forgotten by the end. Acting wise, Ethan Hawke does a good job as the father trying to protect his wife and family. Yet you'd think, for a security salesman, he would implement a fail safe or two preventing young kids from opening intricate home defense systems with the touch of a button. Lena Headey is breathtaking and makes a great heroine, but she seems to have the bare minimum interest in her children's well being, not even knowing where either of them are for most of the film. Rhys Wakefield makes for a creepy but unmemorable villain. This is a decent movie and worth a rental. It will make you think, but not of the morality or immorality behind the Purge. Instead you'll be scratching your head as to the incompetency of the Sandins. Perhaps diverting your attention from the inhumanity of the Purge is the point.",4,1,1,12 November 2013
Cloud Atlas," An Unforgettable Experience
","We have all heard that our actions in the present will impact the actions others will make hundreds, thousands of years in the future. 'Cloud Atlas' defies that idea by replacing 'others' with 'we'. Over six story lines spreading from the historical African slave trade all the way to a post-apocalyptic future, people cut from the same mold make decisions in their present that effect who they are to be in the future. The Wachowskis and Tom Twyker have engineered a thrilling, romantic, truly unforgettable epic.Screen writing is without a doubt the most difficult aspect of making a film. Everything hinges on how well the plot hangs together, how the lines create conflict and chemistry and make these essentials go together seamlessly. The authors of 'Cloud Atlas', who also directed the piece, had a blueprint in David Mitchell's book, but still had to adapt a Star Wars-like future and an early 1900's English countryside into the same film without the plot falling apart. The Wachowski's and Tom Twyker have done exactly so, which is reason enough for this film to succeed. The actors, including Oscar winners Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, and Susan Sarandon along with Hugh Grant, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw and the underrated Keith David, all perform with downright majesty considering the complexity of the as many as six characters each play. It takes true talent not just to eloquently read lines but also to understand the director's vision, and each performance fits like a glove into the world each of the six stories has created. 'Cloud Atlas' is the top of the list of ensemble films. The best line of the film comes near the end; 'From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime, and every kindness, we birth out future.' We would all be well to remember this.",10,6,9,3 July 2013
The Hangover Part III," Better Than You Expect, Not Better Than You Hope
","Some time after the events in Bangkok, Stu (Ed Helms) and Phil (Bradley Cooper) have turned thankfully towards mundane lives with family, but Alan (Zachary Galifianakis) remains unsettled. The ramifications of a giraffe purchase send Alan's father (Jeffrey Tambor) into cardiac arrest, reuniting the Wolfpack with the intention of sending Alan to a mental rehabilitation facility. On the way, the four are attacked by a gangster named Marshall (John Goodman) who wants several million dollars worth of gold returned to him after being stolen by Chow. The first film in this series was a breath of fresh comic air - timely, hilarious, a real 'guy movie' that the ladies wouldn't have any part of. The sequel was a summer blockbuster; not as funny, considerably darker, but still a worthy addition to the Hangover brand. The finale drops the premise of its prequels to focus on three action packed days with nary a mention of the drugs and alcohol that sent our heroes into a memory loss stupor. The third is different entirely from the first two, and therefore can't be compared as the third in a trilogy, but as the sequel to the first two. One of the most fascinating characters is Stu, the dentist with a dark side who does things that I'm not sure I am able to write about here without being reported. The most tame act he commits is a sham marriage to a baby-wielding prostitute, yet in the third film he manages to drive a limo around. Crazily. Phil, the level-headed macho man, makes the obligatory call to tell the others the trio has give up. Here, he helplessly looks around as Chow plays them for fools. Even Alan, played by the expert comic Galifianakis, only gets chuckles as he hits on the fat girl from Bridesmaids who expertly plays the fat girl from Bridesmaids. The characters are less developed and do less, which should be expected in the trifecta, but perhaps we expected more out of Todd Phillips and his crazy, drug-addled world. The formula is gone but the characters are there, the hilarity is gone but the situations are there. It's difficult to judge The Hangover 3. It plays out like it has been filmed but not finished; as if this is the bow hastily tied on to the series before the temptation to make more could be unwrapped.",Null,1,2,23 May 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Bad, Bad, Bad! Terrible Summer Blockbuster!
","Why does this series keep churning these movies out?! The second one was terrible, the first was hardly bearable. The most recent edition was as bad as the rest.I won't try to describe this 'plot', it's just not worth it. Shea Labouf is terrible, and Rosie-Huntington Whiley makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep. Greats like John Malkovich and Frances McDormand show up, and for what? They are great actors in a terrible movie.As usual, big, incomprehensible robots duke it out in the middle of a city, and destroy everything they touch. No surprises there. These effects make all the robots blend into one giant metal mass, an ugly visual that makes no sense.Just terrible, not even McDormand, Malkovich, or John Turturro could save it. Watch something else.",1,12,27,5 July 2011
