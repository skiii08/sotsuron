The Perks of Being a Wallflower," I hate it for loving it
","You will hate this movie. There's no question about it. You will hate it because you will find it stupid and/or boring... or you will hate it because you relate to it so much. In the case of the second one, the hatred will be caused by the disconnection from reality as real life is rarely this perfect for an introvert. If you're neither, then I find not point for you watching this. It's well made and rather well acted, however relating to this, adds so damn much that regular watching might just seem stupid. I've watched it a couple of times and it's true on all levels... even the awkwardness. No complains from me, but then again, I am a light critic.I have to give this movie one thing for sure... it does capture the mind quite perfectly. Our mind is the biggest source of our troubles and this movie shows it quite nicely.",8,2,3,13 April 2017
