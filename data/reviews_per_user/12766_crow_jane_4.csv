The Ring," The sophisticated cousin of a large family
","First, I saw The Ring. I stayed at my friends house, drinking coffee in her kitchen and talking about the movie, until 2am. I went home and slept with the light on. My curiosity, however, was piqued. My friend and I then rented Ring and Ring 2 to see how the Japanese versions stacked up. We watched them in her lounge room, alone, with the lights turned off, yet neither movie elicited in either of us the same response as the American version. To my, perhaps overly westernised view, each contained only one truly scary scene, in the first, the 'Sadako leaves the TV' scene, and in the second a scene where Anna appears as an oblivious ghost, but then turns around and looks at the main character.I then read all the information I could find on the net, and then one day in Borders I saw the book had finally been translated and published here. It was a great read, very different from the movies, and, apart from being incredibly sexist (all the women in it are either evil or insipid, the Rachel Character is, of course, a man) one of the best contemporary stories I have ever read.However, it opened my eyes to a plot hole I had ignored in the movies, which is; if Sadako/Samara wants everyone to know her pain and spread it like a sickness, why would she not SAY SO? In the book, the video is like a chain letter, featuring a 'If you do not pass this on within 7 days, you will die' type warning, however, that part has been taped over by the teenagers as a prank. Apart from that, and the odd inclusion of horses, and the fact that the DVD has a trailer of Catch Me If You Can as a Special Feature, it is a very scary, well done movie with brilliant sound and lighting, and a breath-takingly chilling performance by Daveigh Chase. Some of the story changes, such as Samara's mother being the one who put her in the well, and of Samara being killed when she was still a child, were good choices for this film. Someone said here that the end is a disappointing sequel chaser, which is missing the whole point of any of the movies, and certainly of the original story- which was that 'it won't stop'. It will spread throughout the world like a virus, replicating a re-replicating itself until everyone has experienced the horror of Sadako.",7,1,2,30 January 2005
Shaun of the Dead," brilliant...except they killed bernard *cough*dylan*cough*david
","the only reason i rented this movie was that there was a half price deal on the second movie at my local video ezy and my boyfriend is a fanatical black books fan and i felt he deserved something for agreeing to watch bridget jones two with me. bridget jones! ha! (not that it's not a watchable movie...with a great fight scene. but ha!) i've never seen a zombie flick, and i didn't watch this as a zombie flick, and everyone who complains about it in terms of it being a zombie flick needs to understand that simon pegg is a comedian. but! people also need to understand it's not a spoof. this is spaced humour, this is black books humour. this is *that type of British comedy* humour. and it's bloody hilarious. my only complaint is David's death, and not just because i, like my boyfriend, am a black books fanatic, but also because up until then the movie hadn't been particularly gruesome, so disemboweling, however fake it looked upon repeat viewings, was a bit of a shock. and i have to admit the end was an anti-climax both dramatically and comedically. but i'm willing to overlook this on account of its humour, originality, and the fun we had going 'hey! that's the girl from episode whatzit of black books' or' i know. ed was the security security security guy!' oh, and i read somewhere someone complaining about how the movie broke away from 'zombie fact'. zombie FACT?? .......................",9,1,2,12 May 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," but....but....but.....why????
","how could this happen? in the first matrix movie we are given both a great story and a great set up for sequels. i was so stoked when i heard that they were releasing two follow up movies. i wish i'd never seen them.i can't watch the original movie now without remembering the descent into overblown mediocrity - as much of a tautology as that sounds - that followed. characters degenerate - Morpheus especially. No longer the enigmatic, idealistic, self-sacrificing leader he once was- he's now a pathetic General wannabe who has to make overly loud speeches to compensate for lack of substance. And what's with Neo's premonitions? His ability to affect the machines from outside the Matrix? I was hoping against hope for a dual matrix revelation, but instead we're left with vague explanations and made to feel that they're either too obvious or too complex to explain to *us*i did like the final battle for Zion, the special effects were great and it was realistically gritty, even if the acting was incredibly uneven.....but i thought neo's awkward, anti-climactic death was an insult even to keanu reeves. and that ending better not be a signal for ANOTHER movie...",3,1,2,31 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Pope Yoda and the Revenge of Sooky La-La
","I was all prepared to like this movie. I found the other prequels dull but had read all the good reviews of RotS by others in the same boat. So how disappointed was I.I could whinge about all the let downs, but a lot of people have already done that. So my main points on what I loathed and how Lucas let us all down are as follows:What exactly did we gain from watching this movie? We all knew Anakin was going to turn to the dark side, and that's basically what happened. Over the course of three films a petulant, sooky, talented kid grew up to think too much of himself, showed off his lack of intelligence and fell for the dark side for no apparent reason. Right, he'd had some dreams about Padme dying. So, he believes the evil guy is going to help him. Maybe believable before he found out Palpatine was the Sith Lord, but afterwards it smacks either of an IQ somewhere in the low teens or Lucas being too lazy and/or preoccupied with CGI to come up with something believable. However, part of me did not blame Anakin for turning to the dark side when the other option was to be a priest in the thou-shalt-not church of the Jedi. We were seriously wondering if anything wasn't the path to the dark side. I mean, if you went up to Yoda and said 'Hey Yoda, let's do lunch!' would he reply with 'the path to the dark side lunch is'? In this movie, probably. Women are generally not portrayed well, portrayed at all, in sci-fi movies. However, in the original Star Wars films, we had the brilliant character of Leia to compensate for all the Y chromosomes flying around. In TPM, Padme seemed to almost fill the void, in AotC she did sporadically, but in RotS she became a spineless sop with no backbone or brain. The one time she expresses her views on the war Anakin gets angry at her so, instead of having an argument or at least sticking up for herself, she goes 'Hold me' and chickens out. After Anakin tries to kill her, instead of asking if the bastard's good and dead, she's all 'Is Ani OK?'.and I seriously wonder if she was wearing a corset under the multitude of pretty clothes that were her only voice in the movie, and if all she did whilst pottering around in that apartment was embroider and sigh, since Lucas assigned her the 19th Century fate of dying from a broken heart. If roles were reversed, Anakin would hardly have died of a broken heart, would he? Nooo, cos he's a man, man.One potential for drama in this movie, which I was looking forward to, was the hunting down of the Jedi. Lucas should have watched 'Elizabeth' before shooting those scenes, because they lacked even the hint of dramatic tension or suspense.Basically, what Yoda should have said was 'gullibility path to the dark side is' or 'mind- boggling naivety to the dark side leads.' Because that is the main moral of the story, and all the rest was a load of computer-generated excrement",3,88,167,27 May 2005
