The Expendables 2," Meh
","Dumb everything that was good about the first one (character development, likable characters, almost believable action scenes, story, music) and add more stupid 80s-action-stars that appear for no reason what so ever out of the blue, say a stupid one-liner and kill 50 enemies without reloading.I didn't like it when in the first movie at the end all the soldiers were painted like 'warriors' so they wouldn't appear human anymore, making it easier on the viewer to kill as many of them as possible as gruesome as possible. This time they took a different approach, there are just so many bad guys randomly appearing, you never even feel like there is something violent happening. This movie reminded me of CoD, endless spawns of mindless drones that are too easy to kill and never hit anything.Better save your bucks or be high or drunk when watching this...",3,1,3,14 October 2012
Twilight," a music-video with holes
","I never cared for the twilight hype, could be cause I am not 14 anymore. So this was on TV the other day and I had nothing better to do.It bothers me, that I cannot stop thinking about this movie. It had potential if it only had been done right. There is next to no character development in this. We never learn why anyone does what he does and thus I have no reason to care for anyone, there are plot holes you could park a truck in, the acting is 'not good' to be generous and the 'effects' are cheap.I quite enjoyed the parts when this too long music-video stopped pretending to be a movie, the rest was plain boring clich√©. I cannot shake the feeling the hole point of the 'movie' was to start a franchise... I guess it worked.",3,4,6,29 March 2011
