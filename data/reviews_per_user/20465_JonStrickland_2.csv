Minority Report," One of Tom Cruise's Best
","Minority Report is an excellent movie that is set in the middle of the twenty-first century, where the environment, which is quite futuristic, provides scenes somewhat similar to those in The Fifth Element and Judge Dredd. In terms of story lines, it is Gattaca meets The Fugitive.For those who enjoy stories that deal with Utopias created for the safety of mankind but have underlying flaws that place innocent lives in jeopardy, Minority Report is a must-see. Throughout are  perpetual chase scenes, where one is eluding authorities who are trying to secure a sophisticated but fatally flawed, Brave New World society.",Null,0,0,20 January 2003
Elizabeth," A post-Medieval Queen Who Could Get Medieval
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Elizabeth is an excellent movie that pays tribute to Queen Elizabeth I, who is portrayed as a woman who advances from a somewhat timid, introverted lady to one who, as the ruling monarch, is credited for leading England to the Golden Age of its history.Upon succeeding the throne of her half-sister, Mary of Scots, Elizabeth is dealt with powerful opponents who are heading the Catholic church and are looking for an auto/theocrat who, as her immediate predecessor did, will continue to make Catholicism flourish and put those of other faiths at the burning stake. To make relations even more strained, Elizabeth seeks to loosen ties with Rome and instead of helping make Catholicism even more prominent, desires to establish a Church of England. In consequence, not only do these particular standpoints sit unfavorably with many of the local governing leaders, but in the eyes of several, the fact that she was not born into the Catholic faith discredits her from being a righteous heir to the throne.Throughout the movie, both enemies and concerned loyalists to Elizabeth mingle with leaders from France, Spain and Rome to undermine her authority as Queen of England. As a result of the social engagements that come about, Queen Elizabeth I is faced with the following ultimatum provided by her immediate advisors: She can marry the ruler of either France or Spain and thus make England subordinate to her husband's country, or she can give up the throne and, in consequence, open a wide gateway for the oppressive, religious persecutions to continue.
*****WARNING:POTENTIAL SPOILER!!!!!******In reaction, Elizabeth decides to disregard her counsel. She desires to remain in power without the reliance of marriage, and upon foreseeing the troubles that might come about, she replaces her administrators and appoints a confidant whose political opinions and updates are those she trusts.Frequently throughout the picture, there is one among her supporters who questions her ability to take on her foes simply because of her gender. But as a response that sets the tone for the remainder of the movie, she looks at him straight in the eye and proclaims that she is her father's daughter and that, if necessary, she can have the heart of a man.
After viewing this retort, an individual might think that perhaps Elizabeth wants to revive Henry VIII's reigning style and that coupled with the determination to have the heart of a man, she will summon the strength to triumph. In fact, one might assert that by themselves, both the affirmation that she is Henry VIII's daughter and her steely resolve will be the essential keys to victory. But I say that only the right person with these traits could possibly succeed, and with time, Elizabeth portrays herself with increasing charm, intelligence, and grace, all of which eventually help her to become immortalized as one of the greatest rulers of history.Along with the strong, personal attributes that eventually propel Elizabeth to victory, the actions of her once intimidating opponents add only fuel to the fire, which has by then become her increasing, but well-managed, ire. For after finding out that those who placed serious threats to her throne have also put their signatures on documents declaring that she is an illegitimate ruler who is to be put to death, she sees where things clearly stand and is motivated to face this hateful resistance with the unrelenting scorn of a genius woman who will do whatever it takes to maintain her authority.",Null,0,0,20 January 2003
