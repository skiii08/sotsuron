Saturday Night Fever," Disturbing disco (spoilers included)
","This movie came out when I was a child, and Vinnie Boberino (of Welcome back Kotter) was basically a household name. I was too young to see his movie debut, but the producers for some strange reason (curse them!) decided to release a kinder, gentler, super-edited version for under aged Welcome Back Kotter fans. I was dragged to the movie to see this by a friend who bought into a lot of hype regarding how great the movie was supposed to be. Mind youI was like 9 or ten years old and would have rather seen Star Wars (for the fifth time), Superman, or anything by Disney. What I expected to see was something humorous, with a lot of dancing and music What I actually did see was shocking, appalling, disturbing, and frightening despite the heavy editing that cut the film down to like one hour and fifteen minutes (or thereabouts). The scene where his buddy jumps off a bridge gave me nightmares for weeks, and despite the heavy editing the rape scene was stillwell, a rape scene. A few years later, when I was in High School I finally saw the full-length unedited version of the crap-fest to see if my opinion would change if I a) realized there was more of a plot while viewing the full version or b) was a little older, and more mature. Sure enough, it appeared to me as no less of a smutty crap-fest than it did the first time around. In fact, I grew to hate it more. Despite a film that glorifies being a low-life rapist who thinks he's Al Pacino, and hangs out at discos with drugged out racist scumbags It also features bad acting, really bad directing, poor dialog, underdeveloped characters, and so much unnecessary use of the F-Bomb that it makes Kevin Smith films look like Saturday morning cartoons. The worse and most appalling part of this film catastrophe was: THE ENDING! Come on. Unrealistic and degrading to women. What was it about the disco era that made producers of film and television shows (like General Hospital) to glorify and glamorize the cruelty of rape, making it look like all the attacker had to do was apologize to his victim andnext thing you know they fall in love and live happily ever after?!?!?! What a crockIf this was as 'gritty' and 'real' as some of it's 'fans' claim it to beStephanie would have called the cops on Tony, and he would have spent his entire meaningless life in jailRealizing he threw away what could have been a promising dance career when he acted out on his frustration and rage. Now THAT would have been realistic. The only good thing about this film was the dancingeven though it was to really cheesy music.",1,17,38,19 February 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Middle earth finally comes to life...
","I must say I was skeptical when I first heard my favorite novels were being made into films. I dreaded A-list tow headed actors and actresses over-dramatizing and/or faking their way through one of the greatest journeys ever. I feared they'd cast Tom Cruise as Aragorn, and Brad Pitt or some other overindulgent, overconfident 'golden boy' as Legolas--a character I've loved since I first read the chapter about The Council of Elrond. ...but then I heard That Elijah Wood, a fine young child actor now grown up, was playing Frodo. I was intrigued. Sir Ian McKellen would be playing Gandalf--and I felt it would be refreshing to see him play such a good, likable character after watching him play Magnetto in X-Men (another performance of his I enjoyed.) The rest of the cast was either unknown to me at the time, or I hadn't heard that they had been cast in it yet. Needless to say I was DYING to see this movie. Unfortunately I didn't get to see the film when it first came out. In fact, I finally got to see it several months later. Definitely worth the wait. The cast, the script, the entire production was simply flawless.Within the first scene the shire that I read about when I was a child, came to life... Middle earth where I longed to escape as a child had come to life, and was even more beautiful than I imagined. THe characters were almost exactly how I had pictured them, and the excitement, the drama, and everything else seemed very, very real.My hat is off to Peter Jackson for his excellent job in bringing The Lord of the Rings to life, for those of us who grew up dreaming of Middle Earth. He did a wonderful job of (more or less) sticking to the original story, and bringing his vision of The Lord of The Rings to the big screen for all of us to enjoy. Hat's off to the cast too, who not only looks exactly like I imagined them...they act and speak, even walk just how I pictured them. Some long-time Tolkien readers may scoff at scenes that were cut out, or rearranged...or Arwen taking the place of Glorfindel in the Flight to the Ford... Well some scenes don't always translate well onto film,...I would have been bored watching Frodo wait a full ten years at Bagend waiting for Gandalf while the Sacksville Baggins' raided and pilfered what Bilbo had left behind... The Tom Bombadill scenes would have been rather bland, and taken away from the central story... And I didn't mind at all that Arwen was the one to save Frodo...that scene was so spectacular, F/X wise! I'm not going to nit pick about a female elf saving Frodo. Regardless of such changes, the movie is spectacular! If you don't like it...well then maybe fantasy movies, or classic literature brought to life is just not your thing. To each his own.But it's a must see for all Tolkien fans, all fantasy fans, and all who want to escape reality for approx 4 hours... and wander into Middle Earth.",10,8,9,31 March 2006
Grease," See the stage production. not this disco version.
","If you're going to do a revival movie of the 50's. By all means, do a revival movie of the 50's.GREASE is not a 50's revival. It mixes two decades, the fabulous fifties and the groovy seventies. And it pulls it off--oddly enough--successfully. That is, to the large population that love the lead actors, and are not frequent Theater patrons. For me, the only TRUE Grease is the Broadway Musical. I dislike both movies, and was reluctant to see the Musical. However, when my cousin took me to see a recent performance for my birthday I truly appreciated the experience. What's the difference? well despite the fact that the movie stayed relatively close to the main story, the music was all wrong. They've replaced a lot of 50's do-wop songs with updated disco numbers. 'You're the one that I want' replacing 'All choked up' ...a disco version of the Bo Diddley classic 'hand jive', and Sandy's vocal solo 'It's Raining on Prom Night' (which in the musical, is key to the plot since Sandy was not at the dance) becoming a background track, barely noticeable in the Prom scene. Another huge difference is that the movie is less funny than the stage production. Many of the funnier scenes were omitted or completely revamped. For instance, in the prom scene the character Cha-Cha wasn't a hot Latina in the play, but a chubby girl who Danny was plagued with at the prom. THe mooning scene was an entire musical number, with the T-birds singing about their favorite prank. and the ending was just more fun. And now let's talk about the acting. These actors were way too old to be Seniors in High School. While I truly enjoy Stockard Channing's acting she looked as if she would have children in high school--not a high school girl who wonders if she's with child. Well all of them acted well, they still looked way too old to play their characters--even Newton-John and Travolta. But it was a big career boost for the then-disco king, and the pretty Australian songstress. It paid off for both of them.But it cheapened the musical for me by 'updating' too much. It worked with 50's do wop numbers, and I found the disco style songs (you're the one that I want, and Grease) totally jarring. In short: If it isn't broke, don't fix it. I give it 3/10.",2,9,19,13 February 2006
The Shining," Kubric's The Shining
","There's a reason why this film is dubbed 'Stanley Kubric's The Shining'.It is not like the book. And mind you, both are very good. Just in different ways. Kubric had a different view of Jack and his family, their stay in the hotel that winter, etc...and he brings that to the screen with chilling imagery, eerie subliminal flashes, and Jack Nicholson's performance as a wild-eyed madman. That being said I enjoyed the film for what it is--Kubric's the Shining. Not King's the Shining. The scenes were creepy, frightening, and unsettling. Blood pours out of elevators, The ghosts of twin girls tell Danny 'come and play with us' as the images of them chopped to pieces flashes in front of our eyes. Sure, it's not King's original vision--which of course is excellent!But Kubric wanted to freak us out, give us the creeps, making us feel like we're watching someone else's nightmare. He's succeeded.",7,0,0,3 February 2006
Dreamgirls," And I am Telling You...
","This one is a winner. I was blown away by the music, the performances, and the bold statements made about the music industry that this film provides. The sound track helps to tell the story, with songs that would make you tap your feet...or will bring you to tears. Jennifer Holidays voice had me wondering why the heck she didn't win American Idol in season 3. Their loss is Dreamgirls' gain, I suppose. And Eddie Murphy proves he's just as good of a singer as he is a comedian, going from James Brown-esquire, to crooner, to Sam Cooke style vocalist, and then back to James Brown. Beyonce was spot on as a Diana Ross-type. But the biggest surprise came from unknown Keith Robinson (Power Rangers) as Effie's brother CC. The plot had plenty of emotionally-driven ups and downs as it exposed the different types of people and situations you encounter in the music industry. Every character represented a different persona. Those who would sell their soul for fortune and fame like Curtis (Jamie Fox); or those girls like Effie (Hudson) who have the voice and the talent but are shunned because of their looks. There are starlets, wannabees, and Divas... There are some people like Jimmy (Murphy) who wind up getting hooked on drugs. There are artists like CC (Robinson) who just want to express themselves. People get hurt, people use each other, and people pay the high price of fame--all in pursuit of their dreams. It will bring you to tears, and make you think. I definitely give it 9/10.",9,0,0,27 October 2007
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Excellent film, but see the first 2 first if you're a newbie
","First of all, this is one of my favorite movies. I love reading about Harry Potter as much as watching his films. The only real criticism I have is that you may be a little confused about some of the elements if you haven't a) seen the first two films, or b) read the first three books. Harry's history is glossed over, and leaving Potter-heads to explain to their friends outside of the fandom the basics about Harry and his non-magical relatives. 'why does he live with them? Where is he going with that trunk?' etc. The big picture becomes clearer, however when he threatens his 'muggle' uncle with his wand, and heads for Hogwarts school of Witch Craft and Wizardry once again. The Knight Bus scene is hysterical.However, Harry heads to his home-away-from-home and into unseen danger as murderous, wild-eyed wizard escapes from Azkaban Prison and (rhumor has it) is searching for Harry Potter. Harry teams up with his two best friends, lovable Ron Weasley and intelligent Hermione Granger once again. And this time their new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher knows more about Harry and the mysterious escaped prisoner than he lets on. Some moving scenes, excellent cinematography and Gary Oldman's portrayal as the infamous Sirius Black are just some of the things that make this one a must-see. However, if you're not familiar with the basic premise watch Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets first.",9,0,2,26 January 2006
Dirty Dancing," or as I call it 'dreary dancing'
","I regret that I actually sat through this yawnfest twice. The second time was only because some kid in my acting class told me he had a cameo, so I rented it again just to watch for him ...At any rate, I found it to be a major disappointment. The script was cheesy, the plot was bland, and the 'Grand finale' dance scene was 'just okay.' Certain elements of the storyline were unbelievable...The 'ugly duckling' goes to the Catskills with her family, and falls for a handsome dance teacher...who falls in love with her. BUT her dad believes this guy A) got his dance partner pregnant (just because he was helping the girl...) and B) Stole some stuff (because an envious Matron set him up...)Even if he wasn't a thief, WHY would she even like this guy?? I mean he's a good dancer, but would YOU want a guy who slept around with wealthy older women? you could catch something. I kept thinking, if everyone would just come out and say the truth in this movie, there wouldn't be 500 misunderstandings going on at once.THe parts of the story that could have been played up were played down, and vice versa. None of the characters were endearing. At all. I felt empathy for no one. Baby was bland, her sister was a brat, Johnny was a revamping of Swayze's 'Outsiders' character except for the dancing, and the late great Jerry Orbach was reduced to a cardboard cut-out character of a domineering father. Such injustice!Avoid this one like the plague.",1,9,26,16 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Great Story, Epic Battle Scenes, Absolute Classic!
","First off, let me just say that I love Tolkien's original story The Lord of the Rings. It's absolutely a classic, and deserves much praise--as well as the cult following it's gathered the past few decades. But of all of the three parts of the story this one stands out apart from it's predecesor, The Fellowship of the Ring, and it's Sequel The Return of the King. The second part of the saga is definitely pivotal. Why? We are introduced to Gollum, The Kingdom of Rohan and it's characters, and Faramir of Gondor. Let's not forget the Battle of Helm's deep, Gandalf the Grey becomes Gandalf the White, or the The breathtaking March of the Ents.Despite certain liberties--artistic and cinematic--taken by Peter Jackson, it still does not mar the beauty or enjoyment of this film for me. While Boromir's death should have been the beginning of This film instead of the end of the last, and the spider Shelob should have made her appearance earlier I respect Jackson's decisions in that respect. With all that went on in the film version of The Two Towers--Battle of Helm's Deep and all--Shelob's Lair interjected into the mix would have made this seem 'too busy' after all. (That's just my opinion, however.)Many viewers scoff at a miniscule modernism by Jackson, involving Legolas using a shield in a skateboard-like fashion. But honestly, if you blink you would miss it. All in all, it was well done--relatively true to the source material, exciting and entertaining.",10,1,2,16 January 2007
The Piano," Silence is NOT Golden
","I really didn't care for this film. I appreciate it's symbolism, and the acting was okay--not great--just okay. I always thought Sam Niel was really great. Holly Hunter was okay. The little girl stole the show. Harvey Kitel should NEVER appear naked in another film again. As far as plot--it was trying too hard not to be trite, that it became trite in its efforts. Trading a finger for a piano key? The handsome husband being a jerk, while the homely lover turns out to be gentle? The sex scenes were too much. It was disgusting! Other films have managed to achieve subtlety with love scenes...not this one. I remember how when this film first came out, I got tired of people telling me how 'artistic' it was...and I just didn't appreciate it, yada yada....But, to be honest, It was nearly porn. Porn sandwiched in between artistic and symbolic scenes, mostly involving the daughter. And overall, I found it kind of overly-dramatic, trying to get you to feel some emotion and sympathy for an adulteress.",2,6,12,31 October 2006
The Departed," Noteworthy Cast! **some spoilers**
","This film was rather impressive. Plenty of action, intriguing characters, and brilliant acting from an all-star cast. I feel that the violence could have been toned down a bit-the swearing and racial epithets could have been kept to a minimum. Other than that it was brilliant. Scorcese outdoes himself with this mob vs. cops drama that makes us keep wondering whoif anyone at allis one of the 'good guys'. Jack Nicholson delivers a punch with his over-the-top performance as Irish mob boss Costello. He's a self-indulgent, arrogant, domineering control freak who rules his neighborhood with an iron fist. It even seems as if Costello has the Boston State Police Departmentever on his trailunder his thumb. This is mostly thanks to a Detective named Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who began working for Costello when he was a young kid, and is forever indebted to Costello. Working both sides of the coin, in secrecy, Sullivan helps to keep Costello one step ahead of the 'Staties' that are hot on his trail. The Staties have a mole of their own. Young renegade officer Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is sent in to infiltrate Costello's gang, under orders from his superiors (Baldwin, Sheen, & Walberg respectively). With some felons in Costigan's family tree, and the rumor that Costigan was thrown out of the academy, he receives acceptance from Costello's men. But soon he meets the man himself, and his loyalty is tested by undergoing a small yet painful ritual. The story heats up, with more action, a lot of shooting, and a rather confusing love triangle involving a young psychiatrist who is forced to face too many truths all at once. Nicholson's portrayal becomes increasingly more manicalmost resembling his performance in The Shiningas his organization begins to unravel and turn on each other in search of the 'rat.' However, many scenes were stolen by Mark Wahlberg as Dingam. The plot gets confusing at times, and the ending will seem like a cop out (no pun intended), but it's the sort of thing that if you look at the events that led up to itit seems to have followed a logical conclusion. Who really is a rat? And who real are the good guys? Very well-acted, and intriguing picture. I give this an 8/10.",8,2,4,19 October 2006
Wedding Crashers," so predictable.
","I am truly disappointed with this movie. I expected a good comedy, which would leave me laughing out loud holding my gut. Instead I yawned. I looked at the clock. I counted the minutes of my life wasted while watching this crap... and as much as i was tempted to put on a better DVD...I (mistakenly) kept watching thinking that at some point it would get better.It's not that funny. The plot is predictable. The script is terrible. The scenes in the beginning move so fast, that you can barely tell what's going on...then half-way through you find out that it's NOT an American Pie type comedy but a romantic comedy. A romantic comedy with a plot that's already been done about a dozen times. Will he get the girl before she makes the biggest mistake of her life and marries somebody else? Then it gets dramatic and depressing. Then it gets silly (as Will Ferrel finally shows up) then the plot reaches it's predictable climax, and the movie ends. The best part of the movie, IMO was the end...no, not the final scene but the closing credits.",1,25,51,2 April 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," Inspiring.
","Shawshank Redemption is truly an inspirational film--a work of art. What makes this film so special (asside from the excellent acting from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) is the message of hope, even in your darkest hours. Robbins plays a man sent to jail for a crime he did not commit--the murder of his wife and her lover. He is found guilty, and sent to Shawshank Penitentiary. He meets Freeman, who has spent most of his life in Shawshank for a crime he committed when he was a young, dumb kid. Freeman feels that Robbins wouldn't last past his first night in prison. But after being repeatedly sodomized by 'the sisters' and manipulated by the warden, Robbins remains resilient and hopeful. He gains Freeman's respect as well as his friendship. The men go through three decades of unhappiness as the pinup on Robbin's wall changes from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Racquel Welsch. Each one hiding a secret that grows bigger, with time. Something that Robbins doesn't even confide in his best friend Freeman.After one final betrayal from the warden, we find out what those posters were hiding...The gateway to Robbins' freedom. I'll spoil no more for you...but recommend you watch this film yourself. It's quite inspiring and uplifting.9/10",8,0,0,29 October 2006
Vanilla Sky," A horrible mess.
","This movie was a mess, from beginning to end. It seemed very 'thrown together' and almost as if it was entirely ad libbed. Tom Cruise plays David Aames; an egotistical, self-centered, rich pretty boy who thought he could do whatever he wanted and screw the consequences. In other words, he was playing himself. He finds out that treating women like yesterday's trash has consequences, when his 'bed buddy' Julie(Cameron Diaz) starts to develop feelings for him and notices his attraction to another woman (Penelope Cruz). There is a bad car accident. Julie dies. David gets messed up physically, IE 'pretty boy' isn't so pretty anymore, and he cannot handle it. THe vain playboy takes a dozen or so pills because he cannot stand his own face. He especially cannot handle that his dream girl (also his best friend's dream girl) wants very little to do with him. He became involved in this 'Lucid dream' project (unsure whether it was before or after the accident, as the story jumps around so much time wise) and that is where the whole plot gets convoluted and twisted so that neither you nor the main character himself knows what is real and what isn't. In David's dream-life, he's still handsome. And he has a wonderful romance with Sophia...or wait, Julie? Oh wait, nobody. He's dead? he's alive? He's seeing a shrink ( Kurt Russell). His shrink doesn't exist...? It all becomes a blur of scenes of David's fantasies and pseudo-realities, and neither the audience nor David knows what is real and what is just a dream. It's not even *really* explained by the end of the movie. It would have been better if it were all wrapped up neatly in the end with an explanation of what is real and what isn't. But the end still kept us guessing. It also would have been better if Cruise had not been cast in the leading role. His over-acting and yelling every line reaches an all-time high. And his attempts at a drunken stagger were pantomimic and laughable. Penelope Cruz was bland at best. And, in my opinion Cameron Diaz' performance really stands out as the multi-faceted Julie. Sadly, her scenes were short, sweet, and few.I give this stinker a 2 out of ten.",1,12,26,28 January 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Hail to the King
","The third and final installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to life bigger, and bolder than the first two. Director Peter Jackson and company held nothing back when it came to CGI, special effects, gorgeous landscapes, and breathtaking cinematography.Fans most familiar with Tolkien's famed novels would take note of changes made in the interest of keeping the film short (as with it's two prior films), but he stuck close enough the main story and brought it to its destined conclusion. He didn't water down the scene where Frodo finally gets to Mt. Doom in order to get rid of The One Ring once and for allin fact it packs quite the punch. The way that scene was intermingled with the battle footage heightened the emotional level of the scene as well as the excitement.The actors deserve praise as well. Viggo Mortensen reminds us of what a hero truly is, with his performance as Aragorn, the man who would become King of Gondor. Sir Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf the White, bringing the Wizard to life as if he popped right out of the pages of Tolkien's novels. Elijah Wood draws us in with his portrayal as FrodoSorrowful, and weary of his travels and all of the trials he'd gone through along the way. Other noteworthy performances include those of Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchet, Miranda Otto, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Hugo Weaving, etc.I highly recommend this film (as well as it's predecessors) to anybody, regardless of whether or not you've read the novels. Of course the books are betterthey always arebut the movies are an excellent adaptation of Tolkien's wonderful tale.This film is clearly worthy of the many Oscars it has won.I easily give it a 10/10.",10,6,8,18 October 2006
Braveheart," It's no Lord of the Rings.
","The acting was good. The cinematography and directing was good. Other than that.... The movie was much longer than it needed to be. It was also much more violent than it needed to be. Add to that the fact that it was historically inaccurate. It's a lot of Mel Gibson's self-glorification, as we've seen him too often...and he does it so well. Over-acting his way through lukewarm love scenes, and bloody gruesome battle scenes. and at the end of this movie he exclaims 'FREEDOM!!'...that is exactly how I felt when I walked out of the movie theater, after sitting there for over four hours watching this overindulgent midieval battle film. If you plan on buying the DVD, save your money. Rent it if you must, but it pales in comparison to Lord of the Rings. Enough said.",4,3,6,2 April 2006
