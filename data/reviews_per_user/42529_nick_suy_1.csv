Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," best comedy I've seen since long
","OK, for starters this is the most political incorrect, insulting and sometimes even disgusting movie you will see these days in the cinemas. Then why the hell did Ã¬ rate it this high?Well first of all the movie shows the large differences between people in the US (or at least their vision on society). Secondky, Sacha Cohen makes fun of everyone (some more than other, but anyhow). And last but not least it's just a damn good movie; The best comedy I've attended in years. During the movie people started clapping for a fantastic scene (this happened more than once), and on the other moments people where laughing 'till they had to BLEEP their pants.Anyhow if you go and see this movie, just take a good laugh and forget about being polite for 90 minutes, otherwise the 'movie-film' will lose it's effect.enjoy",9,4,12,3 November 2006
