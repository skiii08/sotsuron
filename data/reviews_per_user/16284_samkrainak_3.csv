United 93," the Airline lived up to its name
","I was in my sophomore year at high school, on the school bus on 9/11. I remember the day of the planes hitting the WTC towers and the Pentegon, and the plane crashing in shanksvill,PA. little did I know when terror hit the America on those four planes, strangers aboard UNITED flight93, stood up as hero's. they began as stranger traveling as innocently. they were strangers(even though some new each other). they were attacked on aboard, scared to the bone, not realizing it was a suicide mission. they heard of the other attacks and new what was coming for them. they set fear aside and stood up as hero's. An uprise to stop terrorists and save countless others. It is the most intense film of the year Evan though we no the ending. the great part was no actors or actress playing the passengers. normal people playing normal people, who were American Idols.",10,0,2,2 September 2006
The Exorcist," one of the darkest film ever!!! best horror film ever!!!
","The first time I saw this I couldn't sleep. Its one film that will possess you forever. visual,audio, and graphic nature of this film will stop your every muscle in your body, and stop you physically and mentely. If they ever remake this film it won't match. The follow up films to the Exorcist are fair to none, though Exorcist III was good. I loved how the camera follows to Reagens room with the sounds in the room and the door shut. The house was well established, looking dark inside even in the calm scenes. the devils voice is well done. the girl well dressed with make up. When Reagens climes down the steps like a spider, how grizzly!!!!",10,1,2,17 November 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," brilliant!! great minds think alike! be ready to enter world of two human monsters.
","A brilliant dark thriller. It shows how evil and dark the human mind can get. Out of all the 5 awards it won Mr.Hopkins deserves it the most, who better to play an evil psychotic genius then him.When Lector talks to her at his cell in museum with camera up close to his face that must be seen in the theater. Some may not reallies that Stariling is also a innocent pretty sparrow, and that Clarcie Starling is the same. We see Lecter as the deadly monster, in two scene's's when Chiltion explains the physical safety measures taken when visiting Lecter. When Crawford quotes'just do your job Clarcie, and never forget what he is.' We also see Lector walk along his cell at the museum following Clarcie as she is being haled away, he walks as if he were a tiger pacing in the cage. The moth was especially nice touch, because on the movie cover on DVD and VHS the moths head has seven naked women that create the moth's creepy skull. The women represent 'Buffalo Bills' six victims and Kathren the seventh whom he abducts. When Starling dream of her trying to save a lamb its like way she is trying to save Kathren. The movie title is very unique for a dark creepy film. if you don't have a clue about the film and only heard the title you would wonder what kind of movie it is. would horror,dark, thriller come to mind. You might think its take place on a farm, (in some respect yes) or sweet loving drama? romantic drama? or a comedy? doubtful. Who would suspect it was creepy movie about a young FBI trainee,a brilliant and infamous psychopathic serial killer locked away, and a deadly serial killer on the loose. Be ready, its a thriller about two brilliant powerful minds , one good one evil, as the good has to match the evil, to find a human monster on the loose of unspeakable evil. After you watch it,try to sleep peacefully to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.",10,5,11,16 November 2005
