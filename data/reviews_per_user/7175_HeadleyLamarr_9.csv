3:10 to Yuma," Outlaws a la Robin Hood?
","Watched this film with so many great expectations - very few were met. The film started out as a standard tale of heartless monster outlaws and lawful upstanding men that vow to bring one of them, Wade (played by Russel Crowe), to justice. But it rapidly derailed into a politically correct farcical piece that ended most senselessly with the outlaw trying to uplift the honest man, decimating his own gang and voluntarily boarding a train to Yuma prison. What is wrong with that, you ask? Maybe he was ready to do penance for his sins, but the makers were not happy to even throw us that bone - they showed him whistling for his horse and the animal running alongside the train in an implied escape.Along the way the Pinkerton man was shown to be a Bible thumper who killed three year old Apache children, the outlaw had so much appeal for the women, and could charm children too. There were no moments of real tension in the film, no character that pulled me in, the situations were extremely contrived and the last 30 minutes were cobbled together in a laughable manner. Mr. Crowe was his usual suave lady-killer self - no matter if he was supposed to be an outlaw. Mr. Bale was more in character and did do a fine job, but could not salvage the film. Top 250? This one is eminently forgettable. To get the dubious taste of this travesty out of my mouth I will have to watch the modern day Western masterpiece Unforgiven yet again.",6,1,3,19 January 2008
Hot Fuzz," Yarrp? Narrp!!
","In the IMDb top 250? I don't think so. This is a film that starts out bloody hilarious but ten suffers from serious genre identity crisis. It veers between serious and comic and goes on for way too long, like 45 minutes too long, while it is still deciding what it wants to be. Simon Pegg was hilarious and absolutely deadpan through out. The supporting cast around him was great too. There were some moments of comic genius - By the Power of Greyskull! Yarrp, Narrp? The police force of Sandford had me in stitches but the cloak and dagger mystery was just too much Arsenic and Old Lace style. A shorter, snappier, less serious version would be a masterpiece but this one became tedious and took itself too seriously in the end. All in all I would say that this was a film would test the patience of your behind unless you were lying in bed while watching.",7,3,6,6 August 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Tedious - enough already!
","This is one Pirates movie too many. If it were not for Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush I'd be gone in a flash. The story is too pathetic to go into - in fact there may not have been a story. The pouty Keira Knightly makes me want to slap her, Orlando Bloom should be cast into bronze and put on the bed stand of teenage girls - then the rest of us will be spared his meaningless roles in films. The bad guy is a caricature, the rest of the cast is flailing to create some kind of impact. The special effects are good, but this film fails to engage one and is a meaningless caper. My plea to Johnny Depp - enough with the cashing in - please go back to meaningful cinema and leave this kind of drivel to other lesser actors!",5,1,3,13 July 2007
Chak de! India," Chak de Chak de, Ek Hockey doongi main Rakh ke!
","Yes I went to see the film because I saw Shahrukh looking super good in the promos (what can I say - I am a shallow person!). But what kept me glued to the seat with my eyes fixed on the screen was a motley crew of ordinary girls with extra-ordinary attitude. AND I like hockey, wish the glory days were back.Chak de India is an out and out sports film, there is a disgraced coach, there is a team that is fragmented and needs team spirit, and there are matches to be won and glory to reap. The film follows a rather linear path and does not dish out any surprises except one - it is unpredictably wonderful! My football and basketball fanatic little nephew was shouting 'goal' at every score and the audience was as mesmerized at this tournament being played out on celluloid as they would have been at the live event. There were cheers and claps at every win. Why? Because this team was real, we watched them turn into a team and we yearned for their day in the lights as much as they did. Of course it was a Cinderella story - but what made the story poignant was the fact that all this happened for real, that there was indeed an extraordinary player who was disgraced and redeemed himself in exactly this fashion. The script was taut, the editing was superb, there were no unnecessary moments in the film. There were no cringe inducing dialogs, no useless song and dance routines, no romance backdrop of the coach falling for the star (a la Bend it Like Beckham). The music was uplifting and extremely well integrated into the narrative - Kuch Kariye was inspirational, Maula mere haunting, Badal Pe Paon a most exuberant transition from stuck in the back waters to out in the happening place of the World Cup! The girls were superbly cast - they represented the true face of India, with all its diversity and its problems that relate to this diversity. Their bickering, their in fights, quest for personal glory and how this slowly changed into a camaraderie was extremely well done. Komal Chautala (Chitrashi Rawat) was CUTE, Bindiya Nayak (Shilpa Shukla) was awesome as the bad girl of the team, Preeti Sabharwal (Segarika Ghatge) was hot, Tanya Abrol was awesome as the Hockey Doongi Balbir, Vidya Sharma (Vidya Malvade) was good as the conflicted housewife turned goalie/captain, but my personal favorite was SoiMoi (Nisha Nair) the girl from Jharkhand. Every one was given their moments to tell us why we should care about them. The other supporting cast of the assistant coach and the federation people did their job well. Of course I had gone in expecting to see SRK in a hot new incarnation. What I saw was a man who was a coach, a haunted man with agony in his eyes, a fire in his belly and a desire to redeem himself at all costs. After about the first 10 minutes I did not even care that Mr. Khan was looking the best he has done in years - he was coach Kabir Khan, the tarter, the disciplinarian, the psychologist, the motivator and above all the man who was in for the long haul and was going to make a miracle happen.Shimit's direction was superb, Jaideep Sahni wrote a stirring tale, and together with the actors they made sure that this was not just another sports Cinderella story. This was a tale about the empowerment of women, and showcased their ability to triumph in the face of innumerable hurdles both in the home and outside. Chak De!!",9,9,18,11 August 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Unlucky 13?
",I saw this film on a plane and fell asleep multiple times. There was nothing to keep my attention and the story seemed to be hastily cobbled together so the team could capitalize on the previous two films. Many mysteries remain for me - who kept calling Brad Pitt? What did he and Clooney keep talking about? What exactly was Matt Damon doing in the film? I only realized just now that the villainous guy who double crossed Eliot Gould was Al Pacino! So Al acted well enough to camouflage his usual persona. That is a plus.The software guy first went on and on about how the system was unbreakable then Bingo he had a way to break it! The other cast - who knows what they were doing - some guy used to keep dealing cards and getting them all over the floor.I have to say that star power is an awesome thing - even with complete lack of coherence and intelligence in how the plot was cobbled together every time I woke up either Matt or Clooney or Brad kept my eyes glued to the screen for a few minutes before the snoozies set in. Any other cast and no one would look twice at this film; heck they would walk out in the first 20 minutes.,6,2,3,17 September 2007
Stardust," Enchanting fairy tale
","A farm boy Tristan (Charlie Cox) loves a icy 'princess' (Sienna Miller) and vows to get her a star, but many others are after the star (Claire Danes). Among them are various sons of Lord Stormhold, a wicked wicked witch (Michelle Pfeiffer). Tristan and the star find refuge in a fantastical dirigible captained by Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro). The star is eventually saved by Tristan, the riddle of his parentage solved and all is happy ever after. The journey is magical, the lead man is fluff but the rest of the cast, sp. Daines, DeNiro and Pfeiffer, makes up for it. Watch the film to recapture your childhood stories that were full of witches, princesses, princes, magic good and bad and above all love. Great film for all ages.",8,4,6,5 December 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Fun, but fell short of expectations
","This latest Harry Potter extravaganza fell a little short of my expectations. Why was Harry so mad at the world? Why were the Weasleys in Sirius Black's house? What exactly were David Thewlis, Emma Thompson or Helena Bonham Carter doing in the film? Fortunately for me the movie came out two years after the book so the facts were a bit fuzzy and I didn't care. The movie wowed with excellent special effects, great acting by Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Gary Oldman and the Dumbledore character.. But all along the telling of the tale I was not completely engaged - there was some key ingredient missing. It was almost as if this one was just a filler until the next installment. All in all it was an afternoon well spent to keep me up to date on the story and gave me incentive to buy the next book.",8,0,1,15 July 2007
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," 30 seconds of meaningful cinema
","The Star Wars trilogy (IV to VI) was path breaking - the special effects were like never before seen, the story had meaning, the cast was interesting. There was substance, there was excitement. Now Mr. Lucas has lost all his magic and turned this into a meaningless franchise of useless drivel. Episode I was horrific - the menace of Jar Jar Binks has me cowering. I skipped EP II. But I was a captive audience (as in on a long bus ride) to Episode III. The special effects made me feel like I was watching a video game in progress. The robots all died after three shots, screams and their eyes exploding! Anakin was played by arguably the worst actor ever - who told Lucas that Hayden Christensen could act? And Natalie Portman was no better. Yoda and Obi Wan were the only engaging characters. Even Samuel L. Jackson flailing about with his light saber couldn't save this travesty. The last 30 seconds when the metallic mask was finally put on Darth Vader, dotted some is and crossed some longstanding ts. But was the 2 hour long torture necessary? This is one to be avoided at all costs. A word of advice to Mr. Lucas regarding numbers 7, 8 and 9 - please do not go there!",4,6,10,13 July 2007
Iron Man," Righteous Flight!
","Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a modern day DaVinci, tinkering with his gadgets while his weapons company happily builds and supplies the most modern and devastating of killing machines to the highest bidder. And he is a playboy to boot, ignoring the ever faithful Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), and flitting from babe to babe. Then the unthinkable happens - he is shot up with shrapnel, kidnapped, and confronted with the cost of his company's business ventures. He needs a battery powered magnetic device in his chest to keep the shrapnel from entering his heart and is forced by his kidnappers to build a destruction device. But what emerges is a breathtaking Iron Man!! Of course there are whys and buts when he gets back. And since he is a Marvel comics character he has to undo all the wrong his company had been doing. There is a baddie who is bigger than the Iron man. Many breathtaking flights and shoot-ups later, good does triumphs over evil and all is well with the world! Iron Man works because of Robert Downey Jr. He injects just the right amount of wryness, urbanity and mischief into the role to make the Iron man much more than a mere superhero. Gwenyth is decent in a small and undetailed role. Jeff Bridges is very great in a larger than life role. After many a superhero film that failed to click we finally have a worthy successor to Batman Begins. Yet another superhero has arrived - welcome!",9,2,5,8 May 2008
