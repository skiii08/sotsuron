It," Not what I was expecting
",I grew up with Tim Curry's Pennywise. Nothing was and will ever replace his iconic version of the menacing clown. When I heard about this remake I was against it of course. Any classic movie or series should be left untouched. But after following up with the remake I was willing to give it a chance.After seeing this and knowing there will be a Chapter Two it all makes sense. It measures up to the original. The cast was perfect. The story telling is fantastic. The scares and pacing are perfect. And casting Skarsgard was brilliant. He did not try to mimic Tim's version. He simply made Pennywise another menacing clown. So far this is my favorite film of 2017.,9,2,3,8 October 2017
