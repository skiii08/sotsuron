Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great movie
","Let me just say one thing. This movie is great. One of, if not the, best movies of 1999. I mean American Beauty. Ha, I laugh at your American Beauty. Some people take their movies too seriously. They're supposed to entertain, and this movie excells at it. Not be some artistic peice of crap that you think you're supposed to like, but you really don't. And it is very faithful to the series. People get mad because it isn't Star Wars enough. It sure is if the creater of it says so. The creater is the god and he is always right. People complain that is the worst of the series. That doesn't make it a bad movie. And it isn't fair to compare to the others, because that was 20 years ago and things can change. Anyway, about the movie. I think it may have the smartest plot of the trilogy, because the first time seeing it you may even be a bit confused, which makes it more of an involved story. I don't  need to explain the plot, because if you haven;t seen this movie you have been living under a rock. But the final battle scenes are the best in any sci-fi movie to date. Nobody can beat the lightsaber duel at the end. You should really enjoy it. My only gripe about this movie is the amount of computer graphics in this film. Sometimes it makes the film lose character, and if the older films chronologically take place later, it shouldn't make the newer films(1977-1983) look so dated and old. What I'm saying is that they should have not relied on CGI so much. Ending up I would say that the amount of bad reviews may forever hinder the greatness of this masterpeice. Because that is what it is, a modern day masterpeice. You dont find much better nowadays.",Null,0,1,2 February 2002
