Skyfall," Why are IMDb Skyfall reviews seemingly so out of touch
","I liked this movie a lot. I am some what surprised by the number of negative reviews. Especially when Rotten Tomatoes is reporting high critical and audience numbers (91 percent). I suspect the Daniel Craig is Not Bond group is over-represented here and trying to flood the IMDb site with bad reviews.Get over it. The Bond franchise has moved on from its descent into lame self parody. As one who started watching the series from its inception, it has been a slowly disintegrating formula beginning with Diamonds Are Forever (admittedly with the occasional bright spot).Craig brings gravitas back to the series. Skyfall was a great action film with nice human moments. Come on you guys, you had decades of the slapstick, cardboard, comic book Bond. It is nice to have a James Bond with a some sort of relation to actual human feelings and failings. Skyfall has those human elements in spades.",8,6,16,13 November 2012
