It," TIME TO FLOAT !!!!
",IT is an outstanding movie because well there's lots of reasons first there's an incredible cast with the bond of he kids. Seconds of all the movie it quite scary but it's mainly a Sci-fi horror because it's of a clown.I think this movie is the right age rating 15 but there are a few scenes that are very violent there's a scene where Georgie's arm gets bit of by the clown penny wise and another's scene where the bully Henry bowers kills his father and lots of blood was spitting out.The ending is a bit confusing and scary because the losers club fight penny wise and don't know if they kill him.What recently came out was IT CHAPTER 2 where some people on IGN have said is scarier and that had jumped them quite a few timesHope you liked my review and tell everyone you know about this review,9,0,0,3 November 2019

Avengers: Endgame," Wicked movie top ten rated
","Endgame is the most emotional avenger movie ever because iron man dies.But he died peacefully and it was a nice way to end his contract.
I loved when captain America fought Thanos because he just kept throwing his shield at him and Thanos didn't even have a chance.i also liked the final battle at the end because they all fought together even Thor's pile of people and I like black panther when black panther said 'give the gauntlet to me'.
I like all the characters absolutely everyone and I thought the movie epic no doubt about that so give a watch in the cinema I love this movie again so give this review a thumbs up.
Also it's a long film 3hr 1min the first 30min is pure talking and the rest is interesting because they have a time travel that iron man crates in like one day",10,0,3,18 May 2019
