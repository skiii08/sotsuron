Howl's Moving Castle," One of the best magical adventurous movie I have ever seen.
","I would watch this movie so many times and never get sick of it. I first discovered this movie when I still had AT&T U-verse while I was recording some movies and shows. I remember it was on STARZ and I only saw the ending and I got very interested in it because it was the same studio who made Ponyo. I did managed to recorded the whole movie the next day to watch it.I love the characters, they were mostly interesting and colorful and you want to know their backstory. The animation, the visuals, the art style, and the colors are beautifully stunning. If this movie was in live-action(don't get any ideas Hollywood), it looked like it could be nominated for 5 Academy Award categories: Best Makeup & Hairstyling, Best Costume Design, Best Art Production, Best Visual Effects, and best Adapted Screenplay. The story is the reason why I want to write stories of my own, full of character development, action-adventure, and heavy drama romance.Not many 2D animated movies are looked at these days but this is a gem and I recommended you to watch it.",9,1,1,12 November 2019
It," Overall creepy.
","Few parts of this movie has scary moments but overall, it's just creepy. It's hard to say it's a flawless movie and there are some flaws that can be easily addressed, but it's also hard to say it's bad too. This is a dark film to watch and I recommend it.",8,1,1,22 September 2019
Spider-Man 2," This movie proved me wrong as a kid.
","I saw this movie on DVD as kid and I didn't like it because there was 'too much Peter Parker, not enough Spider-Man.' I enjoyed the train sequence and the ending, but that was just it.Years later, I started to see people saying Spider-Man 2 is the best superhero movie ever made and deep down I disagree. I did go back and watched the movie after seeing Spider-Man(2002) and man...man, was I wrong about this movie. This movie has such a deeper meaning to it and very relatable to the real life world. Dare I say, IT'S HUMAN! Seeing Peter struggling with school and jobs is related to how people are in the world. Seeing Doc Ock from being a good scientist and lovely husband to a mad scientist from a experiment gone wrong to a guy sacrificing himself to save New York. Now that is something you don't see in superhero movies. A bad guy becoming a hero.The writing is great and the visual effects still holds up to this day. If you think about it, every character, including the ones with small roles, has a story and it's memorable. Sam Raimi did an awesome with this movie.It's sad that some people say this movie is terrible and Spider-man fans only like it because of nostalgia which is not true. The people who say these things:
-Never actually seen the movie
-Never grew up with it
-Find something to nitpick
-Heard it from someone else
-Never understood anything in this movie
-Not their type of movie
I always quote 'people hate what they don't understand' because I see movies with good universal praise gets bash by people who don't understand why it's good as it is. They'll never bother putting 2 and 2 together to understand the movie. The movie is there to show and tell while you figure it out yourself before judging the film. THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED ART!",9,0,0,13 September 2019
The Irishman," Scorsese is a mob gangster of cinema.
","I've been a fan of Martin Scorsese ever since I saw Goodfellas, The Departed, Hugo, Taxi Driver, and more. It has seems the old guy still got a kick to make one of the best movies of 2019 and he never lose the touch, it stays there till the end. The Irishman was a great journey of violence, drama, and suspense with some shocking and touching moments. What a outstanding movie.",9,5,11,3 December 2019
Spider-Man 3," 11 years and I still enjoy this movie.
","As a kid, this would be my personal favorite Spider-Man movie. A decade has pass and now I'm start to see some people hating on this movie and it left me shock to see many people dislike it. I started to research to see why the movie was bad and I'll admit...it made some valid points. Too many villains in one movie, Eddie Brock and Venom, emo Peter, the writing, and probably more. I had to watch the trilogy again to understand it and I get the hate...and I still like the movie.To be honest, I think the memes from this movie just makes the movie more entertaining. What I like about the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy is that each character has their own story. Most people don't like Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom, but to me, he seems more accurate to what Eddie Brock suppose to be and he represents the dark side of Peter. Some of these flaws, to me, actually help this movie.",7,2,2,21 September 2019
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," More than a superhero movie.
","This is no average superhero film you expect, this is more of a spy thriller. Give props to the Russo brothers for making Captain America likeable for the MCU. This movie is where I place it with Spider-Man 2, X2, The Dark Knight, and Logan.",9,1,2,22 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Divivded the fans, this movie has.
","Every since Star Wars was released back in 1977, it was, in a way, meant for kids. Due to its giant success, it was more for everyone than just the kids. Its simple but effective storytelling and its universe created more stories and world-building which gain a much bigger fanbase. Now, we are here with the ending of a continuing saga from 40 years with The Rise of Skywalker.Some people think Star Wars is just starships and space battles when there's more to that, even the fans from the beginning knows this. You can like the movies as it is: lightsaber fights, comedic relief, visuals, and explosions. What some people don't care about is the fanbase that cares about Star Wars more than they do and how it hurts them. Sure, they are harsh at some points but that's because they care about this universe that made them who they are. The more successful a popular thing is, the larger people will stick with it. The large amount people there are, the more defenses they'll become.The Rise of Skywalker (or this sequel trilogy as a whole) has been quite a mess with it's story and characters. Hate what you will about Episode VII, but I liked the route the were taking with the new characters and Episode VIII and IX butchered it. For people saying it has a good story, go back and watched the other movies in released order and watched the Clone Wars TV show (or research the lore of Star Wars but that'll probably won't be worth your time since it's quite long) then, looked at the Disney Star Wars films. Say what you will about the prequels, at least they have a good story...just terribly executed. The sequel trilogy has good execution but poor storytelling.This movie will be talked about for years from a growing fanbase to a divided one.",4,29,47,1 January 2020
Justice League," A bad movie, but it's no surprised
","Justice League, a group of DC superheroes coming together to fight evil, best crossover team-up like the Avengers...what we got is a disappointment. Seeing your favorite superheroes coming together in the same universe is supposed to be the biggest movie event, but all we got was a movie not big and not exciting at all. It's no surprise since DCEU didn't even try to build-up their characters and manage to be worst than BvS.The jokes in the movie felt force, we only know 2 characters with development, the visual effects and colors is bland as hell like I'm looking at a PS4 graphics if it was downgraded. The villain of the movie is just forgettable and his goal is generic and boring. MCU made 5 movies about it's characters and had some good side characters throw in there and had a movie with them in there that become universal praise. DCEU had 4 movies, but one of them is rush and the other one has nothing to do with Justice League.",4,0,6,4 May 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," First timer and WOW!
","I wanted to checked out TLOTR trilogy to see what's so special about it that made it an Academy-award winning trilogy.The music, the tone, the cinematography, the visuals, the characters, just...WOW. This was kinda breathtaking to me. I seen some fantasies movies before, but this was something new to me. I been avoiding these movies before and now...now I'm glad I got a chance. The first movie is such a surprising for me, I was already hook on to seeing the second movie.",9,1,1,4 May 2019
Spider-Man," Good story with Sam Raimi's goofy elements.
","This is without a doubt the best superhero origin story. This movie made me a Spider-Man fan from movies, TV shows, and comic book. It was relatable, emotional, funny, and action pack. This is the first Sam Raimi movie I have seen and seeing that his old movies had campy moment in them, it really fits well with is movie.",8,0,0,22 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Best MCU Phase 3 movie ever!
","This is the Marvel movie I'll never forget. Trust me as I say this: this was WAY emotional than Infinity War. It is to be expected, but I haven't had this much heartbreaking experience since Logan and that's saying something. 2019 seems like the year where everything is coming to an end and there's more to come in 2020 and I can't wait to see what awaits us. Now that Iron Man's gone, we'll have to wait and see what's the future of MCU ( after Spider-Man: Far From Home comes out).",10,0,2,4 May 2019
Toy Story 4," An unnecessary solid sequel.
","I don't know if I have already made a review of this movie, but here it goes: I think this movie was unnecessary to begin with. As a kid, I did wanted a 4th Toy Story movie to be made but times has changed and I was focusing other things until the trailer dropped. The plot was...alright. I see what they're going for, but there were some flaws in the writing that made me scratch my head. This movie is now mostly focus on Woody, which is upsetting because I know Woody is the main character of this franchise but I would like to see the movie give Buzz Lightyear and Woody enough screen time like in the previous movies rather seeing Buzz less in the movie. They made the villain pretty obvious, seeing Bo Peep was nice, and the ending was pretty emotional. Overall, it's a solid film that shouldn't have be made in the first place. I know Pixar said they'll make another Toy Story if there was a story idea to be made, but Toy Story 3 had a perfect clear ending.",7,1,2,30 January 2020
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Hard to get passed through...
","I heard from many people that The Hobbit trilogy is fun, yet not so charming. I have never read the book but from what I heard, it's more light-hearted adventurous likely for kids and older people to enjoy. After watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy, is was curious about how The Hobbit will hold up. Will it be it's own movie with new things we never seen or try to live up with The Lord of the Rings with references?Awhile ago, I did go on the movie to watch it and...well, seems unwatchable. Too many characters to remember, have CGI that looks like it came out of the 2000's, characters being too invulnerable, no atmosphere tone (atleast for me), and it's just so...boring. It's so boring, I have to go on my phone to entertain myself. After realizing the movie was still going on, I changed it to another movie.Few days ago, I decided to give it a chance to have a go at it, thinking to myself 'The writing, the visual, and the characters won't entertain me but I hope the action can get a pass for me.' I watched the movie again and the beginning of the prologue was pretty promising. There were some questionable things I have to say about it, but I let it slide. I did enjoyed Bilbo, Gandalf, and the dwarves at the beginning of the scene...then, something felt off where the movie killed my enjoyment. I honestly don't know what it is, but it made me stop watching the movie.I really want to enjoy this film, I really do, but something keeps throwing me off that makes me want to close my eyes. It's really hard to get through the beginning of the film.",6,1,1,12 September 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," A Epic History Tale
","After watching the movie, I feel pumped up inside after what I experience. The cinematography, the production design, the acting, the colors, and costumes were all beautifully strong and breathtaking to watch. I really cant get the 'NO PRISONERS!' quote out of my head, it's keeps me wanting more. I would've ranked this movie a 9.5/10 if it was possible. The main leading actor and supporting actor should have won an Academy Award for their role, especially for Best Costume Design. I would give it 10/10, but I found myself comparing this film to Ben-Hur(1959). Although I find this movie extraordinary epic, I think Ben-Hur still tops as the definition of epic.Edit: You know what? Screw it! I can't stop thinking about the movie, I'm giving it a 10.",10,0,0,24 January 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A good buildup movie, but not better than the first.
","I enjoyed this movie because it was leading to the finale of the trilogy and the visual effects blew my mind and GOD THE MUSIC SCORE OF THIS MOVIE! I did enjoy the film, but the story didn't blow my mind like the first movie did and I find that a little sad. Not to say it didn't had a good story, it does, it's just not better than The Fellowship of the Rings. Other than that, it's a lovable movie :)",8,1,1,4 May 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good movie but kinda disappointing.
","I actually love this movie, but I did expected more from this. I was hoping to see the villain, Ultron, to actually bring down the Avengers like in the comics or actually see some characters die in the movie (well one), but we didn't get those which makes the trailer , to me, feel misleading.But me feeling underwhelming cause I didn't get what I was expecting, this was a kiss-ass movie. Still fun, enjoyable, entertaining to watch like the first movie. Although I had my hopes up when this movie came out, I still watch it to this day.",7,0,2,4 May 2019
Singin' in the Rain," A Great Musical Direction
","I don't watch much of musical movies that's not a Disney feature, but this was a great movie. I was watching this movie for my Cinema Theatre class and I kinda didn't want to see it, but I know I had no choice. Probably the first time I'm happy I'm force to watch a movie because I LOVE this film! There were some references from this movie that I didn't even that came from this movie! The musical was exciting and memorable, the production design and colors and lighting were a standing point, and the 3 actors of this movie stole the show. This movie is really a true classic to watch for all ages.",10,1,1,16 January 2020
Titanic," Greatest movie in generations
","I know this is the best (overrated) movie of all, so I watched this film...it earn its place as the best movie of all time. The visual surprising still holds up for a movie that came out 2 decades ago, the music score is the best thing I ever heard, the cinematography is beautifully shot, and the tone of the movie is very lovable and emotional. Watching this for first time is such a blast, but sadly, I won't have that same feeling again if I go watch it again. This movie is very memorable for generations to come.",10,5,9,4 May 2019
Mystic River," Gut-punching film.
","Clint Eastwood love making a dark reality movies that makes you somewhat feel guilty. No action packed moments, no visual effect, nothing. Just regular people living a average life until tragic stroke. It's a really good film that'll make you feel emotional and to the point where I say it should've won Best Picture...if The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King didn't came out that year. My issue with the film is that is very slow, but I can see that it's trying to build tension...which makes it interesting yet very boring. I do recommend to watch this movie. It's slow but it gets interesting when you keep watching it.",8,1,2,25 September 2019
Joker," The Best Controversial Movie I Have Ever Seen.
","Listen, okay. This is the best (controversial) movie I have ever seen. This movie is art and I LOVE it. I don't like people using politics and other propaganda to over cloud their judgement towards this film. Why not just let go of those problems and go see the movie open-minded? We live in a world where good things we love is bad because of feelings and lies. Don't let politics overshadowed art. This film was great for what it is and I love every minute of it. No regrets....I hope this actor and this movie wins an Oscar.",10,1,3,5 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Disturbingly Entertaining...but not Disturbingly Scary.
","I expected to be more like the first movie but I was a little disappointed. There's some things in this movie that was pretty predicable, little cringe here and there, jumpscares were mostly disturbing and gross but not horrifying, and Pennywise was mostly the disappointing one out of the film. Despite these problems, I still like the movie. It's like watching a rated R version of The Goonies as adults, like I'm watching a 80's film. The characters were great, especially Richie. I say it's a okay film to watch, but you won't get any scares out of it.",6,0,0,29 September 2019
Marriage Story," Kramer vs. Kramer for the Modern Era.
","I wish there was more hours into this movie because I wanted more, that's how much I loved this movie. The actors were brilliant in the film, making it such a emotional rollercoaster to sit through. The ex-couple are going through a hard time and not one of them feels like a bad guy, you sit there and observe what's going on and you understand their point of view. This movie almost remind me of Kramer vs. Kramer except we do see the dad and the mother in the film rather than mostly seeing the dad.",10,4,6,14 December 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It's a dumb movie, but it has its moments.
","The action, Wonder Woman, Batman fighting Superman (for 8 minutes), and Batfleck is probably my favorite thing in the movie. Although I do enjoy these moments, the story that drove them to do these things is ridiculous. The movie was trying to compete with a franchise that's been going on for 9 years and doing so, they cram so many things into one movie without time to understand instead of making a movie about each DC characters like the MCU. I do enjoy the movie, is just that things that are happening in it makes it feel unwatchable to me.",5,3,4,3 May 2019
Ben-Hur," This movie basically created the word 'Epic'
","I wanted to see movies that won some Oscars at the Academy Awards, then I came upon the Holy '11 Academy Award Winning' movies: Ben-Hur, Titanic, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I have only seen Titanic and The Return of the King, but not Ben-Hur. I wanted to see what so special about this movie. Best Cinematography, Art Direction-Production, Score, and Special or Visual Effects are my favorite categories for the Oscars.
Yeah, it didn't age well, but the acting, the colors, the cinematography, the production, and the music score really sells the movie. The story reminded me of Gladiator in the way, which helps me understand the plot better. This movie basically revolutionized the word 'Epic' because that is what this movie is. Epic.",10,1,2,18 June 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Funny yet moving
",I think it's been awhile since we see a WW2 film with the Germans perspective and seeing this film makes it look like a controversy waiting to happen...which makes people want to see the movie. The first Taika Waititi film I watched was Thor Ragnarok and I actually loved the movie. By its comedy stats. I still could understand the movie plot and details pretty well. Jojo Rabbit is like this but in a powerful way. It's enjoyable fun flick focusing with hard drama topics. This is tasteful film for everyone to try out.,9,1,3,27 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The movie that got me into Star Wars again.
","I haven't been much of a Star Wars fan since the Prequel trilogy and The Clone Wars as the kid. I barely pay any attention to Star Wars and focus on new things...until the teaser dropped on YouTube and boy was I hooked. I started to watch the Original trilogy before going to theaters with my day because I was excited like everyone else.Not many people liked this movie because it lacks originally, copy previous Star Wars movies, and have a Mary Sue protagonist (which I ended up agreeing few years later). Overall, I really LOVE this movie. The visuals were spectacular, the action was mind-blowing, and the score sells it. The story is basically the same plot as A New Hope but I don't mind it because it was taking our new heroes into a story we know, while entering a new one. It seems like it was going to start something new (until The Last Jedi ruined it).My only complaint is that I wish Finn was a Jedi, turns out it was Rey. From the looks from the trailers, it was making out Finn has the force. Just imagine a former stormtrooper turned into a Jedi throughout the series. It was still cool seeing old characters back and I really love this movie.",9,2,17,28 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the old classic movie I had fun watching.
","I'm probably going to get down voted for this, but in my opinion, I think this movie is better than it's 2 sequels. It was adventurous rollercoaster and the soundtrack keep giving me goosebumps. It's like watching a medieval fantasy mixed with World War II...in space! The characters were marvelous, the soundtrack makes it feel like I was there, and the practical effects were very well made and I don't think it has aged.",9,1,1,15 October 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," My #1 Favorite Action Movie
","I've seen multiple action movies I enjoyed, but this movie, out did them all. The action, the music, the cinematography, and the special effects kept my blood pumping up for more. I nearly cried at the end of this movie because it was so beautifully well made. What a film, what a lovely film!",10,4,8,2 July 2019
Gladiator," 21st Century Modern Entertainment
","Sadly, some movies like Robin Hood, Alexander, and Ben-hur remake will never be as good as this movie. This is one of the most epic movie I have ever scene. Crowe did an amazing job playing as Maximus and also Phoenix did an amazing job playing the most hated villains in cinema. This will go on as the first epic movie in the 21st century.",9,1,1,4 May 2019
Evil Dead II," Little creepy yet very laughable.
","When I first show this movie, I was confused with why did some stuff change from the first and why is it all goofy. I did some research to realize it was basically a 'requel'(a remake sequel) because the movie was own by a different company and the ratings for this movie change. I did look back at the movie and see what it was trying to be and I like Sam Raimi's style.The atmosphere of this movie is horrific and goofy at the same time, which I think works for this movie since the first movie was corny as well, but very gruesome. Bruce Campbell back as Ash goes through a lot of torture in this film which makes him lose his mind in a funny. Mostly of the movie is funny but relates understandable by going over the top. I think most people like this movie so much is because of the story and with Sam Raimi's campy element, it makes it more like a dark humor.Some people will hate this style of the movie, but going back the first film it did the same thing just more embrace. The movie tries to be scary in the funny way and that's fine because that's is what it's going for. Creepy but funny. Heck, there are some effects that are some effects in this movie that are visible to see and you can tell this movie isn't meant to be taken seriously. Some people will still hate this film and that's fine because this film isn't for everyone, but to understand why everybody love this movie, you have to see what the movie is going for.",9,1,2,17 October 2019
