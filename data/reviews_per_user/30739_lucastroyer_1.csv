The Longest Yard," The Longest Yard
","The Longest Yard is basically the story of a college quarterback's after career life. The quarterback's name is Paul Crewe He gets arrested, and then gets sent to jail. At the jail, he is confronted by the Warden of the prison. He is told to start a football team out of all of the prisoners and have them ready for a game against the guards of the prison. The two teams meet at a high school stadiums and have a remarkable game. In my opinion, this movie is one of my favorite football themed movies. It is very funny with times of sadness and action. Adam Sandler and Chris Rock were a very good pair of actors in this movie. I also liked how they were able to get a lot of famous names into their cast, such as Stone-Cold Steve Austin. This is one movie that if I see it is on, I will want to watch it.",8,1,2,3 May 2012
