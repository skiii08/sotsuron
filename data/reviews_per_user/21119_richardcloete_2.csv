Deepwater Horizon," Just a load of booms, bangs and flashes
","I will keep this short as most aspects have already been covered.In short, this was a terrible film. It could have been fantastic, but instead of focusing on the massive political, economic and environmental issues that followed the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the film focuses solely on the life of riggers and the explosions. Lot's of explosions. There is really nothing to this film... just a load of way over the top special effects with flashes, shaky camera action, explosions and whatnot. To make it worse, the camera is zoomed in - making it almost impossible to tell what is happening... although, it was probably just some piece of the rig blowing up. Additionally, the dialogue was absolutely rubbish! There was no depth or substance to it - all that we were fed was how stupid BP is. To top it off, the characters all sounded like African American gangsters, even though most of the cast was white! Finally, for some reason, the director decided to play a list of the 11 victims that lost their lives in the accident... fine, but he chose to do so at the end of the film, most of which died in the initial blast and therefore one is left wondering, 'hmm, who was that again?'.If you are looking for an interesting, well-thought out and dynamic plot, turn away! This film is for people who do not have a thought of their own and just want to watch some things blow up.",3,62,121,24 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Recycled rubbish. Don't get excited
","There is nothing that I can say here that has not already been said, so I will not waste my, nor your time writing anything other than this: Just look at the votes by users... 90% are 1 or 2 stars. Now, look at the score given by 'critics'... 7/8/9. What does that tell you? Ignore the idiotic critics; they get paid to spin fairy tales. It is clear that the VAST majority of fans agree: Star Wars 7 was absolute garbage. I can think up a better plot in about 30 minutes... There is zero imagination in the plot. The characters are dull and are given no introduction, no background, no history... nothing. To make it all even worse, the scenes are cheap and acting is shoddy.",3,36,52,24 December 2015
