The Blair Witch Project," Chilling
","This was the most chilling movie I have ever seen.  It brought out some of my childhood insecurities - being afraid of the dark and hearing strange noises.  I must admit that somewhere in the back of my mind I probably do believe in ghosts, witches and the supernatural.  I knew the story line going in to the theater but was still on the edge of my seat.  If you do not believe in the supernatural, do not bother seeing this movie because you will not be able to let your imagination play along (i.e. my husband). However, if these types of things bother you, you must see it.  Three days later I am still haunted by the tent scene and the final scene in the house.",10,1,2,5 August 1999
