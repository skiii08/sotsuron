The Ring," It is a horror classic.
","This movie is one of the leaders in the horror genre. It is up there with all the rest. It is creepy, thrilling, and keeps you guessing. The plot-line is good and the scenes are well shot. You are always asking yourself questions, and in the end it all makes sense. Although it is a supernatural horror, the ring is greatly about mystery and the way the film is done is fantastic. For horror fans this is a must-see. In my-school this film is a forbidden object, that if seen will make the watcher an immortal horror fan. The little girl is great and is disturbing, and the final moment in which she is unmasked, you see where this film is really going. Another great thing about this film is how weird it is. The affects of the tape make no logical sense, and they don't need to. Though there are some flaws.The opening scene is tacky and unoriginal. Also at the start the boy is really weird and feels miscast. But all-in-all a classic and if you like horror you already should be driving to rent a copy.",8,0,1,26 March 2005
