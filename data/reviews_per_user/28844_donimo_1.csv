Requiem for a Dream," Possibly one of the best performances in cinematic history.
","Even though I agree with 'Danfish' that Ellen Burstyn was criminally robbed of the Oscar for this film, I must point out that it was actually Julia Roberts who stole it (Erin Brokovich), not Marcia Gay Harden. Other than this one small misstep, I emphatically agree with every word 'Danfish' said, all the way down to the amazing scene with Sara Goldfarb talking about how old and lonely she is. Probably one of the most stunning and true moments in cinematic history is this conversation with her son Harry. Every single scene where Ellen Burstyn appears is magic, including the one where she has just completely lost her mind and is deliriously wandering the streets and subway. This is probably my favorite film despite, or maybe because of, all its stark beauty. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who can handle it.",10,0,1,21 May 2005
