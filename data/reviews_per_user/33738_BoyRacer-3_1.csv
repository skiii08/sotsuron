The Blair Witch Project," Instant classic
","Being a huge fan of horror movies, I wasn't expecting too much from The Blair Witch Project, but what I got was one of the greatest movies ever made. In fact it's the first movie I've felt strongly enough about to add a comment on IMDB. It simply grabs you and doesn't let go till the shocking and truly unforgettable climax. I've been recommending this movie to everyone I know, and it was just as intense, if not more, the second time I saw it. I'd definitely give it a 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,19 July 1999
