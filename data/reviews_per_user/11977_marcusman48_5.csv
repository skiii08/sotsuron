Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Can't mix Buffy with politics
","I actually saw Steven Spielberg's LINCOLN before I saw this one, and in retrospect I wish I'd done things the other way around. The Spielberg film was was skillfully acted and directed, especially with Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role, even if it got bogged down too much in the politics of the 1860s at the expense of focusing on Abraham Lincoln the man. But ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER ultimately falls short because it tries to do two different things and fails at both of them.I can't complain about the film's technical aspects, which are about as good as Hollywood gets. And the performances of Benjamin Walker and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Abe and his wife Mary Todd, respectively, are appealing, even if they're hardly historically accurate even without the vampire stuff. But the central premise of the movie is flawed, at least if you serve it straight-up.I admit I did not read Seth Graham-Smith's book, which I've heard is superior to the film adaptation. Maybe it's unfair of me to judge one medium by another. But the filmmakers missed a huge opportunity to make ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER truly entertaining by trying - among other things - to make it a 'serious' vampire story. I know one shouldn't always be prejudiced by the title of something, but a movie with a title like this one makes you expect an extra-large helping of horror-camp, like the original BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie or Quentin Tarantino's FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (both of which are enjoyable films, even if they're not excellent ones). But here everything is played (no pun intended) deadly seriously and with very little humor. You have to imagine that Honest Abe, who loved telling funny stories, would himself be disappointed.But all the earnestness doesn't simply make the film boring and depressing; it ruins any chance the story might have had of resonating with audiences. It sucks (again, no pun) all the fun out of vampires by trying to link them to the Confederate States of America. ('Hey, vampires are evil and slavery is evil, so they must be linked somehow, right?') And having the real-life death of Abe's son Will be the result of a vampire disguised as a servant biting the boy would be monstrously insensitive if it weren't so thoroughly absurd. I can't imagine Mary Todd screaming accusations at Abe about their boy being killed in such a way; I'd much rather expect her to just get angry at the VAMPIRES and set about gathering up crucifixes and whittling stakes.There's one other major problem I just couldn't come to terms with: the idea that the Battle of Gettysburg was actually a fight against vampires in Confederate uniforms, and that the Union soldiers destroyed them by shooting them with silver bullets and goring them with silver bayonet points. Assuming you even try to accept this at face value, how in God's name did it manage to stay out of the history books? After all, the secret of Gettysburg would have been known to Abe, Mary, the entire Lincoln Cabinet, EVERYONE in the War Department, top military leadership, and all the thousands of men who fought and survived. Even if Abe himself wanted to keep it all under wraps, surely SOMEONE would have blabbed.See ABRAHAM LINCOLN VAMPIRE HUNTER for the novelty value only. There is really no reason to watch it a second time.",4,3,5,16 October 2014
Mississippi Burning," One of the best social drama pics ever!

American Beauty," What...What was the point?
","AMERICAN BEAUTY is, to put it quite bluntly, an embarrassment. At least if you consider yourself an accomplished filmmaker. True, if the director were severely mentally challenged, this film would deserve all the praise in the world for its ironically glamorous style. But that would only prove how low a bar this movie set for itself, because plenty of movies out there are pretty to look at.While I could have believed that Sam Mendes and his crew won some Academy Awards at some point in their career, I never in a million years would have believed that they could have won the award for THIS! I'd even go far enough to say that THE MATRIX deserved the 1999 Best Picture award more than this did - and THE MATRIX was little more than trendy trash.Even when watching this as a relatively naïve teenager, I could sense how hollow and trite AMERICAN BEAUTY was at its core. Did we really need a two-hour domestic drama to tell us that 'suburbanites are weird and they're harboring shameful secrets?' You can get the gist of that from watching most Tim Burton films - and be more entertained than here, too. Not to mention that the above cliché was already, well, a cliché as early as the Fifties.And speaking of the Fifties, I can't help wondering if, had Mendes made AMERICAN BEAUTY four decades earlier, he would have won even more Oscars. Because here he rips off a LOT of films from that era, and not only are they very famous films but they're considered classics. Dead guy as a narrator? SUNSET BOULEVARD already did it (and DOUBLE INDEMNITY did it even earlier, albeit with an ALMOST dead guy). Secretly taking pictures of people? REAR WINDOW already did it. A middle-aged man cheating on his wife for a much younger woman? One of the oldest plots in history - but, more to the point, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH already did it.Which brings me to the biggest slap in the face of all. The young woman in question (who is not the 'American Beauty' rose garden of the title, but is explicitly associated with it) is not Marilyn Monroe but Mena Suvari - a girl who would need only the smallest amount of makeup to portray a vampire. Sorry if that sounds mean, but it's true. Even when Suvari is doing her utmost to be sexy (and this film certainly makes the effort), her pale and cadaverous face is pretty hard to ignore. For that reason alone, this movie's plot makes no sense. It's not much of an exaggeration to say that in real life most men wouldn't consider it worth the risk to betray even a 100-year-old Annette Bening for Mena in her prime.I must admit that I'm glad this movie exists, if only for the reason that I get to mock it and joke about it. And I can't help thinking that it works on SOME level. You might consider it a feature-length, VERY dark cheesy sitcom spoof. Or a very polished student film done as a warmup during the first semester. Or something to leave in a time capsule for our distant descendants or a visiting alien race who wanted to learn about twentieth-century American movie stereotypes.But it does NOT work on the Oscar level.",1,1,12,5 March 2020
Aladdin," Too much for this cantankerously chauvinist Westerner
","As Guy Ritchie's ALADDIN arrived in theaters, there was a great hullabaloo raised by the so-called 'SJW's' (social justice warriors) over whether the live-action remake would be sufficiently politically correct. With the movie set to be light-years more 'authentic' than its predecessor, one would think they would have been grateful. But what they were promised seemingly wasn't enough for them.But with what they ended up getting, they needn't have worried. ALADDIN is quite possibly the most 'woke' Disney fairy tale you'll ever see.To start with the obvious, the significance of the casting is impossible to miss. With the exception of Will Smith (who does get top billing, even though this is ultimately not his story), pretty much the entire cast is of Middle Eastern, North African, or South Asian extraction. The main characters do speak in American accents for the most part, but otherwise this is a show that is (with one ironic difference) thoroughly non-Western, and in some ways even anti-Western. There is only one character of European (or, given the mythological setting of Agrabah, pseudo-European) descent seen throughout the entire movie, and he is not only marginalized but made to appear a buffoon - and, to add insult to injury, he isn't even funny.But the 'socially relevant' changes do not end at the cosmetic level. There are the small things, such as the 'sensitized' song lyrics (Agrabah is no longer 'barbaric,' and Prince Ali no longer owns slaves), but the more fundamental alterations have been to the plot itself. Believe it or not, ALADDIN is now primarily a political thriller in which Agrabah's national security is at stake. The evil vizier Jafar is now not only greedy and power-hungry, but a visionary in foreign policy. And, as it turns out, the kingdom's most worthy head of state proves to be...Princess Jasmine.Yes, that's right. In fact, as events play out, Jasmine becomes the sultan! Disney might as well have titled this version JASMINE and called it a day. Though it makes sense that Aladdin, who can claim no experience in statecraft (not having been a real prince, you know), would not have made a good sultan himself, the denial of the throne to the person who logically would be the (male) sultan's successor still seems vaguely like a humiliation. Certainly, it's Aladdin who brings Jafar's ultimate defeat, and Jasmine is indeed reduced to a damsel-in-distress courtesy of Jafar's black magic, but that's really only for the sake of form. The irony of this big change, of course, is that in simultaneously trying to make the story more sexually egalitarian AND more respectful to Arab culture (among other nods, they recognize Friday rather than Sunday as the Islamic holy day, correcting a blunder made by the 1992 animated version), Disney has done a disservice to the latter by rendering the tale more Western - which is, to say, progressive. Sometimes you just can't have it both ways.Don't get me wrong. I adored the movie's visuals, the delightful music, and Will Smith's brave attempt to match Robin Williams's cosmic level of charisma. But for all that, there was a chagrined spirit inside of me that wanted to yell: 'No, Jasmine, you do not get the throne! You're not a man! JAFAR deserves to be sultan more than you!'Let's just say this movie will make you feel so 'woke,' you will probably never sleep again. Jeez Louise. For all my hatred of Trump, this sociological debacle is almost enough to turn me conservative again.",4,11,16,19 June 2019
Born on the Fourth of July," Yankee Doodle? More like Yankee Doofus!
","As a lifelong fan of Oliver Stone films, I felt betrayed after seeing this on video for the first time. More than just about any other filmmaker/screenwriter, Stone has inspired me to attempt to write my own screenplays. His movies always display a plethora of technical wizardry, rendering the artistry of cinema in its boldest colors. Indeed, so impressive is Oliver Stone as a showman that it is all too easy to overlook that many of the stories he tells range from the mediocre to (in this case) the horrid.Tom Cruise plays the famous Vietnam War-era Marine Ron Kovic; the man himself appears in a small role in the film. But I am surprised that Kovic would have wanted anything to do with the filmic adaptation of his book, considering how unflatteringly Cruise portrays him. As Kovic, Cruise proves to be deeply unlikable and often unintentionally funny. He (very poorly) takes a stab at Kovic's Long Island accent. He brays 'Love it or leave it!' as if that were some magical mantra. By the time we see him and Willem Dafoe spitting on each other, I was laughing uncontrollably. I felt bad about laughing at what was ultimately a tragic story, but I didn't really consider it my fault. I put the blame on the director and (especially) on the actors, who look like sit-com stars being directed in an embarrassingly inept TV movie.All of this might have been forgivable if Stone had at least put some effort into the story, but his efforts are hit-or-miss at best. The script is riddled with historical errors, from Kovic's assertion that the North Vietnamese were fighting for independence (blatantly false) to the appearance of a rock singer belting out 'Rock Around the Clock' in a Fourth of July parade taking place in 1956. (Was rock 'n' roll really socially acceptable enough then to be a theme in a small-town community parade? I think not.) Then, just to prove that he managed to stay awake in history class, Stone hammers home every 1960s trope he can remember: from burning the flag to the Black Power movement to the supposed sexual repressiveness of suburban Americans, he misses no opportunity to play up the clichés. The fact that this movie won some Academy Awards tells me only that Hollywood will lavish honors on any half-baked historical epic as long as it's done with enough chutzpah.Is there anything at all good about BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY? Well, Stone does prove once again that he knows how to paint action-packed panoramas on the screen; his scenes of riots and firefights and parades are extravagant masterpieces, at least when taken on their own terms. But they have been put at the service of a story that plays out like a twisted satiric comedy. Mark my words: you will feel ashamed to be an American after watching this, for it depicts us as profoundly delusional and dysfunctional and ultimately pathetic. It is a mystery to me why Stone, who professes to harbor so much fondness for American history, would go out of his way to squirt huge yellow gobs of macaroni at the Yankee Doodle Boy.",3,19,34,29 December 2007
