The Hangover," Just wow...
","I actually made an account just to review this movie, because it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen Superbad :P So, the humour is top-drawer. Sure it's very crude, and even slap stick in some places, but that just makes the film so much funnier. The 3 main characters, (not including Doug) have great chemistry with each other, both in acting and comedy, and the side characters like the two crazy police officers, and the Gay Chinese Mobster were simply quality.All in all, it was Â£6.25 thats was well spent. The storyline was excellent, subtly combining many classic comedies to enhance the already fantastic quality storyline and humour. Hats off to the script writers, the director and the cast, for a simply hilarious movie.Watch It. ASAP.",10,8,14,17 June 2009
