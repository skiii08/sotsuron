The Rock," Great action movie with a couple of glaring mistakes
","Just to get them out of the way, here are my complaints:Atropine does NOT get injected into the heart. This would puncture the pericardium and kill you, plus, atropine is a poison it'self, and pumping that directly into the heart would also kill you. It gets injected into the thigh.Also, F-18 Hornets belong to the Navy and Maines, not the Air Force.Okay, that aside, this movie kicks serious butt. I has a great cast (Sean Connery and Nick Cage, of course. Ed Harris is fantastic in anything, so this is no exception. Some of my favorite supporting actors are in it, John c Mcginley, Bokeem Woodbine, William Forsythe and Tony Todd just to name a few.The plot is about as feasible as they get for Jerry Bruckheimer films. It also runs the gammut from Intense action to some extremely heart-wrenching scenes. (The Navy Seals getting it is always difficult to watch)The first night I saw this was New Years eve, 96 turning over to 97, Aand it was the most fun I have had on a New Years before I turned 21.",Null,1,2,5 April 2002
Alien 3," Not for everyone, but dont be too harsh on it.
","For starters: SPoilers found below!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now that that is all out of the way: Alien 3 was not a big hit, and I admit, the killing of Hicks and Newt straight out almost killed it for me the first time I saw it, but by the end i was so pumped at seeing more Alien that i didnt care.They were very good characters that deserved MUCH more than this, but let's face it. Aliens came out in '87. Alien3 didnt come out until '92. Newt was in second grade, and Carrie Henn was about 10 or 11 when the movie was made. That would have made her about 14 or 15 when Alien3 was made. Explain that diescepancy without doing another '57 years in hypersleep'....They could pull some tricks with Michael Biehn, but I imagine he was off doing other things. So 2 of 4 remaining lead actors are unavailable. Do you replace them? NO. I would have been outraged had they just replaced Henn and Biehn.So what else could they do? They wanted Ripley. So they had to kill off the other two. I wanted another Alien, so I accepted the sacrifice.I read something somwhere that said that since the characters were almost all criminals, we felt nothing for them. Okay, so they were criminals, and dressed the part. However, with the exception of descriptions of their crimes, and the attempted rape of Ripley, we see very little to suggest that these people ever did anything wrong. Hell, i always had a hard time buying that Pete Postalwaithe's character was there for any crime. He seemed to likeable.On to the performances.Charles Dance was great. For the first part of the movie, until he gets killed, he stole the show. I was almost offended to find out he was Sardo Nussebaum and that happy-face-contact guy from the LAst Action Hero. Those roles were beneath him. He was convincing and damn likeable as Clemmens.Charles S Dutton. Okay, if I want to gush about him, I'll go over to his profile and comment there. This man is just great. When he and Ripley are convining the convicts to fight, wow. That is the most rousing speach i have ever heard.Ripley is great as always. Sigourney Weaver managed to portray her as the exact same woman in 3 movies. Ripley is easily one of the greatest cinematic characters ever. period. Hard to imagine  that she was set up to be the 'most likely to die' character in Alien. Yep, Ridley Scott wanted the audience to think she would die. Not bad, huh?I'll end with Morse, because otherwise, i would go after the whole cast, and space does not permit. The whole movie is bvasically split into 3 parts: Ripley and Clemmens Ripley and Dillon Ripley and MorseEach act has it's own person paired up with Ripley (Arguably, there is a 4th one in there with Aaron, but he is an idiot), and each part manages to feel natural with that person as her partner. More props for miss Weaver.Morse is great, because you get to see him grow from lazy rebel to active, getting-shot-for-the-cause semi-hero. He was SUCH an ass, it is hard to not like him. Plus, my sister thinks he's cute. As she puts it, 'not cute-cute, but monkey-cute'. Not since Bluto Blutarsky has there been such a loveable foul-mouth.
In the end, if you love the end of Aliens to the point where you cant bear to see the characters gone, leave the series as Alien and Aliens. If you are willing to accept their loss for the greater story, then enjoy.",10,5,9,26 August 2003
Alien: Resurrection," Okay Action Flick, but not very Good for an Alien movie
","Okay, I will admit that I am one of the most disturbingly Hardcore Alien fans on Earth. I spent an entire summer watching Aliens 2 to 4 times daily just to learn how to draw the damn things. And I like Alien 3.But i had a hard time swallowing Resurrection. I love Ripley, we all do, but c'mon. Cloned? Grown up in a few weeks? Retaining Memory?!?!Movies do require suspension of disbelief, but the other Alien movies did not require very much. The 2 originals were masterworks done by two people I believe to be geniuses. The third was done by another incredible talent (Fight Club is another favorite of mine and Se7en made me sick to my stomach, for all the right reasons). Resurrection...... I'll admit, ive never seen anything else this guy had directed. All I can assume is that he figured he was making a movie for an American audience, so he decided to make it nasty, gross and disgusting.Do the others have their share of gross? You betcha. Did it drive the plot foward? For the most part, yeah.But I can't eat through much of Resurrection. That friggin baby-thing at the end makes my skin crawl every time, and I have to put my drink down when it comes on the screen. It seems to be that in some director's hand-book it says 'When a creature bites down on a head, blood should spew forth like the mighty Old Faithful'. I never realised that death caused the blood vessels suddely gain the power of fire hoses, but here is the proof.All the 'so-so' parts aside (it is a pretty good movie, it just stinks for an alien movie), the only real gripe i have aginst this movie is the scene where Christie (Gary Dourdan) dies. It has always grated on me, because it was so completely unnecesarry. I never understood how acid-scarring and a high-dive into very deep water killed him. He was tough. It always struck me as the writers said 'Well, the black guy always dies in movies, so I guess we should kill him'. Irritating. Christie was one of the best characters in the movie.I will mention that I miss the old Ripley. The new one is cool, but it's more 'Siguorney Weaver in another Alien Movie' than good old Ellen Ripley. She has the same name, but is a different character entirely.All complaints aside, i do like the movie, and was not at all let down that it was included in the Alien Legacy set. (which , of course, i have). The characters are a tad shallow, but still enjoyable. The references to the other movies reminded me of a Simpsons episode (that is a compliment from me). I like Ron Perlman, he's always welcome to any cast. Michael Wincott rocks. I've liked him since Robinhood: Prince of Thieves.All in all, it is a creative, enjoyable sci-fi action movie. 6 out of 10",Null,0,1,26 August 2003
The Exorcist," The scariest movie ever
","The exorcist is one of those movies (right up there with Citizen Kane and Casablanca) that will remain with popular culture forever. It is truly frightening, with scenes that can actually make you feel physically threatened. Now, some reviews have been done by people with religious upbringing, and i can see how it would have a great impact to them. I, however, am an athiest, and i have to say, the movie doesnt lose any of it's impact even if you dont believe in the existance of God and Satan, because in the movie, they are very real, and very convincingly portrayed.
Linda Blair was pretty damn brave at her age for taking the role as Reagan. Unfortunately, this movie did for her what Clockwork Orange Did for Malcom McDowell. Rather than being lauded for her part in one of the greatest horror films ever made, she became the bearer of it's stigma, actually having her carreer suffer for her convincing performance.If you wish to make your life filled with paranoid delusions and a fear of the dark and being alone, I recmmoned watching The Exorcist, The Ring, and possibly House On Haunted Hill (okay, crappy movie, but had some good scares) alone in the dark at night. try taking a leak at 2 in the morning with the subliminal face of the devil creeping into your thoughts.All in all, the film was well produced for the early 70s, the acting was well done, the special effects were great, and the attention to what constitues 'horror' was impeccable. While it is blatant at times, it is never particularly gory. Anything that could be construed as 'inappropriate' was the Devil talking through a child, so it wasnt inappropriate, it was plot.
To date, the only horror film that affected me nearly as deeply as the Exorcist was The Ring. If you like horror and have not seen this classic, you are sorely cheating yourself.",Null,1,2,19 May 2003
