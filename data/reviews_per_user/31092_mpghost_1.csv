The Expendables 2," 100% Action
","*SPOILER ALERT*It's a good movie. But not good enough.One of the things that I don't like about it is that the ending is not convincing enough. Yeah, Barney killed Jean Villain. And that's it. And I didn't get to see enough kicks from Jean. It was disappointing.Jason Statham played his role in this movie REALLY WELL. His knife/dagger throwing skills were impressive. I mean, his scenes were really cool. Heck, they can even make a movie out of it! Like the past of Lee Christmas, something like that.It was great to see old geezers fighting old geezers. But the ending wasn't convincing enough.",7,0,0,28 November 2012
