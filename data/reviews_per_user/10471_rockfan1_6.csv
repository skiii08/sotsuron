The Blair Witch Project," I'm so scared right now...It's on!!!
","Have you ever seen a movie that you wanted the main characters to just die a horrible death? Well then Blair Witch is for you! Whether it's the whining of Heather or the stupidity of her male buddies(I'll hold the compass and you hold the map!) you find a reason to cheer for the Witch! It basically stinks, in fact I can't say that enough-IT STINKS!!! 1/10  I'm a sucker for a movie that kills off the people I hate",1,2,4,3 July 2000
X-Men," X-Men are alive and well
","Bryan Singer knows what he is doing and what he is doing is creating an excellent franchise. This film leaves you wanting more and more and is just amazing. Hugh Jackman may have only been big 'down under' before this but now he is king of the world. His portrayal of Wolverine was perfect and he showed he is a fine actor and a bad man. Mardsen did a fine job and really gave Cyclops that preppy leader with the hot babe I always envisioned. Famke is hot and a great actress who created a hotter than imagined Jean Grey. Patrick Stewart was excellent and proved he was Prof X. I had my doubts about Mr. McKellan but he proved me wrong and I'm glad. Halle struggled as Storm but could easily tweak her role for the sequel. No one did a bad job except the score composer. While it didn't hurt, it didn't help.X-Men is awesome and the sequel is coming. Prepare for the next generation of adventure to get even better10/10 This is a dream realized for X-men fans and a great film  for non comic fans",10,0,0,2 August 2000
Being John Malkovich," Average at best
",Talk about a movie that made me wish I hadn't seen it. I had high hopes for BJM after reading reviews and hearing the positive remarks of those who had seen it. But I was really bored with this film. The idea is great but the after awhile it gets boring and repetitive. It came off more like a music video than a movie and just didn't connect with me.Sorry but I give this film a 4/10,3,1,2,29 June 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Impossible to sit thru
","Talk about the worst John Woo flick of all-time. I felt that the main point of MI2 wasn't the plot but how much can John Woo stroke the ego of Tommy Cruise. The action scenes are soo overdone that they are stupid and the first hour of the film is liking waiting for the doctor to see you..boring and annoying Ving just seems to sit in the background with nothing to do, a total waste of great talent. Anthony Hopkins is involved for only a millisecond but what a second it is, now that's a waste of talent The effects are pointless and the editing is very poor (watch for the dead guy get into a car!! Space Mutiny revisited!) The ending has you angry cause it's a complete load of crap. In fact, load of crap sums up MI22/10   How big can the ego of Tom Cruise get?? Only time will tell!!!",1,12,23,30 June 2000
Scream," I've lost hope for horror
","That's what Scream does to the original fans of horror who thought a great horror film was coming soon...it smashes that hope with a hammer until nothing is left!! David A. is not funny, he never has-been and he never will be. Neve has that sweet, innocent, hot look going but she can't act her way out of a paper bag!! Courntey Cox is well, she's Courntey Cox and that says enough about her ability as an actress. The only bright side of this film...HENRY WINKLER!!! FONZIE!!!1/10  Wasn't scary, wasn't stupid and isn't worth a $1.95",1,5,20,3 July 2000
The Sixth Sense," Horrid
","Am I the only person in America who knew the ending after the first 10 minutes!!! The ending had about as much surprise as the season finale of 'Becker'.*SPOILER MAYBE* Bruce Willis plays Mr. Non-emotion who gets blasted by his wacko student, Mr. Under pants, in his apartment. After watching Demi Moore's ex bleed his bed red we get introduced to the 'only reason' this movie was good, Haley Joel.What we follow next is the life of captain loon tune as he talks to more ghost than Clinton did interns. Soon we find out the 'Big surprise' ending which I won't give away cause if you had a brain you'd already knew after ten minutes or less. The ending to The Haunting surprised me more than this load, If you see it watch it for the young man who was screwed by the Oscar pickers-Haley Joel-My rating--- 1/10 (GO AWAY WHOEVER WROTE THIS)",1,6,18,28 June 2000
