Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," This is movie making is supposed to be
","I was totally caught up in the story from the very beginning beside the outrageous and extreme scenes one upon the other. You can only do outrageous if it works and that's exactly what Downey Jr. and Law pulled off. I hope that this is just the beginning of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson with these two guys. It was a great bromance in its most asexual sense--after all part of the story line was Dr. Watson getting married. Perhaps unintended but it showed a powerful relationship they had together as much as Dr. Watson had his frustrating moments not completely understanding the motives of his partner but ultimately trusting his incredible acumen in dire situations. I also enjoyed that there was more story line plot than just one action scene after another. Finally, Downey Jr. nailed down the English accent and even the expressions of an Englishman .Clearly, one of the top ten movies of 2011.",10,1,3,24 March 2013
