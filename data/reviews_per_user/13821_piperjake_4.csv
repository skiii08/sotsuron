10 Cloverfield Lane," Claustrophobic, tension filled thriller - NOT a sequel
","I tend to enjoy writing spoiler reviews more than non-spoiler ones, however with this film I truly do not want to give anything away. I want everyone to have the same experience I did when I watched this film. Which is a good experience. Very good.The premise at a glance is that Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is involved in a car accident after an argument with her boyfriend, and all of a sudden, she wakes up in an underground bunker being held by a man named Howard (John Goodman) who claims there has been some sort of chemical attack on the surface, and that it isn't safe to leave. However, Howard may not be the all the saviour he seems to be. That is all I'm going to say in regards to plot, as anything more would be considered a spoiler due to J.J. Abrams excellent marketing campaign similar to The Force Awakens: never give too much of the film away.The beauty of this film was the unknown. I haven't watched Cloverfield (2008) for a good few years, and made the decision not to re-watch it before the 'sequel', in order to fully appreciate the film as an original. In fact, it is not really a sequel at all. If you go into this movie expecting raucous action you will not enjoy it; it is a claustrophobic, tension-filled thriller, and a movie in itself as opposed to a follow-up.John Goodman steals the show. After watching some of his more comedic films like The Big Lebowski (1998), I thought perhaps that is the character I would see whenever he spoke, but that was not the case at all. Goodman is a phenomenal actor, and I believe this is some of his best work. He had the perfect believable balance between insanity and rationalism and is genuinely terrifying in the movie, on par with Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men (2007). You are never too sure whether he is bending the truth, telling the truth or lying, and as a viewer we explore much of this through Michelle and fellow bunker- bound Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). There was also much impressive acting on Winstead's behalf. The only other film I had seen her in was Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (2010), which is a fun movie, but doesn't flair up her acting capabilities as much as her performance in this flick. Her non-cheesy portrayal of what could have been the classic 'damsel in distress' was in fact extremely commendable. Playing the relatable character in the film, all of the choices she made were believable and thought-out, which is what many modern actions/dramas tend to lack, leaving the viewer thinking who in their right mind would do that? As Chris Stuckmann noted in his brilliant review, the film didn't feel like it had to become bigger than the one it shares a name with (NOT a sequel). The studio in fact did the exact opposite, creating the movie solely from a very small set of perhaps five rooms within the underground bunker. This impressed me as it meant the film relied completely on the characters and dialogue, which was a bold move for debut director Dan Trachtenberg. The score composed by Bear McCreary was also compelling and very much added to the darker scenes, in both senses of the word. I particularly enjoyed the sudden changes in tone whenever Howard entered a room or spoke, a small aspect that can often completely change a scene subconsciously.The lack of music in particular scenes also worked in adding tension and uncertainty to the film.My only criticism of the film, and even here I have to think about it, is that the ending could be seen as rushed. Without spoiling anything, the 'reveal', as it were, was eloquently done, however that wasn't the strong point of the film. The acting and dialogue indefinitely compromised for this minor critique, and I would recommend that you see this film as soon as possible to avoid it being spoiled!",8,2,4,28 March 2016
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," 2hrs3m of confusing Americans
","Firstly, before I have even watched the film, I absolutely love the audacity of its existence. Literally no one asked for Eurovision 'The Movie', and yet what a strangely great premise for a story. I liked this even more upon learning that Will Ferrell himself is a big fan of the contest, and was a major hand in getting this film from paper to living room TV.I feel that I should pre-empt this review by stating that I watch Eurovision religiously every year, and that the date is CLEARED from my diary as soon as I learn it. The film itself does a pretty good job at explaining why Eurovision is so popular - the whole thing is a caricature of itself, and I love that Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga continues this tradition. From the get-go, it knows exactly what it is and should be - cheesy, campy and over-the-top. Eurovision was wise in seeing its own indulgence and being able to self-deprecate for a large portion of the movie, which I fully commend. Being directed by David Dobkin, who appears to have directed mainly music videos, was probably a good choice for these reasons. Also, the fact that the film has a subtitle makes me think...is this the start of a saga?! Forget the MCU, from now on I'm attending midnight screenings of the ECU...After Holmes & Watson (2018), things could really only go up for Will Ferrell, and this film has its fair share of welcome Ferrell-esque slapstick and humour. As with his other films, some of the quips fall flat and some tickle you for hours after the credits have rolled - it's always a mixed bag. Unfortunately, Eurovision had a few more duff notes than you would usually find, but thankfully the film moves on quickly enough to forget about it, unlike films by a certain Sandler that often crack a joke and leaves silence after it as if it's a comedy set, but even the tumbleweed doesn't feel like interrupting.I digress.If you're a fan of the annual contest, the inclusion of a few familiar faces is a nice touch. The effort gone into the production is truly commendable - I'm told that a full song was written and performed for every country that would usually compete in Eurovision. The ironic thing is that pretty much every song heard could quite easily pass as a winner of the contest. The 'song-along' (essentially glorified music video/karaoke) about halfway into the runtime was a fun little showcase, however did feel a little shoehorned in for the sake of a single to release with the film. Upon checking Spotify after, my hypothesis was confirmed. This could have been done better and be less incongruous with the pacing.The, for lack of a better word, 'villain' was a little bit of a concerning choice for me. Of all of the European countries to choose from for a 'bad guy', they decided to go for... yep, you guessed it! Russia. It really is a lazy film trope in 2020, made even more of a bizarre choice when the 'booing' incidents of Eurovision 2014 and 2015 are still fresh in the minds of many. Casting a person from the UK as the villain might have been a funnier choice and a little more tongue-in-cheek as, and I quote the film itself, 'everyone hates the UK'.I was told by a friend before watching this film that if I like Blades of Glory (2007), I'll enjoy Eurovision 'The Movie'. Perhaps this kept the memory of Chazz Michael Michaels fresh in my mind, but I couldn't help noticing the almost uncanny similarities between the two films throughout my viewing. For starters, both films feature Will Ferrell with long hair and a big personality, and not to mention explore the subject of underdogs in a big competition. However, even the smaller plot beats match scene by scene - one conversation that includes characters that may or may not have had sex with each other for the sake of sabotaging a rival duo could have been stripped word-for-word from Jimmy MacElroy for all I know. Yes, if it ain't broke then don't fix it - but also try not to create a carbon copy that ends up being inferior to the original!Wow. I've really written all this on a movie in which Graham Norton stars as himself. Regardless, everyone needs a feelgood movie from time to time, and truth be told, this movie made me smile a lot in a time when doing so is quite a rarity - and there's nothing wrong with that, right?Very much enjoyable Ferrell-style-flick. 7 stars.EDIT: It's the day after I've watched the film and I have listened to nothing but the soundtrack, so they must have done something right in that department. It's definitely filled my Eurovision-shaped hole in 2020.",7,1,1,3 July 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man," Garfield not the right choice
","If I hadn't have seen the original Spiderman trilogy I would have probably rated this movie higher, but I have so therefore I can't help but to compare it. In itself, this movie is good- Emma Stone played the part very well and the plot line was believable for a 'comic book' movie. The problem is that I don't think Andrew Garfield was the right choice for the lead role; he is a good actor as we saw in The Social Network but something was just missing for me, lack of Peter Parker quirkiness? The plot line was believable as I said but also predictable - there were no interesting plot twists and I found myself getting bored in the talks bits, the dialogue between the characters could have been written by a 9 year old! I understand that not all action movies need to have action 24/7 in them, but honestly, this needed more! There were only a handful of decent action sequences and most of them were pretty short. All in all I was disappointed leaving this movie, I will see the sequel and hopefully Garfield will have stepped up to the role.",6,2,4,4 August 2013
Spectre," Classic bond movie - not without flaws
","Spectre took Bond straight back to its 1960/70s roots. It included a gadget scene from Q, a classic hit-man side-story, all on top of an underlying secretive and mysterious adventure, from previous Skyfall (2012) director Sam Mendes. I did enjoy the film, it didn't quite exceed my expectations after watching the brilliant previous film, however I appreciated the route that the film tried to take.I felt that character of Q was much more fleshed out in this film than in Skyfall, largely due to screen time, however also on the part of Ben Whishaw. He brought more quirkiness to the character than we've seen in Bond films of old, which was a brave move on Mendes's behalf. I feel Q is very much the Han Solo of the franchise, being sarcastic, funny and somewhat relatable. I also thought that the now cult opening sequence was exciting, not the best that we've seen in recent times but pleasing nonetheless. Despite being the weakest in the Craig era, Quantum of Solace (2008) had one of the most dramatic opening scenes!The car chase was also a high point of the film. Well executed cinematics and choice of camera angles from Hoyte Van Hoytema created real tension during the whole sequence, and it all felt very realistic. The film handled action in general very capably and was always in control of what was happening; each shot was deliberate and tailored to give a different perspective. The film peaked for me at the debate room scene, where we first meet Oberhauser. The lack of soundtrack added to the whole atmosphere, and clever camera work did make you feel as if you were spectating; no one dared to breathe in the cinema at the eye gouging scene. A recurrent theme that I noticed was that the film was funny! I found myself laughing out loud at points, yet humour wasn't too ridiculous to take away from the seriousness of the whole film.There was parts of the film that could have been improved, however. It was predictable, however I loved the plot twist in that Oberhauser was essentially Bond's brother, and that he was in fact not Oberhauser, but the sinister Blofeld. This, though, I felt was very much skipped over. It is a fairly large reveal in terms of plot development, and if you weren't concentrating on the film you could have easily missed it. It could have done with being hidden more throughout the film, only to reveal it more dramatically later in the film, instead of rushing the scene. Also, I expected more from the film I general. I can pinpoint many great moments, but there was no one scene or event that made me go 'Wow!', or feel any strong emotion like in Skyfall and Casino Royale (2006).Spectre is a thoroughly enjoyable yet flawed movie, that lives up to Bond film standards, but perhaps could have been better. One part of me wishes that this is Craig's last Bond movie as it was a satisfactory end to his era, however the other part of me loves him as Bond too much that one more 007 movie couldn't cause any harm!",7,3,17,27 October 2015
