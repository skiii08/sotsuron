50 First Dates," Fun movie
","I am a big Adam Sandler fan and that is the reason I went to see this movie. I enjoyed this movie to a great extent but the only thing I didn't like was Sandler's performance. He is not in form but surprisingly I loved Drew Barrymore, Rob Schneider and Sean Astin's performances. They were simply brilliant. Watch this movie for three of these characters you will have a good time.My Rating 9.5/10",10,0,0,18 February 2004
Minority Report," Minority Report is a brilliant movie
",I bought this movie on DVD without even watching it first and I think this is one of the best DVD I bought. Minority report is a brilliantly made movie. Tom Cruise performs his part with a lot of intelligence. The direction of the movie is simply outstanding. Steven Speilberg is a great director. A must watch movie. My rating- 10/10,10,0,0,27 December 2002

Bridget Jones's Diary," Surprisingly funny and good

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," This movie surprised me
",When I went to see this movie today I didn't expect a lot but I was surprised. T3 is a very interesting movie. Although T2 was a bit better but this one has a very interesting storyline. For action lovers this is a must see. If you liked matrix reloaded you will have a lot of fun in this one. The humor in this movie is pretty good too. My Rating - 10/10,10,0,0,5 July 2003
The Usual Suspects," One of the best thrillers I have ever seen
",Great acting and great direction are the words that describes the movie The Usual Suspects. Kevin Spacey shows that he has a lot of acting skills and the direction by Bryan Singer is just outstanding. A very good movie to watch. A must watch.,10,0,1,31 December 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Brilliant
",I just went to see the butterfly effect with a lot of expectations and all my expectations were fulfilled.  When the movie got over I wanted to watch it again.  It is one of those rare movies which is 99% flawless. All I can say is that this movie should be seen in theatres as the movie is simply excellent.  Ashton Kutcher gives a fine performance as Evan and so does Amy Smart (she is hot).My rating 10/10,10,0,1,18 February 2004
Saw," I loved it
","Movies like Saw are the ones that makes us believe in the horror genre. It is because of such movies we like to see horror/thriller movies. Let me tell you that after watching Saw I wanted to buy the ticket and watch it again because after a long time I got to see a real gripping and tightly directed horror movie. The movie is very exciting and has a lot of goosebumps. However, if you are a faint of heart please do not see this movie as it has a lot of gore/violence in it which will make you jump out of your seat. I just can't wait for the DVD to come out as I really want to buy it. My recommendation to all of you is to watch Saw and have a good time like I did. Also, the movie has a great twist. 10/10",10,389,580,10 February 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Great movie but first one was better.
","Better special effects, great acting and a gripping screenplay makes matrix reloaded a great movie but I still think that the first one was better because it had a better script but that doesn't means that you should miss it. Some people will get disappoint in the end of the movie but I am pretty sure that Matrix revolutions will be great. I can't wait to see it.My rating- 10/10",10,0,0,24 May 2003
The Departed," damon caprio nicholson are a blast, Movie is fantastic
","After walking out of the theatre after watching the departed, I felt like going to the ticket counter, and buy the ticket for it again. The departed can best be described as the most powerful and the most entertaining movie of the year. It's very hard to decide who was better than who in the movie because everyone gives a great performance. Leaving Nicholson, Dicaprio and Damon aside the supporting cast too gives a great performance.Martin Sheen and Wahlberg gives some great support to the cast. My favorite scenes includes the one involving Martin Sheen, Wahlberg and Dicaprio. These scenes are really well executed. I have always been a big fan of Scorsese, and even this time he doesn't disappoint. He surpassed my expectations by leaps and bounds. Thank you Mr. Scorsese for making the departed.Dhruv Puri gives the movie Two Biggest thumbs up way up.",10,1,2,16 October 2006
Bruce Almighty," HILARIOUS and non stop fun
","Jim Carrey is outstanding. He knows exactly what he is doing. I went to see this movie today and believe me I was laughing, laughing and just laughing. Jeniffer Aniston also gives a brilliant performance in this movie. She really looks hot. This movie shows that being God is a job itself. This movie is a must see for all Jim Carrey fans and all comedy fans. I can't to buy this movie on dvd.",10,0,1,24 May 2003
