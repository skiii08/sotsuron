The King's Speech," Very honest
","For me, a parallel between The King's Speech and The Queen (2006) is very appropriate because while Stephen Frears' movie was pioneer exposing the royal family intimacy, Tom Hooper's film tries to follow - even indirectly - the same formula that made The Queen a success between critics and audience. Tom Hooper, along with screenwriter David Seidler - backed by the Weinstein brothers' experience in giving independent films necessary production to turn them into commercial successes - reached the same goal with The King's Speech. By this point of view, leaving aside the distinct themes of each one of the movies, I consider The King's Speech some kind of unofficial prequel of The Queen or, maybe, the male version of Stephen Frears' flick, but just for some similarities between both movies.Anyway, the film is successful in all aspects, from Colin Firth's visceral performance to the effective direction that seamlessly gathered traditional and conservative elements of direction with modern features of independent movies. While Tom Hooper keeps the film linear and often common, the contrast happens when he intensifies through cinematic techniques what's happening with Firth's character, making the audience feel his anguish and inability to handle his problem, making it clear by these moments that the film isn't conservative as it seems and as the critics are saying it is.Historically the movie has its merits too as most of the people didn't realize what in fact happened with the royal family in that troubled time and also how the King's problem was affecting the decisions of the monarchy and its reputation in a fragile moment when people and also other nations were heavily demanding politic responses, becoming an untenable situation.David Seidler's screenplay does a wonderful job when subtly reveals that the King wasn't unprepared for the throne, but was a person contained by his meanness feeling, believing that being a stammer was an impotence condition and not a disease that nothing had to do with his capacities. The movie grows as the audience - and also the character - starts discovering those differences and that under that voice there's a strong man able to be a respectable monarch who defies himself for the sake of his beliefs.A very honest movie. I do not consider it the best of 2010, but surely a part of the list.",8,0,0,4 March 2011
Black Swan," The movie that the symphony deserves
","Black Swan is the movie that Tchaikovsky's 'Op. 20 - Swan Lake' needed. While Hollywood trivialized the composition for decades using it in ordinary drama scenes and transforming it in cliché and also a joke in drama, Black Swan, above all, comes to stop this and proves that a symphony is not meant to be trivialized but used as a amazing support creation.Of course that Black Swan is far from being the masterpiece that Requiem For A Dream (2000) is or also a cult movie as Pi (1998), but Darren Aronofsky made another poetic and amazing movie with memorable scenes full of emotion and expression of the fears that we hide and oppress all the time to a point that one day or another it releases itself. Darren knows how to treats and transforms our inner feelings into images and Black Swan couldn't be different in his career and the more the movie improves more the images and the characters become stronger.Natalie Portman is mesmerizing. I'm impressed how that little girl from The Professional (1994) is becoming one of the best actresses of her generation improving her abilities and proving her capabilities on each new work. Black Swan comes to sum a list of remarkable works as on Closer (2004), V for Vendetta (2006) and The Other Boleyn Girl (2008). Being a 2011's Oscar favorite not surprises me and I will not be impressed if she wins. She really deserves.The scene when she enters the stage as the Black Swan proves that this girl is an amazing actress. She makes you believe during entire movie that she isn't capable of both roles and suddenly she transforms herself into a sexual bomb exploding in sensuality and desire.Also, the scene when she's dancing and the feathers starts growing is one of the most amazing scenes of 2010 and makes me shiver all the times I watch.Amazing. Fairly one of the best titles of the year.",9,3,6,18 January 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Meet the new great super hero of the last century
","The first Sherlock Holmes not only took off Madonna's shadow over Ritchie's works but also reinforced the idea that troubled icons such as Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law and Guy Ritchie himself still ruling the box office.Putting that aside, the first Sherlock Holmes was a breath of fresh air for a character that had become something so obsolete as James Bond over the years. Like Daniel Craig renewed the world's most beloved spy, Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr. renewed the world's most beloved detective.Fans of the books liked Ritchie's new approach, although many still questioning the presence and importance of some facts and characters like Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) in the first installment, since that character is mentioned in only one story. The presence of Rachel McAdams as Irene also brought a different dimension to the first movie because she was a great partner and, as Sherlock mentions in the story, she is 'the woman' and I could not hide my disappointment when I noticed that her presence in The Game Of Shadows would not only be important, but also brief... very brief.Instead of Rachel McAdams, now there is Noomi Rapace performing gypsy Simza Heron, a character that appears and disappears and no one even notice that during the movie. If some fans say that the presence of Rachel in the first movie was useless, now they have reasons enough to do the same with Rapace's character. Of many films I've seen lately I haven't watch any that features a so useless character that has nothing to contribute for the development as happens with Sim Heron.The name of Noomi Rapace in the credits is just an indirect way to promote and link her name to David Fincher's remake of the first part of the Millennium Trilogy. That's so that way that here in Brazil both movie posters of Game Of Shadows and the remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo are arranged and disposed in hall theaters intentionally.The Game Of Shadows is a great action movie. The slow motion scenes and the scenes representing Sherlock's logical reasonings and his practical side were maintained and improved and for me those are the best scenes throughout the film together with its linear plot and great story development. But I think that some exaggerations turned Sherlock Holmes more like a new great political incorrect superhero than just only a clever detective.Many people loves the eccentric figure of Downey Jr. and his cynical way of acting, but I personally don't like his constant habit of always acting like everything was a big circus. Jude Law was great as always and Jared Harris as Moriarty really is the great villain that you should never met.Also happened in this movie what happened with Soderbergh's Ocean's 12, a film filled with improvised dialogs and full of inside jokes between a bunch of friends.But despite all of that the film flows as it should, the plot development is linear and holds our attention, keeping what it promises during its 129 minutes.And Guy Ritchie proved that he could stop being a director of cult action movies to become an excellent blockbuster director without losing his own style.",7,0,0,15 January 2012
Sucker Punch," Action movie disguised into a non existence concept.
","Movies and imagination always were side by side. So, a movie about a girl that tries to use the imagination to escape from reality isn't an original plot and at the same time is a dangerous one for the fact that movies are natural products of imagination. Sucker Punch follows the same premise of 2010's Inception, which isn't as good as it seems when trying to mix fantasy and reality. I'll not extend my points of view about Inception because I've already wrote about it, but the fantasy product that Sucker Punch offers is more successful than Inception because it's surreal as it could be, and the movie should have stayed like this entirely. But Snyder's attempts to make it not an ordinary action movie fails badly.Snyder did a lot of promotion and explained a lot of something that in the end is just a movie filled with spectacular action sequences, amazing visuals, young women representing different fetishes in the attempt to attract the male audience, and all this huge package still bore and make us thinking the reasons of its existence.I've read a lot of reviews about people saying that 'you need to understand it to enjoy it', for me it's completely the opposite: if you try to understand anything, than you will not enjoy it. That's why the audience didn't get the movie, because there's nothing to get even with all the explanations Snyder gave about its concept because he tried to make it a cult movie and maybe a reference for the genre in this decade giving deep perspectives to an action movie that has nothing to offer. So the audience expects something really huge and then the movie gives nothing than a boo-hoo. I mean... it's an extremely loud thing when just a regular scream should be effective.Sucker Punch could have everything to be a perfect action movie, but his plot full of empty reasons just messed with its amazing action sequences, making it just a collection of music video scenes. And that's it and only.One of the other negative things about the movie is about its sexual incoherent intents. If the movie pretends to be about women empowerment why reduce them to fetish characters? If the movie is about women trying to release themselves of men's oppression why keep oppressing them with all its attempts to attract the male audience? The rough and raw beginning of the movie gives the audience interest to keep their attention but then the characters became just a product of the male culture. So, that's why I agree that somehow there's some misogynous thing about this movie.At first Sucker Punch may seems impressive and pleasant, but then you realize it is just the easiest way to make an action movie disguised into a concept that only exists in Zack Snyder's mind.As I said before the movie blows your mind with spectacular action sequences, amazing special effects and visual concepts... one of the best since Matrix, 300, among others, really! Technically it's perfect and fans of comic books and video games will be dazzled by it, but should be watched just for theses qualities.",6,0,2,18 June 2011
The Hunger Games," Far better than the book
","The Hunger Games is a surprise. For the first time I've watched a movie that is better than the original material. In a era that every channel has a new kind of reality TV program, like those ones that Truman Show (1998) and EdTV (1999) predicted a lot in a brief past, Suzanne Collins' idea sounds, by its own merits, interesting. And although her mix and parallels between reality shows and Roman Empire 'panem et circenses' are by far the most interesting idea that came back to pop culture in the last couple years, I didn't like the book for a lot of reasons.The success of the book trilogy is completely understandable. Until 10 yrs back book series wasn't exactly a product of consumption until The Lord Of The Rings become more popular than it was. Then Harry Potter followed the success of its major source of inspiration, becoming the first young adult series to become a world wide hit. When the series was close to its end people was crazy for a new stuff, searching for a new book series that could replace it. Then Twilight saga was discovered and later, The Hunger Games.Unlikely Twilight saga, which entire movie series was made for young people that loved it without reasons because it is incredibly bad, this one is for a totally different audience. First of all because there is a real actress there, second because Gary Ross (director and writer) did a good work taking the essence of the book and amplifying it, never hiding from the audience that everything is a TV show, even the cheesy romance. But the good thing about Collins' saga is that it always was more interesting as a material to be used in the future than as literature. All three books of the brief saga are short, with a lack of description and poor narrative that would only satisfy those ones looking for a new subject. So, the best achievements of the screenwriters (including Collins herself) were taking all these flaws and transform them into a movie that does what the book fails: dive you into it.The 1st person narrative that Collins uses is an extremely old technique for those ones who does not succeeds a lot into other different perspectives, cutting a lot of what could be a great experience if a much more described narration was used instead. And that is what the movie does, it shows you the different and wider perspectives that the book does not.Gary Roos, who directed that sweet movie called Pleasentville (1998) and the great Seabiscuit (2003) had the same gentle hands here and the supporting actors give to the movie another high level. Elizabeth Banks performed Effie Trinket exactly as she is in the books. Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci (and his prosthetic teeth) were far better than the way Collins describe them.But at the same time that the movie feels better than the book, sometimes it also fails. It cuts some important facts of the book wasting time on Katniss hiding, crying and running or other uninteresting facts that if doesn't bore us, dumbs us. There are so much open space for close shots too, and also plenty of 1st person shots, which sometimes are interesting, connecting the audience to what the character is experiencing, but there is a time that it stops being interesting to become dull. For a movie rated PG 13, I think that more should have been shown like the fighting between other tributes which would have given us the feeling of what a true hunger game is. Instead, the tributes are shown as a bunch of teenagers in high school bullying each others.Its success is fair because it's not bad when compared to other low quality movies made for this age group. It has bad moments, but as a whole it deserves attention and Jennifer Lawrence deserves this success.",7,1,7,23 April 2012
Juno," Not all that I was expecting, but...
","I was quite curious about this movie. Any comments of it till now are very positive and the fact that the screenplay was written by a blogger and former stripper, only increased my curiosity. But just yesterday I had the opportunity to watch it.Movies are like books. There isn't bad literature coz everything is valid. And I think the same thing about movies. I'm a person who watch any kind of movie, and I try hard to understand the primary artistic tone of each one of them, even if it's the worst movie ever. I do this because regardless the quality of the film, sometimes the intentions are good. Of course there are unbearable films, but the idea, if well crafted, could offer an excellent result.I really must say that the movie is not all that I expected. I watched the movie and all its extras with pretty attention trying to understand the whole creative process and its intentions at its best, and truly I could not understand the reason for so much talk about.It is a smart movie, no doubt. It's a realistic drama, the existence of clichés are minimal to not being noticeable. And the performances, with no exceptions, are outstanding and convincing. I read and heard few people talking about the performance of Jennifer Garner, but I think that the simplicity and subtlety of her role is very important for the dramatic tone of the film, it's evident especially in the scene where she feels the baby for the first time at the mall, is one of those scenes that any soundtrack is dismissed because it's exciting for its own, and that scene actually is a plus in her entire career. Ellen Page for me is Juno, and Juno is Ellen Page. I cannot imagine any other actress for the role, but like Brazilian reviewer Rubens Edwald told, who watched Hard Candy will realize that Ellen's acting is not very different between both characters, and I totally agree with him.Nor do I say if the original script (which was written by Diablo Cody) deserved an Oscar. Maybe yes, because Diablo's idea for writing a story that has not yet been told and also with clichés away, really works. I also believe that the power of the characters and the script really works for the fact that much of it was written by Diablo's own experiences. The characters are fictional, but were based on real people and events of writer's own life. With exception of a few characters, all seem to have come from the same cake tin. They are intelligent, cunning and quick-reasonings, and all are references to Diablo's personality. Even the actors say it in the extras, saying that there's a bit of Diablo in each character. That's why they seem so similar to each other and I don't think this is very interesting when we are talking about a screenplay because the great dramatic content of a story is exactly for the existence of distinct personalities created by one person - the screenwriter. I think this is the big negative point of the movie, the personality of the characters are not as deep as it seems, because everyone has a personality very similar to each other and all of them are very similar to Diablo.Maybe I really don't understood the movie as it should be, or maybe my teenage time has really been quite different, because I couldn't find in the film all the elements that much of the audience could find and talk so much. I also believe that the film was a lot surreal when the parents accepted the pregnancy of Juno in a so easygoing way, mainly, when she decided to deliver her child for adoption as simple as it happened.Do not judge me bad for some of my bad reviews. It's just that, in my particularly point of view, I don't feel that the film is a masterpiece as it is reported. But even then, I found the movie interesting for being subtle, light, with excellent performances, intelligent dialogs (much more intelligent than in real life), an efficient direction and a script that, although some daydreams, is quite fluid.It's not all that I was expecting, but also there's nothing so bad or negative to talk about it.",8,1,2,21 September 2008
Spider-Man 3," Not this time!
","I really don't know what happen to this people in Hollywood. Sam Raimi got 3 years to finish the trilogy and everybody was expecting the 'big show', 'the best one', 'the golden key'... so, everybody was expecting so much and then he brings a mess.The resumé of the story is simple, fragile and interesting: Peter Parker starts liking his suite more than ever. He knows how to live his personal life with his super-hero's obligations but he's starting to forget who he really is. That's a simple plot like the first 2 movies and it starts well till the audience see that it's not simple like that.The mess starts with the visual effects. They are the worse of entire trilogy! It's so plastic, so unnatural... I mean... it blows on your eyes that it's truly fake that even Hulk looks better. It's not something like X-Men: The Last Stand, that you see and think: 'Wow, this visual effects are great!' but, yes, 'WOW, THIS VISUAL DEFECTS ARE GREAT!'. Too much chroma key, even at unnecessary moments. So, if should be like this, why Tobey and Kirsten are still being cast! Let's just make a CGI Spider Man movie! Final Fantasy shown us that this is a possible thing.Then, the camera: Sometimes things are too fast, lot of CGI scenes, so much action and movements making you lose points and focus. You get dizzy, everything is dark to make a camouflage over the CGI imperfections and finally... you see anything. It's something like throwing a magazine in a liquidizer, that's what the movie is all about sometimes.And now, the final point: Too many villains. Too many stories. I think that Sam Raimi was so desperate to put all together just for the pleasure of the fans that he made real mistakes here. 1) all the stories loses its focus; 2) people was expecting an entire movie just about Sandman, or Venom, or the Green Goblin's return.The movie goes slowly 'till its final part, then everything happens fast enough. I can see Sam Raimi at the editing room: 'OMG, 120 minutes have been edited and... where's the action??? I had 3 years of my life to make this but I could only find the right color for the black suite now, so, everything needs to be done until tomorrow morning because Saturday is the premiere! C'mon everybody, fast! Fast! FAST!'.Why should you see: well, it's the end the trilogy... if you already saw the first 2, why not this one?The best part: Stan Lee camel.What I really think: Spider-Man is done. Sam Raimi should move to other projects, he's a great director, but he seems kinda tired of so much spiderwebs.",5,0,1,17 May 2007
Match Point," Good for its ending
","OK, nothing that we haven't seen on other movies about bizarre love triangles: boy meets woman, man meets girl, boy meets girl, man marries girl, boy marries woman, boy gets girl.Boy stays with woman, woman wants a child, woman can't get pregnant, boy just get nuts. Boy can't broke up with woman, woman still wants a child, girl gets pregnant, boy loses his mind.That's it! This is what the movie is all about. We all heard this story before BUT, not told by Woody Allen. The perfectionism here is all about the differences between both Americans and Europeans culture, something that Woody knows lot about. The English aristocracy is well reported and the north American rustic veins too, like 'ok, people, this is my first movie in Europe, so... something remains', until the time Woody kills what has been reminiscent. That's my point of view.BUT... the great part here is the insanity that gradually installs on each character's mind to a point that you know how it ends, but you don't know how it goes. You THINK you will know how the end will comes till you see that it's not the way you thought and again it's not the different way you're thinking again and this makes this romance thriller one of the best ones in years.Woody's perfectionism is here, all the time, but it doesn't affect the final results like use to happen on his previous works, and that's a very good thing, making this movie something consistent, heavy and not something just meaning to be the mirror of his freakness.",8,2,4,9 April 2007
Cloverfield," An excellent low budget movie!
","For the first time I saw the trailer I was horrified with the idea. Seeing the head of Statue Of Liberty falling in front of the camera really shocked me a lot, not for being the head of the main icon of the USA, but yes for its crude feeling.When The Blair Witch Project came out people realized that a lot of other 'projects' using the same kind of narrative would pop everywhere from that on, but it never really happened, and Cloverfield is the first excellent movie to follow The Blair Witch by an own original way.J.J. Abrams is a great creator and producer, and Cloverfield is something to make him proud of his success because he used a very low budget (25mil) to produce something intense in a so high level that Spielberg should feel ashame.I don't have anything bad to talk about this movie. The action and all that suspense flows naturally, and the characters are really doing what people would surely do in real life (with exception of 'saving the camera above all of things'). J.J. Abrams together with the director created something really interesting that gives freedom for mistakes, continuity errors, plot holes... resulting in something intelligent and brilliant.",9,0,1,18 June 2008
The Expendables," Testosterone celebration...
","Brazil was one of the filming locations of The Expendables and after that Stallone did an awful joke about Brazilians at Comic Con which had a very bad repercussion worldwide. Later he apologized for the joke inconvenience but it was too late, people here just did a massive boycott to his new action flick, even me... until now.Anyway... besides all that press stuff, Stallone proves one more time with The Expendables that he can finally and officially be passing his testosterone belt to the new generation, but he knows how to make old school action movies like no one without being old fashion or out of date.The movie has all the classic elements that made him the king of bloody punches and explosion in the 80's and is a lot entertaining and also nostalgic see this kind of thing nowadays when action movies have had a lot of changes thru the decades. He's still in shape, get some injuries here and there, but he's tough enough to hold it for the sake of entertainment, as another one said.He also cannot be the best director or writer in the world but we have to admit that his direction and writing is more effective and superior than most of other action directors that are hitting box office since late 90's. Also it's obvious that this is the realization of a dream and a fun time he always wanted and always talked about joining together most of the old and new Hollywood action icons, a project he had in mind since the 90's but only now he could make it true.All the tough ones are there, even as guest appearances like Schwarzenegger and Willis (with a few exceptions like Van Dame and Steven Seagal). Also references are there too, mainly of Stallone's classics like 'Rambo'.You cannot expect anything more than explosions, gun shots, mutilations, real bad ass man fist-fight and bloody+sweat everywhere. Is a movie for the men and made for the male audience with no interesting story, just no remorse fighting and killing.The movie is a clear intent to be a testosterone celebration like men drinking cheap beer in a nasty bar and there's no way to watch it in a different way.Forget John Woo's lame American titles, forget Michael Bay's awful direction and all Brukheimer's terrible taste... get a beer and some undercooked meat and have some fun with Stallone once more.",6,1,6,22 January 2011
Horrible Bosses," Horrible movie.
","Really, this is one of the most horrible movies I've seen in the last few years and I can't believe its 7.3 of ratings. What is wrong with you people, have you lost your judgment capacities entirely?! What have you been watching lately to unbelievably consider this movie something watchable, entertaining or whatever?It has an interesting plot but a horrible script, actors playing annoying characters and a very, very awful development. Never found Jennifer Aniston funnier or interesting more than what she did in Friends, but here she exceeds the line of what an actor should never ever do. I think the same about Jason Bateman, he's not funny and I never could understand why Americans love him so much. The only actors who save some minutes are Kevin Spacey and Collin Farrell. Both Kevin and Collin seems to just having some fun and never try hard to give very funny moments that the other ones never give.Awful, unfunny, uncomfortable, a waste of time and money. Horrible movie.",2,17,35,23 October 2011
Bird Box," Effective but not consistent enough
","Bird Box isn't that amazing as its trailer and premise appeared to be. Don't know the book, never heard of it in fact, but I guess that, like all book adaptations, it may be more coherent on its narrative when the movie is not.Sandra's acting is flawless, an Oscar performance for sure if the movie was better developed and with a wider theater release. It's amazing how she's getting better and better on each new movie. So, about that, no complains. She holds the movie entirely by her own, the same way she did with The Blind Side and Gravity. She's compelling since the first minutes, when the camera captures her minor mixed emotions while she prepares the kids for their blindfolded journey.Surely the movie starts strong. It's shocking how things happen, in a very impressive way as in World War Z. I mean, it's believable in its fiction. The crazyness afflicting people on the streets were terrifying. The beginning of the movie have some resemblances to the beginning of The Last Of Us game too, plus all the emotional rollercoaster of fear it provides.But when the story clearly divides itself between present and past, seems to me that the flashbacks doesn't do what it really should. Instead, flashbacks are there because the story couldn't hold itself only in the present and the difficulties to cross miles in the woods blindfolded with 2 kids.It's so that way that the present time is always boring, lacking of hard obstacles and unpredictable enemies as people may expect. The direction isn't all that good too. The camera never delivers a desperate or claustrophobic feeling of the unseen. Director Susanne Bier opens the camera too much to show every step taken by the characters didactically, instead of doing the contrary, because most of the movie should be developed around senses, which is not, and very frustrating in that aspect. The sound could do so much more like it does in The Blair Witch, for example. A movie where characters are not blindfolded, but have no vision in the dark, making audience experience with them the terror of listening things, but never seeing them.The supporting characters are all one dimensional, and their fate in the story is predictable as hell. Even when they could have been better played over the aspects of doubt, if that character should or shouldn't be trusted, the screenplay fails terribly and shamefully.Plot holes are all around because the writers explain nothing about anything. There's just this imagination surrounding what's happening all the time. Malorie, for example... We can imagine that she has some social difficulties, some traumas or relationship problems with others, but we never know exactly why. Why is she going further with an unpleasant pregnancy? Why is she isolated in her home? Does she have been thru a sexual violence in the past? Only questions... Never answers.The same about the unseen enemy. What is it in fact? An alien? A disease? Or just an unexplainable collective madness? Why some people can adapt to it and some cannot? Why was Jessica affected and Malorie was not?Ok, I hate movies that explains everything, but here they never do it even with the basics necessary to immerse audience into the story.We have no need to see or know what the enemy is, but we should had a moment in a victim's eyes to at least know why the despair takes them so deeply. What is that they see? Their worst fears? Their worst version of themselves? The horrors of the past or future? Why some of them claim it to be be beautiful?So, for me, the movie is only interesting because of Sandra's acting, and because most of the time it delivers what it promisses, even if superficially, but it does. There are thrilling and impressive scenes that will make audience so desperate and affraid as the charcaters are, but that's all. Effective, but not consistent as it should.Sometimes seems a waste of great ideas because the experience could be much more explored, but entertaining if you don't take it that seriously, even if the ending is too simple for all the post apocalyptical circus that was promoted.",6,4,11,22 December 2018
28 Weeks Later," Applauses!
","28 Weeks Later, together with 28 Days Later, is another current masterpiece. Even being two movies setting different stories and time, the continuity idea of this movie fits perfect with the first one because all the elements of 28 Days Later are there... but improved. Knowing that Danny Boyle was there all the time working together with the director, writers and all of the cast and rest of crew members is fantastic, it's a plus to admire more and more his work and professionalism and to believe that this movie could not be described better than one of the best sequels to be placed together with other classic ones as Aliens (1986), T-2 (1991) among very few others. As the first one, it's also not original, but it has all the qualities that a movie like this should always have.While 28 Days Later has a classic horror feeling because it follows the steps of classical horror movies like those ones from the George A. Romero's first 'dead' trilogy, 28 Weeks Later elevates it to a truly survivor horror, something that Resident Evil games did quite well, and also was a precursor of this style, but never achieved that objective with its shameful movie trilogy made for the masses. Alike the previous one, 28 Weeks Later is not all about action and deadly virus, it's also critical and realistic with the governments, civilians and military, and all of this criticism is the heart of entire movie.Juan Carlos Fresnadillo did an AMAZING job researching and adding some of the strong elements of the first movie to the plot, creating a sequel straight faithful to the original but also giving personal touches to it. The actors and the characters are awesome because when you're finally connecting and sympathizing to any one of them, the character suddenly dies, which makes the audience capt the feeling of loss that all the characters have during entire story, and that's simply amazing.Applauses!",9,2,4,11 January 2008
Hugo," The old and new in a perfect balance
","Hugo Cabret is a wonderful story about the history of cinema mainly for those ones who are not familiar to it and believe that its history began in America. Centainly an amazing tribute to french cinema from the beginning to the end.The movie reminded me a lot of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro movies, their visuals, the importance of daily life segments, uncommon characters and the using of fantasy to tell an ordinary story. That happens maybe for the fact that Jeunet is one of the most important contemporary french directors and also clear inspired by George Meliés and his fantastic and colorful misé en scene.Scorcese truly offers to the audience a heartfelt and inspired journey that only an experienced director would be able to give, mixing the old school cinema with what is the most modern in filming technology showing a fully emotional trajectory from the old to the new in a perfect balance.Amazing. The movie is not only a nostalgic way back to the roots, but also what George Meliés exactly expected from cinema: an opportunity to dream again.",9,3,7,5 March 2012
The Orphanage," Another magnificent Spanish production
","The Orphanage fulfills what it promises. As well said, it is terrifying and beautiful.I watch a lot of films, but I know few things about Spanish movies. Maybe that's why Spanish productions are surprising me a lot, because they always run away from some clichés that make Hollywood productions not as exciting as it should. The Orphanage is the truly example because the clichés of horror movies are present all the time, but the way these clichés are used throughout story is exactly what makes this movie out of what seems predictable.It is difficult to talk about this movie without breaking surprises, so I will only say that this is already a classic of the genre in which it fits, even being difficult to fit it in a unique genre since the film is a blast of sensations: the audience laugh, cry, feel fear, compassion, anger, despair...Unlike Pan's Labirynth - which is also a Spanish production that also mix intense feelings - it's not a movie for all kind of ages. Although the film looks beautiful in some parts, it's something only for adult audiences. The way story goes is kinda slow, but no tiring. If people pay attention for the details, they can understand the story as long before it reaches the end. The direction is quite efficient, and the performances - especially Belen Rueda - is magnificent throughout the film.With no doubt, is a film that should have had a better promotion, and it should be seen by all movie lovers.",9,1,2,23 September 2008
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Disappointed
","As I expected: David Fincher's American version is cleaner than Niels Arden Oplev's Swedish version, and that's the huge difference between them, also that's the huge difference between what is produced in Hollywood from what is produced outside Hollywood.My review is ONLY about the movie itself and not as an adaptation, so doesn't matter for me right now which one is more faithful to the book or not, but instead, which one of them has a better development since both are using exactly the same source.Unfortunately this is not an occasion like Capote (2005) and Infamous (2006), I mean, the same story but with open possibilities for several point of views. This is just and only another disposable product like dozen of others Hollywood adaptations of much better foreign movies.I do admire David Fincher, really. He did amazing works that became references. He gave another dimension to a genre that was stuck, he kinda recreated the serial killer genre formula and the word 'suspense' got another depth in movies such as Se7en (1995), Fight Club (1999) and Panic Room (2002), movies that had become responsible for some changes about the way thrillers are produced since then.Making an American version of Stieg Larsson's novel (or maybe a remake of Niels Oplev's Swedish version) seems a little vain in Fincher's hands. There are no big differences in the story development between both movies, but there are huge technical differences. You can't avoid comparisons because this is not just a low budget Swedish movie versus Hollywood production, this is all about art. In one hand you have a Swedish movie that, despite its low budget, is a part of a successful well written, produced and directed trilogy. And in the other hand you have just an expensive sugar water.Swedish version was not afraid to be shocking, and as I said before, American version is cleaner, softer and also more didactic, truly a version made for those ones who do not like think too much while watching a complex movie, as another one said 'Hollywood dumbs things down, making everything transparent and easily digestible for 10 year-olds'. Swedish version is a lot more crafted and demonstrates interest only for the most important facts that were efficiently tied from the beginning to the end in a full circle story that flows without efforts in an amazing script, a very timed edition and a direction that understood perfectly its source and what to do. Also the acting, Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig did a great job. Both are the closest we could get of Lisbeth and Mikael if Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist never existed. Rapace and Nyqvist shows a chemistry that never happens between Craig and Mara.Fincher's opening is an extremely, incredibly and unnecessary loud thing. He stated that the opening is just an expression of what happens inside Lisbeth mind. That makes sense, it's effective and an amazing music video for Trent Reznor and Karen O's cover of Led Zeppelin's 'Imigrant Song', but for me it was just a way to complement and excuse audience for the lack of shocking audacity, roughness and realism of the character that was so well explored in Swedish version. Even her tattoo seems softer, or better saying: forgettable.Fincher also stated several times that he did not watched Niels Oplev's version. There are scenes so similar between both movies that call them IDENTICAL wouldn't sound entirely an offense. Seems that Fincher did some changes here and there just to say it's different and call it his own. So let's believe that what he stated is true, in that case he should have watched Swedish version before just to figure out how this movie should have been made.While Oplev's version is suspenseful and holds your attention from the beginning to the end, events and subplots are tied linearly and brilliantly never forgetting the importance of both characters, Fincher's version is boring and his storyline seems disconnected. The way he shows how Lisbeth and Mikael get connected to each other is so superficial and seems so unimportant that if there's something that Fincher succeeds is transforming Lisbeth into a mere supporting character. Also Fincher 'manages to reveal all the wrong details at all the wrong moments, effectively destroying any mystery or suspense to the story' as defined by another review.I'm completely disappointed mainly because Fincher's version is receiving better ratings than Swedish version instead. There are no reasons for the existence of this remake, there is not even a great and relevant particular point of view. A waste of time and money, a shameless and bad made copy of Swedish version, and the most revolting thing is that Fincher's version will become more popular and called original, believe me.Those ones who are claiming this to be an 'amazing adaptation' or the 'best movie of the year', clearly haven't watched the Swedish trilogy or even cared for that.Leaving the theater I realized how Gus Van Sant's version of Psycho (1998) now seems so good.",4,12,20,31 January 2012
Bad Teacher," Badness is missing.
","I've always considered Cameron Diaz a good actress, even sometimes making average movies or accepting weak roles that never required much of her capabilities. Even though, she sporadicly make movies with quite interesting roles like: My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Being John Malkovich (1999), Any Given Sunday (1999), Gangs Of New York (2002), The Box (2009), among others. Even in Charlie's Angels (2000) and in CA: Full Throttle (2003) she gives very funny moments.Bad Teacher seemed to be the movie she was waiting to be able to use all her powering beauty and strong presence together with a heavy dark humor, since she already had experience characters with some dark sides but they were never entirely bad as the bad teacher seemed to be.Well, the teacher is bad, but not heavily and totally bad, and a lot of badness is missing. She's just a bitter woman that lives an unhappy life with no money and no big tits. She isn't intelligent enough to be a teacher, but is enough to be placed as one. Some kind disappointing for those ones who expected not a very interesting plot or something like that, but at least a character that could use and abuse all the meanings of what is to be bitchy and mean. But the concept of the word may be different for the writers and also the development of the movie is quite poor. If being bad means smoking pot and sleeping during classes, pff... please, I've met worse. Maybe writers should have watched some Bette Davis classics as inspirations about what the meaning 'bad' means between humans, like Of Human Bondage (1934), The Letter (1940) or The Little Foxes (1941), just as a start. But anyway, Cameron is getting better with the age, her timing is really great, and she seems to be just having fun in this one. Lucy Punch, as Amy Squirrel, is incredibly funny and talented, and for those ones who are not familiar to her I always recommend Being Julia (2004), maybe her first major role. Justin Timberlake does his part well and also the rest of the cast, helping to save the movie from the drowning. But in the end is all about Cameron. Even the movie being weak, with a tedious plot and not even a memorable scene or great sequence, Bad Teacher is watchable just because of her presence.",5,3,6,3 August 2011
Resident Evil," Sad for a game fan
","I don't know where or how to begin because it's really tough for me, as a game fan, to describe what I felt when I saw this movie for the first time.First of all, I played Resident Evil for so many times that I can't count. All first 3 episodes are one of my favorite games and my favorite kind of genre.The introduction of the first game is quite exciting, showing us all the cinematic importance of the game with a man stepping into a corridor, being attacked by something unknown and the name 'RESIDENTE EVIL' appearing in the screen in red blood. Then, the game opening shows how everything started. Of course the actors were a lot like amateurs but it was innovative and frightening for a game those disturbing scenes till the game finally starts into a hall in an anywhere mansion. The main characters of the game were Jill Valentine, Chris Redfield, Albert Wesker, Barry Burton and Rebecca Chambers. This brief description of the game is just to make clear how the movie starts as a completely mess.I think that, to say something about this movie, we have to say if from 2 different point of views: as a game player and as a non game player.As a game player I couldn't understand why they have changed all the original plot of the game. None of the original characters was there and all the interesting facts of the game have been totally ignored. All of the original game characters had different and well defined personalities and each one of them have its importance during the game story, something that do not happen in the movie for the fact that Alice is the main character and everything surrounds her. The cinematic importance of the game has been completely forgotten in the movie and all the frightening atmosphere of the game was totally lost. For a first impression, I liked the fact of Milla Jovovich as the main character just for the fact that she's not a box office name but she's an action star and a name needed for the movie's success, but she is an awful actress. Her face is always the same from the beginning to the end in each movie she's cast, with no exception. But what I keep asking myself is: 'Why Alice as the main character? Why all that stuffs about a girl suffering from amnesia, The Red Queen and The Hive, when we already had an interesting plot from the original game?'.The game plot involve a group of special agents that are lost into somewhere full of all kind of monsters that, in fact, are zombies from a genetic experience accident by a part of the Umbrella Co. that's hidden under a mansion for its illegal studies content. This is also an interesting plot for an action movie because it's simple, original, understandable and full of action (that's what action movies is all about). And why did they had to make something so complex in the worst way? But the worst thing is that they did something so strangely complex that's almost impossible to insert the original characters during the movie or in its sequels. So, as a game player this is an awful adaptation.As a non game player I could find the movie quite funny. The movie starts well giving a detailed explanation about the happenings over the Umbrella Co. until the virus takes control of everything. The zombies are interesting because jumps over your eyes that all zombies are people not dressed well with dirty make up. That thing about Milla recovering from an amnesia all, discovering her fighting techniques under pressure situations are so def that is hugely laughable. It's laughable because it's a common situation in the history of action movies and very few of them made it quite well as The Bourne Trilogy. It's also laughable because it's not in a movie called Resident Evil that that situation would be taken seriously from the writers and the audience. Milla Jovovich, as said before, is one of the worst famous actress of history and I can't understand why people like her so much as she isn't an actress because she's never acting. She's always looking with the same way, she's always with her mouth half-open when she's amazed, frighten, happy, sad... and she's always shaking her jaw when she has something quite important to say as: 'you'll die!' I liked some scenes that I don't remember by now because they were too short. Lot of people hated the final scene, claiming that it was a scene for a predictable sequel, but I liked it a lot and I think that it's the kind of impressive scene I was waiting for during entire movie and it's the first time when you can finally realize the complete chaos and destruction that Umbrella Corporation caused and how it should be if something like that happened in real life. So, as a non game player I had an enjoyable time watching that movie but it could be a lot better.That's sad. The movie suffers from improvement failures over the potentials of the game, and the game (and also the fans) suffers under this awful adaptation.",3,0,2,23 September 2007
Avengers: Endgame," Unecessary
","There's a moment in one of Scream franchise openings that a girl makes a comment about the Stab franchise (the movie series within the movie). She says that even Stab series used time traveling because that's what they do when there's nothing else to tell.Funny enough, some of the Avengers makes a quite similar observation when Ant Man comes with this cliche idea. That was exactly the moment that I did remember that quote from Scream. And I couldn't expect anything different from that on.Infinity War was an amazing movie, first because it gave us all the feeling that heroes can fall, and villains can be more than just bad guys without purpose.Thanos is a villain because he was created that way, but his vision about the world and universe are unique and makes sense in his mind. When he snap his fingers and random people start disappearing, Infinity War made its point.At first, Infinity War was to be a movie divided in two parts, and the second part being the consequences and resolutions about the world after Thanos. A new era was about to be born, but suddenly it was stated that the 4th movie wouldn't be that way anymore.After finally watching Endgame, the reasons for that changes are very clear to me.First thing is that most of the fans couldn't stand the fact that some heroes have died, so writers had to think about a differet resolution to please them. Second is that Marvel failed to use it as an element of surprise to Endgame.What we see during 3 hours is an empty movie struggling to keep the pace of an entire cinematic universe created throughout a decade.As a whole, Endgame is only a redone version of Infinity War, and not exactly a follow up as it might seems. The consequences and resolutions are redundant when compared to the tragic ending of previous one. And yes, the time travelling plot was nothing else but a comfort zone to retell a story in a simpler way for the sake of a true ending.So, the clueless girl from Scream was right.Endgame had much more to tell than the way it was done. The plot development could have had dozen of different paths, and each one would have been much more interesting and still satisfying.I really don't understand how this movie became the biggest box office in history, because together with Age Of Ultron, is the weakest movie of the entire saga and entire MCU.",6,8,12,17 December 2019
Quantum of Solace," Is all about action and Daniel Craig
","Well, for sure Quantum Of Solace is not as well written than Casino Royale. In fact, Quantum is all about action and not so worried about a plot. There are some bad and mixed reviews out there blaming the movie for not being so good like Casino, and I really feel sad about these people because if you're going to watch a James Bond movie then you're expecting great entertainment, and first of all, the movie is pure entertainment from the beginning to the end.Casino Royale is one of those James Bond-exceptions that is more than an action movie, being quite a piece of art in the genre. That happens in every each new 007 generation, the same happened to GoldenEye, and the same happened years before it and before-before it. But anyway... the new 007 is the closest to the best thing we could ever expect.The great thing about the new 007 is - of course - Daniel Craig. For sure he gives another respectable depth to the character. James Bond is not and only that womanizer anymore, he's more than that, he's much more real now than that flirting face and thousands of killing artifacts hidden everywhere in his nice outfit and perfect car. People now go to see 007 running in an old Volkswagen, kicking asses like a real someone and feel the pain every time he punches or is being punched and thrill with every dangerous moment he gives. And now also feel his inner pain, the pain of a killer, the pain of someone that lost a love and a life, the eyes of someone that never sleeps and kill the bad guys in the search for a self peace that he lost somewhere. Now I ask you: when, a few years ago, could you imagine that 007 would be all that?So, that's why I think that, even Quantum Of Solace seemingly being superficial, there's no need of smart dialogs and amazing twists and turns here like Casino Royale because this one is all about James Bond discovering himself and showing us what he became after Casino Royale facts. So this is the time to see everything in and by Craig's 007's eyes. And that's it, there's no need for more, I would be completely satisfied the same way if entire movie was 007 locked in a room, because Daniel Craig gave the best personification of the character and understood perfectly what 007 is and is all about.",9,2,9,27 December 2008
District 9," A great alien movie since Alien (1979)
","I've never seen so many critic films being produced and consumed by the masses as in the last few years. Movies that disseminate political and social issues disguised as action, fantasy or fiction. It's the old story, using allegories and metaphors the audience captures the idea without being blocked by their own prejudices. Disctrict 9 (2009), Watchmen (2009), Cloverfield (2008), V For Vendetta (2005), 28 Days Later (2002), 28 Weeks Later (2007), X-Men (2000)... are some of the last examples of important subjects discussed and disguised into pure entertainment. That's really clever.Disctrict 9 is pure entertainment, but also a very different way to feel how humans can be so mean and cruel. The subject here is not about aliens or the probability of any invasion (even if it can also be a probability), but yes to discuss what's the worst of us. For sure the movie is a clear reference to what happened in South Africa in late 40's and what is called Apartheid, but just replacing black people for aliens. But if you replace again aliens for any kind of people or community, the main subject would not change in any way comparing to all that's happening and ever happened around the world. That's why this movie can be entertaining, but also a very interesting way to discuss current matters.The movie itself takes the primal idea of movies such The Blair Witch (1999), REC (2007) and Cloverfield (2008), and also from games like Halo and Half Life. Like those movie references, there're no familiar faces or big names in it, which pumps the reality feeling of the events since everybody is unknown as in fact it would be in reality. There are some moments that you just can't understand why things are happening that way, for example, when Wikus uses the robot armor. That's nonsense, but it doesn't mess with entire movie or the rest of the idea.District 9, above it all, is a great alien movie that I haven't seen since Alien. Cloverfield is also very interesting, but District 9 intensifies the idea and gives you another point of view of things.",9,1,3,16 September 2009
Bridesmaids," Great honest performances
","Bridesmaids really is what is seems: a funny, loose, entertaining and interesting movie with well developed characters that use a simple story to show the relationship between them and also their personal crisis, all centered by a woman that is living the worst moments of her life few days before her best friend's wedding.Bridesmaids is being compared to The Hangover (2011) which isn't fair, because this one may seems a chick flick but it's not just for having more important qualities. The Hangover is just a male celebration without any other interest than just make audience laugh and have fun with absurd situations involving male culture and cliché comedy situations effectively used.Written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, the movie is not absurd. The female culture is there for sure when talking about marriage crisis and all that bridesmaids culture, but it's just a background story. The personal dramas, the difficulties to achieve some objectives in life, relationship crisis between love and friends, the feeling that the world is conspiring against your wills... all of this is universal and everyone goes thru it at least one time in life. The movie shows it all in brilliant small doses without being corny for the effective use of comedy moments to relieve what would seems melodramatic, also it's not cheesy because there are amazing performances by an ensemble cast that most of the times use improvised dialogs and moments, making the movie flows naturally and with no pressures or high intents to be funny.Kristen Wiig shines and gears entire movie, her performance is stunning. Being or not being based on personal experiences, her character fits her perfectly. Rose Byrne also have her important moments and proves one more time that she's getting better with each new work. The other supporting characters are well placed, even some of them being a little underused.Predictable? Yes, but loved it anyway. It's impossible not be fascinated by so charismatic characters within simple and at the same time amazing funny and heartfelt moments that never requires more than great honest performances.As another one said: 'It's strong proof that one can make a comedy about women without it ever being stupid, sexist, or mean-spirited.'",8,1,3,14 August 2011
28 Days Later...," Finally something to make Romero proud!
","Finally a 'zombie' movie to make George A. Romero proud with the new generation of directors and writers. Between hundreds of zombie movies that popped theaters for the last few years, there're no doubts that 28 Days Later together with Romero's second 'dead' trilogy produced (and being in production) during this decade are by far the best ones already produced. The most funny thing is that this movie is directed by the most improbable of the directors to direct something for this genre: Danny Boyle. Yes, the Trainspotting one. The interesting thing about him is that he likes to handle with human limits, and this movie couldn't be different.Screenplay is signed by Alex Garland, and it's fantastic because it follows almost the same steps of Romero's movies, where a virus and zombies are just camouflages, trying to explain over metaphors and allegories a reality possible to happen in some near future. The criticism is always there, all the time, disguised as entertainment. It's truly a movie to make Romero proud with those ones that one day were watching his movies and are now being inspired by him.It's also interesting when we finally understand that the budget of a movie isn't responsible for its quality. 28 Days Later cost US$ 8 mil and had a US$48 mil gross, while the shameful Resident Evil trilogy cost US$ 200 mil and its gross hadn't achieved even the double of its total budget. These brutal differences should make producers, directors and studios responsible for trashes like Resident Evil feel ashamed of their selves. With Romero's words 'The best horror films are the ones that are much less endowed'.This movie is a precious gem among horror and sci-fi modern productions and certainly can already be consider a classic for the fact that it's based on classics.",9,3,4,10 January 2008
Gone Girl," Not that effective...
","The problem lies in the fact that Gillian Flynn tried to be extremely faithful to her own book, giving much attention to the facts and the story development rather than the layered personality of the main characters. Ben Affleck was never praised by his acting skills, and his natural apathy fits well to the character because in the book Nick is described as a guy unable to express his feelings and emotions. The movie doesn't make his personality clear enough as in the book, giving the feeling that Affleck is just delivering a bad performance, which he is not. Only those who did read the book will understand that no matter how low skilled Ben Affleck is as an actor, the character is exactly like that.Rosamund Pike does an incredible job mainly in the moments when those ones who did read the book will understand the real meanings of her looks and actions. In other words, the actress knew well the original material and exactly what she was doing, but the movie doesn't succeed or matters to explain her magnificent intelligence as described in the book. When Flynn and Fincher finally try to come to terms with it, it is too late and ineffective.The film editing never achieves the same magnificence of some of Fincher's latest movies. The dialogs and the conflicts between characters aren't fluid as in the book. Fincher cuts it all the time like a soap opera discussion, making a table tennis with the cameras for meaningless and unnatural reasons. The same about the music. Although Reznor and Ross composed an amazing score that sounds naive, relaxing and at the same time creepy, for sure it is used effectively to distinguish the different times set, but it doesn't quite intensifies some dreadful moments, sometimes sounding more invasive rather than an important scene composition.I did like the story development, which is the same as in the book, and the other characters are pretty interesting. Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Margo (Carrie Con) steal most of the scenes. The amazing thing for me is that the actors chosen, the scenography and locations are mostly exactly as I imagined when reading the book and that makes clear how rich is Flynn's description even being a 1st person narrative.It's a fair adaptation, but far away to be one of Fincher's best movies. For me he is so desperate to make another huge thriller that he is not making movies for fun and pleasure anymore. He did not find yet a material to make him passionate to work on like he did with Se7en or Fight Club. He is obvious unfocused, shooting everywhere to eventually hit the target and accomplish his mission. All the acclaimed reception are mainly because Fincher is always overestimated. They did the same with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and people later discovered that his adaptation wasn't that good at all when compared to the Swedish version. Even being well developed Gone Girl lacks of important subtle details that make the main characters so rich and full of tricky personalities (they also forgot, for example, Nick's sarcasm and self depreciation). A book so rich in words and description that were underused in the movie. When compared to Fight Club and the impressive way Fincher reveals what was obviously clear but we could not see, we know that he could have used different and more elaborated ways to reveal important facts. That doesn't happen even in the most important turning moment of the story, a moment that in the book is shocking because it is unexpected and the movie delivers it in the most ordinary and unsurprising way.Maybe all the few things that keeps the movie away from its glory is about Flynn's inexperience as a movie writer since this is her first movie writing work, but also feels like Fincher wasn't passionate for it anyway and he just delivered an ordinary hired work.",6,2,11,20 October 2014
Insidious," Cheap, cheesy, disappointing.
","Insidious could have been a great horror film. Everything happens very well in the movie from the beginning to its half. The main character doesn't take long to realize that her house is haunted, her husband tries not to believe it although he knows that something wrong is happening. Very obvious things happen, but are treated as 'obvious' and not always as a 'cliché' and that was interesting because the characters discover what is happening and do what must be done to find solutions instead of dying one by one or keep the whole movie discussing with the Catholic Church. But when complex explanations start to appear justifying the mysteries, all the good qualities expressed earlier in the movie are brought to the drain. The film then turns into a B horror movie with infant arguments for a subject that could have been very interesting if well developed. The makeup is more laughable than frightening. If fresh makeup was supposed to be frighting, for sure Insidious would be a blast! I was very curious about this movie, it took a lot of my attention in the beginning but in the end I was regretting seen it because its disappointing.",3,4,10,24 May 2011
The Mist," Insane
","Stephen King has amazing stories that can be excellent explored or can become a mess, unfortunately most of them become a mess when movie adapted, but for the happiness of some of his fans or for some of those ones that just enjoy a great tale, this is one of those few exceptions. Seems that Frank Darabont is the only director/writer to really understand Stephen King. He did 2 other great adaptations: The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and The Green Mile (1999), both critically acclaimed and awarded. He should think about it more often, because it's hard to find great directors and writers to make excellent movies based on Stephen King's novels as Darabont does. From the last couple years 1408 and The Mist are the best adaptations that can be seen.Like Dreamcatcher, this one's also about strange creatures, but dislike the other one, it has been splendid adapted, becoming a completely terrifying piece of horror. It has monsters, gore, explicit violence but also great dialogs, excellent performances, an effective direction, religious and political issues and an ending completely out of Hollywood proportions.Marcia Gay Harden as Mrs. Carmody is just an excellent example of a breathtaking performance. Thomas Jane as David Draton sometimes seems not so desperate as he should, in fact, a forgettable performance within so many characters well performed. I see some people complaining about the visual effects, yeah, they are not so convincing some times but this is just a detail when compared to other magnificent qualities seen and felt for over 2 hours.This movie can be loved for the genre lovers and also for those ones who enjoy great subjects for later discussion, but it will probably not be pleasant for people with problems affecting some of their believes or for those ones who are expecting something easy and superficial. There are a lot more within its story than its shown and it doesn't need so much effort to understand some of them at the very beginning.It's claustrophobic, frightening, shocking. This is not a zombie movie but some references to classic movies as Dawn Of The Dead seems necessary much for its problematic tones disguised thru entire movie, issues that involves social relationships and the constant difficulty of understanding that the modern society presents heavily thru the years, becoming a nightmare when not dealt with logic.This movie is insane. Interesting and clever insane!",9,1,4,9 December 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Beautiful, but too much for something so simple
","The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is curious, but not the best interesting thing that you could be expecting.First of all, it's curious the fact that David Fincher is the director, because he's the wizard of kick asses like Seven, Fight Club and The Panic Room, so you could never imagine that someday he would just jump into something that is too much Chris Columbus, Robert Zemeckis or even Tim Burton for him. But that's OK. Maybe he's just trying to dive into something a little different to express his eclectic taste or also his versatility as a director.For someone that built an entire career as an outstanding director of amazing thrillers and was responsible for some kind of revolution into the genre, Benjamin Button seems a little vain in his hands. This kind of story holds dense feelings that David Fincher is not able to express intensely, failing at times that other directors like Columbus or Zemeckis would probably care a lot more than he did.Getting 13 nominations for the Oscars doesn't mean anything because this is the movie that Academy's waiting for so long since Titanic because it's romantic and perhaps intense over an uncommon story, and everybody loves it. So, this is the kind of thing that Academy will always receive and announce with open arms even if it ends up with none of the statues.The story is simple and everyone already thought about dying young once in a life, but it happens so slowly and suddenly it ends so fast as an attempt to make you feel together with the character his perception of time passing by with the ages, so there are times that you just want to skip all the intense narrative and jump right to the point that everyone's expecting since the beginning: how will it ends? That line connecting fantasy to reality riding you naturally thru the movie like happens in Forrest Gump fails a lot even Fincher trying hard for it sometimes.For sure it's a beautiful movie that makes you think about all the meanings of life for hours, but it's a long-long movie that sometimes seems going to no where. The best parts of it are when Pitt's character is not alone because Benjamin Button is a curious character but he's not interesting enough to hold entire movie up on his back. Brad Pitt is a lot different from everything he did and he's a lot convincing as an old child during the first half of the movie, but that's it, because he backs to his comfort zone after it. Cate Blanchett has a very supporting role in a story that's about Benjamin but surrounds her all the time, anyway... any comments about her are dismissed because, you know, she is Cate Blanchett! The make up is outstanding most of the times, but it's kinda bizarre that they had so much care about Pitt's character that the same cannot be said about Blanchett's.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, I just think that there are too much in it than is needed and most of its success are for the important names in it than for the story itself as it's told. Maybe if things were a little different like being produced, written, directed and performed by different people the results could be a lot better but it also would never get 13 Oscars nominations and probably would never be a massive success.",7,2,4,23 January 2009
Transformers," Funny only for Americans!
","I don't understand and it's impossible for me to understand why this movie is being so much well rated by people. This is a crap that only Michael Bay is possible to offer. It's a movie only for Americans taste and it's funny only for that audience because the movie is full of those 'american jokes', jokes that 95% of rest of world population would not even move a facial muscle for it.Michael Bay is well known for horrible blockbusters like The Rock, Armageddon and one of the worst flops of history: Pearl Harbor. I kinda liked The Island, but I totally hated Transformers.It's sad being sit by almost 2 hours and 30 minutes of horrible acting (exception of Shia, he's a very nice boy), terrible script, awful plot and those wannabe-funny robots.Those robots are a shame. The robots on the animated series were fun because, you know, it was ANIMATED. Now, there's no reason for those robots that came from a totally different world to have hip hop manners, feel pain, have fighting techniques or just scream during a hunt: I CAN SMELL YOU. Where in the world those robots would do that? Oh, I know... Hollywood.That movie is for kids only. If adults like it, it will be just for the visual effects and for some remembering of their childhood and not for being a very interesting or funny movie.I'm completely disappointed.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Surprised and breathless.
","I'm from Brazil and I never heard anything about this story, nor the Millennium trilogy or anything about it till one day I was caught reading some news about David Fincher's new movie which is entirely based on the original 2009's Swedish movie based on Stieg Larsson's novel 'Men Who Hate Women' (Män som hatar kvinnor, 2005). From that moment on I looked for more information about it, read everything I could find and the more I was informed about, the more I was curious about.Finally I could have the possibility to get the entire original movie trilogy to watch before watching any American version that are set to be release, or even trailers. Today I've watched the first one and I'm breathless. It's one of the best investigation/crime movies I've seen. Its impressive, well constructed, edged plot is really intense. The characters are also edged, full of interesting psychological layers, completely out of what is usually created. The story is extremely well developed and all the parallel stories withing the main plot are tied amazingly, being easy to follow even with its complexity level. I mean, there are no unnecessary twists or red herrings that American movies usually have just to play with the audience, the main plot lead us to the subplots with no efforts because the effective screenplay and direction naturally hold our attention in a full-circle story, guiding us from a defined beginning thru a fully coherent and satisfying ending.The acting level is another top thing. Michael Nyqvist as Mikael Blomkvist and Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander are responsible for entire movie effectiveness, both are completely different from each other, but at the same time their chemistry is amazing and their relationship may be complex but understandable. At first impression Noomi Rapace's character may seems awkward and move with all of our inner prejudices, but then you're intensely touched by her past and story and her difficulties to adapt herself into a harsh world and that's when you finally realize once again that prejudice isn't the best judging tool for anything.Every single scene in the movie has its reason to happen and that is impressive and refreshing for those ones that are tired and so used to American movies filled with empty scenes. It's a movie with some disturbing images, but as I said before, it's effective and necessary for the development of the characters and also for the deepness of the story.Now I can understand David Fincher's reasons to make an American version of the trilogy, not because since Seven (1995) there wasn't so many interesting thriller movies, but because 'Män som hatar kvinnor' not only can be easily the best one since Seven but maybe better than Fincher's classic. But really, I can't understand the reasons for an American version when the original Swedish one is superb, with an extremely top notch production. So I hope Fincher doesn't overdo the elements that the original retained in the exact doses, but unfortunately we can expect an extremely cleaner version.After watching the first part of the Millennium trilogy, I'm much more excited to watch the other two parts.",10,2,3,25 June 2011
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Yeah, a bolt can drop 2 times in the same place!!!
","I played all the first 3 chapters of Resident Evil for so many times that I can't count. All first 3 episodes are one of my favorite games and my favorite kind of genre. I think it's important for me to say that for Resident Evil I gave 3 stars. But unlike I did for Resident Evil, I will not split this comment as a game player and as a non game player because there's no need for doing that as the mess has been done with the first movie and we can't go back in time.The second chapter of the game starts with Claire Redfield going to Racoon City in search for her brother disappearance, Chris Redfield, the character from the first chapter. Also there's Leon Kennedy which is coming to Racoon after his admission for the local police department. Claire and Leon meets each other when both of them were running away from the zombies attacks. An explosion split themselves, both go to separate ways to find survivors and a way to call for rescue. During their search for rescue they discover what happened to the city, the people, and all the responsibilities of Umbrella Co. over the happenings. That's the story of the game.Backing to the movie, Resident Evil ended with Milla Jovovich discovering the complete caos surrounding Racoon City. The city is completely destroyed everywhere, there's no sign of any human being. She's alone. The first movie was a huge piece of crap but its end was a sign that everything could be better in a sequel because its end is a lot like the way the second chapter of the game starts. I thought they would start the movie from its prequel finish... but they didn't. Crap again.Resident Evil: Apocalypse, had all the qualities to be a better and interesting version of Dawn Of The Dead if it had been made over the original game plot because it also takes over a city fulfilled by zombies and there's a complete caos everywhere but with more interesting characters, but the movie wasted again all the potentials of the game plot and that's a shame.Nemesis is quite the same of the game, but at the end of the movie he saves Alice from the dead, because, you know, at the deep of his heart there's a human. Oh, cmon, that's so dumb!!! Nemesis is the toughest monster of the series, he destroys everything he touches and there's no way to scape if you do not have a rocket launcher because he never dies with punches or simple bullets, he was made to be a destruction machine.Milla is worst than ever, and when you think that Milla is the worst actress of the movie than you'll be surprised with Sienna Guillory. Siena is Jill Valentine, it could be fine to have this character if the plot of either Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse were some kind faithful to the game plot, but they're not, so... what the hell she's doing there? And Why she's here using the outfit of the 3rd game? On the game there's an explanation for her to be using that outfit, it's silly, but still being an explanation, but that outfit on the movie is bullshit! She's there and using that outfit just saying there's finally an original character in the movie and she needs to look hot for the audience. And there's more... Jill Valentine doesn't have that personality. She's fragile but also courageous, she's not that kind of kicking ass girl that is shown in the movie. The first scene where Jill appears is so cliché and laughable, making all those choreography with her pistols and shooting perfectly on every zombie. That's awful... it's a scene to impress 8 y.o. kids, and it's a shame that this movie is full of scenes like that. The other original character there is Carlos Oliveira, original but useless for the movie.There's no way to fix this series... I don't know who are the people who enjoyed this movie so much to make the studio work on a 3rd chapter. I hope some good director take the Resident Evil project serious someday to redo as it should had be.",2,0,1,24 September 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Keep the book...
","I finished reading the book this week, and so decided to watch the movie. The differences between them are huge. Unfortunately the movie isn't that good for a lot of reasons.What make Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice an amazing book isn't the love story between Lizzy and Darcy, but how she was able to concoct a full circle story full of subplots with so few in her hands. Even being written in the 19th Century, the book was some kind written to be adapted somehow. The chapters are divided like scenes. Those who are familiar to her books are well known that the lack of places and their descriptions are for the fact that she was a single home writer woman and never a person who traveled a lot or was interested or able to know different places, which also gives readers creative freedom to build in their minds their own places and locations. Jane's primer interests always were how people were able to relate to each other within their society and their different social classes in a era full of manners and customs. She was a gifted social observer, knowing perfectly how to outline and describe people's personality into her characters, giving to the readers the possibility to always differ characters by their ways and, the most important thing, their dialogs, by the way she structures them. She couldn't be able to describe perfectly a place, but she could describe perfectly and paint with words a character and its personality.As the title says, all the gears of entire book resolves under both words and Jane plays with them all the time making them part of every single character, sometimes being a merit or sometimes being a flaw.The movie not only cuts a lot of what is in the book but also misinterprets important meanings and characters. Also, it lacks of the subtlety, the irony and the sarcasm that are some of the most important characteristics of her style. Even the movie using most of the original dialogs, the actors seems to don't know whom they are exactly playing because they never give the impact or the subtle characteristics that Jane describes.Mr. Bennet in the book is described as a man intensively sarcastic, dried by years of a marriage that slowly replaced the love by a day-by-day consideration and convenience, respecting and being comprehensible to everyone but never being a tender figure, completely the opposite of what Donald Sutherland portrayed in the movie and his remaining American accent. The same can be said about some other characters. Keira Knightley in my point of view wasn't the best choice and her 2006's Academy Award Nomination is a doubt in my head, but I prefer keep to myself my opinions about her as I know that there are a lot of people that intensively defends her performance. Mr. Darcy is a serious man tired of the hypocrite society that surrounds him and the usual formalities for being a public figure. He's almost a sociopath, because he loves the ones he likes and lives with, but he despite the ones he never met. He's a man of few words, but he's not impolite. He's subtle, he's clever and a great observer, and Matthew Macfadyen may have a strong figure and presence, but his performance is cold and empty, and not just contained and oppressed as Mr. Darcy really is. Mr. Collins, as Jane Austen describes, has a forced and inconvenient formality using difficult vocabulary when speaking to impress and seems noble, but he is not insecure and freak as the film shows. Most of the cast fades. Credits go for those ones who knew what they were doing like Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet and Judi Dench as Lady Catherine.So... analyzing the movie as a whole, I think that Joe Wright could indeed have taken more advantage of the social criticism Jane Austen so implicit describes, also the relationships of people around their prides and prejudices, the subtlety and the sarcasm of the dialogs and the constant British formality.",4,3,4,30 October 2011
Super 8," Another great marketing effect
","I didn't like the movie and you cannot blame me for that.First of all, I was a lot interested about it. The trailer did what was supposed to, lighting the flame of curiosity as a massive campaign should always do. Then it was released and received huge positive reviews from the critics and also from the audience but people never tell you what the movie is about to not spoil it as if there's something really interesting to cover. J.J. Abrams as a director was attractive since he is becoming a great one. Spielberg producing means that maybe the story would possibly be 'interesting'. That's why I think that this movie is being so overrated just because of these huge names and because seems that nobody dares to dismiss Spielberg. But in the end it was a totally disappointment and a waste of time comparing to what I was expecting.The art direction is amazing for sure reproducing the late 70's in the best possible way, some anachronisms are there but forgivable. Also, Abrams direction is extremely similar to some of the traditional characteristics that made Spielberg a reference like the abusive use of dynamic and open shots. The young actors are convincing and have a great chemistry together, giving you that Goonies feeling that we haven't felt for a long time. References to the classics are there, from Romero to Spielberg, from Ridley Scott to James Cameron, fulfilling its intents. So, technically, the movie is great.But then comes the train crash. First, I'm sorry, but it is impossible for a simple car to destroy an entire train like that, the physics can explain it better than me. Second, how could someone drive a car directly to a train, crash it, explode it, take entirely train off its trail, make wagons fly and destroy everything around but still alive and just with some few scars on the face? Absolutely nonsense. Not even the worst action movie would do something so lame and absurd.Then comes the plot development, it takes hours for something interesting to come, and it keeps hours using that old suspenseful element of never revealing the great threat entirely till the last couple minutes, which is a formula that isn't so much effective anymore. So, after 1 hour watching the movie, I was completely bored and the action and the thrilling moments just end as fast as it happens. The ending is another thing that was disappointing. There's this monster that makes dogs disappear, kills and sometimes kidnaps people, but then a small boy with a pure and in love heart says this magical words that comes from his pure spirit and then this monster finally stops creating the chaos and decides to go home. WTF!I was expecting more than it is. But one thing is great, it's a teenage movie. It never tries to catch different audiences, that's why maybe I didn't like it or do not agree to be one of the best movies of 2011 as people and critics are claiming it to be, but teenagers will love it for sure or some older people that will be affected by this teenage nostalgia that the movie provides.I would give 10 for the technical qualities, but movies aren't just that, so I give it 4.",4,0,0,12 August 2011
Limitless," Good plot development
","Limitless isn't a common great circuit film, at the same time isn't a movie that offers great information or a grand moral to make people think about life or something, but it is a daring movie that shows the drugs from a different point of view.Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) is a writer in creative crisis who discovers a miracle pill that can increase brain synapses and give access to all information acquired since childhood that are stored in the sub-conscious, also increasing the learning curve and the logical reasoning. So, Eddie gets out of his hole that was getting deeper and deeper to a surface of ​​success, fame, power and money. The film shows the ups and downs given by the drug, but unlike movies like Trainspotting (1996), Requien For A Dream (2000), Enter The Void (2009), among several other titles that deal with drug abuse as something extremely harmful and destructive, Limitless tries to make the reverse curve and instead of leaving us depressed as the other titles do, this one let us excited about how far the character can get.The film has a great plot development and a direction that works in all aspects. Again the edition and the soundtrack gives the hallucinogenic elements that offer the ecstasy and anguish of the character without seeming pushed or overdone. Everything in the film is used sparingly. Who would imagine that Bradley Cooper would come out from a show like Alias (2001) to become one of the new stars of this decade? Besides acting convincingly, Bradley also is the executive producer, which is surprising because it shows that besides knowing how to choose great money machines he also knows how to pick a great movie not only to act but also to produce.Limitless is undoubtedly one of the best movies of 2011 and one of the few which deserved its success, although it will probably not be remembered in the future.",8,0,2,5 June 2011
The Descent," It's safe play with old formulas
","This is a better version of The Cave. We have an outdoor adventure group going to explore a cave, the way back is blocked and finally they meet a group of monsters who lives in the dark and are hungry for human meat. Also there's a villain in the group who are responsible for all the wrong turns, a cool and uncommon one to break a leg and be the first one to die and a beholder to be killed by the b*tch.But the differences here that makes this movie a great one is: 1st) it's European; 2) It's all about the direction, that's why the movie is quite effective; 3) All the actresses are great.Those are the 3 reasons to waste a good time watching this movie and that's enough.Of course that even being European the movie is filled with Hollywood clichés because it's safe play with old formulas than try new ones, but just a small part of the audience should be troubled with that.",8,1,3,28 October 2007
Thor," Just an ordinary spectacle
","The biggest problem about comic book adaptations is that sometimes movies are too short for them. That's the problem about Thor. I'm not familiar to the comic book, but it's clear that the story has much more than what 2 hours can offer and it's impossible to digest all at once no matter how long the movie could be. Kenneth Branagh's efforts to transform it into a Shakespearean thing is just an attempt to give to a comic book adaptation a different approach intensifying some mythological beauties and artistic layout within traditional direction techniques so Thor wouldn't be called just another regular action movie full of special effects. But in fact that's what the movie is, an ordinary action movie full of ambition as well as its main character. The movie fails to specify the audience it wants to achieve shooting everywhere and everyone as possible, giving the feeling that sometimes you are watching Henry V with lame dialogs played at a Comic Con event by amateur young actors.The movie is more beautiful than interesting: the special effects are better than the dialogs and the visuals are better than the plot. Chris Hemsworth did what he was supposed to and Natalie Portman is beautiful and responsible to give the charisma that the movie lacks. Kenneth took a comic book character serious enough giving a huge blockbuster spectacle and limiting the layers he wanted to give instead of just defining it. Thor isn't what it seems to be and that makes it a little frustrating. Kenneth Branagh was responsible for the longest Hamlet adaptation, so of course you can expect hours of useless progress and a movie full of things that regular action movies shouldn't care.Anyway, the movie isn't bad, but isn't better than other comic book adaptations, but at the same time you can't ignore the fact that it's entertaining most of all because gives one of the best visual effects sequences so far in 2011, the acting is fair and also is Mr. Branagh's first step into action movies.",6,1,4,10 May 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," The same lame...
","What could you expect from the worst director of this planet working together the worst writer of the history? Nothing but shame. OK, Michael Bay is not so 'the worst', but he's well known for doing exactly what no other director that praises his career would do. Ehren Kruger... oh, my! I really don't know why people still calling this guy a writer because really seems that he doesn't know: 1st OF ALL) How to have a great idea; 2nd) How to translate it to the paper; 3rd) How to make something good for once in his life.The other big thing is: why people still wasting so much money for craps like this while there are people out there with great ideas but no money? I really would not have wasted my money into this if wasn't my friends, but here's the thing: I slept... and I had the most delightful and expensive nap of my entire life... yes, even with that sound blowing up my ears.I have nothing to say about this movie only my DESAPOINTMENT and my best wishes for Michael Bay, Ehren Krueger and for those ones who have so horrible taste.",1,20,43,28 June 2009
The Holiday," It's lovely, but it could be a lot better...
","I loved this movie, but I could have loved more if it hasn't Jack 'Annoying' Black in it. I got this movie without knowing that he is in it, and I swear that when I saw his name in the opening credits I thought: I hope he's just as much as a supporting-supporting actor can be. Yeah... almost.He's one of those current actors being cast in the movies not because he's actually GOOD, but he's funny enough to cover some holes on the plot and to make Americans laugh a lot with those annoying joking faces when there's nothing to be said or when the movie is getting a lot dramatic or sleepy. I'm sure he's one of those Jerry Lewis fans that really makes hard to be so funny as Mike Myers, and I just hate that.I think that this movie flaws with some things. First it suffers for so much characters and relationship happenings, I think that it was a lot talk about 3 broken relationships that resolves into 2 new ones because that's a lot for a movie. So, when a story starts getting interesting with Iris and Mr. Abbott, we are cut in the middle to see what is happening with Amanda and Graham, and when these last ones' story is getting interesting, we are cut back to Amanda that needs to answer the door, and guess who is it? 'Annoying' Miles, of course! Another thing that is quite annoying (and this time it's not Jack Black) is the fact that Amanda's story is more interesting than Iris's, or that's what writer and director Nancy Meyers tries to make us believe when we check the fact that more than a half of the movie is about Amanda dyslexic and embarrassing moments. That's sad because Kate Winslet is a lot secondary in it and she does her part a way lot better.Don't get me wrong but one more time I loved this movie and I LOVE all the cast (except Jack Black), I just think that it could be a lot better without these wrong steps and turns. Even I have pointing a lot of negative comments, this movie deserves a great look, just try not bothering with Jack Black annoying acting.",7,1,3,29 January 2008
Burlesque," Just watch it before bed...
","Burlesque is for Christina what Glitter (2001) wasn't for poor Mariah.The movie is just OK... there's not much to say about it as it's a piece of Moulin Rouge, Chicago and Nine, the trilogy of new modern musicals that popped theaters and now are becoming a tired formula. It's a linear easy going movie to catch all ages and people, mainly those ones who are Christina fans because the whole movie is all about her.As an actress, she's just playing her part well, thinking that this is her first big role and also her debut. As a singer there's not much to prove either because all that she sings there she already did with her 2007's Back To Basics album and this music style is almost stereotyping her career when the movie was much more successful than her new album - which got a totally different direction and was a complete commercial failure.The movie is not entirely a musical... it has a lame background story and other parallel ones that doesn't add anything interesting. Cher is okay and her acting level is equivalent to the facial expressions she's able to do, that's why she isn't making so much movies lately... Stanley Tucci is okay, being the example of people that sometimes do amazing movies and sometimes don't... Alan Cumming in a super-supporting role isn't okay. That's almost an offense as much as watching Michael Caine appearing for just 2 minutes in 'Inception' (2010).It's what a regular musical is supposed to be, even when sometimes I just used the FF button because all Christina's burlesque vocal performances were making me dizzy.Just watch it before bed.",6,1,3,13 February 2011
Stranger Than Fiction," Freedom to realize what you want.
","Who thought that the ideas to confront fiction with reality were already over, is a lot wrong. Stranger Than Fiction is one of those movies that 'fiction' is just a word to qualify its style because, actually, it's a lot real. Have you ever imagined life as a book already written? A life where you're just someone's doll? If you're one of those people that never imagined that, after watching this movie I'm sure you will.This movie is almost a modern masterpiece. The direction is fantastic and the performance of the actors is outstanding. Will Farrel gives to the character the pathetic and sad tone in a realistic and brilliant way to a point that it's impossible to not sympathize with his character. Although she exaggerates a little in the caricature of her character, Emma Thompson gets the audience's attention effectively. But the audience here is another very interesting thing, because it's a lot more like an observer than a simple audience, it's like some kind of Truman Show experience by another point of view.The subtlety and the dexterity to balance the tragic from the comic and the constant alternation between the comedy and the tragedy are the highlights of entire movie. Maybe that's the point that Woody Allen tried to catch with Melinda & Melinda, but Forster's results are much more expressive than Woody's.Other very important point of the movie, a special attractive and also an important material for the context of entire movie is the GUI (Graphic Usuary Interface) especial effects, a brilliant idea that came out after lot of researches and tries, becoming something simple and at the same time essential to comprehend the character's manners, being more than just an especial effect, but a living part of the character.Marc Forster is showing to be one of the most current versatile and interesting directors and Zach Helm a very promising writer.",9,0,0,8 January 2008
Inception," I prefer my dreams...
","OK, Inception can be the best rated movie of 2010, but not for me. I'm not questioning its quality as an action movie but yes as a sci-fi production because after The Matrix this movie seems much more illogical exactly for trying to be more realistic and fully coherent and cohesive. Also, it's impossible not compare it to The Matrix as Christopher Nolan already stated that the idea for the movie came from movies like The Matrix, The 13th Floor and The Dark City. That's so inspired by these movies - mainly The Matrix - that some references to it are a lot clear: the red and blue button in the briefcase (like the red and blue pill), the architect, a group which each one of them has an specific ability, the idea (meaning the virus), the dream soldiers (as the anti-virus), the totem (like the telephone), among others...Who pays attention to dreams or is familiar to the basics of it knows that the movie is right in some points but lacks of several other characteristics. When you're in a lucid dream you're able to control it and direct events and happenings, that's why you're able do dream a lucid dream and back to it even if you wake up for a short time. In unconscious dream you're unable to control it, that's why we mostly wake up when we die or when we fall, because in a lucid dream you're able to 'defend' yourself as you wish. The world of unconscious dream, where most of the film tries to reproduce as the characters are in a pre-coma state, is a lot more confusing and chaotic than it seems. It could have been much more explored if wasn't given so much attention for action sequences. The only time where seems like a real and chaotic dream is when a train crosses an entire street. At that moment I thought that things would be visually interesting, but it never was.Trying to give more attention for the action and not for science, the characters have a magic pack that connects several people into a dreamer's dream without reason. In The Matrix they have those huge machines that are connected in their minds to fully transfer people to a dream world previously built, making 2 or more people share the same dream space. That makes The Matrix more acceptable in this explanation than Inception. Scientists believe that sharing a dream is possible as the brain is moved by electric impulses, so, if we have a main board able to unify and decode those electric impulses, this could be possible. But in Inception what really connects them all? Just a powerful sedative? Are they super heroes or what? That's why I think that The Matrix is much more successful when exploring this idea, because it starts from a solid scientific one.While The Matrix deals with an electronic generated world, in Inception we are talking about a dream where there are cities, people, mobiles that works, explosives, car crashing, people dying and bleeding and whatever... but never the power of imagination. Work about the inception of an idea is a great plot, and the barriers for that could be anything than just a bunch of armored guys shooting and exploding everything.Inception for me is just a redone idea, the same as Avatar is to Pochahontas, but Inception doesn't give me anything new or add something interesting among other interesting ones I've seen before. The media calls it one of the best movies of 2010 and one of the best sci-fi movies of the time and that actually insults my intelligence because there's nothing new there. But the industry needs to make money from something times to times and they found Inception a great money machine. Technically the movie is superb and a great action flick, but I don't see anything more from it.I give 5 stars just as an action movie, because thinking as a sci-fi, I give it none. There's a lot for nothing... or maybe, a lot for just in the end the movie explains that incept an idea is so difficult as I trying to convince you that this movie isn't so good as it seems.",5,10,16,19 December 2010
The Queen," Exceptional!
","What really happened to the Royal Family at that time, we'll never know. I was very young when Diana was dead and I could never understand why she was so important for the people, and now that I'm grown I see that she was loved because she was from the people and the closest one to the Royal Family. She could see that there was a hole between the people and the institution and she did what a sane and modern person (like she was) would do: work like a bridge between them.As well said in the movie, Diana had 2 very different personalities: Diana as a family member and as a mother, and Diana as a visionary woman that found a way to show the people that her country was in need of some changes. But when the Royal Family could finally see that, it was too late.All this is shown in the movie. The Queen is one of the most touching, sincere and subtle movie I've seen in years, and it's on its manners that it makes you take your own conclusions about everything.",9,0,1,8 October 2007
1408," Brains but no blood
","Who is expecting blood or a conventional horror movie will be a lot disappointed. 1408 is more than just a horror movie, it's a psychological mix of horror and thriller in the best brilliant way possible like old classic horror movies used to be.As well said, 1408 is a story that Stephen King never published as a book. The writers not just did a movie based on a limited material as they put all together in the story most of the elements that Stephen King's stories classically have.The movie is a nightmare coz its confusing, claustrophobic and frightening in real time. But the most horrifying thing of it it's not its story, but yes all the situations lived by John Cusack which starts being a lot terrifying when we start imagine our selves living all his experiences. By the way, John Cusack is brilliant as always. The path he goes thru his sanity to insanity in 60 minutes makes Mike Enslin one of the best performances of his career.The writers seems to be a bunch of people that know a lot about Stephen King's stories because references of his works are in every corner of the room: Cujo, The Shinning, Pat Cemetery, Rose Madder, Misery, and a lot more. 1408 is also a lot similar to Silent Hill: The Room, a video game for PS2.Mikael Håfström, the same director of Derailed (2005) did an amazing job. Even both movies setting their main stories in hotel rooms, who watched Derailed would never imagine that he would be the director of such a movie like 1408.Like Identity (2003), another hotel movie also starring John Cusack, 1408 is not just a horror movie, it's something that you will watch and you probably will not like it for the first time, but you'll be impressed, thinking about it for hours and trying to understand what really happened.",8,3,6,30 March 2008
X-Men: First Class," Back to its form
","It's hard to talk about 'X-Men: First Class' putting aside the previous ones. In my point of view one thing has always been very clear: no matter how Bryan Singer has made of X-Men (2000) and X-2 (2003) two interesting and entertaining movies, he should never have appropriated the characters to create his own story and most of the time never respecting the original stories and the chronology of each one of the characters because now they are trying to repair that in a cyclical chain of mistakes taking classic characters but reinventing their stories once again, denying in one way or another all the development in the comic books in its more than 40 years of existence. Sequels may come, but how they will develop and give space for the forgotten characters - or for those ones that have already been presented out of their original chronology - is a mystery.Anyway, 'X-Men: First Class' pleases comic books fans when keeping some characters or bringing back few others, but at the same time it can displease them for not being faithful to the original stories. For people who know little about the mutants it makes no difference and analyzing the movie itself it actually delivers what it promises and brings back the atmosphere of the first two installments that were lost in 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (2006).The story is solid and consistent placing the mutants as pieces of a chess game in the historical period known as 'Cold War', making that period the zero point of the battle between humans X mutants and between mutants X mutants.The screenplay conducts the facts ina linear way and the movie is directed for the adult ones more than for the youth, although the young ones will also have great fun with the characters and action scenes that are frequent from the beginning to the end. It's a violent movie, but not explicit, and this is what characterizes it not only as an adult movie, but an intelligent one as well because most of the violence happens more in our imagination than in images. Michael Vaughn sustained the direction more than the expected using the prime elements from the first two movies but also adding his personal characteristics to it, bringing something fresh to the series, something that hasn't happened in the third installment.The costumes and the art designs are amazing when trying to reproduce the 60's. Some anachronisms exist but will not mess with the experience. Fans will be dazzled by some references and some special appearances. Bringing Michael Fassbender, Kevin Bacon, Rose Byrne and Jennifer Lawrence to the group just added more qualities and the adult tone to the story. Sometimes I felt that the background music was kinda invasive, but forgettable withing so many qualities.For me the movie loses some of its interests when reaching the end, easing the rebellion of some characters and making the split between Magneto and Xavier something a lot peaceful for those ones who expected a genuine clash of ideologies.But in general, it is by far the best comic book adaptation of 2011 and fair enough placed between the best comic book adaptations together to the first two installments. As I said above, it is X-Men returning to its form in movies.",8,0,2,11 July 2011
Iron Man," Forgivable flaws, great action time...
","It's hard for me to say if this is the best comic book adaptation because I really don't know so much about Iron Man. But, as a movie lover, I can say that it's a great action movie based on a comic book most of all for its cast and for bringing to reality something that comic book lovers were so desperately wanting. The story itself has some flaws, but that's also predictable as it's impossible to tell a great story and also be an action movie and ALSO a blockbuster within 2 hours.As said before, 2 hours is a very small time to tell Tony Stark's story and how he became Iron Man in a acceptable way as happens, for example, in Batman Begins. Jon Favreau made miracles, but it's kinda hard for me to accept in the movie the fact that Tony, from one day to another, created a complex iron suite like playing Lego and learned how to fly in a few tries, it doesn't matter how much intelligent he is, it doesn't fit. Not even Super-Man could learn how to fly in a so small time as Tony or Obadiah, this one a lot worst because he learned how to fly in minutes. But that's okay... this abstraction of time is forgivable. Also, it's hard to imagine that he could just insert something on his chest or a woman could just put her hand into it and he never died of infection. Tony Starks knows a lot about science but nothing about medical precautions. How smart he is!The cast is interesting. When I heard for the first time that Downey Jr. would be playing Iron Man I thought that producers were crazy because Downey Jr. has nothing of a hero. But, yeah... after watching the movie and understanding the character's personality, now I understand why he fits so well in the character. Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is kinda funny. I'm not a fan of Gwyneth's work because I think that every time she performs, she's performing not a character, but Gwyneth herself. But for the first time for me seems that she's performing something a little different from Gwyneth, I mean, she has facial expressions in here and not that watery face, dead eyes and inexpressive voice as usual, she just seems different, I don't know exactly why. Anyway... Jeff Bridges is good as always, kudos for him once again.The direction is effective, linear as the plot. Jon Fefreau plays it safe during entire movie. I would never imagine that he, as an actor or a not so known director would make his first 150 mil blockbuster. I would do the same if I was in that condition.The visual effects are just perfect. There wasn't any moment I stopped to say 'That's a CG! That's not...'. Iron Man is not a CG doll as Spider Man seems sometimes, it really seems that there is a real someone inside that iron suite. Also, they did an excellent job working on it and creating an armor that seems a lot realistic.For the fans, I could imagine how they felt when I was watching the DVD. The option screen shows Iron Man in a 360º angle, it's just awesome!It's a great action movie, Iron Man is a little unusual from all the heroes out there and Downey Jr. increases its personality. The flaws are there all the time, but they can be forgivable. Just enjoy it like popcorn.",8,2,5,6 January 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," The comic half of love stories
","For sure Europe has made consistent changes in Woody's mind and all that's happening around him as an observer and as a misunderstood artist as well. Also seems that he wants to express it in a so intense way that all his best creative processes in the last 10 years are happening in Europe than when living in his loved Manhattan.It's obvious why his mind seems so much more clear and his movies seems so more coherent now than before. Manhattan is a concrete jungle surrounded by chaos and cars and people crossing streets and a place where you can find anything anytime anywhere, but you will never be able to find answers for inner questions. So it's always the search for an inexistent thing. In Europe, as things happens a little slower and everything in that continent has a cultural explanation for everything, or an intense artistic feeling for every moment, that's why most of the artists find themselves crossing the ocean. And we can feel that happens to Woody.I never appreciated his movies so much as now. Like I said, he seemed to me a totally chaos before Europe and now he seems a lot more coherent and expressive, and we are able to feel that. It's not like Woody is trying to be something else, he's there all the time with all his perfectionism and questionings, extracting from life the finner feelings that we are always trying to hide, but he is not that messy expressionist picture anymore.Vicky Cristina Barcelona is one of his best works because he unified all his discussions thru the years in a loose movie that carries you naturally over his own ideas and personal questions and fears that we all heard before. For me, Vicky Cristina Barcelona is the opposite of Match Point (2005), and both of them are what he was trying to express with Melinda And Melinda (2004) and its both sides of the same story, the comic one and the tragic one. While Match Point is the tragic one in London, VCB is the comic one in Barcelona. So, it was necessary two different movies in two totally different places to show what Melinda And Melinda fails a lot in Manhattan. But that is a totally Woody Allen thing, I mean... he never gives up an idea till the time he feels fully completed in satisfaction with it.Also is very interesting why he chose Spain as background of the comic love stories, because that country represents all about love clichés and the appreciation of a good wine in bucolic warm places surrounded by colors and history. That is another huge twist in a career that always suited in inexpressive cold places filled with whisk.But the most interesting fact of the movie - and each one of his European movies - is that there are always American characters searching for something outside their native country, and there are always other American characters always trying to push them back to that American way of life that those ones were trying to escape or forget someway. And that seems to me his consistent idea that no matter how better and creative he fells in Europe, there's always a foot in New York.It's unfair talk about how much better are the actors or the characters separately because all of them has a whole importance in Woody's mind and how they were able to express it in his own artistic ways. But the actors here perform their characters with sincere brilliance and they are so consistent and well directed that is refreshing.No doubt Woody keeps getting better and better thru the years and I'm rediscovering the pleasure to watch his movies all over again.",8,1,4,12 January 2009
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Amazing little piece of art
","Well, I have to say that I'm a huge fan of Queen Elizabeth I, but I don't know so much about history to be able to point the flaws or the rights of the synchronism between movie and real facts.But after watching and reading some reviews about the movie, seems that Shekhar Kapur flaws with The Golden Age (2007) the same way as he did with Elizabeth (1998). I mean... Shekhar is naturally excessively sensible and poetic with his movies, so all his devotion and all the historical figure that Elizabeth means for him is a lot iconic. So that's the way he portraits Elizabeth in both movies, as some kind of sacred woman guided by God's hands and not just and only a queen. He's not wrong because he, as a director, have all the rights to express all his artistic visions thru his work, but at the same time he exceeded it somehow affecting the final results and all the huge potentials of both movies in its historical meaning. So, both movies turned from historical movies to genre movies with all its romance and divinity icons humanized by Elizabeth.No words, technically it's an amazing movie. All historical rescues for the art direction are perfect and incredibly detailed by Guy Dyas who is responsible to transform The Golden Age from a low budget movie into a visually blockbuster one. Shekhar Kapur is also an amazing director who usually feed people with amazing and large shots over the huge and mesmerizing locations. As anyone here said before, sometimes we miss seeing more of the Elizabethan age in England than it's shown in the limited sets but all the production was so under limits that all that is shown is respectful.About the cast, Cate Blanchett is an actress that any comment is dismissed because she's always perfect and only her persona is the necessary to uplift any kind of movie. Shekhar said that The Golden Age would never be produced without Cate, and we can notice why. The strong and tenderness figure that Cate gives to Elizabeth is something that only her could be able to do. But talk about Blanchett's performance is not being fair with all the cast. Samantha Morthon as Mary Stuart is terrific. The moments which Mary Stuart appears are few and short but Samantha Morthon is a so amazing actress that her dazzling presence during the scenes are just a plus for the excellent choice for casting her. I think that all that Samantha represents as an excellent actress can be seen when Mary Stuart is under house arrest, the scene is superb and the camera could capt every single expression on her face, which are splendid.As I said before, Shekar is a so poetic director that every scene, every camera movement and every effect has a purpose, so, it's a lot recommended for those who watch this movie also check the DVD for the bonus for a better understanding of all the concept of the movie and its director. Maybe The Golden Age cannot be a great historical movie and suffer with some flaws but all the direction, acting and amazing art direction naturally covers everything that seems to fail. And all of that is more than one reason to watch this amazing little piece of art.",8,0,0,13 July 2008
50_50," 50/50 completely
","Well, 50/50 is the way I felt after watching it. Not bad, but not good. Not amazing, but not frustrating. Half comedy, half drama.Written by Will Reiser and based on his life, I think that the movie fails badly first of all because this attempt to mix drama and comedy using a so difficult illness as cancer is something that naturally takes it to inevitable cliché moments.Then you have all the main cast performing the same again. Joseph being that suffering personification as in (500) Days Of Summer (2009); Seth Rogen being that boring and over the top 'funny' character that tries to make people laugh and forget that it's a drama; Bryce Dallas acting as the same selfish girl; Anna Kendrick the same insecure and enthusiast as in Up In The Air (2009); Angelica Houston the same old mother. And none of them giving a truly and brilliant performance.And the result is the same movie about cancer and its difficulties of surviving. Javier Barden did it. Meryl Streep did it. Susan Sarandon did it. Michael Keaton, Emma Thompson, Debra Winger... and the list goes on. This is just another one. It seems honest, but it's cheesy instead, trying hard to be something. There are a few funny moments, but none of them for Seth Rogen's hard efforts. And a few tear moments for the right using of impacting scenes and score.That's it and only, a movie to be watched on a rainy Sunday afternoon.",5,3,6,21 April 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Ignorant and useless.
","I just can't understand why a so low rated series like the Twilight Saga stills being a huge box office thing. This proves at best how can studios make so easy money with so lame thing. Most of it, this proves the best how to alienate teenagers so early, making 12 y.o. kids going out of the theaters with the books under their arms like a bible thinking about sex symbols and perfect bodies and with no sense at all of what's good or what's bad for them, because if you tell just one of them that this is the worst movie series ever they can spit right in your face and call you a sh*t. This is one of the reasons that makes me think that this is the end of days. At my teenage times (almos 15 years ago), my parents would never accept me going watch this piece of crap. Never! That's why my senses today are so better than a lot of what will be in the future when this kids have exactly my age now. That's sad. There's no good movie for teenagers. In one hand you have that huge crap called Karate Kid, then... in the other hand you have The Last Airbander... and in the middle you have entire Twilight 'Crap' Saga.This is the best entertainment effort to make the future ignorant and useless.",Null,11,20,4 July 2010
The Proposal," Great chemistry since Speed
","OK, first of all I love Sandra Bullock even knowing that most of her movies are not so interesting enough. Her charisma is always the top thing about her and her comedy felling always flows naturally being always a pleasure see her in the big screen. On the other side I feel bad because she is one of those stereotyped actress that no matter how hard she pushes in titles like A Time To Kill, Crash, Premonition or Infamous she will never be successful enough if not in a While You Were Sleeping-thing. But following her career for more than 10 years, I have no doubts that she's a great actress.Anyway, this movie is another one with nothing that we haven't seen before in her career or any other 'chick-flick' genre, but I liked because she's comfort in it, and also, there's Ryan Reynolds, and both has a great chemistry in the screen that I haven't seen since Speed. Certainly is entertaining and charming, there are memorable sequences and a few good dialogs, but mainly actors that are not really acting but their experiences give spontaneous funny moments making the movie a lot enjoyable. Even the trailer showing most of the best parts, you would probably enjoy seeing them again. Some kind nostalgic when compared to the old romantic comedy movies but also some kind boring for, once again, being so predictable and full of clichés.The movie plot has a lot of problems mainly about unnecessary issues like Andrew's ex-girlfriend or also his relationship problems with his dad resulting in forgettable dialogs. Seems that they tried to give some consistence for a so loose plot, but audience probably will not give any importance to that as the lack of consistence is notable on its very beginning.But that's OK. I had a nice time... and if you're expecting nothing but fun, I guess you will have it too.",7,0,3,25 June 2009
