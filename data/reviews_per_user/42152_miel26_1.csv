Angels & Demons," I believe in angels
","I was not really a fan of Dan Brown until Da Vinci Code was released. It left me wondering how did he come up with that story. When I heard about Angels and Demons it made me say 'I must see that movie'. And so I did. Hanks did a really good acting and the role was very impressive. He's a brilliant professor really trying to help without asking in return. For me, he played the role of an angel sent by God to search for the truth and make the people see who the real enemy is. It was not an exaggerating film but not a simple one. It just showed that it doesn't matter what your faith may be as long as you have the heart to truly save other people's lives.",8,2,4,15 May 2009
