Hereditary," Absolutely disturbing...
","The movie starts nice and slow... I love a good scare... which the movie lacked...
If you have conjuring or insidious in mind.. just don't bother.
Some of the scenes were very disturbing.. Dunno why Toni chose this...",4,1,6,30 August 2018
Get Out," Good watch...
","There is no great suspense in the movie... Half an hour in the movie, you would understand whats happening... except, why it is happening. It is not a horror. It is a psycho thriller... and it was absolutely entertaining. I wouldn't say that the 'plot highlight' has not been used earlier. but it has been done interestingly. It has its moments. And it was fun watching it.",6,3,6,5 May 2017
