The Blair Witch Project," Best reason to not go camping since 'Friday the 13th'!
","I wish I'd seen this movie in theaters back when people still thought it was real and before all the hype.  Even so, don't expect too much and your in for an absolute hoot.  The concept is still brilliant.  It was very creepy.Now how the hell are they going to make a sequal?",5,0,1,6 August 2000
The Mask," Still Smokin'
","Sad news first: 'the Mask' is destined to go down as the OTHER live-action/animated tribute to classic cartoons.  'Roger Rabbit' looms too large.  While 'Rabbit' has better special effects and is, admittedly, a more fun ride, 'Mask' is much darker and funnier.  Somewhere, Tex Avery is nodding apreciatively.",7,0,0,5 January 2003
Gremlins," I bet you're all wondering what I thought of this. ^_^
","Odd that I've been using this 'handle' online for years without having ever seen this movie.  It is actually a reference to a series, of sorts, of Bob Clampett cartoons.  I have actually just seen this movie for the first time this afternoon.So, without slipping too deep 'in character', what did I think?Ha ha ha...Ha ha ha ha ha!...(pause)BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!This movie rules.Seriously though, I should be ashamed of myself for not having ever seen this movie for so long.  And not just because of my username or whatever; this is one of the Essential Eighties Movies.  I've seen, off the top of my head, 'E.T.' and 'the Breakfast Club' and 'Risky Business' and 'Spinal Tap' and so on and so on, but not 'Gremlins'?!?  What the heck was wrong with me?But yes, 'Gremlins' is good, very funny.  Go watch it if you haven't seen it yet.  You will apreciate it a lot more if you hate Furbies.Hee hee hee...",7,0,1,17 July 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Harrowing and (oddly) beautiful
","This is one of the most incredible movies I've ever seen, but I can't rightly say that I *enjoyed* it.It's by the director of 'Pi', which gives you an idea of what you're in for. The acting is good, the music is excellent.  Most impressive, to me, are the visual effects.  This movie could very well make more sensitive viewers insane.  I dare you to keep your eyes open through the entire 'Winter' segment.If you aren't crying by the end of the final shot, you aren't human.",7,0,1,18 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Reflecting on it a year later...
","Well, it's the summer of 2000, the Star dust has settled, and the marketing orgy has vacated Wall Mart.  Now seems as good a time as any to give my verdict on 'Star Wars 1', and I can sum it up in one simple statement:I don't care how old or young Darth Vader is.  We should NEVER have had to hear him squeal, 'Yippee!'  Barf.Now when does 'Matrix Part Two' come out?",3,3,5,26 August 2000
Catch Me If You Can," Great fun.
","'Catch Me if you Can' is lots of fun for about the first hour and a half, and then it kind of runs out of energy.  And this wouldn't be worth complaining about if there wasn't a whole hour left to go.  This is still a very good movie, and it is worth watching.  It is also the first movie in a very, very long time where there's nothing as memorable or imaginative in the movie itself as there is in the opening title sequence.",6,1,4,30 May 2003
The Ring," I want me mum...
","Well, it scared the hell out of me.  Can't really say that I enjoyed it, but it scared the hell out of me.And I feel the need to mention (go ahead and call me a little sissy) that I was watching this at noon, it was sunny and windy out, with the blinds open, a window open, and all the lights on.  And the more logical parts of my brain are now working overtime trying to convince me that I'll be fine after discovering that nifty little DVD Easter Egg that allows you to *watch the video from the movie* but won't let you stop it or shut it off. Fun!(Whimpers...)",5,2,5,30 March 2003
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Nothing short of miraculous
","Stop and think about this movie for a minute, and you realize that we are unbelievably fortunate that it even exists.Think about all the different cartoon characters who have cameos here. Think about how their respective owners had to put aside decades of competing against each other for gags that would last a few seconds of screen time.  Realise that, before this movie, the idea of combining fully rendered animated characters with live action footage was considered impossible.  And how the hell do you market a movie that includes both murder plots and fuzzy little cartoons?This movie is a miracle.I absolutely loved it as a kid, and although parts of it flew over my head I really did not care.  I did know that this is what animation can do when all the 'rules' are totally ignored.  And why shouldn't they be?Now, as an adult, I appreciate 'Roger Rabbit' for its gutsyness.  There is absolutely *nothing* like this anywhere.  It gets a solid Ten.",10,252,262,2 March 2001
Minority Report," Really good. Could be the underrated movie of the year!
","Hard science fiction, usually defined by taking a scenario from reality and bringing it to a logical conclusion, doesn't really translate well to film. When even a reasonably good hard sci-fi movie comes along, it's darn near a miracle.I say all that because 'Minority Report' does have a few flaws.  But it's still really good.  I vote it the scariest serious science fiction since 'GATTACA' (if they aren't working on animated cereal boxes in real life, I'm missing a bet).  Check it out!",7,0,0,31 January 2003
Wayne's World," One of my absolute favorites
","I always have a hard time writing reviews of my favorite movies.  To paraphrase that great philosopher Garth, after a while, a favorite movie becomes a part of you.I think it's pretty safe to say that, if you've never seen 'Wayne's World', and you're going to watch it for the first time because you are starting to feel like a mutant, you are probably going to love it.  It's goofy and fun and quotable as all get out.  My other problem is that I don't want to describe too much because I don't want to ruin the funny parts.You will appreciate this movie more, however, if you have a strange fascination with those weird commercials that they show on cable a lot for things you never knew you needed.",10,1,3,18 September 2001
The Big Lebowski," 'All the Dude ever wanted was his rug back!'
","Here we have a typically Coen Brothers story of an easygoing hippy who finds himself in several layers of deep trouble with porn directors, scary bowlers, performance artists, scary German electronic musicians, a cranky old millionaire, and the mysterious Bunny Lebowski.  Rude, crude, and very, very funny (especially the bowling-themed hallucinations), this movie is a must-see.",5,0,6,31 January 2003
Unbreakable," 'If I go crazy then / will you still call me Superman?'
","First things first.  This is a great movie.  You have to be *REALLY* patient with it, as it's a bit slow.  You should actually make plans to watch it more than once.  The first time to let the story unfold.  The second, to actually enjoy it.It is *not* another 'Sixth Sense'.Now 'the Sixth Sense' is one of my absolute favorite movies of the past five years.  It was oddly moving, had memorable characters, and an absolutely perfect story arc.  Best of all was the premise.  I have figured out the reason why this is the most popular thriller of all time.  It manages to remind us all (well, me at least; I had a wonderfully overactive imagination as a kid) why we still get a little flicker of dread anytime we're alone in a dark room.  If you don't, you are deluding yourself.There is nothing that primal behind the premise of 'Unbreakable'.  I did get the feeling that there *wants* to be a more universal theme there. 
You see, and I noticed this more on the second viewing, this is less a story of a guy with a strange secret and more the story of as kid and his father. The idea here was so good, I wish it had been the focus.  The moments where this subplot does come to the fore ring the truest (and I'm thinking especially of that beautiful scene towards the end where the father passes the newspaper to his son, the camera pans up, and there is an expression of unmistakable sadness on the father's face).So give this movie a look.  It's really quite good, but there's another even more excellent movie lurking beneath it.",7,0,0,29 June 2001
Fight Club," Mind-blowing, don't miss it!
","Let me say this right off the bat.  This is one of those movies that you're either going to love or hate.  But no matter what, DO NOT MISS IT!I really don't want to say too much about 'Fight Club'.  To try and describe it would spoil it.  Just know that this is possibly the most insanely subversive movies in a *really* long time and that you'll probably go, 'Woah, wait a minute...' more than once.And, love it or hate it, you will not be able to get it out of your head.'Slide!'",10,0,1,23 June 2001
Akira," 'Woah...'
","So here I am, the only animation fan I know who's over the age of ten, and I had never ever watched 'Akira' before yesterday morning.  I am very ashamed of myself.So let me just say that 'Akira' is awesome.  It's pretty much everything I'd ever heard about it and much more.  It will literally blow your mind. 
I'll only share a few things because I don't want to spoil it.  You'll want to be in the same mind-set as the unsuspecting folk who went to see this movie in the late eighties, back when animation meant Disney and nothing else.  Two small bits of information might help, though.First of all, the story is a little confusing.  Fortunately, I read a criticism of the movie a long time ago and one of it's helpful points came back to me while I was watching it, so I'll share it here.  The story is basically a darker 'Star Wars', one where Luke goes insane after all he's been through and Han Solo is a horny jerk.I'm also telling you not to eat while you watch it.  It is *very* gory in parts.  The final half-hour is especially insane.  As I told my sister, 'Well, it's real pretty they way they animated the horribly mutating corpse!'  (Poor, poor Tetsuo...)I should note that the version I saw was the letterboxed subtitled edition. I know many people make a big deal out of that sort of thing.",7,0,3,21 August 2001
Citizen Kane," Uh... that's it?
","So here I am finally watching THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE and the one question that plagues my mind is, 'that's it???'Okay, before everyone gangs up on me, I'm not saying that 'Kane', THE BEST, GREATEST, AND MOST UNDENIABLY GOOD MOVIE OF ALL TIME, isn't well made or anything.  It is a very good movie and it held my attention and I enjoyed it.  But the thing is, anytime anyone talks about this movie, all you hear is how 'Citizen Kane' is DOUBTLESS THE GREATEST MOVIE IN THE KNOWN UNIVERSE, START BOWING TO IT, KID!  It's impossible to get that kind of hype out of your head, and I couldn't get around the fact that this is supposed to be some kind of INCREDIBLE AND FANTASTIC DEITY AMONG MOVIES.  Frankly, I was disappointed.'Citizen Kane' IS a good movie.  I might go so far as saying that it's a great movie.  But the BEST MOVIE EVER?  I don't know...",5,6,13,13 June 2002
Memento," A compelling, mind-bending thriller
","You are going to have to watch this movie more than once.  Trust me.  You're going to want to anyway.I have a word of warning.  The first time you watch it, make sure it's at a time when you won't be interrupted.  I was getting so caught up in the mystery that it was a hard time getting up to answer the phone.  You'll want to be able to give this movie your full attention.Aside from that, all I'm going to say about 'Memento' is that this is one of those movies you're either going to love or it's going to drive you insane. Or, maybe, a little of both.Now, where was I...",8,0,1,22 September 2001
Beauty and the Beast," Perfect
","This is one of those movies that I hadn't watched in a very long time.  I remembered, of course, that it's a good movie, but I didn't remember *how* good it was until just watching it again now.This is, quite possibly, the very best Disney movie of all time.  It would be very hard to argue with that.  The songs are excellent, the characters are memorable, the art is beautiful, and, most importantly, the story has great emotional resonance.  It is absolutely perfect.",10,1,1,3 November 2000
The Fifth Element," 'Woah.....'
","I remember reading somewhere a very cynical review of 'the Matrix' which went something like this:  'This is exactly what 'Blade Runner' would have looked like if Ridley Scott was dropping acid.'If that is true, then 'the Fifth Element' is none other then 'the Matrix' on acid.And I mean that in the best way possible.Words cannot adequately describe the pottporri of mirth and mayhem that is 'the Fifth Element'.  All I can say is that I liked it and I reaccomend it. I am not even going to *try* to imply wether you'd like it or not.  Rent it the next time you are in the mood for something completely off the wall, very underrated, and visually inventive (a nicer way of saying trippy as all hell).  And be prepared for sort of a 'Captain Planet' flashback at the finale.'Father... are you *sure* she's the Supreme Being?'",7,0,1,27 October 2000
The Mummy," Big and dumb, but lots of fun.
","Well, I finally got around to watching 'the Mummy' and I found it quite charming.  Charming insofar as a movie who's main character is a rotting corpse CAN be charming.What we have here is a big silly old-school adventure with ancient curses and exotic locals.  It's lots of fun.",5,0,0,27 August 2001
The Others," More 'ooh...' than 'BOO!'
","Well, there I was expecting a movie that was going to scare the ever-loving jiggity-jogs out of me, and 'the Others' ends up being about as scary as the 'Harry Potter' movie.  Less, actually.It is worth watching, though.  It's gothic atmosphere is very pretty, even though the scares don't quite deliver.  I suppose it's because they're drawn out for too long.  This would have been an excellent episode of 'the Twilight Zone', had it been a little over twenty minutes.I want it on record that I was one of the first to 'call' the twist at the end.",6,1,2,2 July 2002
Insomnia," Excellent...
","'Insomnia' could be the best thriller of the year.  The performances are great, the setting is gorgeous and creepy, and the story is inventive.And, at the same time (this is a similar case to 'Panic Room', which I also thought was excellent), it is a PHENOMINAL disapointment coming, as it does, on the heels of 'Memento'.  Oh well.",7,0,0,14 November 2002
X-Men," Yes! A 'Summer Movie' with brains!
","The first thing I have to say about 'X Men' is this.  Alarm bells were going off in my head the very second I first heard about this movie.  The reason is that the world of _X Men_ the comic book / animation series is, let's admit it right now, one of the most elaborate science fiction universes this side of 'Star Wars'.  How can you possibly please the 'newbies' and yet not alienate the long time fans?And this isn't meant to stereotype, but you *know* how dead-serious sci/fi fans can get.  I should know, sort of being one myself.Well, it turns out that nobody needed to worry.  Amazingly, this is not only one of the better movies of the year (a phenomenal year for high-profile bad movies), it's also one of the smartest.  I like how they focused on character development, as that is the strength of the original comics as well.  And I liked how several characters from the comics were given 'cameos' of sorts.Two little details I have to pick at here.  I'm not sure that I liked how they killed off the most interesting antagonist (and in an unnecessarily gruesome scene at that).  Also, make sure that you get to watch the bonus scenes at the end of the video.  They clarify a lot of the various subplots, so I can't think of why they were cut out at all.Otherwise, this movie was excellent and I highly recomend it even if you don't like 'comic book movies'.  This one will win you over.",8,0,0,26 January 2001
Snatch," Energetic and Funny
","There's a lot of mayhem in 'Snatch'.  Dogs are set on rabbits and humans. Dead bodies are turned into pig feed.  A nice old lady is barbecued in her own trailer.  Drunk guys beat the tar out of each other.  Bullets fly, blood flows, and a cute dog is threatened with an on-the-spot vivisection.It's also the funniest movie I've seen in months.  You see, it's done in a very lighthearted style; it reminded me a lot of 'Monty Python' and especially of 'A Fish Called Wanda'.  I loved the photographic effects and the music (and listen for Guy Richie's unsubtle shout-outs to his Missus :)  It's fun, check it out.",6,0,0,13 July 2001
The Doors," Man, where do I begin with this one?
","You may recall that, earlier this week, I watched 'Cast Away' and found that movie to be so insanely ludicrous that it would take one heck of a movie to beat it.Well, I just found that movie.  I ran into it playing on VH1 and found myself getting caught up in it.  It's Oliver Stone's biography of the Doors, and what a movie it is.Now, I have to say that I have nothing against Oliver Stone or Jim Morrison or the sixties or anything associated with any of these.  But I think we can all agree that the way Oliver Stone chooses to envision the sixties and Jim Morrison is... well... a *little* much.Let's just say that I completely lost it when they started dancing around in the desert, going on about the Mystical Time Serpent or something.By the way, I now know less about the Doors than I did when the movie started, so if you're looking for a dead-serious biography, look elsewhere. If you want to laugh at some absolutely ridiculous 'hallucination' scenes, this is the movie for you.",4,4,10,4 July 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Stop being a funsponge and enjoy the freakin' movie already, you must!
","I was, needless to say (go read my review), a bit disappointed with 'the Phantom Menace'.  So when I went to see 'Attack of the Clones', my mood was more one of 'as a Child of the 80's, it's really my civic duty to go 'Star Wars' crazy once in a while', rather than, 'I'm going to see 'Star Wars 2' and have FUN!!!'And lo and behold, I had great fun at 'Attack of the Clones'!I'm trying to figure it out.  I guess it's simply that Episode Two just *feels* more like a 'Star Wars' movie.  There's more gleeful swashbuckling action.  The plot has finally kicked in and is starting to get interesting. My favorite characters from the original trilogy are finally getting in the spotlight.It isn't perfect.  I'll admit that.  I'm still not anticipating part three as much as I am counting the weeks until 'the Two Towers' and 'Matrix Reloaded'.  But it IS a much more enjoyable movie than many movie critics would have you believe.One hint: anytime Amidala and Anakin are onscreen together before they head to Tatooine, go get more popcorn.",7,0,2,2 July 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Adorable
","I have to be honest with you.  At this point, Pixar Studios could make a movie about a guy reading a phone book and I'd go.  They seem to be the last animation studio these days that has FUN animating.  There appears to be an unwritten rule now that you have to take animation way too seriously.  God forbid you have fun making cartoons, right?Okay, end of mini-rant.  Now, while 'Monsters Inc.' isn't as downright *perfect* as the 'Toy Story' movies, it's very close.  It's about on par with 'A Bug's Life'.  And with all that said, I have to say that this is one of the most charming and imaginative movies of the year.  The visuals are particularly amazing (the chameleonic Randall is a stunner, and check out the great lost visual gag from 'Terminator 2' towards the climax), so expect this to become a huge cult hit on video.",8,0,1,30 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Something of a miracle
","Here's the first time I've ever seen a movie, come home from it, and wanted to immediately go see it again, this time dragging all my friends along.  It is THAT good.Now, now, I know you've all heard how good this movie is and maybe two or three of you are sitting under your rocks and thinking, 'what's the big deal?  You people are starting to sound like the now anachronistic broken record.'Go see this movie.Right now.You may thank me later.It's pretty long so make time for it.  Make sure you use the restroom first. But you have got to see this on the big screen.This is, simply put, the kind of awe-inspiring high fantasy I didn't think anyone had the guts to make anymore.  Those new to the story may well not know what the big deal is.  Go read the cliff notes.  Those dead serious fans may gripe (or better explicit) about small changes in the story.  Go get a life.As for me, what I saw was an incredible movie that was very true to the story, but more importantly the spirit, of the books.  I am marking the release dates of parts two and three on my calendar.",9,0,0,23 January 2002
Cast Away," 'WILSON????!!!!????'
","This movie is so ridiculous, I am going to have a really hard time making fun of it.  All I have to say is that five minutes in, my friends and I were taking a sip anytime the (enter name of delivery company that rhymes with 'Red Rex') logo is onscreen.  That was the prologue.  This movie *NEVER ENDS*.  The prologue alone is about five hours long.  But finally the plot kicks in and things pick up for a while.Tom Hanks washes up on the island.  He wanders around for days and days. When he isn't wandering around, he yells at the animals in the forest to be quiet.  They don't listen to him.And then, when things couldn't get more crazy, when I couldn't be laughing my rear end off any harder, we meet Wilson.Wilson is the most interesting character in the movie.  All told, he has more screen time than Helen Hunt's character but not as much as the 'Red Rex' logo.You want to see Tom Hanks looking like a Neanderthal and getting into heated arguments with a volleyball?  Here's your movie.You want to roll around on the floor laughing at Tom Hanks looking like a Neanderthal and getting into heated arguments with a volleyball?  Let me just say (since that was the same spirit I saw it in) that it is going to take one heck of a movie to beat this one.",4,1,2,2 July 2001
Lilo & Stitch," 'I gotta go! My dog just found the chainsaw!'
","I won't back up the claim that this is the most 'unusual' or 'different' animated movie to have the Disney stamp on it (check out the Henry Sellick / Tim Burton movies).  However, this could be the sleeper hit of the summer. It's funny, subversive, and ultimately adorable.  Like my cousin said, if a movie includes a line like the one quoted above, you have no excuse not to see it.Just be warned.  If kids aren't driving their parents nuts imitating Stitch by this fall, I'm missing a bet.",8,1,1,2 July 2002
Armageddon," Confessions of an 'Armageddon' detractor.
","Am I 'geddin'' it?No.'I hate this movie,' I'll say.  I expect at least five to ten people will agree with me.  Instead, jaws drop.  Faces turn pale.  I am stared at aghast like an inhuman monstrosity.'How can you hate this movie?!?'  It's apparently not normal.  'It's so realistic!  It's so romantic!  It's life-affirming!  My uncle watched it once and his chronic nostril acne vanished the next day!'What the heck is WRONG with you, Gremlin?' they ask, appalled by my degenerate point of view.  'How can you POSSIBLY hate this movie?'Let me count the ways:ONE is for the fact that 'Armageddon' proposes that it is easier to train a bunch of oil drillers to be astronauts (without a single one failing any test, and with a deadline set by a gigantic asteroid about to knock us out of orbit and send us screaming into the center of the sun) than it is to show a professional space team how to operate a drill.TWO is for the destruction of New York City being practically forgotten after it happens.  You'd expect something like that to at least make the national news in a few seconds but there's no mention of it once we're on the oil rig in the next scene.THREE is for the introduction of Bruce Willis' character.  He's supposed to be the hero.  The audience isn't going to like the hero all that much if, the first time we meet him, he's chasing his daughter's boyfriend with a massive shotgun.  (Well, you wouldn't THINK the audience would like him.)FOUR is for how a single character dies in 'Top Gun' (the Bruckheimer/Scott movie I actually like) and we're bawling, while the entire population of Paris is wiped out in 'Armageddon' and it barely raises an eyebrow.FIVE is for how everyone I've met enjoys this movie over 'the Truman Show', which is like preferring the taste of dog food to Filet Mignon.SIX is for how there's Earth normal gravity in the space station and the asteroid unless the plot requires for it to be less, so Ben Affleck can play Evil Knevil.SEVEN is for how there are Dramatic Sunsets everywhere on Earth at the same time, ignoring time zones and the International Date Line.EIGHT is for the Inevitable Red Wire/Green Wire Bomb Disarming Scene.  First of all, I'm not a detonation expert but I'm pretty sure government issued bombs do not follow this pattern.  Second of all, *ahem* THE GUY TRYING TO DISARM THE BOMB BUILT THE DAMN THING IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! Shouldn't he know how it works?NINE is for the Touching Finale where a character must sacrifice himself so that he can set the bomb off, exploding the asteroid and saving the planet. So why in the heck does he feel it necessary to give a Big Long Soliloquy AT THE LAST MINUTE, THREATENING EVERY SINGLE CREATURE ON THE PLANET WITH AN AGONIZING DEATH, so he can say farewell to his friends?!?TEN is for that damn Aerosmith song.  It's their only number one hit.  Of all their songs, that Dianne Warren penned tripe is the most popular.  I'm going to cry.'Armageddon' gets a big fat two stars, for the sake of inspiring a good parody on 'Futurama' once.  I'm grinding my teeth over giving it even that much.",2,1,2,2 June 2001
Pitch Black," Scary and clever
","Well, with a movie like this, all you have to know is that it was very scary.  It was also, however, quite smart as well.  Very rarely do you get both qualities in one movie and it reminded me a lot of the first two 'Alien' movies in style and tone.  Very atmospheric, with a creepy villan (?) and awesome Wayne D. Barlow inspired aliens.",5,0,0,5 November 2000
American Psycho," I never liked Yuppies.
","This is one hell of a messed-up movie.  And, having just typed that, it strikes me as a gross (I love my puns) understatement.This is the kind of movie in which the sexiest scene is the one where the main character (I hesitate to call him the hero) is chasing a girl around wielding a huge, Freudian chainsaw and wearing only his sneakers and a psychotic grin.Hey, if you're into that kind of thing, more power to you.  It takes all kinds.  I'll admit I laughed during some of the mayhem herein, which indicates things about myself I'd rather not have known.",5,0,1,13 July 2001
U-571," U is for 'Ugh!'
","There's a scene in 'U-571' where the acting captain on a captured German U-boat watches a German plane zip overhead.'It's long-range reconnaissance,' he shouts.  'What the hell's it doing all the way out HERE?!?'That's about as smart as the characters are allowed to be in this movie.",3,0,2,5 June 2001
Save the Last Dance," Very good. Call it 'Pretty in Pink 2K'.
","Here's a great little sleeper hit that also happens to be the first recent teen movie that, so help me, tries to give it's audience a little more to think about than booger jokes.  It's weird that I'm recommending a movie for that reason, but these are strange times we live in.One caveat.  Is it me or might they as well have dubbed in rattlesnake sounds anytime the Nikki character was onscreen?",6,0,2,16 August 2001
Being John Malkovich," A truly unique mind bender
","I made my mom watch this movie (and she hates offbeat movies), and the only thing I told her was that she's probably never seen anything like it. 
I wasn't lying.There is *absolutely* nothing like this anywhere.I dare not give anything away except that this movie has, without a second's doubt, the most sublimely hilarious sequence I've ever seen.  Watch for the part that begins with Craig asking what happens when a man enters his own subconcious.Woah.....",Null,1,2,22 January 2001
Spider-Man," Great fun
","Well, you've heard it enough times that it's like a broken record, but you are going to have a grand old time at 'Spider-Man'.  I will say that you'll appreciate it a lot more if you're familiar with the story.  Even so, go and have fun.Trust me.  At this point, you'll feel like a mutant if you don't.",8,0,0,2 July 2002
Dark City," 'When was the last time you remember doing anything in daylight?' - Murdock
","I have an important announcement for those of you who have been able to hunt down this surprisingly underrated movie: you MUST watch it in the dark.  I'm serious.  Up until the last thirty seconds or so, the visuals are almost too Noir to handle, and you don't want any pesky daylight ruining the effect.This is one of the most visually stunning fantasy films I've seen in over a decade.  The only bad news is that the story is just what would have happened if 'the Truman Show' and 'the Matrix' had a kid.  That's okay; I love both of those movies.  I'm giving 'Dark City' a cozy placement somewhere near the equally underrated films, 'the Dark Crystal' and 'Return to OZ'.  I won't give any hint as to what happens in this movie, as I had no idea what it was going to be like when I was about to watch it, and I don't want to ruin any of the surprises.Inevitable sci-fi/fantasy geek question:  So who'd win in a deathmatch, Neo or Murdock?",8,0,1,3 August 2001
The Fast and the Furious," Not bad for what it is.
","Let's face facts.  You don't watch a movie like 'the Fast and the Furious' for a compelling story or memorable characters.  You watch this movie to see cars driving around, really, really fast.  So how is it in that department?Pretty darn cool.Hot rods, motorcycles, trucks, all look very cool in this movie.But then, I'm not a car person.  I'm an 'Okay, you can have some cool action sequences, but they have to involve interesting characters and be part of a larger, more exciting story' person.  So, from me, this movie got a four. You may want to add a point there if you just want a big, dumb car chase movie.",4,0,1,27 January 2002
Spirited Away," Triumphant
","Let's face facts: Anime is better than live action.  Animation is better in the same respect that dreams hold more *truth* than reality.  Understand this and (I know it's starting to sound like a broken record, but it's true) you are going to love 'Spirited Away'.Rabbit holes are everywhere, according to Miyazaki, and they are just waiting for you to fall inside.  You have every reason in the world to do so.  You can spare two hours to nurture the child within, can't you?",9,1,2,30 May 2003
Pearl Harbor," 'Titanic' with explosions. YEEE-haw!
","I know this is a trite analogy and I apologize in advance, but this movie seriously ticked (or better explicit) me off and this is the best I can do right now.  Watching 'Pearl Harbor' after September 11th is like watching 'Bambi' and then immediately sitting down for some venison.I wanted to boycott this movie but my family rented it and I ended up watching some of it.  I had to leave.  It's that aggravating.Possibly the biggest insult from this movie is that the second tape of it on video is taken up mostly by a *documentary* that basically says, 'Okay, you watched us totally exploit one of the most tragic events in history for a sappy love story.  Now here's what REALLY happened!''Pearl Harbor' gets a big fat one; the first movie in a very long time to do so.  Veterans and families of attack victims should stay the blazes away from this thing, unless you want to need lots of therapy.",1,1,2,27 January 2002
Resident Evil," Run-of-the-mill zombie flick... if there's such a thing.
","I've never played any of the 'Resident Evil' games (I'm too big of a sissy), but one of my cousins has and she assures me that this movie follows the game's plotline to a T.  That's the good news.The bad news is that I was expecting a movie that'd scare the goodness-knows-what out of me and it didn't.  Now, it does LOOK cool and atmospheric, but it isn't wickedly gruesome like the George Romero 'Dead' series or delightfully sick like the 'Evil Dead' series.  For a zombie movie, this is pretty boring.",3,0,1,3 September 2002
Liar Liar," Very cute, but not much else.
","This is just a very cute little movie, nothing more.  It would be instantly forgettable if not for Jim Carrey doing what is quite possibly the greatest collection of double-takes ever committed to film.  That and the scenes where he beats himself up are worth giving this one a rent.",Null,1,1,23 October 2001
Man on the Moon," Weird, but funny.
","I think the best, most helpful summary of this movie that I read before seeing it was this:  This is the story of the strangest person (prior to PeeWee Herman and Tom Green) to ever get on television.  You won't learn much about Andy Kaufman besides that, but I still thought it was good and very funny.  Now, I'm not old enough to remember if this movie was totally accurate or not, but it must count for something that I laughed harder during the first five minutes than during a lot of recent full length comedies!One thing though:  expect to get the song stuck in your head!",6,0,0,18 July 2000
The Princess Bride," 'Have fun storming the castle!' - Miracle Max
","This was the 'Shrek' of the eighties (although I'll be the first to say that it's more accurate to call 'Shrek' the 'Princess Bride' of 2K01).  Adults going in didn't like the idea of having to drag their kids to a 'fairy tale' movie, and came out laughing hardest of all.Adorable, romantic, and quotable as heck, this is a must-see!",8,1,2,8 November 2001
The Little Mermaid," On the Fence
","Well, I don't really know what to say about our old friend, Ariel.When this movie was first released, I would have given it a solid ten and gushed about it in this review.  Well, today she gets a five.  And I think my reasoning for this is that this one movie is the birthplace for every single current Disney animation cliche.  And I, for one, am getting a little sick of seeing the same old thing over and over.Aside from that, the one major critisism I have about this movie, this is a reasonably good nostalgia buzz.  Takes me back to the summer when my sister, my cousins, all my friends and I watched it so many times that we could pretty much recite every line of dialogue in our sleep. Scary!",5,8,20,3 November 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Gorgeous
","I have to precede this review with a couple of disclaimers, alright?First, the only reason I'm giving this movie a 9 as opposed to a 10 rating is because of the hype.  Had I never heard of it before, I'd rate it a solid 11.  As it is, with the amount of buzz this movie got, if any movie wanted to live up to it, it'd have to have been personally directed by God.Secondly, since I know lots of people consider this a big deal, this review is based on the English dub.  The ONLY reason I didn't rent the subtitled version is because of my sister.  She refuses to watch anything subtitled. I pity her.On to the actual review.Wow.This is the kind of romantic high fantasy they don't have the guts to make anymore.  Magical swords, exotic empires, desert bandits, ancient secrets, fierce rivalries, and secret identities.  Mountains that dissolve into mist. Forests like green oceans.  Caves that transform into underground cities.Oh yes; in this world, humans can fly.  People can fly and that is that.  If you can't take that, go watch something like 'Sweet November'.This movie is gorgeous.",9,0,0,2 July 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Sam lives too!
","I won't get too crazy here.  We're at part two in a really, really long story, so this is basically all building up to what happens in 'Return of the King'.  That said, it's not as interesting as 'Fellowship of the Ring'. It's still very good.  You can't say anything bad about something that involves talking trees.",8,0,0,5 January 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Well...
","What an overwrought, exasperating pretentious mess!That is to say, I loved every minute of this movie.I don't want to say a darn thing about what you're going to get to see when you watch 'Moulin Rouge'.  If you've seen Baz Laurman's (I know I spelled that wrong, sorry) take on 'Romeo and Juliet' you have a vague idea of what you're in for.  If you saw the video for the 'Lady Marmalade' song, you have a very vague idea of what you're in for (by the way, the movie is a lot smarter than the video suggests).  Just make sure you watch it when you're good and alert cause there's more stuff going on in any given frame of film here than some movies have in their entire running length.This is a movie you're either going to passionately love or violently hate, but don't miss it.",6,0,1,29 December 2001
Men in Black II," 'Awright, check it.'
","The original 'Men in Black' isn't one of my absolute favorite movies, but it's okay.  The best things about it are the sci-fi jokes and the most inventive looking alien characters since we left the Mos Eisley Cantina. Well, 'MIB 2' is one of those sequels that takes what worked in the first movie and goes with it.  Unfortunately, that means we end up with exactly the same movie over again.No, really; the EXACT same movie over again.  Right down to the plot being about an evil alien (who, again, transforms into the first human form it lays eyes -or whatever- on) searching for a glowy thing that the universe depends on.Is it worth watching?  Well, kids will still like it, I guess.  And people who were waiting on the edge of their seats for the next 'Men in Black' movie (as opposed to, say, parts two and three of 'the Matrix').  As for the rest of us, all we get is a scene with Michael Jackson and some penguins that I guess is supposed to be funny but ends up being profoundly terrifying.",4,0,0,8 December 2002
Pi," Royally messed-up, but in a good way.
","I didn't know a thing about this movie or what it was about before I watched it.  With that in mind, I won't give away too much.  'Pi' is a great, mind-bending look at an obsession that turns into insanity. Watch it.I'll warn you of one thing.  The movie's rated R for language, scenes that graphically recreate Sean's horrifying hallucinations, and mature themes.With that said, here comes a Rant of sorts.  By 'mature themes,' I mean that the things the characters discuss in this movie are actually very intelligent.  I feel weird saying that's one of the reasons this movie is so mind-blowing, but these are strange, sad days.  See, or spare yourself and DON'T see, the 'mature' R-rated 'Scary Movie.'",5,0,1,29 July 2001
The Nightmare Before Christmas," An all-too-rare treasure.
","One thing animators are able to do is create entire alternate universes from scratch.  And, sadly, they very rarely take advantage of this ability.  The best animated films are like travelogues filmed on location in other worlds, and one of the most downright astonishing of these worlds is to be seen in 'the Nightmare Before Christmas'.This would be an amazing movie anyway because of it's stop-motion animation, a dying art if there ever was one.  However, the story, characters and music are equaly memorable.  It doesn't hurt that Halloween and Christmas happen to be the two bookends of an annual period of holiday season euphoria for yours truly.  This, of course, is one of the movies I always must watch every holiday season to get myself in the spirit.Be sure to get the 'Special Edition' video, by the way.  It's letterboxed and includes the two Tim Burton shorts 'Vincent' (which looks excactly like an Edward Gorey book come to life) and 'Frankenweenie' (a sublimely hilarious tribute to Shelly).",9,1,2,9 March 2001
A Bug's Life," Underrated but very cute.
","While not as absolutely perfect as the 'Toy Story' movies (indeed, that's a very tough act to follow), 'A Bug's Life' is very enjoyable movie.  It's one of the very few animated movies that works well for adults and kids, the script is incredibly well written, and the artwork is bright and adorable. 
I want to make one last comment on that last aspect.  This summer, a lot of noise was made about how Disney's inventively titled (I hope you can all hear the sarcasm dripping off of that statement) non-Pixar-involving (and man, did that make a difference) computer animation -err- 'movie' ('Dinosaur', if you haven't guessed yet) had backgrounds that were real live-action footage.  Only the characters were animated.  Well, watching 'Bug's Life' again, I have to ask, what was the point?  The backgrounds in 'Bug's' are stunningly beautiful, and the characters interact with them convincingly.  The characters (if you can call them that) in 'Dinosaur' were less convincing than the animated creatures in a Ray Harryhausen movie. Much less.  There's a lesson to be learned here.",9,0,0,20 October 2000
Toy Story," Absolute perfection!
","Hard to believe it but this, one of my all-time favorite movies, is already five years old.  And you know what, it's aged beautifully.Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest animated films of all time. And not only that but it's also one of the funniest comedies (animated or otherwise) ever written.  I remember when this first came to theaters and everyone came to see the animation.  Don't get me wrong, 'Toy Story' would still get a solid ten (if only the ratings went to 11) on eye-candy value alone.  However, the thing that gets me watching it over and over is the script.In short, this is the one animated movie that's *almost* more quotable than 'the Breakfast Club'.I can't imagine that there are people out there that haven't yet seen 'Toy Story', even though I've met a few.  Go watch it, already!  You can thank me later.This movie is *perfect*.",10,0,0,16 February 2001
The Mummy Returns," More big, dumb fun
","Here's more silly action in the style of the first 'Mummy' movie; it looks like the video game you don't have to play yourself.  But this one's got a very important lesson:If you're a director, and you tell your animation team that they should make the final 'boss' villain the scariest looking scorpion-demon thing ever, do not ever end your description of the creature with, 'and give it the head of a professional wrestler!'",4,0,0,9 October 2001
Toy Story 2," Perfection
","I was a little worried when I read that there was a made-for-video sequel to 'Toy Story' in the works, and even more worried when I found out it was going to be released in theaters (three words: 'Doug's First Movie'). Turned out my fears were completely unfounded.'TS2' is the rare sequel that not only lives up to the original, but outdoes it.  That's no small feat in this case!  The characterization is excellent, and the animation is incredible.  Most importantly, the story is surprisingly moving (I guarantee you'll be bawling during Jesse's song), and there's more action in any given frame of film here than in most recent thrillers.And ya gotta love the scenes parodying 'Star Wars'.  This rates a perfect ten.  I only wish there was an eleven.",10,1,3,1 January 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Well, gee. Now I know what everything in the book looks like without having to use my imagination.
","Nearly every single scene from _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's (or Philosopher's) Stone_ is in the movie, but there's still something missing. Something big and very important, and it isn't Peeves.It's the heart.I saw this train wreck in a dollar theater and felt like I was having the book read to me flatly. All it does is show you what the producers think everything in the story looked like without ever bothering with what the story was ABOUT. I know a movie's in deep, deep trouble when I really couldn't give a pair of fetid dingo kidneys about the title character or his friends.Do the little ones a big, big favor and sit them in front of 'the Neverending Story', which has got more imagination in any given frame of film than 'Harry' has in its entire running length.  And it does so while (gasp!) NOT sticking slavishly to the book!",2,0,3,26 March 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Blah blah Wizards, blah blah Magic, blah blah Monsters...
","The 'Harry Potter' books are still much more fun than the movies, but I liked 'Chamber' better than the first one.  Of course, this could just be because I don't remember that much from this particular book in the series. It should be noted that while there is a moving (if very brief) final performance from Richard Harris, this film -even more so than the first- is an even bigger waste of John Cleese.Interestingly, the various 'tours' on the special features disk on the DVD set are far closer to the spirit of the books than anything in the movies. Check out the visit to Diagon Alley, make sure you explore everything, and see what I mean.",6,0,0,28 April 2003
Ice Age," 'Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow...'
","I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  The animation (while not as polished as that of PIXAR; it resembles a really advanced PS2 offering) is loose and energetic.But the best thing about 'Ice Age' is the humor.  I swear, this is the best movie for people who are going into 'Far Side' withdrawal pangs.  That said, this might not be the best choice for really little kids.As for the rest of us, enjoy the movie 'Dinosaur' had mad delusions of being.  And watch out for a great 'Goonies' reference.",8,3,6,8 December 2002
The Green Mile," Mixed reactions...
","Well, this is (accessing Sarcasm Mode) one of those upbeat movies that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside!  Seriously, though, I know people who cried at the end and I know people (like myself) who though it was good but also thought it was a LITTLE much, and I know people who hated it and walked out in the first half hour!My opinion was this: it was well done, but a more subtle approach would have been better (and I don't know if we needed that cheerful meditation or mortality at the finale).  On the other hand, by the middle, I said to myself 'If John Coffey saves a deer (think 'Starman' or 'Powder' and cringe) this movie is OVER!!!'",3,2,6,18 July 2000
Jaws," I can see why it's a classic
","Here's the problem with not having sat down and watched 'Jaws' until just last weekend.  SO many cartoons, movies, and so on have parodied this movie, I felt like I'd already seen it about thirty times.  Then again, this is such a great fish story, it deserves all the tribute.One thing that I'm still not so clear on.  See, I was born a few years after this movie was released.  I have a *really* hard time believing that not so many people were cautious about swimming in the ocean before this.",7,5,11,18 September 2001
The Lion King," On the fence again!
","Well, once more I'm revisiting an old Disney movie that I haven't seen in a while but had memorized years ago.  And, again, I do not know what to say about our old buddy, Simba.First the good news.  This is still a great looking movie.  The opening sequence is still one of the most breathtaking pieces of animation ever made.  The score is also phenominal.However, of all the Disney movies of the early 90's, this is the one that has aged the least well.  The story really isn't all that original (can anyone say _Hamlet_?), and the characters are too derivative from other characters who were popular at the time (Timon and Pumbaa are essentially the nuetered Ren and Stimpy).  Furthermore, the much hyped celeberaty voice-overs are very distracting.  Who the hell casts Rowan 'Mr. Bean' Atkinson for his *voice*?When all is said and done, 'Lion King' makes for good eye-candy, but not much else.",6,1,10,2 February 2001
Scream," Admit it, it's a classic!
","If you think about it, this movie's got a lot to answer for.  After 'Scream' became a surprise hit, it was assumed that *any* scary movie would be a guaranteed hit.  And so we got 'Urban Legend' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', which didn't do much other than reminding us what the cliched scary movies 'Scream' was making fun of were like.That's my only problem with 'Scream'.  Other than that, it's my favorite scary movie and an even better tribute to 'Halloween' than the wrong-headed twentieth anniversary sequel.  You might have a problem answering the phone immediately afterwards.",9,0,0,28 September 2001
Shrek," I'm sure you've heard this enough times already but you are going to LOVE this movie!
",All I have to say here is that I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard through an *entire* movie.  Mike Myers is a genius!I will add this.

The Emperor's New Groove," A terrific (and, yes, groovy) surprise
","'The Emperor's New Groove' is the first Disney animated film in WAY too long whose characters have just that; animation.  Really, when was the last time you watched a Disney movie and thought to yourself, 'they must have had a lot of fun drawing all of this'?This is just a great cartoon.  No more and no less.  And thank goodness for that!  I'll stop here because I don't want to spoil anything, but make sure you don't miss it.  Pick it up the next time you want something a little offbeat for the family.I have to admit, though, I'm curious as to what 'Empire of the Sun' ('Groove''s previous life - it's a LONG story) would have been like.",6,0,0,15 August 2001
Blade Runner," Stunning
","Note: This review is, needless to say, for the Director's Cut.'Blade Runner' has always been hailed positively as one of the most visually creative movies ever made.  I strongly agree; the world of this movie is downright spine-tingling, like shining a spotlight on another universe.I have a problem with this movie, though, and it's a pretty big one.  For a movie that asks what it means to be human, why aren't the characters more interesting?",8,1,2,5 March 2002
Space Jam," Why, Bugs? Why?
","Way, WAY back in high school, I took an animation class over the summer, and everyone in the class, myself included, were huge fans of the classic Warner Brothers cartoons.  They were, essentially, the very reason we were all into animation in the first place, and we were all a bit upset about the current sneaker commercials that featured the characters playing second-fiddle to athletes.  So, as you might imagine, when one student mentioned that he had heard a rumor that they were going to make a *movie* based on the commercials, we took the news in the same way lots of people reacted to the 'Star Wars Episode II' rumor that Boba Fett may turn out to be JarJar Binks in disguise.I could totally rip this movie apart, but I don't happen to have the energy. Just know that, indeed, the classic Bugs Bunny we all know and adore would need *NO* help in defeating the (ergh) 'Mean Team'.  (OH, hahaha!  I get it! Oh, brilliance!  Oh rapturous laughter such a pun hath generated!)  I can also sum up, in two words, the gut-wrenching, toe-curling, fan-pooping-on badness of this *thing*:  Lola Bunny.  Yes, even the once totally anarchic Looney Tunes must bow to (cringes) Political Correctness and have a Strong Female Character retrofitted into their world.  I am so touched by this decision, I think I just might vomit.'Space Jam' is getting a two only for its parody value and the admittedly funny out-of-nowhere visual shout-out to Quentin Tarantino.  Which has in all likelyhood been cut out.",2,14,36,26 September 2000
Signs," Good the second time around
","The thing you need to know about 'Signs' is that this is probably the first alien invasion movie  in a long time that isn't any fun at all.  Also, you need to watch it twice.See, the first time you watch it, you end up disappointed.  It takes a good ninety minutes or so to get scary.  And it's a more sublime kind of scary than the 'Anything can happen, oh, %&$@!' kind of scary you might be expecting.So watch it again, later on, now that you understand the tone of the movie. See, it's less 'Oh, no, the aliens are coming!!!' than 'Independence Day' as a clumsy (but effective) 9/11 allegory.",5,0,2,31 January 2003
The Truman Show," Is it me or was this movie just a tad prescient?
","I absolutely loved this movie from the first time I saw it.  Now I hadn't seen it in a while and I just watched it tonight.  I love it even more.I might as well mention an interesting phenominon regarding 'the Truman Show'.  I know a lot of people who say they don't like this movie even though they've never even seen it.  That's just rediculous.  Now I understand it might have been a little ahead of it's time a few years ago. Today, however, I think we can all agree it's become a great deal more relevant.",9,0,0,2 March 2001
Aladdin," Great fun!
","I think, of all the Disney movies from the early 90's, 'Aladdin' is, hands down, the most enjoyable.  It's got the perfect mix of humor, action, and romance.  Most interesting of all, however, is the fact that Disney hasn't ever got this mix right twice.  'Hercules' was intended as another 'Aladdin' and while that's a fun little movie, it's not nearly as memorable as it's predicessor.I think the reason is that, for once, Disney chose to lighten up while making 'Aladdin'.  They allowed the characters to look and act more offbeat than usual.  Visually, the artwork is fantastic and the psychedelic color scheme comes very close to putting 'Yellow Submarine' to shame.  The memorable characters are another highlight of the movie.  I don't think you'll find a better sidekick than Genie or a more endearing hero than Aladdin himself.Absolute perfection.",9,1,1,2 February 2001
The Breakfast Club," Should be required viewing for teens
","Let's get my rants out of the way first.  I hate seeing this movie in the comedy sections of video stores.  Have those people ever sat down and watched it?  I'm willing to bet that they haven't. 
I've also noted that this is a movie people either love or hate.  Most of the people I know who hate it first watched it as adults.  That is a HUGE mistake.  Adults (and I know this because I find myself slowly, reluctantly transforming into one) tend to remember their teenage years with (can you believe this?) *FONDNESS*!  I'm serious!  Adults have it in their heads that being a teenager is *enjoyable*.'The Breakfast Club' was one of the first films to try and show what kids really go through in high school.  Most teen movies prior were something more like 'Grease', all nostalgia and denial, no trauma or disillusion. Then this movie arrived with scene after excruciating scene of adolescent angst.My humble opinion is this:  If you are currently in high school you MUST watch this movie.  If you wait, you'll be too old to get it.  It is, simply put, the greatest teen movie ever made.If you aren't tearing up by the middle of the second act, you are advised to check your pulse.",10,0,1,23 March 2001
Gladiator," Awesome!
","My only regret about this movie is this:  I wish I'd seen it in the theater instead of waiting for it on video (I was very bad about seeing new movies this summer).  I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd seen the full effect.Because this is a BIG movie.  And to that end, it's excellent.  The sets and costumes are incredible, the characters are well established, and the action scenes are amazing.  My only problem with the story was that I think there must have been a better way to explain the main political conflict, as the action literally has to halt in order for the characters to explain what's going on.  Other than that, I enjoyed this movie.  Although I'm not sure if it'll be up for best picture, it at least gets my honor of the year's most quotable movie.'That vexes me.

This is one of the most visually stunning and compelling films, animated or not, I have ever seen.  It will stay with me for a long time.  I just wasn't quite prepared for all the gore.
