It," After the movie ended! the clown became a joke to me rather than scary.
","I watched the movie late! considering its huge rant and I watched with a very high expectations, Anyways it started very strong but then my interest was slowly dying during the movie, and here is why I think 'it' isn't great compared to other horror movies:1) The amount of the scary scenes are TOO many! and you know what does that do to a horror movie? it kills the mystery! you will be left with scary jumps scenes only, and to a lot of people; that's not what you only look for in a horror movie.2) The kids were acting good but .. come on ! regular kids will be knocked down if they see what those kids saw.3) I feel like every scary scene is the end .. since they are so intense .. there is not much to wait for at the end.4) You know how you see in cartoons some times kids saying all kind of crap like 'with the power of friendship we can defeat the devil!' yeah you will see some of that in there ... cringy.I gave it 5 stars because it's still thrilling and I didn't regret watching it and the directing was almost perfect.",Null,0,2,6 October 2017
