Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is aimed mainly at the Symon Parks guy who disses Star Wars for bad reasons.
","Sure, we all have our opinions but I give better ones.  I really enjoyed Episode I because of a great plot, good characters, and very well done special effects.Now, Symon(hope you are reading this), I am writing this NOT to down you I am just saying that the reason they were called 'The Trade Federation' was because the plot took place in a time where peace had been restored to the galaxy(but before Luke's time.)  Geez, would people that were plotting against Naboo even CALL themselves 'the evil empire'???  No, I didn't think so.Now, anyway, there was a bad aspect that critics noticed.  The movie had bad acting, but it didn't really affect the movie much.  (Actually, I thought Liam Neeson did some great acting.) But I have to admit that at times, Ewan McGregor(Obi-Wan) did sound a lot like Alec Guinness...If you haven't seen the movie, GO see it.  You're missing a good movie if you don't.",Null,0,0,9 September 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Spielberg in one of his best!
","Well thought out movie.  Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, John Rhys-Davies, and the late Denholm Elliott did excellent jobs at their roles.  Spielberg directed this very well and a good script by Lawrence Kasdan(writer of 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'Return of the Jedi'), which was from a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman.  I recommend this movie to ANY one!",Null,0,0,14 June 2000
X-Men," excellent movie renedition of a comic book!
","I must say that this was a great movie.  The whole cast was excellent, but the highlights were Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen. Well-written and well-directed.  My only complaints were: *  Too short.  It was only 92 minutes. *  Beast was NOT in it. But since the movie promises a sequel, I shall wait...",Null,0,0,19 July 2000
The Terminator," One of the greatest sci-fi movies ever!
","Exciting action\adventure\scifi film!  This movie was very, very good in every aspect.  Even if the special effects are outdated (The Terminator effects were stop-animation), it is still a classic movie.  Arnold was perfectly casted as the Terminator, which (ironically) would've gone to Lance Henriksen, but Arnold pushed to have the part.  Great movie, I highly recommend this one!",Null,0,0,12 January 2001
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Excellent sequel!
","This movie was really good, with Arnold playing the good guy this time around.  I can't say if this is better than the first one... this one has some great special effects (especially the liquid metal), spectacular action sequences, and Robert Patrick... but it wasn't nearly as intense as the first one.  Go figure, though, because you have Arnold as the good Terminator.Arnold has that menacing look that really convinces you that he's evil. Robert Patrick is a great actor, but he doesn't look evil.  It's the special effects that makes him look evil.On the plus side, this one is much funnier and the relationship between the Terminator and John Connor is hilarious.  I especially liked it when John was teaching him not to kill anyone.  Also, the ending was very touching and sad, it made you not want Arnold to die.I guess it depends on what you like in the Terminator movies.  The first one has intense action and a fresh look at science fiction... the second one has great relationships between Arnold and Sarah and John, while possessing special effects that will knock your socks off.  For me, I love them both. =)",Null,0,0,12 January 2001
Aliens," Outdoes the original in every way!
","Alien was an excellent movie.  A bit slow-moving, but a good horror film. Aliens is even BETTER.  Sigourney Weaver is even better here as Ripley and the action and horror never flag.  Classic, filled with action and horrific aliens, it's no wonder this movie remains the best mix of horror and sci-fi today.  Way to go James Cameron!",Null,0,0,28 October 2001
Independence Day," Wonderful movie!
","Why do people keep dissing this movie?  This movie has a pretty good plot (a rip-off of the 1950's movie 'War of the Worlds'), but the strength lies within the characters.  Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and especially Judd Hirsch put in fine roles.  Watch out for Brent Spiner and Randy Quaid in this movie, they provide short-lived excellent roles.",Null,0,1,14 June 2000
Mission: Impossible," Good movie, BAD BAD ending!
","The movie was great with lots of good action scenes.  The thing that ruined it (for me and others) was that Jim Phelps was the bad guy!  (If you don't know, Jim Phelps was the main good guy on the original 60's series...)  For Jim to turn bad like that (and he WAS NOT played by Peter Graves) was inexcusable and out of character.  This may sound picky, but if you liked the original series, you'll know what I mean.",Null,4,8,14 June 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Perhaps the greatest box-office success... ever.
","I grew up on Star Wars and I especially like it now.  George Lucas did well for this one, the storyline, the acting, pretty much everything was GREAT. Alec Guinness and Mark Hamill were awesome in this.  The special effects were quite good for its time period. Let's face it, they don't make movies like this anymore.",Null,0,0,20 July 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," British humor that lights up, despite a bad ending
","Despite the dull, idiotic ending, this will be a memorable movie.  This is most loved because of the knight scene, the crazy Frenchmen, the knights of 'NI', and Old Man asking the questions.  ('What is your name?  What is your quest?  etc.)",Null,0,1,16 January 1999
The Breakfast Club," Don't listen to the negatives
","Let's face it, this movie is a classic.  Don't listen to that Dick (excuse me 'Richard') that hates 80's movies; Aliens ROCKS.  Hoosiers ROCKS.  The Back to the Future series ROCKS.  Plus, who can forget The Terminator? That's only a few movies out of many films I can name that are good that came out of the 80's.For this classic, you might not want to pay too much attention to the plot. It's the characters and their development that highlights this gem.  Judd Nelson is the best here, and with good development too.  Also, not only is it funny, but there is great perception here (questions such as why do jocks have to act 'cool' around each other?).  My advice: at least rent it.",Null,0,1,1 December 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The best Indiana Jones movie!
","Indy's back in the third installment in 'The Last Crusade,' which is (in my opinion) the BEST.  Although not quite as 'special-FX-spiffy' as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', this one was better in terms of plot and the character relationship between Indy(Harrison Ford) and his father(Sean Connery, in his funniest role).  Beautifully filmed and well-acted, this movie remains the best.  Steven Spielberg did it again!",Null,0,0,14 June 2000
