Insidious: Chapter 2," Better than the first? :O
","A number of reviews are stating its better than the first film in the series, and I agree! As I said in my review of #1, the purpose of a film (whether or not the plot is 'rehashed' or whatever you want to call it) is to draw you in and make you FEEL the movie; the more flaws the movie has, the more you detach. This movie definitely makes you FEEL it, and mostly through an excellent story.",8,0,1,28 September 2019
The Babadook," Screaming child + beyond stupid ending = disappointment
","No spoilers here, I do think it is worth a watch, but the constantly screaming child (not because he's being tortured or anything 'horror' related, just 'because' they decided to make him scream for a good chunk of the movie) and the *terrible* ending ruin what would have otherwise, easily, been an 8 or 9/10 movie.",5,2,5,27 September 2019
The Conjuring 2," Not as good as the first, but definitely worth watching
","An excellent continuation of the series; watch the first, then this one (assuming the first is something you enjoy..........and it had better be as it is excellent!!! :P).A lot of reviews are including things like 'nothing new' or 'not groundbreaking' etc, but in the sea of crap horror movies the Conjuring movies stand out for doing things *right*. The characters don't do 'stupid things' just to keep the movie going, no cheesy crap to TRY to scare you. With incredibly few exceptions everything is 'purposeful' and nothing takes you out of the movie. You don't wonder 'why didn't they do this?' or 'why did that happen?'I can't begin to count the number of horror movies I've watched, and the vast majority, literally within 5-10 minutes of the movie starting 'force' something to happen to establish the plot, and you never get sucked into the movie. So far both Conjuring movies avoid this and many other common pitfalls of this genre.The only 'negative' is for the whole 'universe' of the Conjuring, the Nun, Annabelle, etc etc, etc, which is the 'spin offs' are almost entirely drivel and have little if any involvement with James Wan.",9,0,2,27 September 2019
It Follows," Lots of effort, ultimately fails.
","*Minor* spoilers in the review.It's difficult to organize my thoughts on this movie, and speak to the extreme reviews (seems like people are either ranking it 'amazing' or 'trash', and its neither).There is well done suspense and 'scary' moments to the movie; a lot of care was put into this, which I appreciated.The movie is very 'ambient', and well done in that regard (some reviews are calling this aspect 'slow' or 'bored me to tears', but its purposeful and well done in this regard, in my opinion).Why am I giving it a 4/10; the movie manages to make virtually every single possible 'horror movie failure' possible. The main character is told exactly how the evil thing works, and even after accepting that its real continues to ignore what she and the audience know about it. She knowingly follows it sometimes, why? There is literally no point other than allowing the audience to 'see' it in action, but that could be done on camera without her present. She manages to harm it at one point, but then gives up on trying to kill it for no reason. It has to interact with the physical world, its not some magical thing that just *pops* up wherever it pleases, so she could try and get 'official' help (police, etc) but never attempts to. Soundtrack and a lot of the scenery and surroundings make it seem like its set in the 80s but there are modern cars and electronic devices. I found myself constantly wondering where we were and what year it was. You know the movie isn't 'doing it right' when you *constantly* are yelling 'WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?!' or 'DON'T GO IN THERE' at the screen. And these aren't cases where the audience is privy to information the characters on screen are not; they have experienced *exactly* the same thing as the audience, no 'reveals' to just the audience.I really wanted to like this, as it is different than a lot of horror movies, but ultimately it was a massive disappointment due to the numerous and obvious flaws and falls prey to virtually all horror movie tropes (not in a good way).Oddly enough, I do recommend watching it, but if you're looking for a movie to fully engage you and give you a REAL scare, this is sadly not the one.Edit: After reading ALLLLL of the reviews currently on IMDB about this film I felt like I had to add something in response to what I'm seeing in my own review.Probably unsurprisingly, most reviews are 'polar' (either 1 star or 9or10 stars). The 1 star reviews are mostly complaining that its boring and that the 'thing' in the movie is never explained as to what it is, and that something slowly walking at you isn't scary. To these people I say that they aren't horror fans, they're not looking for an actual *scare*, they probably want a slasher or something along those lines. For something to be scary you don't need an explanation as to what it is, in fact, in general that makes it all that much more scary.The other side, the 9 and 10 star reviews praising the film for how amazing it is. Do I get the 'hype' in that regard of it being 'refreshing' and not the same crap that every other horror movie is? Absolutely!!!! But these people must be blind as there are *sooooooo* many plot and logic issue with this film, which are specifically the reason I'm giving it a low rating. If somehow magically the film didn't have massive plot issues (which I haven't touched on even half of them in this review, trying to leave something for people that want to give it a chance) I would easily give this a 10/10.I wish people would be honest with themselves and in these reviews, not just blasting immediately to a 1 or a 10. That's not a review. That's ignorantly trying to force people to like or dislike something because you personally love or hate it.",4,2,4,26 September 2019
Insidious," Underrated!
","Is it an AMAZING movie that'll blow your socks off? Probably not. But there are a lot of reviews calling it repetitive, been done a million times, etc etc etc. It is actually quite innovative. I wouldn't go so far as to call it 'original', but it possesses original qualities! It seems some reviewers want EVERY movie to be 100% original, otherwise its no good (giving them ratings between 1 and 5 stars of 10) which is a ridiculous way to review movies. In my opinion, the 'crux' of a horror movie is to draw you into the film and make you 'feel' it, and in that regard this film is very much a success.Great acting, great plot, overall excellent movie that is getting a much lower rating than it deserves.",8,0,0,28 September 2019
The Conjuring," Best scary movie in recent history
","No spoilers here, I only write spoilers for trash movies so you know what you're 'missing'; aka nothing.Excellent suspense, excellent 'scary' moments (very few 'pop out' scares and the ones they use are well done; innovative). Almost zero blood and guts in the movie, which I think it just fantastic, using gore to 'scare' people is tired, overdone, and overrated.If you like scary movies, and haven't seen this one; see it. Sadly, the 2nd isn't as good; still an enjoyable scary movies, and well done, but it doesn't have the same feel and scary ambience of the first.",9,1,2,27 September 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," Very little scare, but very enjoyable.
","Are you an Evil Dead fan? Specifically the movies? This is a love letter to those movies, there are even some scenes that use Raimi's camera techniques to *really* drive that point home.There is no 'Ash' character, but the spirit of the movies is here. Plus some great direction and writing from Joss Whedon.",8,2,4,27 September 2019
