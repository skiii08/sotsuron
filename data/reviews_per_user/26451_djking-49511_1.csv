Blade Runner 2049," waste of time don't wate your time
","I saw the original in the theater and on VHS/ DVD a few times over the years. Blade Runner 2049 is a boring movie that i hoped would get better. it was complete waste of my life and wish I had the 2 and half hours back. The movie never got better, it had no plot, the acting was horrible. I don't usually take the time to write reviews on anything but this movie sucked so bad that i felt compelled to go against all the great reviews this movie received. There are only two ways which i think this can be rated so high, first if the people watching it were on drugs, stoned, or drunk. There might be enough with the music and visual effects to make someone have a surreal moment of this movie being worth watching. The other way there is a way for this movie to considered good is if you are looking to see is a possible future of the world, there are good visual effects, a potential of how the world might turn out and the idea of AI becoming part of society and then gaining a conscience. This is worth 15 minutes of, wow that is cool or would be interesting but after 2 and half hours of this, it even gets ruined and is boring. There was potential for this to be a great movie but like too many movie productions it gets too artistic with no substance. I will never re-watch this movie and if there is another chapter in this movie I will never watch it, I am done with Blade Runner forever.",1,17,33,18 February 2018
