Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," See it twice! (at least)
","I saw The phantom menace, and was quite disappointed. Nothing quite 'gel'ed', and a lot of stuff just flew by without any meaning what so ever..... I gave it another chance, reluctantly, but now I'll give it an 8! Not as good as Empire, but way ahead of Return of the Jedi. So see it twice, if you didn't like it the first time!Ok?!Tm",Null,0,0,17 September 1999
