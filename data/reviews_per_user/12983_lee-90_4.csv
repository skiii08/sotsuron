Catch Me If You Can," The best of 2002
","This is one of the best, non-stop entertaining and deepfully touching movie of this year. Everything that's on screen is just a gem (the lines spoken, the acting, the soundtrack, the editing, the scenes) perfect in every way!! a 10!",10,0,1,14 March 2003
Minority Report," Very Spielberg Indeed
","Spielberg is really good in reflecting human charms and nuances, and he did it remarkably well in this film. But seriously, in capturing the whole movie form, there r no scene stealers here, no classic scenes (such as the ty-Rex roar in the end of Jurrassic Park, The sinking boat in JAWS). There r, of coz great special effects done, very effectively and subjectively conversationalble. I like those scenes, reflecting human classes, their culture, reaction to future tech. and manners towards life, those r very well made.Eventhough i truly like the ending (in term of story wise, eventhough predictable but very well told), i didnt like the way it was ended, by capturing the house, moving backward, outside of house and background near the seaside. i felt empty, there is something sooooo wrong with that kind of ending! anw, a very good work from 1 of my fav director!",9,0,0,7 July 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," MUST SEE FOR ALL!!
","IT's all about the story, im always into how people tell the story. And this one gets to me. Though Phantom Menace didnt have a good one, this 2nd episode has created the 'missing link' tighter between the episodes of 5-7 and 1. So i dont blame George Lucas on episode 1 as it must as it is 'happened to be that way' thus bringing up more power in characterization and depth in the telling the EPIC story. What people didnt get it is, this is what it's supposed to be. But what i felt, Mr. Lucas did remarkably well was the scene of Yoda (all of it), as it brings higher level of wat people r gonna see Yoda (in his character) on Empire and Return of the Jedi and the conspiracy scenes. As classical and powerful as GODFATHER's revelations. Everybody did a great job, even the extras, tech and all (but im still waiting for John William to deliver a KILLER score as unforgettable as episode 1,4,5,6). This might be the best SW ever (but personally, im more into Empire Strikes back), and definately not dissapointing. Sheer movie power at its best.",10,0,0,15 May 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Dissapointing Mindling
","It's a dissapointment that the Oscar voters picked this as Best Picture, a film as ponderous as Crowe's burly physique. Because just about the only light moments in the story occur when his schizophrenic condition is used to draw laughs. So, if twisted logic is applied here, the sense of humour John Nash (Russell Crowe) is portrayed to possess is probably also delusional.Ron Howard as Best Director for this? You just wonder why. He has not bothered to flesh out the real supporting characters other than Nash's wife (played by Jennifer Connelly, with more insightful performances); it's a curious point that the three people who only exist in Nash's mind affect him more than the real ones. Lord of The Rings and Amelie should have a better chance (of winning Best Picture) as they have better characterisation of the roles and deeper meaning of structure. It's also weirdly remarkable that Crowe plays an older, beaten man more comfortably and believably than he does a sociopathic and arrogant young math genius (hah!) considering his real-life behaviour and attitude. 3 years ago, Crowe did an overall better job in The Insider.Kudos to the make-up artist who aged Crowe, and that's about. Sigh",Null,0,1,14 May 2002
