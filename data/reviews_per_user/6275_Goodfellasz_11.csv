Skyfall," 50 years of James Bond
","2012: Bond is back ... or not? Seeing this movie the first time I had high hopes for Skyfall. Me, being a huge bond-fan, hoped that this movie would be all about the action. However I should have known that director Mendes didn't want another Bond-movie, instead he wanted an Oscar-movie with a character named Bond. Does this mean that Skyfall failed: not at all. The strength of the movie is hidden in a little thing called nostalgia. Director Mendes is able to combine the action of the older (brosnan en Dalton) Bond-movies with the brains of modern action-dramas. Skyfall is a more realistic Bond-movie than Moonraker, Die another day or even From Russia with love could ever be. Nevertheless Skyfall has a greater Bond-sphere (i.e. Sean Connery sphere) than both Quantum of solace and Casino Royale. Bond-actor Daniel Craig is playing Bond for the third time and he is finally becoming one with his character. Despite the fact that his workout has undoubtedly had its results, it must be said that his aging hasn't gone very well. Nevertheless he once again given a splendid performance. Than comes Javier Bardem, the appearance of his character made me think of Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken in A view to a kill (1985) and just like Walken I expected him to be the better actor in this movie. Without wanting to spoil anything I can only say that the performance of Bardem immediately made me think of Heath Ledger (playing the Joker), with that little difference that Bardem failed in every way. Not only has he no credibility, also his manner of speaking is extremely annoying. As for Action and special effects: despite the fact that most action (other than the opening sequence which is pretty amazing) is rather limited, is must be said that that limited action has been brought both beautiful and realistic.In short Skyfall is a more realistic Bond movie, in which not the action of gadgets, but the story and its characters of most importance are. Despite the disappointing soundtrack you'll find Skyfall to be a very entertaining and bond-worthy movie.",8,1,4,29 December 2012
Alexander," Alexander revisited vs theatrical cut
","The first time I saw Alexander, I saw the theatrical cut. To be honest I have always been intrigued by the unique life of Alexander the great (I still believe that it is impossible to not have some kind of respect towards someone who conquered such a great part of the then-known world in only ten years) And having seen this theatrical cut I thought the movie was mediocre, watchable but not as good as brave heart or the Vietnam drama Platoon. Nevertheless I heard that the revisited version of this movie was much better and having seen this version now I must say don't waste your time with the theatrical cut, but go see the three and a half hour long version. Despite the fact that this version is without doubt of epic duration, the movie seems less long and boring than the original cut. I don't want to spoil anything but in this version Stone has also switched the order of some scenes which makes it easier to watch this movie without getting bored but which at some times can be confusing.However adding and reshaping the storyline doesn't turn this movie into a perfect picture. The flaws that were present in the theatrical cut remain in the revisited version however they seem to be less annoying. Colling Farell performs very well and in the extended version a more emotional dimension is being added to his character explaining some of his reactions that seemed somewhat strange in the original version. Val Kilmer gives one of his greatest performances, although he has not that much screen time. Anthony Hopkins seems to be less great in his role. Sadly enough Angelina Jolie still gives the worst acting performance in the history of mankind. Her forced accent sounds so terrible that one would mute the sound so he would no longer be tormented.Historical this movie is more or less accurate (Alexander was no blonde and some of the events mentioned may not be 100 percent accurate but overall this movie shows a rather true image of this man. There is much ado about the action scenes, there wouldn't be enough action in this movie and the action scenes would be too long. However this movie is no action movie and chooses to focus on the emotional side of Alexander.So don't waste your time with the theatrical cut, but go watch the revisited version.",9,2,4,12 April 2014
Fast & Furious 6," Brainless.... but so much fun
","This movie must be one of the most brainless movies I ever saw in cinemas, along with the expendables that is. However it was just so much fun.What makes the Fast and the Furious so great is without a doubt the incredible team that is behind this series. It must be said there isn't much of a story in this installment of the series. However after having seen five brainless fast and the furious movies one does not expect a strong storyline. The really lovely thing about this movie is that the viewer really can see how the actors actually must have had a great time shooting this film. As in the previous movie there is a great cooperation between Vin Diesel and The Rock, now teaming up in one of the greatest bad-ass end battles in movie history.But also the character of Roman gives an extremely witty feeling to this movie. As said it is not the immense stunts, the incredible special effects or the beautiful soundtrack that makes this movie, it is simply the great acting team behind this movie that makes it so entertaining.A must see for every fan of action, comedy and just pure entertainment.",8,5,8,1 February 2014
Watchmen," Underrated
","In my country this movie didn't last long in the cinemas, so the first time I saw this movie it was on DVD. I had been attracted to the story and after a first viewing I was blown away by the CGI, acting performances and the story. Personally I still believe that this movie remains underrated (even after five years there are only two graphic novel/comic book adaptations that are superior to this movie and these are sin city and the dark knight). Watchmen gives a raw perspective on the lives of different vigilantes. The mixture between the rather unknown actors (and not blockbuster actors) and the perfect CGI makes this movie so great. Add an incredible soundtrack to this mixture and you're in for one hell of a ride.Personally I have seen both the theatrical version as the director's cut and I have tried to watch the ultimate cut. It must be said that the first two versions are very good to near perfect (especially the director's cut adds some very beautiful scenes to the movie). If you're watching this movie for the first time though it might be better to watch the theatrical cut because most people don't like three hour movies. Personally I prefer the director's cut, but that's only because I'm a huge fan of the movie and prefer a longer version of the story. The ultimate cut though is not for everyone, I have tried to watch this version but had to stop. This version adds the story 'Tales of the Black Freightner' and because this story is an animation 'movie' every scene that is added from this picture forms a kind of a fracture with the main (watchmen) storyline. I think that the ultimate cut is only for the real die hard fans of watchmen (and especially of the graphic novel).Overall I think that Watchmen should be seen by everyone because it's one of the few successful hero-stories that doesn't show a hope-giving picture of these men and women but that tells a real dramatical series of events.",9,2,4,13 April 2014
Man of Steel," This is madness
","When I heard that Zack Snyder was going to do a film on superman the first thought that came to me was; wauw. Being a huge fan of Watchmen (that still remains one of the most underrated movies ever), I had high hopes for this movie. However coming out of the theaters I didn't really know what to think of it.Let's start by saying that choosing Snyder as a director was a good choice, the man had proved that he is familiar with the world of comics and graphic novels, combine this man with David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan and you should get one of the greatest comic adaptations ever. However why didn't it feel like that? The answer is quite simple, despite the fact that I love this movie, it is just to dark. Superman is contrary to batman not a symbol of darkness, revenge and bitterness. The man of steel represents hope and showing hope in a dark and destructive movie like this is just not possible. And I think that's why most people say this movie isn't that good, well that and the enormous amounts of destruction that is at display. However if you can get over this darkness and over the destruction, then you must admit that this is a really enjoyable, highly-entertaining and actually very good movie. The casting is simply put perfect, Fishburne plays a very realistic Perry White, Costner and Crowe each perform tremendously the role of loving father (although it's quite funny that superman has in this movie two robin hood fathers). However the real star of this movie is Shannon playing Zod. In short if you expect to see a superman comic than you shouldn't go watch this, because well it isn't. If you however desire to see a bad-ass movie that is highly entertaining and happens to have superman in it, then you really should just go and watch this.",9,1,3,19 January 2014
Quantum of Solace," underrated bond film
","This very entertaining sequel to the popular Casino Royale has received a lot of critique and it must be said that this critique is not deserved.QOS can be seen as a direct sequel to casino royale. And this is probable one of the reasons that this movie has been received rather negatively. Casino royale was a near perfect film while QOS is one of the better bond films (but not films in general). After CR the expectations have been to high for this rather small sequel. Nevertheless QOS is an entertaining movie with a mediocre to good villain. The editing of the movie has a rather quick pace, this together with some of the action scenes make the movie a rather Jason Bourne - James bond cross-over. If you can look past this fact you'll find the story to be quite good. More important the action scenes feel more bond than some of the scenes in CR. This together with some subtle references to previous bond movies (Dr. No, goldfinger and The spy who loved me) mixed with the incredible soundtrack of David arnold make this a worthy successor to CR and a great Bond movie.",10,1,10,18 April 2014
The Dark Knight," let's put a smile on that face
","wow, some time ago I saw the dark knight and all I can say is :wow.the film started as a crime film and ended as a real dramatic story. the joker is the only 'bad guy' I like in the batman series and Heath ledger preformed an amazing enemy.The story of Two-Face was dramatic and sad, 10 times better than Jones (Batman forever)BAtman himself was probably the best of all. my favourite scene : every scene with the joker.only one disappointment : the film was to short.Yesterday I red that the sequel would contain the Riddler (good choice) and the Pinguin (afwul choice)All I can say is : hopefully the writers erase the Pinguin and replace him by another enemy.",10,8,18,1 August 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," goodfellas meets Casino
","Let's start by saying that this movie isn't for everyone. Like usual in Scorsese's movies, this film is also filled with explicit scenes, explicit language and explicit everything, however the tremendous difference between this movie and most other explicit movies is that the wolf of wall street is not just a movie, but a piece of art.Starting with the first scene I had an instant flashback to Casino, in which Scorsese also used the unique narrator-technique throughout the movie. Ironically Casino also had a hard time when it first came out in theaters, because just like TWOWS people were shocked by the explicit language and the amount of violence used in the movie. And yet nowadays Casino is seen a one of the greatest movies in the oeuvre of Scorsese. And I think this is also a bit the problem with this movie. Most people are surprised by how the movie is filmed and by the many nude scenes because of the fact that most people expect to see a biographical crime drama. But just like many of Scorsese's films this movie is a mere reflection of today's society and moreover it is a direct attack to the how Wall Street abused the people and money they had and how this lead to the many crisis the world is face with today. And this is were the protagonist of The Wolf of Wall Street meets the characters from Goodfellas and Casino. Like them Dicaprio's character doesn't want to be saved, he doesn't want to be a good guy. In fact he even chooses to remain bad when he is offered a deal to avoid jail time. And that is were TWOWS encounters Henry Hill (from Goodfellas. Hill also didn't want to be a hero, he wanted to be a wise guy, but in the end he had to cooperate with the FBI, just like in this movie. And this is why I believe this movie is without doubt a Goodfellas-Casino mix without any of the weaker point these movies had.Overall this movie is definitely Oscar-material. Like usual it starts with the cutting and editing. Only one director in Hollywood has been so obsessed with the editing of his movies. Like Raging Bull The wolf of wall street has a number of scenes were the editing is just phenomenal. Also the soundtrack is once again perfectly chosen, Scorsese knows where to put certain songs and places for instance the happy song ça plaine pour moi in the dramatic rescue scene. And this is only one of the many examples. And then there is the acting, Leonardo Dicaprio performs at his best. This movie is once again an example of just how big an actor he is. But it must be said he is accompanied by none other than Jonah Hill, which was I must say an extremely dangerous choice as Jonah is not the star actor Leonardo is. Nonetheless Hill gives here a performance that will literally blow you away. And last but not least there is the directing. It is funny how even now no one asks himself is the new Scorsese good are bad? Instead you just ask yourself how good is he, because well, he doesn't make bad movies.In conclusion it can be said that this movie is without doubt not for everyone, but it cannot be argued that this movie will without doubt be one of the greatest movies released in 2014.",10,5,14,19 January 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Bane Rises
","At first I couldn't wait until this film got out in theaters. I had seen every film of nolan and seeing that they keep getting better, I expected The Dark Knight rises to be his magnum opus. But I should have known better: how could someone, even a Christopher Nolan, outdo the Dark Knight.Watching the movie I was blown away by the opening scene. For the second time Nolan has found an extraordinary and brilliant way the introduce the main villain Bane. And it must be said, Tom Hardy is as wicked and genius as Heath Ledger was. After having seen this movie multiple times I'm still amazed with what Hardy does with his face. Although he has besides his eyes no other facial means to express himself, he uses these eyes in a magnificent way.As I was saying the opening scene and Bane in general is without doubt the greatest thing there is to mention concerning this movie. Because despite the fact that The Dark Knight Rises starts huge, the film quickly changes into a fantasy film that doesn't manage to keep up with its predecessors. It is painful to see just how many plot holes this movie has.Why than the high rating? Simpley put: despite everything the last batman movie is still pretty amazing. As said is Tom Hardy his performance Oscar worthy, don't let yourself be fooled by the negative comments of his voice, the voice AND the accents are a perfect fit. Of course there is also the astonishing music score, I don't think there is any movie who has a more entertaining score than this trilogy. And at last you can't neglect the special effects which were once more pure art. In short Nolan knows one more just how to combine the unrealistic Bane with the realistic character Bruce Wayne has become. Despite the fact that the movie loses its pace in the second part, the movie still has a better pace than most modern action movies.",9,1,5,29 December 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," This gives a new definition to the word brainless
","I am a huge fan of Michael Bay movies and I must admit the first two Transformer movies were actually quite good and entertaining. The First Transformers was a action-packed, funny and good written movie. The Second installment was somewhat a put down, but nevertheless watchable.But what has happened to this third installment. The acting is horrifying, the writing is crap and the special effects may be the only good thing in this movie.Where the humor in the first two movies was well placed and actually a contribution to the movies, the humor in this part is just bad.As for the story, it must be said there is just no story. People keep complaining how Man of Steel is just a brainless action movie with no story, but it must be said, transformers dark of the moon has even less story in it.Like I said the only good thing in the movie may be the special effects and CGI, however watching this movie one gets the feeling that he is in a computer game and not even a good one. More than half of the movie is just pure computer added effects, making you wonder if Bay should even have taking the effort to film any actual scenes.If you are a fan of brainless action and just want to sit down in your seat after a hard day of work, watching the Apocalypse with some weird humor than you should really go and watch this movie. If you are not looking for this then I would suggest to just skip this movie and go watch another Michael Bay movie.",2,4,9,1 February 2014
The Great Gatsby," unique and beautiful but not for everyone
","Let me start by saying I have never read the book and never saw the movie with Redford. Also ever since Romeo + Julia I have been avoiding every Baz Luhrman movie. The way he destroyed that story still give me the creeps. However I heard that this movie was quite good, so I decided to watch it after all and I must say I was surprised by how good it really is.The beginning of the movie makes you remember Moulin Rouge, placed in a more or less fairy tale setting this movie has nevertheless a very dark and dramatic tone mixed up with a romantic story. Tobey Maguire and Leonardo Dicaprio do a good job, but it is Joel Edgerton that steels the show. In an unbelievable way he transforms himself in a very energetic antagonist that just gives you the chills.The Soundtrack is amazing, I was surprised about the mixture of the modern soundtrack and the old setting (beginning of the 20th century). Personally I thought it was a vivid and energetic mixture that makes the movie even better.After having seen the movie I didn't understand how so many people could hate this picture, the movie is definitely not for everyone but nevertheless it's a must see for everyone who likes a real dramatic love story.",8,3,5,15 April 2014
