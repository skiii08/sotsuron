Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates by numbers
","This film was made on autopilot. It gives nothing new. Depp and Rush simply cruise through the movie. It is like they are on autopilot. They play the characters with consummate ease. McShane steals the show in all his scenes.Penelope Cruz - well I have no idea what she brings to the table - except maybe eye candy. Her acting is more wooden than the hull of the pearl!The priest / bible basher character, well he is another pointless character.Basically the film lacks something without bloom and knightley.There is still plenty to come from the franchise, but the current direction is a dead end.",4,0,0,1 February 2012
Law Abiding Citizen," Surely the real villain got away with it!!
","This film explores the hypocrisy of the US judicial system, by letting free a confessed murderer and rapist it explores a means lone quest to right the wrongs in his life.It is a tense thriller with more than a little gore. Unfortunately the film does not have the bravery to follow its premise to the end.It casts Jamie Foxx as the 'hero' of the film, when in actual fact all of his deeds are to allow his career to progress, regardless of the victims.The film tries hard to portray Foxx as the victim throughout, but it doesn't wash, when he never actually suffers any great hardship - other than missing his daughters cello recitals!By the end of the film, you are looking for some kind of atonement from Foxx, however right at the end, he himself becomes a murderer.For me this morality tail has missed the point somewhat. Ultimately to succeed is to have to no regard at all for the rule of law - even the mayor is advocating abusing civil rights!!",4,3,3,10 August 2010
