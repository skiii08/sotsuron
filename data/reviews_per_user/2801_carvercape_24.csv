Mission: Impossible III," Impossible to watch
","Boring, predictive and utterly obnoxious.I actually like first two parts despite all the ridiculousness because they had something in abundance that third one does not: FUN FACTOR!This one strives to be taken more seriously. Why? That is not needed. They tried that with last two 007 Bond movies and look how terrible those turned out.I must say screenplay is horrid and editing is done badly as far technical aspects are concerned. Overall acting performance is confined to stupid screenplay and feels two dimensional, so i will not judge them after that. We know all actors involved proved they can do better.Ending is one of the stupidest of all out there.",1,2,6,20 August 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Saga finished before it started.
","Unfortunate this all is.I mean there is no excuse for this movie being made so stupid. Episodes IV to VI gave it's author so much potential to make not only great prequels but to make them epic. Instead they seem more septic. Many reviews went into details why is this bad for Star Wars being fan or not so I want repeat it here.Only one scene is worth to be called Star Wars and that is Jedi duel at the near end of movie and transformation to Vader at end of Episode III. Rest is Lucas going merchandise frenzy.Biggest problem of this movie is not Jar Jar, no, it is lack of soul, lack of any substance any fabric or emotion. Something that made Episodes IV,V and VI so widely loved throughout the planet.Real shame for Skywalkers around the globe.",3,1,2,25 June 2011
Sucker Punch," Sucker punch it is, for audience!
","This one is bit hard to review.On one hand there is ton of great visuals which deserves special grade all by themselves. On other side is story which is unexploited enough and far from being original.This movie is something between Moulin Rouge! and Sin City. Unlike two of them Sucker Punch fails to deliver the drama. And it is a bad mix I'm afraid. Acting is not good, especially by leading actress which messes some better performance of supporting cast. While watching you wish there were something more than just great visuals. And I do not think that was a goal by director.Story and screenplay: 2/10 Visuals: 8/10",2,4,12,24 June 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Inglouriously overrated
","Biggest problem Tarantino is facing before making any movie, is that he made his best two movies at the beginning of his carrier as director. Those are Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.Almost every movie he made after that are good, but no where near as two mentioned above.But this movie is simply ridiculous. Even Kill Bill makes more sense than this alternate look on history. Such a high rating on IMDb is not deserved at all. So many things in this movie treat audience as dumb ass. Apart the first scene with Mr. Waltz everything else is just plain crap. If you wanted to present alternate look on history that is all fine but do it without so many inconsistencies (like only two guards in front of a theater)A shame on Tarantino to allow to many mistakes in his creation.",3,10,16,7 May 2011
Iron Man 2," Useless piece of bad movie making
","Iron man 1 was much better, although bad enough for itself. No thrills, but barely watchable blockbuster, even enjoyable sometimes, as you have to satisfy with that these days.But this is totally useless sequel. Action is little and even those end quickly. Some are even unexploited enough like one in Monaco. Stark's main competitor is terrible to say the least. For the one bad ass weapon maker he is totally childish. Gwyneth is again total waste of movie tape in this movie and many other supporting roles. Director should have concentrated more on the relation between Ivan and Stark and should added more interaction between them for further story development. That would present much better watching experience.Do not waste time watching this piece of bad movie making.",2,1,4,19 September 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," No magic again
","I watched 1st Harry Potter movie and first half of second. I thought here this one may redeem all others parts equally boring because nothing is happening really. That is biggest problem with all Harry Potter movies - nothing is happening.But no unfortunately that is not the case, not even now. 90 percent of time this movie wastes on close up shot of Harry and his friends just looking around!If this is introduction to climatic end battle between Voldemort and Harry I lost complete interest in watching that. Again Harry displays even more emotional dilemmas like a girl. That might be OK in previous parts but hey; Harry you know your mortal enemy is upon you. Say what do you think you finally start acting like some bad ass wizard? No huh?Boring to the bone. I bet 2nd part is like this pretty much to the end?",1,4,4,25 August 2011
City of God," What a ride this movie is!
","If there were no music cues and blending frames you'll be wondering if this is a movie you are watching. Camera and framing are quite explicit as you are one of the actors and that is quite compelling considering the plot and story. Photography is superb and fits the movie like a glove. Acting is beyond par and at the more than few moments it will feel so real you will be at the edge of your seat. I will not reveal any of the story as this movie is a rare breed, fast paced, action packed to the maximum. And do expect lot of gory scenes because this is not for a faint hearted part of audience. If you consider yourself a true fan of movie art, than this one is a must see. Superb and simply brilliant from the start till the very end.",10,0,2,24 October 2010
Cars 2," Clichéd
","Never thought I am going to say this for one of Pixar's movies but this one is totally cliché and predictable.And absence of clichés is why we like Pixar movies in first place. You did not know what to expect around the corner. Excitement was all over the place.But not this time. Artistically it is golden as any other but story wise it failed miserably. This story has been seen countless times in so many movies and cartoons.Real shame for mighty Pixar, beacon of hope for designers and story tellers around the globe. Hope this one will be last bad one they made.",3,1,4,16 October 2011
Transformers," Movie than can transform you into stupid
","IMDb should make special Michael Bay/Uve Boll section on their site as home of worst made big budget movies.Anyway loved cartoon as child. Any episode of animated series is better than this piece of whatever it is. Let see what is good here: robots and transformations, comedy lines (which are better executed by robots than real actors BTW) CGI robots. Now what is wrong with it: Michael Bay, Shia LaBeouf, Anthony Anderson (if hackers were like this in real life we would not need any firewalls ever), screenplay, dialogs, acting, casting all of it, on screen interaction entire time...It is, well, bad beyond description. I can not believe it got 7 star grade on IMDb. I am guessing studio payed some dozen people to do that or audience is really getting more dumb and dumber (even that is better movie than this)Do avoid or it will be I told you so.",1,1,6,3 April 2011
Clash of the Titans," Epic disaster
","This movie is disaster of epic proportions, right from beginning all the way to the end. Acting is awful, screenplay is horrid, editing and directing is as director wanted to make 5 minute movie but was forced to extend them to 1hr and plus. Maybe if it lasted only 5min it would be better. So many scenes seem out of place. Soundtrack is dull and uninspired. CGI effects even those seem cheap in comparison to 1981 version. Such a great story with such a potential for great blockbuster and wasted for no good reason. If Zeus was for real he would fry entire movie crew with lightning.How movie got even 6 stars is beyond me.Compared to original from 1981, well the old one is far better movie.I just saw they are planing another failure for 2012 Clash of Titans 2. Please do not film yet another disaster.",1,4,6,9 July 2010
Into the Wild," Supertramp is SUPERGREAT
","I am still settling it in. Maybe not the best time for review but for movies great like this any time is proper.Where to begin at all? Acting is, oh gasp, magnificent, better than any I've seen before. Directing, editing, photography, soundtrack - that is all stellar. Technically it is perfect gem.Good movies are either liked or not. Great movies are liked as whole or each find something to remember it by. This is GREAT movie. Every possible thing here is brought to the perfection. This celluloid creation managed to cover so many different subjects and themes it will take some time and few more watching to absorb it all. And I do mean to cover them. This movie defies all bad things you have been learned about life in such a manner it is force that drives deep and runs deep.It is very hard to describe why this movie is one of best ever made without making spoilers so I'll just say:JUST GO, WATCH IT NOW!I have to express my BIG THANK YOU for all involved into making this movie, as it is made with such a care for detail that is rarely witnessed today.",10,0,1,20 September 2011
Super 8," Super disappointing
","After initial trailer was released one would think hey finally something smart. My immediate impression was that it is going to be something mysterious, some unknown force or experiment went south and group of teens in the middle of it. Remember Goonies? Well, trust me, skip Super 8 and go watch Goonies, it is much better.Oh but how misleading trailers are. For anything to happen it will pass well over half an hour. Than, after realizing what it is all about you spend rest of movie watching just to see 'main event' and be done with it. Rest of movie is boring, poorly edited, nothing is in focus, and all is left hanging loose.One of worst blockbuster experiences in a while.",2,9,18,19 June 2011
Rio," Really sambastic and beautiful
",I watched this on hot summer day and it felt just perfect. Colors and renderings are beautiful and real treat for eye.Story and screenplay are solid. Voice acting is superb. Music choice is more than well made. I must say I am glad to see really engaging movie from Blue Sky studios they failed to made since Ice Age 1. It really lift your spirit up. All characters are lovable and I recommend it for group watching as it is lot of fun. Each scene was masterly lighted and colored and great atmosphere was achieved for each scene. Have fun watching it. I just can not write anything else to avoid spoilers so just to fill 10 lines minimum :),9,0,0,9 July 2011
Groundhog Day," Will charm you
","They do not make movies like this in Hollywood any more. Maybe they do but they are not exporting them any more. Real shame. This is one of the best acting jobs by endlessly charming Bill Murray. I just want to use this review to recommend this movie to younger generations which are driven too much toward likes of Matrix and comic book heroes, movies which quality is more judged by their visuals instead of some good message at the end.Best part is it does not matter will you watch it in hd or not. For best movies it never is.Go en light yourself.",10,3,6,22 August 2011
Thor," Hammering it right
","Ah finally after so many awful comic book movies something worthy of X-Men 1 and 2.It is good, this one. Great cast, direction, acting and screenplay. All is placed where it belongs. It is all about hero, as it should have been with almost all other superhero movies made before. Good humor is present and it will make you laugh quite a few times.But be careful with the sequel, because the only thing that tint this movie bad is love relationship, which is again being portrayed without any substance that will provide some feedback from the audience, it is flat and uninteresting. If you could keep it simple please. People like this one because it is all action and no love crap like Spiderman.Good job!",9,1,3,7 May 2011
Hancock," Would be good B-movie
","Well now I think someone should stop giving money that let's Will Smith make any movie he damn pleases.It was OK for Bad Boys, that ain't so bad action flick, Independence day we survived somehow but with consequences worse than alien in a movie put up with. But this?! What in the name is this all about?! Why did anyone gave money for this to be made? It is supposed to bring sort of fresh look at superhero movies. Maybe on a paper it all makes sense but choosing Will as main actor, that is where things went wrong. Heck Will acts same in every movie. That separates good actors from bad ones in a first place. If you wish to explore new concept in a movie you have to bring in actor that can carry that concept damn excellent, otherwise it will just ruin it like in this movie.To be fair Will is not only thing wrong here. Jason Bateman is also so irritating beyond description.Only thing fairly good are CGI effects.Rest is utter crap.",1,8,13,15 April 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Somewhere in the Middle
","Enough time has passed since this movie premiered. By now it made it's producers happy and still is by making money out of merchandise and what not else.As far as movie itself is concerned, only one thing matters. How will it stand the test of time. This is climatic final chapter how Sith become to rule the galaxy again, and more importantly how our hero Anakin become anti hero Vader. If there was ever a chance for Lucas to make things right again this was it. So how does this one stands, both, on it's own as a movie and as part of 6 episodes.Maybe luckily for fans, to this episode belongs one task that previous episodes did not have to full fill, and that is teeing it all together with episodes 4, 5, and 6. I said luckily as that forced Lucas to pay more attention to the story and episodes he filmed first, something he forgot in episodes 1 and 2 that allowed him to ignore them.Still weakest link here is acting by soon to be Vader. Even Natalie, which proved her acting qualities, fails faced with stupid dialog. I think this proves that Hollywood is desperate for one good dialog editor, someone whose vocabulary extends beyond TV commercials. Other did a fair job of acting with what was offered. Not surprisingly, best acting is done by Emperor, as given best material to work with.And how about imagination, you know that core star wars quality? What producers fail to see, intentionally or not, is that old movies are more loved than new ones for one very simple, yet essential reason, and star wars provide perfect example. When Lucas filmed New Hope he was fighting to make his vision believable. As said, he was very frustrated because he could not get 50 percent of what he wanted. In that, for him, painful process he achieved something great he may not intended. He left audiences imagination fill the gaps he could not. And that made Star Wars even better even more believable.Here on the other hand with army of effects producers to back him up nothing is left to accident. And that is what this movie needs. Some randomness, to make you wonder, to spice things up. But no, everything is super clean and super perfect and that is why it ultimately fails as a movie.Yet despite all that there are great highlights. Final duel between Obi Wan and Anakin, attack on Jedi temple, Yoda vs. Sidious, Vader transformation...So, finally at the end, this one falls in the middle between perfection driven Lucas and not so 'perfect' old episodes loved by true fans. Neither are happy with it, so each should grab a scene he loves and ignore the rest. This movie and episodes 1 and 2 are filmed in such a manner you can simply ignore half of it if you wish, but for better or for worse is individual opinion.",3,1,3,7 September 2011
Inception," Scorsese should have direct this
","No really, it would be far better. Anyone who saw Shutter Island know that.Instead we got mix of Matrix and attempt to bring elaborate drama to story. Nolan does tries but not his best, he did not kick it here good enough. And we now he can, there are other examples of that (Prestige, Dark Knight). Thing here it seems he could not decide to pursue drama that is private to De Caprio or to pursue more intensely action and dream sequences making it more of an action flick.Concept, although interesting, was sluggish in execution. More than few times movie feels lost, and that is something you should avoid in movies of this genre (psycho thriller).It is like Nolan did not know how to wrap it all up. He did at the end but not in very interesting way.I would gave this movie 5 star but Leonardo performance is exceptional so there goes one extra star.",6,2,3,5 April 2011
The Shawshank Redemption," Just to add another...
","..voice of total respect for this movie.Everything is absolutely fantastic in this master piece. Casting, acting, photography, music, sounds, feel, atmosphere, screenplay, all that is beyond good, it is perfect. Whole movie is immersed in such a delight it really helps if you are feeling down to lift you up. And that is what movies should be all about. Not about damn effects and 3d. As many said before it really lift your spirits up. It gives such a profound feel of hope and happiness, and beyond. And there is another great value of this movie. It proves that sometimes in this lifetime Hollywood is capable to create master piece. It is one but that one speaks for thousands of those we do not get to see. No effects, no damn computer graphics, no faster then light action scenes, and yet after watching it you feel million times better than any other movie.It deserves 11 stars.",10,1,1,17 November 2010
Centurion," Lacks better second half
","I've stopped searching for truth in movies depicting history events long time ago, as none is faithful to it. Well at least one we learned in schools.But this one starts pretty well. It is very gory as that was the case in Roman empire era and later. Violent and bloody, it will satisfy those who like reality in this type of scenes. Photography is great to that extent you can actually feel that famous British cold, wet and rainy weather. Movie is fine in technical aspect and direction is good. Soundtrack is satisfactory as well is acting.But story is what is in question here. First half starts really good and get you interested. You are being introduced to two factions in war and some of it's leading characters. And it is all fine until entire Roman legion got smashed in one scene and only handful is left behind. And they went to rescue their commander who got captured and enslaved. Movie is all good until this point.Problem is that what stated as band of Romans drama turned down to one of them becoming rogue, as being betrayed by his own people, and falling in love with one native woman. Along the way rest of his mates got killed in action or otherwise. From all possible outcomes that one was least interesting and too cliché. A real pity as this could have been much better piece of work.",6,4,7,29 August 2010
X-Men: First Class," First class not quite
","With so many characters and subjects it was probably hell for screenwriter to decide what to include in this part of X-Men. And plus to satisfy comic book fans and those who are not.In general prequels should be banned from movie making. It spoils all good things about sequels.I love X-Men 1 and 2 so having Bryan Singer involved here is only thing that made me watch this movie. But 2 things are starting to get in a way to make these movies better.First is 2nd world war and Cold war inspiration for a plot. Second is unpleasantly weak acting job by James McAvoy. Reason is for such a great mentor he is suppose to be hi is very unconvincing. Remember he is training people with amazing, often lethal powers. He lacks presence authority you can feel. In contrast to that Patric Stewart performed this part perfectly. And as main actor here that is why this movie failed despite the all good things about it. Michael Fassbender is one that did best acting here.All else is good action, effects, even screenplay is surprisingly interesting for Hollywood standards these days. And potential is there. Will see if next one is going to be better as this one feels in no way connected to sequels.",5,3,6,30 September 2011
Fast Five," Furios I am how bad this movie is
","I must ask was Vin Diesel on some kind of drugs while he was filming this? Seriously, every time he appeared on screen he looked like he could use a nap. Maybe he realized how bad this is and did not want to give an effort.I enjoyed 1 and 2nd FnF and did not watch rest of them except this last one.Except for few funny scenes and Dwayne Johnson rest is plain crap. Nothing is consistent. Pretty much like Transformers 3. You simply jump from one scene in no particular order and that is annoyance.Supporting cast is completely obnoxious and that was not easy to achieve.Don't bother to watch as I can not with describing how bad it is any longer.",3,0,1,22 August 2011
Moon," It is Sci but less Fi
","It is a bit offensive for this movie to be labeled just as Sci-Fi.With it's dark tint which rises as you move toward end, especially when you realize what it is about. You do get hint at but kind of hope it is not true. It is much much more than just Sci Fi. This movie is one heavy dark promising single men drama despite somewhat bright end. Film carries though message to digest to the viewer and will make you question lot of things, because it is very much possible for something like this to become reality one day.Sam did absolute amazing act job here. Choosing Kevin Spacey as voice over for computer is just extra bonus. Score is epic in a way it accompanies film and set just the right tone to the audience.This is dark and horrific, but really good movie.",9,1,7,15 April 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Stupidity got another definition
",I really think lawmakers ought to invent death sentence for people like Michael Bay as he deserves one now. I can not begin to describe how bad this is. Bay has pushed the bar for 'how bad something can be made'.I honestly did not believe it can get any worse from previous Transformers movie but Bay proved me wrong.Michael Bay redefines infinity of human stupidity with this... i want even call it a movie.Absolutely every single moment in this abomination is horror to watch. Damn the producers for financing this.Do not dare to watch! You will loose some gray cells after this.-10,1,19,45,30 June 2011
