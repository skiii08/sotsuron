The Blair Witch Project," Unique and an acquired taste, like exotic food
","Negative comments about this film interest me, amuse me.  In most of them the errors are blatant, their diet of large budgets and pyrotechnic technology clearly shows, even when they steadfastly deny that influence. I find myself wondering what books they've read, in their past, where they garnered their sense of theme and character and plot regarding fiction in any medium. TBWP is a ground breaker on so many levels it's difficult to watch the film fairly if you are an informed viewer.  'Scary as Hell' means many things depending on your trip from then to now. Yes, it is scary, it is terrifying, if you can shred your way through the current standards of 'horror' and film making. This isn't our usual drummer. This is a gut raw excursion into a piece of our collective psyche some of us have glibly missed as we moved from kid to adult. This movie may pass and be damn near absent from video shelves in a few years but I'll bet it will hold its timeless spell, that, like 'Night of the Living Dead', most video stores will keep a copy or two because the movie has tapped something that might be difficult for words to keep but lingers in those secret and dark niches of ourselves. One mistake in the whole phenomena is the hype seemed to pitch a movie over 'there', when the film was quite seriously anchored right 'here'. That, I think, was simply a marketing move. When people ask me if I've seen it, I say 'yes, twice so far'.  When they ask me if I recommend it I tell them I have embraced it in the 'top 5' of my horror film closet but that I don't recommend it to anyone because there is nothing to compare it to.  There's no way to prep a first time viewer of the film. I think those having to decide how to market the film faced the same dilemma. Horror, languishing and withering in our full speed ahead culture, has snagged an unseen claw in the fabric of our times and gained a foothold. How history regards Blair Witch is up for grabs, but Hollywood, media, consumers and our culture will adjust their trajectory because of an obscure film made on a laughable budget that reminds us the first tale ever spun around a campfire was undoubtably a ghost story. We have reached the beginning of the end of the color splashed, audibly thunderous and visually garrish 'BOO!'. We happily swap it for a precisely and perfectly timed ' ... boo...' Some may miss the point, find it benign rather that frightening, wrestle over the first person, real time excursion and cast its 'less is more' philosophy against the current 'everything isn't enough' cinematic appetites. But I find much solace knowing that this tiny film has settled itself into movie history, already a truth, alredy becoming an influence. Horror has turned a long overdue corner. Neat! How often is something to fear such a cause to smile.",Null,1,2,15 August 1999
Unbreakable," Here we go...
","With 950 comments on this film already, I almost didn't add another one because I am writing this after seeing 'Signs', M. Night Shyamalan's third movie.  But reflecting on this man's row he is hoeing, I had to come back and do this before leaving a comment on 'Signs'.  Try to imagine yourself as a new film maker, look at the stars, the directors,the money, how in the world do you compete?  How do you break through that wall?  Just like he did in 'The Sixth Sense', remembering the heart of what is being done; 'It's about the story'.  It is story, period.  Shyamalan tells a story, spins a yarn.  Big storys, huge yarns, become dependent on big things to propel them.  But real stories have always reigned or failed on a single point; the telling.  It isn't what's told, but how it's told.  The plot of 'Unbreakable' can be contained in a single sentence and has been throughout these 950 reviews.  But if we start trying to tell how the story is told it gets bigger and messier and confusing and, well ... the easiest way to tell this tale is to make a movie.  'The Sixth Sense' announced a gifted and powerful envisionist.  We didn't see him coming.  Now that he's here we want him to jolt us the way he did in his first film, with every film he makes in its wake.  That's not only impossible, it isn't desireable.  We want this guy to continue to tell us stories because of the way he tells them.   No, they aren't all going to be our favorite, that's impossible, too.  Some people can tell you a bedtime story and you'll be asleep in ten.  Other's can tell you the same bedtime story and you're not going to sleep a wink, not this night.  We have a new story teller among us.  He has told a story called 'Unbreakable'.  If you want loud, colors, special effects headed for the oscars, stars being stars instead of people, you might want to pass on this one and everything else Shyamalan makes.  But if you want to hear a story ... here we go.",Null,1,1,11 August 2002
Ice Age: The Meltdown," CGI carving a niche for itself ...
","CGI animation is entering its era of discovery. Cartoons are suddenly G, PG and PG-13. R's are coming. The screenplays are sophisticated enough to entertain children and adults (much like those oh so wonderful Bugs Bunny, Road Runner and Porky Pig cartoons - they weren't just for kids, kids ...). With few exceptions, the most imaginative and innovative tales worth telling are crawling out of graphic novels and animated features.Films based on video games seem to tank while animated features based on graphic novels (Over the Hedge - From Hell) seem to soar.CGI movies are already their own genre, just not officially recognized.There are no areas of the human experience these movies cannot touch, move and motivate. They have already created conditions where one can equate with a Mammoth, a turtle, a raccoon, a sloth, an opossum, bears, dodo birds ... just imagine a life form and it has been incorporated and on the very odd chance that it hasn't ... it will. 'Open Season' addresses a Redneck variety of possibilities.CGI films are an oncoming Juggernaut.This one fits comfortably and pleasantly in its place and doesn't mind being a launching pad.We are on the brink of a new era in visual entertainment.Catch an attitude and enjoy",8,0,1,6 January 2007
Snatch," Strange poetry
","A lot of people are going to like this film for a lot of different and overlapping reasons, which is a dandy recommendation for any film.  Then again, a lot of people are going to pass on it because it seems to deviate from storytelling, which it does.  This is entertainment, like at a carnival; every corner you turn is something different but when you get ready to leave you look back and see it was all one thing.  Dark comedy, tragedy, people you don't necessarily care about but become seriously curious about.  The poetry is in the way the story is told; it plays with time but it plays with time in an ironic and thematic way.  The poetry is in the story, poetry as old as storytelling because in a nutshell it is about a really bad deed getting what it deserves, the tale just veers and twists and dances on the way to justice.  The poetry is in the visuals, in scenes that follow the plot and in scenes that own themselves, like out takes.  I'm not a huge fan of Brad Pitt's though I think he's navigating that line between good and great, but in this film he gathered me up and made me his buddy.  I just sat down with him in this and liked his character the way I like an outcast cousin.  Guy Ritchie did good.  I've heard it said that if a film has three really good scenes, then it was a success.  This film has three great scenes of irony, three great scenes of melodrama, three great scenes of humor, three great visual scenes ... don't watch this film with expectations.  Just put on your seatbelt, settle back and enjoy a near miss with greatness.",Null,1,1,16 July 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One third of an epic masterpiece
","Even among the faithful (this was my generation's Harry Potter - and take no offence at that on either side, it's merely a reflection of generational popularity with no depth probing or cultural time logging) there are quibbles.  Personally, they make me tired.  The point in moving book to film is to capture a story's essence in cinema since prodigious detail is impossible.  This film has done that hands down.  Everyone seems to have attended the film with a critical eye intstead of as a patron settling in to see where the film makers and story tellers would take us.  We all know all three films are already in the can, why don't we wait to see how these characters build their version of their literary counterparts, see where the movie makers and story tellers take us.  Taking book to film is a perilous endeavor because the medium transfer cannot be exact.  Is Mr. Wood the Frodo I envisioned reading the books?  Nope.  Did he become Frodo in the Movie? Yep.  Are we talking about deep character development?  Nope.  We're talking about an epic adventure of good versus evil in a fantasy land and this tale is ripe with opportunities for special effects which the movie delivers. Where has a book been better adapted to film?  (Okay, the standard will forever be 'To Kill a Mockingbird')  Everyone is trying really hard here to make us feel, from scenes and sounds unfolding, like we are living this movie with the characters.  That's what a writer does, drag the reader indoors.  Yeah, its got faults to endlessly point out, but while I'm musing about the misplacement of a dust mote, I will miss a pleasant, envigorating, promising and exciting adventure of book to film.",Null,0,1,7 August 2002
The Village," Way Misunderstood
","I was so 'prepared' for this movie by all of the reviews by known critics, friends and the social chat. References unerringly cast themselves to the 'Holy Cow' reveal of 'The Sixth Sense'. Audiences, in general, and in box office receipts, tend to encourage the frustratingly successful strategy of franchise horror films of 'Wow, do that again!'. So, we get a repeat of the original, often the same score, more inventive mayhem but, reduced to twenty five words or less, something one can't differentiate between Part II and Part VI.There was so much made, even by one of my (and much of the free world's) favorite critic's, of the failed twist ending seen coming from miles away and providing a 'you've got to be kidding' that is a sinking disappointment rather than a skull exploder.By the time I watched the film (I waited for DVD), I knew the elder's secrets and, as all my exposure to the film had warned, the twist was barely a noticeable kink in the plot. But I had he DVD for a five day rental and there was something squirming about my impression, something that wasn't comfortable.I thought about the director's previous; 'The Sixth Sense' (more than a few of us 'got it' when the boy explained that sometimes the dead don't know they're dead - but it spoiled nothing), 'Unbreakable' in which the 'twist ending' was merely ending, not intended to be twisted and 'Signs' where all the twists happened during, not at the end where all the 'twists' merged. It occurred to me that 'Unbreakable' was not 'The Sixth Sense II', nor was 'Signs' 'The Sixth Sense III', so why should 'The Village' be 'The Sixth Sense IV'? I thought I might want to watch it again.M. Night Shyamalan, in my opinion, didn't build this film around a twist ending (as well as 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'), that the twist ending franchise is a figment of the viewers imagination or 'do again' wishes.Pure and simple, this is a multi-layered love story. Not a chick flick romance but one that addresses the very real fears of parents because they love their children, of heroism because 'I fear for you before all others', and of a forest full of monsters of unexpected kinds that must be crossed ... for love.Shyamalan likes to tell his stories with a tapestry of strange, vexing and magical images and back drops. But strange, vexing and magical are the tapestry, not the stories he tells.The tale told in 'The Village' could not have been told without 'The Village'. Joaquin Phoenix's character (Lucius Hunt) could not exist anywhere but in the Village. None of the plot elements would have worked anywhere but in a Village. I don't know what came first to Shyamalan, but I imagine it evolved in senses and chunks and emotions and sort of oozed from the creative extrusion ports. And nowhere in the world could Ivy Walker (Bryce Howard in an incredible delivery) exist and launch the love-driven quest she made except from a Village.On repeated viewings, my vote is this is Shyamalan at the top of his voyage, to date. There are incredibly powerful scenes, positively dazzling deliveries by non-name brand actors (Adrien Brody as Noah Percy is, hands down, Oscar worthy; magnificent), heart, spirit, that moody thing that Shyamalan does so very well, emotional rewards, dead on score, mysteries only unearthed by a second viewing and did I mention Bryce Howard in an absolutely, kick your legs out from under you delivery? Second and Third viewings let you see all the details come together, watch the ending embrace the beginning. This is a cohesive tale, told with color and lack of color, one of courage and yielding to that which requires bravery and courage because 'I don't worry about what might happen, only what must be done'.There is, within the plot, the world's best marriage proposal.Here again, as in 'Signs', Joaquin Phoenix builds a believable character (though pertinent only for 2/3s of the movie).Sorry, nothing misses. This film is dead on, solid perfect. The 'Twist' didn't work because it wasn't meant to. Everything else worked because that's what the director wanted to happen.Best to date for Shyamalan .",10,1,2,24 January 2005
Over the Hedge," All the way to the top ...
","Oh My Gosh  this review will never be read but how can anyone who has seen this not write something, somewhere As much rave reviews as this animation has garnered, it will never get the respect and longevity it deserves in a world that goes 'Wow! That was incredible  what's next?' Nothing seems to linger these days.I'm an old codger weaned on Road Runner and Bugs Bunny gold plated animation that fascinated kids but had layers and layers to be peeled away that only maturity could appreciate. They were operatic and adult elements just beneath the slapstick.So it is with Over The Hedge, with groundbreaking and cutting edge CGI to boot.For instance, much has been made of its satirical portrayal of suburbia but hiding beneath the obvious is a second review of the human condition in the anthropomorphic depiction of the main characters and then  there are sub-layers there.This movie is one of those accidents of talent, writers, source, directors and actors; when the sum is more than the tally of its parts. That makes it art, milestone, important and one absolute dilly of a movie.It makes me sad to know it will fast-food its way through distribution, sales and fade away for whatever is next.This is a diamond; polished, unflawed (forget the complaints of plot holes and discontinuity, it's a work of fiction  it didn't really happen), pristine and a serendipitous collection of talents and ideas.WOW!!",9,0,0,1 January 2007
Van Helsing," Wrong Audience
","As presented to the world, this movie misses its mark.Allow it a Hard R rating (think 'Evil Dead'), soup up the story to that level, drop the PG-13 stuff, retain the budget and you have the makings of a genuine cult film.The action is so hard and fierce in this, and its effects so restrained by its PG-13 rating, it strives and sets up but cannot deliver. This is an idea born of the Japanese Anime genre. Would have worked and played extremely well in that venue where cartoons are frequently rated R.Making a Disney film of this subject, this way, was DOA.But, man oh man, what a near miss. This could have been immortal.Sad.",Null,0,1,20 October 2004
Black Snake Moan," Chain chain chain ...
","SPOILERS ...like I could ... For Me - One of those movies you can't measure against others of the same ilk because ... it's its very own ilk, all by itself alone. Craig Brewer seems to be blessing those who love film ... that way ... (Hustle and Flow) and now BSM (haven't seen his earlier, but I will!).Posters and hype seemed to pitch this work as a southern/trashy throwback to the exploitation (sexploitation) guilty/sleaze of the 60s and 70s - only my take because I remember (age alert!) those drive-in draws. Black man with a 'half naked' chained white sexpot/nympho born of an worthless Mom and relentlessly abused by Mom's boyfriend ... bad promo but I really don't think they knew what to do with it. Not their usual drummer. Then again, I don't know how to pitch this film ... Now, get ready for something really different? ... not that I have any expertise in that field.What's it about? That would be the purpose of a review, right? ... to create a summary of a given film and a rating of some kind? Okay, it's about two very different people that are very much alike, infested with a maelstrom of personal demons who shouldn't have crossed paths but do. Both are on very different self destructive agendas, one ready to run to the edge and over, the other ready to do the same but also toying with the idea of redemption. Their crossing of paths interrupts both their vectors and creates the raw story that unfolds.But not without 'The Chain!' That chain pandered in the posters and trailers, the one tossing up controversy and raising eyebrows, that chain that was ...... brilliant IMHO. The only way the post-chain drama could have unfolded was to, some way, physically anchor the two together until they 'meshed' (nothing else in life would have forced them to abide each other) so the rest could happen. When the physical chain is finally removed, its physical restriction has allowed the emotional, physiological and spiritual chain to bind them in a way a real chain could not.Then the synergy kicks in ... greater than the sum of its parts. Two lost souls, buddied up on the roller coaster to possible oblivion ... and then ...... Craig Brewer will tell you the rest.We're all flawed, you, me and everyone else. Somehow we find a way ... maybe.A word about Christina Ricci in this film ... she positively and absolutely nailed 10 out of 10 this character. Jaw dropping. Raw, visceral ... really scary good. Out of the ballpark. This is equal to, if it doesn't better, Charlize Theron's 'Monster' which, by the way, Christina Ricci was in as well.Craig dropped some archival footage into the movie ... pay attention ... he's talking to you about what he's doing here.More than a word about Samuel Jackson ... I'm sorry, I think SJ is one of cinema's most overlooked and un-rewarded actors in history and I don't understand that. His palette of characters he can become is apparently limitless (have you seen 'The Caveman's Valentine'?). He turned in an Oscar performance here, which he won't receive, of course. Like all the other Oscar level deliveries he's made but didn't collect. SJ created a character, gave it flesh and blood and soul and life and made it real ... raw, solid, dead on perfect. This is probably my favorite role of his he's taken and owned completely.It might behoove you to remember this is closer to a fable or fairy tale than your normal kind of narrative film.Oh, yeah ... it doesn't hurt if you're a fan of the Blues.In from left field and out of the ball park.",8,2,5,28 June 2007
The Happening," Edgy, softly creepy and vintage MNS
","MNS has been bludgeoned to death because he didn't repeat 'The Sixth Sense' with his career. That seminal film had the 'twist' that most of us saw coming and righteously enjoyed nonetheless. But it branded movie-goers' expectations from this director. 'Unbreakable', which lacked the 'twist' of TSS, again telegraphed this director's intentions of illuminating the 'between the lines'. 'Signs' alerted everyone that he was seriously not focusing 'the same ol same'. An alien invasion with only trace-aliens? Who would'a thought? By the time 'Signs' came along, it was clear MNS was looking at things through a new lens. 'The Village' nailed it. Critics talked about the 'twist' (still demanding a 'twist ending')as disappointing. 'The Village' wasn't about a 'twist ending'. 'The Village' was a love story. About the courage of love, told 'out of kilter' And then what should we expect from 'The Happening'? Quite naturally, it is a story between the lines. Told from a perspective that's easier and easier to fear ... we're not in control of things like we think we are. Nature might hold a surprise or two. I don't like to make comparisons like this but MNS has, from the first, called up those 'Twilight Zone' kind of visions. Invites us to 'look at things ... this way'. He's done it again. Dismiss it. Knock it. But if you're honest ... it's hard to ignore the film's metaphor. We live in strange times and strange things can and do happen. Why are the honeybees disappearing? ... they really are, you know. It's called Colony Collapse Disorder. You can look it up. It's scarier than the movie. Or part of the movie. That's how MNS works. Much decent.",7,2,4,7 October 2008
Army of Darkness," Classic dumb fun, righteous entertainment...
","You know those times when you're with friends when everything is meshing and mixing just exactly and everything said and done garners a round of laughter just because your so bloomin' happy to be right here at this moment? That's the mood you want to watch this movie.  If you want serious cinema, wait. If you want perfect special effects, wait.  If you carry even a smidgen of cinematic snobbery, never ever watch this film.  To all the whiners about this movie I'd ask them to imagine, on their own, without copying other films (I'd explain the differences between copying, tributes and parody but it wouldn't do any good)a trilogy like the one this film caps.  I mean imagine every detail, shot, joke, effect, etc.This was a coup for Raimi.  Few have made this happen.Wild.  Madcap.  Insane.  Deliciously over acted.  So over the top it ends up peeking at its own behind.There are enough one liners in this film, that if one memorized them, a conversation in any situation could be constructed using only the film's quips.This film always makes me recall 'Return of the Living Dead' though that film works with a darker humor.  However, they both share common origins, Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead', an important turning of corners in horror.Innovators who turn corners are at first copied, to cash in on the talents of others, then, respectfully utilized as springboards to take original and gutsy ideas in other directions.  A sincere flattery.Ten years hence, twenty, this movie, and it's first two installments, will be picked up on the dime sized dvds of the future and watched by friends gathered where everything is mixing and meshing just exactly and everything said and done prompts peals of laughter because everyone is so bloomin' glad to be in the moment.If you don't understand about those moments, I am truly sorry.Great entertainment, killer fun film, laugh, jump, shriek, jab your elbow into your neighbor's ribs, moan, enjoy.  If only all of us could drop off something like this as we passed through.Hail to the king, baby.",Null,1,1,30 June 2003
Donnie Darko," Confusion about the confusion with minor spoilers
","This is a really good film or a really bad film, it depends on you but what I don't understand is the confusion about the ending and the mysteries it's suppose to leave us with.  To me, the film was a neat wrap and explained everything nicely, nicer than one would expect.  Donnie's obsession with time travel and portals is the map to the film's ending.  And I think it asked the question 'Are people who ask the real questions considered emotionally disturbed because they aren't pre-occupied with the nonsensical questions we're supposed to be concerned with'  A few bouts with Quantum Physics won't hinder the viewer of this movie but the ending seems to follow the film's logic in an orderly fashion.
