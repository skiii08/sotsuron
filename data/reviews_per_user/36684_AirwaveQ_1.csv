Hereditary," More comedy than horror
","This is kind of strange movie... I heard a lot of hype in the internet about this movie saying this is one of the best horror movies lately. But I don't really feel like this is a horror movie, more like a parody. Of course, in some scenes it was a bit intense, but in the cinema people were laughing a lot from strange scenes which looked like parody.",4,1,3,15 July 2018
