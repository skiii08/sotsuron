The Blair Witch Project," comments, pt. 2
","Having already posted one review which could be seen as being 'negative' (although not as much as many of the reviews here) I have become rather resentful at those who not only praise the film (to each his own) but also offer their interpretation as to why the rest of don't like it - because it lacks special effects and relies on our imagination which therefore must be lacking.As for the first, Sixth Sense was plenty scary without special effects.  I can enjoy a non-effect movie as long as there is something compelling going on.  Blair Witch was interesting but hardly compelling, and effects or not, there was *nothing* scary.  Not a single solitary moment of the film caused me to jump in my seat, to look over my shoulder or to instill a fear in me that wasn't already there.  Silence of the Lambs lacks special effects and except for a scene or two, doesn't have 'jump out at you' scares yet is widely considered one of the scariest movies ever.  Why?  Because the audience is given just enough info to truly be frightened by the possibilities and the knowledge that something real is behind it all.  Blair Witch gives some hints of things to be frightened of, but nothing to indicate that something truly malevolent is taking place. 
As for the second.  My imagination is fine.  I'm a filmmaker myself.  When I go to a film I go to become involved in the filmmaker's imagination.  If the whole point of the film was simply to be scared by what I can imagine, why go to the movie?  I can sit at home and imagine some pretty scary stuff without spending $4.50.  'Jaws' left alot to the imagination but it also gave me enough to go on to fuel my imagination.  Blair Witch gave me nothing.  Not a hint, not a glimpse.  For all I know, the whole thing was a practical joke played on them by Mike, the movie not only doesn't offer any explanations it doesn't even offer any clues (and yes I know what the ending was supposed to be and that was hardly enough to validate any explanation from aliens to a ticked-off hermit).  I am left thinking that the filmmakers had nothing scary in mind... that it was their imagination that was lacking, not mine.  That they couldn't think of something sufficiently scary to match the build up so instead of going for the big climax, they just end it and then say 'imagine something scary here'  That's not filmmaking genius, that's a cop-out.  If Speilburg had *never* showed us the shark and instead left the possibility open that it wasn't a shark but perhaps a big p-o'd goldfish or maybe just a maniacal scuba diver or maybe (insert something you think is scary here) people would have been upset too.  Movie scares require something concrete to scare me.  There was nothing concrete in Blair Witch. The sticks & rocks set up a creepy atmosphere but are not scary by themselves. I have no problem with a movie that doesn't draw a straight line for me, that doesn't make all the connections explicit (Eyes Wide Shut for instance which requires active thought on the part of viewer and was thus not understood by most people) but if I'm to be left to connect the dots myself, you'd better at least give me the dots.If this film scared you, fine.  But for me it didn't and the film's supporters attempts to explain why it didn't scare me (usually in an insulting manner) simply don't hold water.",4,2,4,23 August 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Check the web site first
","I was so ready to be scared watching this film.  I had just seen Deep Blue Sea the day before (a far 'scary' film in terms of shocks & thrills) and was thoroughly disappointed.  As an indy film maker, I could relate to the kids quest, and felt the acting (yes it is acting, the situation is *not* real) was wonderful.  This movie succeeds based on the audience identifying with them - that is, identifying with the feeling of being alone in the woods and have some very strange things going on.  However, while all if this is very effective in setting up a very creepy situation that gets eerier and wierder as the film progresses, there is no pay off at the end.  None of what happens amounts to anything.  We are told at the beginning that the kids are missing (and presumably dead) and really have no more information than that at the end.  The film would have been better served with some framing sequences that include the information included on the web site, which put the film in context and offers far more information on the Blair Witch and the mythology than the film has on its own.  The film alone is a serious let-down.  As part of a multi-media event (movie, web site, Sc-Fi channel documentary) it is an interesting, if ultimately pointless, exercise in creative film making.",4,0,1,6 August 1999
Catch Me If You Can," light, breezy, fun & inconsequential
","'Catch Me if You Can' is as light and carefree as the period it evokes. Right from the opening title sequence, accompanied by yet another great John Williams score, we are transported to the early sixties - a decade of bright colors, breezy tunes and gentile living - the Camelot of pre-assassination-of-Kennedy America.Steven Spielberg's flashier side is well hidden here, although his style comes through in his inventive use of close ups and cross cutting to give a sense of time and place, evoke the period through the use of small details rather than large settings.His work with the actors and the small character touches is evident. Leonardo DiCaprio fares best under Spielberg's guidance, Tom Hanks, not as well, but still strong.His use of a New England accent seemed to impede some of his line readings.The story is fun, with just enough depth to keep it from blowing away. Ultimately though, the material may be too light for Spielberg, often feeling *too* much like 5 or 6 episodes of a 60's TV sitcom, like 'Please Don't Eat the Daisies' or 'Gomer Pyle' Hank's use of a four-letter expletive not-withstanding.CMIYC is a fun time at the movies and will make you laugh and maybe get misty eyed, but it lacks the emotional pull of Spielburg's weightier films. Taken on it's own, it's an excellent film, but given the caliber of talent involved, I expected something more substantial.",8,1,2,1 January 2003
The Others," Boring, dull & pointless
","I had high hopes for this film after hearing so much about it - how it relied on creepy atmosphere and sound to supply chills rather than jump out at you gore.  Well, it certainly doesn't have any jump-out-of-your-seat frights.  That's for sure.  It barely has any thrills at all.  Creepy atmosphere will only take you so far.  Like Blair Witch Project, The Others is like sex without climaxing, all build up and no pay off.The ending is rather pointless and really doesn't add anything to the story. It's an easy twist to figure out and from the moment I did, I realized everything happening had no point as the ending renders it all moot.  The only good moment is the way the twist is revealed but it can't redeemed the 100 minutes of tediousness leading up to it.  How this managed to get on the Top 250 list here is beyond me.  I think I'll go watch 'Signs' again, to see how slow build and creepy atmosphere can be done well *and* pays off with genuine scares.",6,0,0,6 August 2002
Blade II," great visuals, weak story
","The effects for the new Reapers were amazing.  The way the jaw split as well as when they did the disection, made you really believe such a creature is real and they just managed to film it.The story was recycled Buffy meets the Dolph lundgren Punisher film, where the hero makes a deal with his enemies to fight an even worse enemy while falling in love with a person he is supposed to hate and betrayed by those he trusted.  Bland, boring and wholly unoriginal.But the amazing visuals are almost worth the 2 hours of mediocre plot.  If you are looking for a great vampire story watch Buffy or rent Near Dark.  If you want great effects and non stop digitally enhanced martial arts set to a pulsating soundtrack, watch Blade 2",7,0,0,27 September 2002
The Polar Express," An amusement park, not a movie
","How very disappointing. I was hoping for a Christmas movie with a 'spirit of Christmas' type story about heart & warmth & spirit and instead I got a mechanical look at people riding a roller coaster. I've never read the book so I can't say how the story compares, but in this film there is no story. None, nada, zero, zip. Not one iota of plot at all. Here it is: kid gets on train. Train is a roller coaster and goes up down around trough over under left right etc. Kid winds up on roof as tunnel approaches. Somewhere in the middle of this there is a weird dance sequence where hot chocolate is served. The train arrives at the North Pole and main kids get lost and wind up in Santa's gift processing machine which is yet another amusement park ride, this time a slide. Kids meet Santa and go home.There are no characters in the traditional sense, thus no character development. The dialog is minimal as most of the movie focuses on the roller coaster's ... I mean train's ... trip to the north pole using stunning visuals and impossible camera angels. I suppose it's all very exciting but it leads up to... nothing.The 'BIG MESSAGE' at the end is simple 'believe in Christmas.' Nothing revelatory here. And given the not-quite lifelike people populating the film, it's hard to get any kind of human message. The visuals are stunning, but the people are still not quite there yet. And this too-smooth, glossy mechanical look kills any ability to empathize with the characters. This might have worked better as a traditional 2D animated film or using more stylized human figures. Overall, a maddeningly disappointing film from one of my favorite directors.",5,1,3,26 November 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," Craptacular!
","While Reloaded may have been simply a disappointing sequel, substituting story and originality with gonzo effects and 'coolness' so beloved in the first film, this film is a spectacular disaster. it is horrible on so many levels. The music in reloaded was derivative and lacked the energy of the first, but this film's music was just flat out bad. As in like annoyingly bad. Like I wanted to shoot somebody bad.The 'plot' is pretty non-existent and the film takes place mostly in the 'real world' and doesn't even involve the main characters. It's as if Keanu, Carrie-Ann and Lawrence filmed this around their golf schedule. well over half the movie focuses on minor characters who lack personality or development and none of whom we care one iota about. The film is so bad it even resorts to using the horrid cliché of the bumbling young recruit saving the day.I would rank the film as 'horrible' if just for not answering a single question posed by Reloaded, however, the abysmal storyline, acting, music, editing and dismissal of main characters make it impossible for me to rate this film anything over a 2 out of 10 (and those 2 points are solely for a couple of impressive effects shots). This film is an F in every way, as bad and laughable as cinematic catastrophes like Battlefield: Earth or Showgirls.Perhaps the Wachowski's were truly just 2-hit wonders (Bound & the Matrix) and after that have nothing left to say.",2,4,5,22 May 2004
The Shining," no way this belongs in the Top 250
","I have never understood the hype & love for this film. It must a Kubrick thing - people praise his work regardless of actual merit. Any Stephen King fan should be ashamed of this film. Sure the hotel looks great and spooky and ominous and the deep focus photography is excellent.But the story, OMG! what went wrong? for starters, everything. The SK novel was basically chucked out the window except for the most general of character sketches and plot outline. The details that made the novel scary and fascinating were ignored. No hedge animals?!? The entire alcoholic subtext was removed and this just becomes another haunted house story.Plot holes abound. (SPOILERS AHEAD) I gave up on this being even a watchable film when Scatman Crothers' character, a man with great psychic ability, is summoned back to the hotel from thousands of miles away knowing something is horribly wrong, and then walks in the front door and asks 'Is anybody there' prior to getting killed. Monumentally stupid!If you are an SK fan, stick with his miniseries version which far more accurately captures the story he wrote. There's a reason why he hates this film. A very good reason. It sucks.",6,16,34,25 February 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Easily the best one yet
","For the first time I was actually entertained watching a Harry Potter film rather than just impressed.  The first two films in the series were certainly watchable but fatally flawed by their slavish devotion to the books on which they were based.  By trying to exactly replicate the novels, rather than be allowed to exist as movies, the first 2 were suffocated - not allowed to 'breath' as it were - and ended up coming across as merely mechanical exercises rather than entertainment in their own right.'Prisoner of Azkaban' is the first time that a Harry Potter film exists for it's own sake rather than as a copy of the book.  Screenwriter Steve Kloves and new director Alfonso Cuaron are clearly not afraid to alienate the 'fans' who can't stand even the slightest deviation.  Here, the story is compressed and details altered in order to make for a better film.  By treating the story as a film rather than an adapted novel, the film is allowed to live.  Scenes flow rather than feeling forced.The acting is uniformly strong, the cast once again made up of Britain best thespians and strong child (now adolecent) actors.The effects are the best yet, owing as much to advances in technology as to their unobtrusive uses here.  Often, effects are 'thrown away' in the background or to the side, rather than highlighted front and center.At times, the story may be too compressed for the uninitiated, but, speaking as a casual Potter fan, I highly enjoyed this film and look forward to the next provided this is the direction they are headed.",8,0,0,4 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," it's a wonderful life in reverse
","OK, it's impossible to discuss this film without spoiling it so be warned that this review will contain spoilers to the 'big twist' at the end.  You are hereby warned.  (note that I have only seen the director's cut which has a different ending.  i don't know what the theatrical ending is)I hated this film.  Not in the sense that it was bad like Battlefield Earth or something.  I hated what the film had to say.  Sure films are entertainment, maybe even art, and the ride is to be enjoyed as much as the resolution, but a writer is also saying something.  S/he is making a statement about life.  and the writer of Butterfly Effect is making a sick, nihilistic statement that I can't at all find entertaining.This is a film about unfortunate, messed up kids.  They are both victims o bad lives as well as victims of their own poor choices.  After an interminable first hour in which nothing resembling 'plot' happens (instead, all the miserable childhood events that are to be changed must fist be laid out) min character Evan learns he can go back to certain moments of his youth and change things, thus creating a whole new reality for him and his friends (although the world at large is safely unaffected).The exact mechanism of his temporal journeys is unclear.  He returns to moments when originally he had 'blacked out.'  Whether he blacked out because at some point in the future he went back to those moments or that he simply could only travel to his blackout moments is never stated.  Nor is it stated, although it seems to be implied, that he can only visit each black out once.  Mess it up the second time and oh well, time to move on.Of course, each time back he attempts to improve things (preventing his would-be girlfriend's dad from making them star in kiddie porn; warning a mother with a baby about a firecracker he & his friends just put in her mailbox) he fixes the original problem but creates all new ones. Eventually, he decides the problem is *him*, his own existence, so he goes back to (presumably) a black out he had in utero and kills himself before he is born thus providing his friends with a happy life.What is the writer saying here?  First and foremost the message is 'the world is a better place without you'  While this might apply to a Hitler or Ted Bundy it seems rather harsh for basically nice-guy Evan who hardly brought about the harsh problems of his childhood.  If anyone in the film deserved to not exist it was the girl's sick father.  Take him out of the equation and none of this happens either.  To me, this is nihilism at its worst.  It doesn't value human life.  it values its lack. as a final message for what was already a downer film it left a sick taste in my mouth as the credits were rolling.Now, if one looks at the idea that the writer's original name for Evan Treborn was Chris (Christ reborn, get it?) then the message becomes one of self sacrifice - that a good man must die for the betterment of others.  The problem here is that his 'sacrifice' goes completely unknown.  No one will ever learn of his 'noble sacrifice' (a sacrifice made for the primary reason of negating a stupidly bad decision made by the girlfriend, not to undo any action of his own).  Still, the point seems to be not existing makes other's lives better.There can be some debate on this issue though as early in the film, Evan's mom informs him of her two previous stillbirths, but after he kills himself (become stillbirth #3) during the visual sequence showing the 'improved' reality' we hear his mother's voice repeat those lines but this time saying she had 3 previous still births, not 2.  who is she speaking to?  is the cycle repeating?  This point is unclear.Over all, this is a movie worth skipping.  It's not entertaining nor does it offer any kind of worthy message for your 120 minute investment.",3,0,3,31 August 2004
Man on the Moon," Jim Carry *is* Andy Kaufman
","It seems that one's impression of this film is going to be largely dependent on one's impression of Andy Kaufman.  I hesitate to call myself a fan of his.. I don't know that you can truly be a 'fan' of Kaufman's.  He didn't want 'fans' and in fact, often tried to create the exact opposite- enemies. I do appreciate his work and what he was trying to do though, so I went into this movie hoping to get a glimpse of the mind behind the man.Jim Carrey is absolute brilliant as Kaufman, encompassing the late performer so completely that often it was hard to believe I *wasn't* looking at Andy himself.  He recreates some of the best and most famous of Kaufman's performances and if you loved or hated them originally, you will feel the same here.However, after the recreations of what I already knew, I was hoping to see what led Andy to perform the way he did.  What motivated him?  Why was he so dead set against ever letting the audience in on the joke (his one-upping the executive after the 'Fridays' staged argument)  These questions the film doesn't answer.  Perhaps this is in keeping true to Andy's enigmatic persona but in a bio-pic I expect these kinds of revelations more than just finding out the truth about him & Jerry Lawler.Speaking of the wrestling.  Way too much of this too-short film is dedicated to Andy's 'wrestling' career.  Now, in all fairness, too much of Andy's life was dedicated to his wrestling career as well, but that doesn't mean the filmmakers have to make the same mistake.Here's to hoping there is a 3 1/2 director's cut lying around somewhere that gives more background on this fascinating performer.",Null,0,0,3 January 2000
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Someone should have lost the movie
","Is yet another scathing review of this film really needed?  I could blame Michael Crichton for turning out the worst novel of his career, one so filled with bad plot twists, cardboard characters and hackneyed dialog as well as being confused about whether it's a sequel to the original novel (where both John Hammond and Ian Malcolm were killed) or the movie (where they both lived) that it certainly would be easy.  However, screenwriter David Koepp decided to discard all but a few scenes from the book and concoct something equally inept on his own.  I could blame him.  I could blame Speilburg, perhaps the best director of his generation, for helming such a piece of sludge, designed merely to sell toys and lunchboxes. Casting blame his way goes without saying.Ultimately however, blame for this waste of celluloid goes to every one of us nitwits who paid to see this and have let Universal know that we are cattle who will shower money on any dino drivel thrown at us.",3,1,9,6 August 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Better than the first, but also not
","Much like Gollum in the film, I am off two minds about Two Towers.  Oh it still gets a 10 and is an absolutely astonishing work of art and entertainment.  The battle scenes alone are the greatest ever put to film.My sole complaint comes only in comparison to the first film, Fellowship of the Ring.  In FotR we get one story - Frodo's story - told over 3 hours. There is a singular drive and focus.  Two Towers however, actually being made up of two 'books' (Lord of the Rings was written as six books that the publisher combined into 3) has a split focus.  'The Battle of Isengard' sections focusing on Merry & Peppin with the Ents, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and the events leading up to the Battle of Helm's Deep; and 'The Ring Goes West' section featuring Frodo and Sam's dealings with Gollum and Faromir.The movie rapidly moves between the two parts of the novel and as such, the is a lack of cohesion to the story.  It doesn't movie forward in the way Fellowship did.  Oh, it's still better than nearly any other movie out there, but whereas FotR is in my top 10 all time, Two Towers will have to be content with being in my top 20.As for changes from the book, Who Cares????  It's a movie, not the novel on screen.  If the author had wanted a movie, he would have written a movie. The job of a film is to tell the essence of the story.  Getting every detail from the book exact is what makes the Harry Potter films so lacking in spark and magic.  Peter Jackson's ability to deviate from the novel when it serves the needs of the movie is amazing and commendable.  Anyone demanding slavish devotion to the text should be rightfully ignored.And yes, that means Shelob and the tunnel have been moved to the beginning of the 3rd film.  Yes that means the elves, and Arwen in particular, have a larger role here than in the novel.  But it all works and works brilliantly. This is a film not to be missed on the big screen.",10,0,0,19 December 2002
Driven," Better than should be, worse than it aims for
","I went to this expecting a bad action movie with good effects. After all, it was written by and stars King of Cheese Sly Stallone, was directed by the grand Cheesemaker Renny Harlin and features Burt Reynolds, who was making cheesy car crash movies when Sly was still a bit player.What I discovered was a racing movie that desperately wanted to be more... it aims for Rocky but lands somewhere around Rocky IV.  There is actually an attempt at a more complicated story that your typical sports movie.  I will give them points for the attempt, but I think Sly is overreaching, as his writing ability is unable to keep up with his goals.  The female characters are underdrawn, mostly unnecessary, and for act 3 unseen.  The dramatic structure is rather unfocused as well, In trying to have an antagonist who really isn't such a bad guy, the challenge for the hero isn't as compelling, plus, it's unclear who the real lead of the film is- Sly or the kid.  Sly simply has too many plot lines and character arcs going on and can't quite successfully juggle them all.I accept that in a race movie like this, the races themselves are going to be shown in a 'heightened' manner that isn't realistic, and will of course feature far more crashes than ever actually occur.  Given that caveat, I found the crashes, often done with digital effects to be quite thrilling & harrowing.  Where the digital effects clearly fail though were during the last race for the otherwise impossible to get camera angles, which looked like video game shots.  I had to wonder if near the end they started running out of money to fully render the shots.As for comparisons to Days of Thunder, any objective reviewer will tell you that that film sucked.  This one isn't much better, but at least it tries harder.",Null,1,1,14 May 2001
Black Hawk Down," Amazing!
","This was second favorite film of 2001 (behind Lord of the Rings and tied with Memento).  How this got left out come awards time baffles me.  This is incredible, intense filmmaking.  Ridley Scott sets a pace and tone that is unmatched in the history of war movies.  It's like the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan, but for 120 minutes.  Violent yes, intense, definitely. It compels you to watch.  Your senses are overloaded with sights and sounds, like you are in the middle of the battle yourself.On first viewing, I had a minor quibble about the lack of distinction among the soldiers - the uniform and buzz cuts serve to make the actors hard to tell apart.  After watching it again, I realized this isn't really a problem because we aren't suppose to identify with individuals in the beginning, we are supposed to only see 'the army'  Not until later, when the team is split apart do we see them as people with personalities and lives beyond shooting the enemy.  Even then, keeping the well known actors fair unrecognizable helps to keep your focus on the events at hand instead of 'Hey that's the guy from Pearl Harbor' or 'There's the young Obi-Wan.'A comment on the film just isn't complete without mention of the sound, which won a well deserved Oscar.  Perhaps more than the visuals, the use of surround sound puts you in the middle of the action even more.  This is a movie to watch loud to get the effect the filmmakers were after.",10,0,0,6 August 2002
The Dark Knight," Intellectually stunning, emotionally lacking
","So my partner & I were perhaps the last people on the planet to see this, but we finally got to this last night. Surprisingly, even for a 6:30 showing on a Thursday night, the theater was probably 80% full.I think everything that can be said about the great acting, writing & directing has already been said, and yes Mr. Ledger's performance is standout. Thus, I think it will be easier to explain why this film isn't the perfect 10 so many have given it and in fact, isn't even a 9. I give it an 8 and that is a with +1 for Ledger (it's a 7 otherwise). Here's why I can't give this top marks: (note major plot spoilers ahead - this analysis assumes you have seen the film or at least know the major plot twist of the half way point)Because both Joker and Batman represent ideals rather than fully developed characters, there is no emotional response to their conflict. The antecedents of this film aren't Superman or Spider-man but Heat and Goodfellas. It's a crime drama. But even in Heat, the criminal (who structurally, is the protagonist) is a flawed human being we can relate to, perhaps even more so than the cop chasing him. Epic crime dramas painted on a huge canvas can still be small and intimate when they need to be. Given this design element of The Dark Knight though, the film asks other character to carry the heart while Batman/Joker fight over the mind. The problem here is that the characters tasked with job fall short. The first is Rachel Dawes, whose initial function seems to be that of Batman's conscience. While he intellectualizes what he does, she is supposed to point out the human consequences both for others and for himself. In Dark Knight though, she is reduced to the pretty girl on the arm of the new guy. The tragic events about 2/3 of the way through, fail to resonate and rather than being heartbroken or feeling loss at a main characters death and another's disfigurement and loss, I was left thinking (rather than feeling) 'that sucks.' As for the new guy, Harvey Dent, who begins as Gotham's 'White Knight' we all already know his fate, so despite his representation of the good Batman is trying to do, it never resonates because the audience is left waiting for the big reveal of his scarred face (which is excellently foreshadowed several times throughout the film in both dialogue and lighting). Again, this is not an emotional moment but a visceral one. The audience stares at him not in sympathy or disgust or fear or even pity (all of which would be emotional reactions) but with a movie-goers anticipation of a cool CGI/make up effect. Even Harvey himself seems unaware of the damage done to his face. His fall is motivated by the death of Rachel, not his own disfigurement which he never seems to deal with on an intellectual or emotional level.The best films not only bring us into a new world, a new reality and show us things we have never seen, but they engage us on an emotional level. In The Dark Knight, I always felt like a detached observer of Batman rather than someone with an emotional connection to his character or his work. Gotham feels feels very insular and isolated, apart from the rest of the world, not a representation of a city you or I might actually live in.I love Christopher Nolan films, and as Memento and The Prestige have proved, there is never a wasted line, never a wasted action. Everything said, and everything shown ties back in. On that count Dark Knight delivers brilliantly. But unlike those two films, where the stakes were emotional and the twist serves to further manipulate our emotions, Dark Knight's brilliant writing comes across like an intellectual exercise. A puzzle box to be solved and reviewed and discussed philosophically, but not to be felt. And for me, a 10 movie needs to felt.Don't get me wrong, I love the film. An 8 is a great rating for me (7 is a generic good film, 8 is a very good film, 9 is just shy of perfect and 10's are reserved for those 1 or 2 films a year that just go above and beyond the call). But it's not the best superhero movie ever (Spider-man 2 still holds that distinction) and I'm not sure if it's even the best superhero film of the summer as Iron Man (to me) had a lot more heart even while lacking the larger philosophical context and deeper underpinnings of Dark Knight. I will certainly be buying both on special edition DVD as soon as they come out but my guess is that in the years to come, Dark Knight won't get as many plays as Iron Man or even it's largest influence - Heat.",8,3,11,5 September 2008
The Mummy Returns," Not as good or as funny as the 1st
","A classic case of sequelitis.  Take those aspects of the last picture that everyone liked, multiply by 10, cut character development to make room and viola, instant sequel.I will admit to not liking Mummy the first time I saw it either.  I was expecting a horror film and instead got a cut-rate Indiana Jones adventure-comedy.  But after watching it again on DVD I developed an enjoyment of the film for what it was- a fun, light-hearted adventure romp with excellent special effects, witty humor, and engaging (if undeveloped) characters.  I even was looking forward to the sequel.Maybe it will take another viewing of this one as well, because on first viewing I found Mummy Returns to lack the fun of the first one. The humor is carried mostly by Rick & Evie's son Alex and Evie's brother Jonothan.  While they have some good lines, they don't measure up to Kevin J. O'Connor's Benny of the first film in terms of comic relief.The film is composed primarily of action scenes that simply lead into one another, many without much purpose other than to show off digital effects- Where did those pygmy mummies come from? and who controlled them?- and others simply a direct lift from the first film - Im-Ho-Tep blows a wall (this time of water instead of sand) at our airborne heroes, complete with his face which again 'eats' the airship.The hand-to-hand fights were well staged as were nearly all the action sequences (although we have seen the double deck bus into a bridge gag before in a James Bond movie).  The only special effect I was disappointed with was the final Scorpion King.  Why was a digital version of the Rock's face used instead of his real head?Im-ho-tep himself is sadly under used, his place being taken by a couple of forgettable lackeys and the reincarnation of Anck-Su-Namun, along with the ever present threat of the return of the Scorpion King hanging over their heads.An entertaining, if somewhat jumbled & unfocused summer diversion, but don't expect too much.  Just as Mummy was a primer for Phantom Menace, Mummy Returns is just keeping theater seats warm until Pearl Harbor is released.",6,0,0,11 May 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," A Major Disappointment
","Forget the hype.  This film is not only inferior in almost every way save special effects from the original, the mythology of the series is possibly irredeemably destroyed by the confusing, non-sensical ending.Yes there is eye candy galore.  If the Matrix was a Hershey Bar, Matrix Reloaded is Swiss Truffles.  The 3 major fight scenes - Neo vs. 100 Smiths, the Freeway chase and the Foyer fight, which account for perhaps over 1/2 the films run time, are worth the price of admission alone.  The penalty for seeing these amazing effects on the big screen though is the other 1/2.  The non-action scenes are truly gawd-awful, especially the 7 minute rave sequence in Zion where the directors suddenly decided they were filming a techno music video (and a very dull one at that).Every from the dialogue and pacing to the locations and music is merely a pale reflection of the original.  Matrix reloaded comes across more like a remake by people with less inspiration but more money.Let's hope the 3rd one can redeem this disaster and restore the mythology this one destroyed.Matrix provided intelligent philosophical ponderings on the nature of reality and freedom while interspersing fantastic fight scenes.  Matrix Reloaded interrupts it's mind-boggling fight scenes for ponderous and contradictory dialogue that tries to be philosophical but most often sounds forced and out of place, now trying to incorporate the nature of an artificial reality into it's overall philosophy, but doing it very childishly.If all you want are the great fights, go see this film, just be prepared to pay the price for that devotion.",6,0,0,10 July 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Underwhelming
","I was underwhelmed. I haven't read the books and I knew nothing going in, except the first movie.This movie is all plot. There isn't one iota of character development at all. we learn nothing new about any of these character's motivations beyond what we already knew from the first film. Characters come and go, and disappear for long stretches as the plot dictates.Many scenes are well done but ultimately pointless and should have been cut to bring the film down to a more bearable running time. In particular, the entire opening sequence of Harry at home. it's Harry Potter 1 reduxe.The spider scene was quite well done and creepy but also extreneous.  It's a long scene with a deus ex machia resolution that really doesn't tell Harry anything.Of the 2 scenes of students in class, the one with winged gremlins also serves no function but it was in the book so they included it.The Quiddich match was very well done and exciting. Had the feel of the speeder bike chase from Return of the Jedi. Probably the best part of the film.Even more so than the first one, this film had the feel of plot gears grinding away, each scene happening because the book dictated it that way. As the first one, it lacked any magic or spontinaity. It feels 'programmed' and ultimately lifeless, a visualization of the book, not a film on it's own.I wanted to be wow'ed. I wasn't.",6,0,0,18 November 2002
Ice Age," silly and entertaining
","This was a fun movie. It's perhaps more 'silly' and kid oriented than some other recent computer animated films like Shrek or Monsters Inc. which work on 2 levels.  The majority of humor here is physical, reminiscent of early Looney Toons cartoons or even Three Stooges style violence-as-humor horsing around.  The kids in the theater with me seemed to enjoy it.  The only concession to adult-level humor appeared to be a Pumbaa & Timon inspired possibly-gay rhino couple.The message is pretty basic, involving standing by your friends, but that still didn't stop it from being fun.  And despite the carnivore vs. plant eater premise, and the humorous violence, the actual level of violent threat was minimal, with only one real death and that being off screen.The animation style was interesting, looking more like claymation than computer. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. The surfaces looked smooth and realistically 3D. Like it was a physical object, but the blockiness made it clear it wasn't 'real.' But the look worked for the film. It certainly never looked computer created, however it also lacked that level of realism seen in movies like 'Dinosaur.'  These creatures and this world were highly stylized, from the sloth's wide set eyes, to the sabre-tooth's almost disembodied lower jaws.The voice talents of the leads were quite well done, with each actor essentially playing himself (or his well known persona).  Ray Romano, plays the large wooly mammoth Manfred with an arrogance and attitude appropriate for his size, but with an underlying vulnerability and pathos.  John Leguizamo has the enviable role of motormouth sloth, Sid, essentially the comic foil to Romano's straight man (mammoth).  Dennis Leary is rather sedate as Sabre-tooth tiger Diego, toning down his usual hyperactive vocal mannerisms to a more kid-friendly level. His seems to be the only character who's appearance was modeled directly from actor.A minor complaint is that aside from a brief opening 'migration' sequence featuring a number of humorous prehistoric mammals, strange enough in appearance to rival any dinosaur (my personal favorites are the glyphodons, early ancestor's to modern armadillos), there are no female characters. This is a story for the boys, again reinforcing the Three Stooges style silliness.A film the kids will love and parents will be able to sit through without squirming.  Depending on your tolerance for silliness, you may even enjoy it.",7,1,1,17 March 2002
Signs," A little movie disguised as a big one
","Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan likes to make slow, quiet movies. These are the kind of movies that normally would play at the local art house theater and makes $500,000 before going to video. The difference with his movies is that he makes his little movies about big subjects with A-list casts. Of course, a little movie called 'The Sixth Sense' has pretty much guaranteed an audience for whatever he does.That his movies are as successful as they are is almost a mystery. He doesn't rely on big effects, crashing soundtracks and MTV editing, but uses long scenes and silence to build tension and lets his characters and story 'breathe.' Not traits that generally sell a lot of movie tickets.'Signs' is a 'BIG' movie. It's ID4. Close Encounters of the Third Kind. War of the Words. V. Except it's told from the point of view of the guy usually listed in the credits as 'Farmer #3' It's an alien invasion movie that almost forgot to include the aliens. There's no big political machinations. No military. No panicking townsfolk. No giant spaceships blowing up large buildings.What there is a one family. One small, insignificant family whose entire existence is changed by.... something. By keeping the focus small, on ordinary people, not the scientists, the president, the fighter pilot, etc., Shyamalan gives us people we can relate to; not necessarily people to cheer for in rousing patriotic battle, but people who are us. Watching Will Smith dogfight with aliens in Independence Day was fun, but how many of us will get to do that when the ETs arrive?Story-wise, the aliens are just a means to an end anyway. The alien arrival plot is just the surface - an excuse for Shyamalan to ponder the big questions of God and fate, chance and destiny. Do things just happen or do they happen for a reason? I suppose your enjoyment of the film come the finale will be dependent on your views on those 'big questions.' I may not agree 100& with his conclusions but I can't fault his method of presenting them.As with his previous films 'Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' the pace is slow. Some may get bored waiting for the promised aliens but as before, the pace allows plenty of time to become emotionally involved with this family and the events going on. We feel the tension as they do. Sure we want things to happened faster, but they don't. Events don't happen at the pace we want, we wait and we get more anxious waiting, more nervous, we question. Waiting is worse sometimes then the jolt we were waiting for.Shyamalan isn't afraid of waiting. He uses it, just as he uses silence and darkness. Often, he allows the silence to go on longer than we are comfortable with so when the sound does come back, the effect is amplified. One scene occurs in pitch black, with the screen in darkness for what feels like minutes (although is probably only 10-20 seconds) with only sound effects. The effect is genuinely scary, even more so when the light finally comes back.The packed theater jumped, screamed and was truly shocked at least a half dozen times. This is truly a frightening film, a masterful use of 'less-is-more' film-making where every slight glimpse of aliens generates a gasp.The film is not without it's flaws. The finale has a weird pace to it. because the focus hasn't been on the 'big event' of earth vs. aliens, the resolution occurs off screen and thus seems rather convenient. For a moment, it's as if the story has just ended but without the satisfaction of a real resolution. Furthermore, there is certain amount of irony in asking the question 'are there coincidences or do things happen for a reason?' in a movie; movies being specifically scripted in a such a way that there are no coincidences, every character trait, ever action, ever line of dialogue has a specific place and has been put there by the screenwriter to be used later to resolve the plot. Here we have a movie that answers the question 'is this just a coincidence?' with events that are scripted not to be. Movie themselves are self-contained universes with their own 'God' - the screenwriter, so it's somewhat disingenuous to use a movie to tackle the question. But the trip is still one worth taking. Shyamalan is quickly becoming one of my favorite storytellers; more than just a director, a storyteller with a singular vision and the skills and patience to tell big, quiet stories.",9,0,1,4 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," best film this year so far
","Everything Blair Watch was not but wanted to be- well written, scary, incredible acting across the board (and I concur with the general concensus, Haley Joel Osment deserve *at least* an Oscar nomination - and not as a token supporting actor, but as a lead.  He carries the film), brilliant direction, and most of all, a plot!  And what a plot it is.  I was totally engrossed in the trauma that this young boy was going through.  I had no idea about the twists the film would take and if you read these critiques it's unfortunate that the fact that there is a twist ending is revealed. You're better off not trying to figure it out, but instead allow yourself to be transported into young Cole's world.  Lighting and color are used wonderfully to set the mood, often changing within a scene.  The music, which can so often ruin a good shock by being more powerful then what's on the screen instead hightened each moment perfectly.There are some truly scary moments but this is not a horror film.  It's drama with some supernatural elements, so don't be put off by a poor marketing campaign.  As with most twist endings meant to spin everything you've just seen 180 degrees, this one leaves many questions unanswered but if you believe in the world the movie draws you into, these are easily overlooked.  I was unfamiliar with M. Nigh Shyamalan,, but I will certainly be looking forward to his next turn as writer or director (hopefully both again - his singular vision was a huge asset to this film)  Don't miss this flick!",10,0,0,23 August 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," are we watching the same film?
","The Indy film I saw was terrible, full of bad humor, jokey villains, horrid effects and witless action.  If there is some great 3rd Indy movie out there, could someone please point it out to me because I'd love to see it.It certainly couldn't be Last Crusade which is a terrible film for so many reasons.  Let's begin at the beginning.  The opening sequence with River Phoenix as young Indy just screams 'CONTRIVED'  By this point the Indiana mystique was so high, someone felt the need to explain many of Indy's trademarks, so in one 10 minute sequence, we get the origin of his hat, his whip, his fear of snakes, the scar on his chin and his basic sense of right & wrong.  If any 40+ year old human being could claim that so much of their personality comes from a single 10 minute incident as a child I would laugh in their face.  Aside from the completely ridiculous nature of the sequence, even getting into the spirit of fun is next to impossible when the effects are so bad... the 'animals' looked like refugees from Disneyland. When 'Anaconda' had a snake that bad, people rightfully laughed, yet here people seem to think this makes for good filmmaking.A couple of characters return from the first movie but as a fan I have to ask why?  Did they bring Brody back to act as a mentor to Indy, to regale him (and us) with his exploits as a young archaeologist?  Nope, they brought him back to turn him into a bumbling buffoon.  Was Sallah brought back to act as Indy's contact & right hand man, to help him through strange and exotic lands where Indy may not be able to secure the resources he needs, but Sallah can?  No, he was brought back to make camel jokes. ::sigh::Now as for those famous Indy action scenes: in Raiders, Indy got the snot kicked out of him but always relied on his brains to survive (passing under a truck was a great stunt and a deft move for Indy to take).  In the tank chase here, does Indy's intelligence save him?  Does his skill?  The answer is no, it's pure, blind luck.  And who really thought he was ever in any real danger? Besides how dangerous is a poorly blue screened tank anyway?While Sallah & Brody were reduced to cartoon characters, Indy himself became a joke, playing straight man to his father whose dialogue seemed to come from a TV sitcom, the only thing missing was the laugh track.Of course, the only people more comicly inept that Indy & friends were the Nazi villains.  It's hard to imagine these wanna-be keystone cops taking over a bowling alley let alone most of Europe.  But of course, this plays right into the idea that hapless Indy can't face an actual challenging villain that might require skill and intelligence to defeat since in this movie, Indy displays no skill or intelligence.Overall this movie is a hapless, witless exercise in attempted crowd pleasing that only succeeds in pleasing those hapless & witless enough to accept whatever drek the filmmakers give us instead of demanding real characters, real adventure, real thrills and real humor.So for those of you with a videotape of the 'best Indy ever' some of you are claiming to have seen, please, send me a copy so I can throw out my version of Last Crusade which obviously has all the good parts edited out.",5,10,22,28 August 2000
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," the Worst Indy film
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie of all time.  This film is so far removed from the spirit of that film that it's hard to believe the same people were involved.  The film utterly lacks suspense, thrills or genuine warmth, instead replaced by forced one-note 'humor', calculated action scenes with no real sense of danger and Nazis so comically inept it's amazing they almost took over the world.  Simply lacking the darkness that characterized the second Indy film does *not* make this one better.  Good dialog and some believable action scenes are what this film needed. Between this and Lost World Speilburg has shown that for all his talent, he can't handle sequels.",5,3,10,6 August 1999
