The Ring," Impressively Restrained
","Most horror movies suck.Its sad, but true.  The average horror movie has absolutely no respect for its audience, is seemingly aimed at pre-teens, and not very bright ones at that, and is full of cheap scares, ridiculous characters who don't act a bit like anyone you know, and when all else fails, maybe some bad CGI or a bucket or two of fake blood.  The Ring is different, and for that reason alone it earned my respect.  Was I really scared by it?  No, not really (although the climatic ending was appropriately jump inducing).  But it did a great job of maintaining an atmosphere throughout of 'wrongness'.  Nice soundtrack work, quick cuts, disturbing images, just enough revelation, kept the world feeling just a little off, and a little creepy.Unfortunately, not much happened, and what you had was a movie long on atmosphere, but almost boringly devoid of chills.  But its not often I have the pleasure of making that complaint about anything not arthouse, so I'll gladly take the tradeoff.Overall a well made, mature, horror film.  Just maybe lacking in excitement at times.",7,4,8,5 January 2004
12 Monkeys," Smartest Time Travel Film of All Time
","I must confess I have never been a Terry Gilliam fan -- wasn't one before I saw this movie, and haven't one been afterwards either -- BUT, with that said, for the two hours I sat in that theater (and the several repeat viewings at home since that time), I was very much a Gilliam fan.Simply put, this is one of the smartest sci-fi films ever made.  Weird at times, yes, slow-moving and at times confusing, yes, depressing as hell, yes...but always smart, smart, smart.  And even the weirdness, which I often find off-putting in Gilliam's other films, here generally serves to draw the audience into the same nightmare in which the protagonist finds himself. And the last thirty minutes of the movie are just classic.  There have been few movies that have excited me as much as the last half hour of this film -- I recall actually pumping my fist as one by one every mind-blowing loose end in the film was pulled together and tied up in time for an absolutely perfect ending -- just brilliant work.This is not an uplifting film, nor is it an action flick.  If you are looking for something to make you feel good, or for a quick action fix, this is NOT the film for you.  But if you are in the mood to use that round thi ng perched up on top of your shoulders, I highly recommend this movie. 9/10",9,0,0,11 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Astounding
","I intentionally waited until I had a chance to see this movie for a second time before rating/commenting on it -- my first viewing left me with such a jumble of impressions that I wanted time to sort them out and gain some persepctive.Let me first say that this movie did not change my life -- I am neither taller, smarter, nor better looking for having seen it.  And in fact I can not even in good faith give this movie a '10' because it DID have flaws (some over the top effects as the ring tempted people, some scenes and sequences and characters which felt rushed and not fully developed despite the movie's three-hour running time, the (entirely necessary) lack of a true climax/ending etc.).  But with all of that said, make no doubt that this is an absolutely astounding movie -- probably one of the most remarkable things ever to appear on film.  There are a handful of scenes in this movie that are not only jaw-dropping, they are so absolutely perfect that it brings tears to your eyes.  And the sheer scope of the project, its incredible imagination, stunning special effects, and just as critically, a series of casting choices and performances which could hardly have been better, make this not only easily the best fantasy film ever made, but a movie destined (likely with its sequels) to go down as one of those cultural milestones people will still be talking about in 20 years.  Its that good. 
P.S. Kindly ignore the small minority of people who felt compelled to give this movie a '1'.  For anyone who has humiliated themselves in this fashion, allow me to suggest a couple of titles: 'Hercules in New York' and 'Santa Claus with Muscles'.  Watch them, and then answer me this question -- if LOTR is a '1', what on earth are these films?",9,0,0,24 February 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Decent action film, But Unworthy Sequel
","Well...And I guess that's kind of where this left me.  Just well...ok.
(some minor spoilers)The first Matrix was great.  The second was much less so, and you could sense Hollywood creeping in around the edges in the stock characters and cheesy moments.  Now in the third installment Hollywood has taken over -- complete with the Fallacy of the Talking Villain (multiple times!) and people gasping out 5 minute long death speeches wherein they get to spit out their entire philosophy on life and ask you to kiss them -- at which point they abruptly die.  You also have thousands of casualties, a destroyed city, but of course all we care about is the swelling music as two secondary characters come together to embrace.  Sigh.  So cliched in a series which was once so original.  All that was missing was a Red Digital Readout counting down to exactly 1.0 seconds before stopping.As an action flick, this movie does fine.  Its better than most, and has an excellent, although flawed 45 minute action sequence at its heart (although somebody will have to explain to me why the squids school around like fish allowing themselves to be shot rather than swarming and overwhelming the defenders -- oh yeah, because they would have swarmed and overwhelmed the defenders and that wouldn't have been good.).  And I think I really have to talk to the machines about their city defenses -- all you have to do is fly up and 'oops', we didn't think anybody could attack from above?  Hey -- maybe this war could be won yet.  Unfortunately, the movie it lacks the guts to be truly grim, and at all times we have to be pestered by cute Hollywood moments, and characters who once were interesting and deep have now been reduced to cardboard cutouts going 'whoa!' as special effects blow up in their face.And as a thinking movie -- well it doesn't do much of that.  And that's the real disappointment.  It is so obvious at this point that the first movie was intended to be a stand alone movie, and really should have stayed that way.  Not only is there a real inability to capitalize on the mind blowing concepts of the original in this film, they are largely discarded along with most of the details and rules therein.  In fact there are a large number of flat out discontinuity errors not only between Revolutions and the the original, but between Revolutions and Reloaded as well.  And characters and events critical to the first two movies are just tossed aside here -- why, oh why, have the Architect come on at the end of the second one to give us the I am God speech and hope for the trilogy's intellectual premise, only to throw it away within the first half hour here and say 'oh he doesn't know anything'?  Why do the ships suddenly have guns when in the first we knew that 'EMP is our only defense against the machines'?  Wouldn't it perhaps have been a good idea to try to shoot the squids in the first one rather than throwing the EMP and almost blowing up Neo's mind?
Anyway, the movie is fine for eye candy.  But the matrix itself is all but discarded now as totally irrelevant, and the interesting philosophical concepts and questions about the nature of reality are all gone.  Answers of a sort are given, but they are unsatisfactory at best, and just flat out dumb at worst.  Action has triumphed over brains, and one more time you get the feeling that Hollywood has entirely missed what made the first movie so interesting and respected even among those who don't normally go in for sci-fi or action flicks.  The extravagent explosions in this one just can't cover up its essential emptiness.  Bottomline = disappointing.",5,0,0,8 November 2003
Resident Evil," Bad
","Bad.As in: Bad, bad, bad, bad, BAD.*Minor Spoilers*The console game provides some basic inspiration here, but essentially what you have is just another Grade B cliched horror flick.  We have, in no particular order: a small group of people trapped in a supposedly creepy locale.  Standard flesh eating zombies (BTW, has there ever been a LESS scary monster?).  A mad homicidal supercomputer watching everything through cameras.  A heroine.  A bunch of dumb people who get to wander off into the dark and do precisely the wrong thing at the wrong time to get killed.  And one CGI monster who probably should have been used more from the beginning. **YAWN**Throw it all together and what do you have?  In this case, a mess.  When you're making something this derivative its all about the delivery, and this movie fails badly at building suspense, has laughable dialog, huge unexplained plot holes, unscary monsters, and a goofy pseudo-rock soundtrack that does little to cover up the movie's poor construction (reminiscent of John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars actually).  Just a complete failure.See it only if you're 12, have beaten every console game you own, have finished your homework, taken out the garbage, and can't find any paint to watch dry.  And for heaven's sake don't waste any hard earned allowance money on this dreck.",3,0,0,13 November 2002
Event Horizon," Ghost Story in Space
","This movie has some genuinely creepy moments and great looking set pieces, but it eventually falls victim to the same problem as so many supernatural thrillers -- it doesn't play by any rules.  Are our heroes faced with a physical entity?  A non-corporeal one?  Maybe its all in their heads? Maybe the devil?  Do we even care?  The movie starts off nicely enough, but soon loses all structure and just degenerates into one weird sequence after another without much rhyme or reason.  Its too bad too, as it wasted some good atmosphere and a typically strong performance from Laurence Fishburne. 5/10.",5,0,1,11 January 2002
Black Hawk Down," Really Good
","Really good war movie, with both its greatest strength and greatest weakness being that there was no attempt to really make a larger statement. Thankfully it avoided an agenda, either excessive flag-waving or political finger pointing, and just stuck to the action, which was exceptional.  The movie managed to simultaneously express the chaos of the running street battles that evening in Somalia while keeping the audience always up to speed on what was going on.  The movie also benefitted immensely from being able to show about 2 1/2 hours of a 12 hour long battle.  You are dragged into the battle along with the soldiers instead of just being shown a highlight package, and the brutality of war is conveyed by war itself rather than a bunch of preachy statements or Hollywood plot cliches.  All of which makes it a very good war movie.  But its lack of ambition to be anything more than a war movie probably does keep it from going beyond its genre and a notch below a classic such as Saving Private Ryan.  An 8/10 and one of the best movies of the year.",8,0,0,12 November 2002
Pride & Prejudice," Very Nicely Done
","This was a rich, passionate take on a very old story, and Keira Knightley is a revelation as one of literature's first romantic heroines. Frankly, before this performance, I was not really sure whether she could act or not. It is hard to tell when an actress is starring across from a giant CGI octopus. But her range and subtlety as Lizzy in this movie bodes very well for her post-pirate chick future. There is still a bit of an anachronistic tomboy element to her performance, but it never reaches anything approaching the silliness of her characters in the various Bruckheimer blockbusters she has appeared in, and instead adds a flavor all her own to this Lizzy. And her liveliness and the arch nature of the character are nicely set off here by her ability to project a certain sweet vulnerability that helps her claim the movie and make you very much root for this well known character all over again.I fully understand the contingent complaining that this was not a 'pure' adaptation of Jane Austin's P&P -- I in fact would agree with that. But the question would be does that fact somehow make this a bad movie, or even a bad adaptation? And the answer is emphatically no. Characters and story lines have to be abbreviated to make it into a feature film, but save perhaps one more scene that they really could have used to delve further into the Wickham character, the trimming does not hurt the core romance of the story, but rather focuses attention upon it. Nice supporting turns add humanity and humor to characters such as Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins, and upon a re-viewing, even Donald Sutherland did well with a lot of subtleties I missed in the first viewing. (I could, however, have done without the excessive squealing and bouncing around of the younger sisters). Most importantly the two leads, after a slow start, develop a palpable chemistry as the film picks up pace.And pick up pace it does -- this is P & P infused with dark romantic imagery, great period music, and some wonderful cinematography. Rather than a series of stage appearances, we get a passionate and highly entertaining labor of love, where the writer/director wisely decide to take their time and spend their precious minutes conveying emotion and energy rather than forcing in one more line or one more character which could leave little impact. It may not have the social nuance, and only sporadically achieves the comic flair, of Austen's book, but Jane's story never looked so good or felt so powerful before.",9,3,6,27 April 2007
Enemy at the Gates," Disappointing
","Somehow I was hoping for more here.  The movie was just less...mature than I thought it would be, dickering around with a tacked on love story, shallow characters, and a bunch of people doing exactly the wrong thing at exactly the wrong moment to get themselves killed.  Not to mention a fleet of bombers who apparently only flew overhead when it was going to serve the plot in someway.  I was hoping for fewer cliches and a grim gripping WWII thriller.  What I got instead was an unevenly paced mess.  Like the title says, disappointing.  And not even in the same league with a movie like Saving Private Ryan.",4,1,3,22 September 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the Best If You Get It
","People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie.  Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action junkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not 'get' this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.  But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done.  And THAT is filmmaking at its finest.  Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled.",9,3,4,31 July 2003
Prometheus," Disappointed
","While not a disaster, it was hard to view this ambitious attempt to expand the Alien universe as anything but a disappointment.And maybe it was the ambition itself that this movie tripped over. Trying to juggle too many themes, too many characters (doing amaterishly stupid things in order to move the plot along), even too many monsters without clear and focused connections, it just ended up feeling muddled and disjointed. Characters that you would have liked to get to know, only get a handful of lines. Situations that should have been built up and slowly dragged out to pump up the tension, are instead rushed over. Then other scenes are flashed to that look silly and cheap. Along the way most of the menace and wonder that should have been dripping from a movie like this was just lost, and that was just brutally disappointing. Every 15 minutes or so there would be a shot, an idea, an action that by itself was cool, but more often than not it was brushed over and forgotten about, or simply misplayed if not. Even the creatures created from the ubiquitous black goo felt like they were lacking in menace and imagination. Its very disappointing that we have seen similar creature work before in far less ambitious movies over the years.As for the big mysteries that people complain this movie raised but did not answer, that did not bother me nearly so much as the mysteries which WERE revealed. The entire Alien universe, which started out so dark and frightening, felt like it was lessened by this movie. The awe of the engineers has been stripped. The curtain was pulled back from what lurks out there in the dark of space, and what lurks behind it just isn't terribly scary after all. They say what scares you in a good horror film is the stuff you DON'T see. Well I think the same thing applied to this movie -- it was the unknown terrors of a hostile universe that tickled the imagination in Alien. Frightening questions that would make you never want to leave home or set foot on an alien planet again. Here our very stupid scientists pop their helmets off to smell the air like they're on vacation, and get to reveal far far too many of the Engineers' secrets, and with the mystery goes the fear.",6,5,8,17 June 2012
1408," Sigh
","I will never understand why people continue to buy into tripe like this, as we get our 1347th haunted house/hotel/room whatever story, all with the same flaws. I gave this 3 stars because I thought the buildup was pretty effective. In fact until Cusack actually enters the room I was settling in and hoping for the best. But instead of the best, we get almost a one man Cusack stage show that plays out more like an overwrought descent into insanity than it does a ghost story. And then, like all of this breed of story, the wheels come completely off, there are no rules, the main character reacts stupidly to everything, and you spend 45 minutes lost as Cusack runs around his one room breaking things and yelling, and occasionally big special effects that may or may not be in his head come crashing through. It gets tedious quickly. When a character does not know what is real or not, that is fine. When the audience doesn't it just encourages you to detach and sit back chomping popcorn waiting to see if any of the nonsensical special effects you are watching are real, or if its all just a dream. And really, by the end of this one you don't care.",3,2,5,2 May 2012
Signs," Comical
","A movie about intergalactic space travelers who can be defeated by a squirt gun and retaliate by inspirng asthmatic attacks in young children, Signs is extremely hard to take seriously.  I kept on waiting for the humans to wise up and break out the Macintoshes, but after seeing the alien(s) at the end, I guess why bother.  Lock 'em in the closet, beat them over the head with a bat, and turn on the sprinklers.  Problem solved.  Oh well.  Not sure if anything could have been made of this movie given that people have admitted to creating crop circles with boards strapped to their feet, but whatever might have been made of it, certainly wasn't here.  Kind of uplifting in a way -- after watching this movie I say bring the space aliens on!  I've got my garden hose and a healthy supply of water balloons.Guess you can give it a few stars just for the reasonably moody style and acting (you can really sense the presence of the Sixth Sense's director at times).  But as anything that's supposed to be remotely frightening this movie is an abject failure.  In fact with a little work could have been a nice parody.",3,1,1,1 March 2003
X2: X-Men United," Blah
","I did not love the first X-Men, but I generally liked it.  It was solid and serious and went much deeper into character development and the social issues which made the books stand out than I would have expected.  It stood out because it was NOT just a comic book movie.X2 is not a comic book movie either.  Unfortunately in its case, rather than rising above the genre, it falls beneath it.  Its really just another standard Hollywood action flick.  Undeveloped characters, quick but thoughtless action, standard plot, and a host of convenient coincidences and stupid decisions by the characters weigh it down.No better than a time waster.  Maybe even worse.",4,1,3,2 December 2003
The Replacements," Cliché Done Well
","Actually trying to write a review of this movie would be pointless -- we've all seen this exact same movie made dozens of times before. The underdog team of misfits, rallies together, plays with heart, overcomes the odds, bonds etc. etc. etc. Its a giant cliché.But you know what? Its a cliché done well this time. There's nothing original here, but this is one of those times, as in The Longest Yard or Major League, where it actually works. Maybe its the superior cast. Maybe its the great chemistry between the male and female leads. But for whatever reason, this movie grows on you. Even after predictable element after predictable element comes wandering on by, its just hard not to like the film and get sucked in. Its just a light feel good film with its heart in the right place -- I felt stupid for being manipulated by the oldest tricks in the book, but when I let go of the cynicism for a moment, The Replacements brought a smile to my face.",7,2,3,21 September 2004
Gangs of New York," Just how overrated can a movie be?
","I was kind when I cast my vote for this movie -- the pure spectacle alone earned it some credit for me, despite the fact it was a real mess. Wandering through the better part of three hours, and largely dispensing with plot for extended stretches, this is almost a classic example of how bloated and directionless a project can become when you give a noted director carte blanche to try to create a world, rather than a story.  The movie LOOKS great, or at least authentic.  But the plot meanders, the situations are contrived, at best, and the only actor able to rise above the muck to leave an impression is the inimitable Daniel Day-Lewis, returning to the big screen for the first time in half a decade.  Despite all kinds of star power, the movie just sits there on the screen begging the question, 'why was this made'?Catch it on cable, if you must.  Don't worry about missing the beginning, or the end, or any other portion of it.  A half hour or so should suffice to give you an idea of what the movie is about, and just about any half hour will do.",4,1,5,21 July 2003
