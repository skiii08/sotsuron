The Avengers," Believe the Hype!!
","I'm pretty sure I had a grin on my face the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes, including the 20 minutes I waited after the film to check that there wasn't a sneak peek after the credits. It's got a great great story, which is relatively true to the comics. Stan Lee MUST have had a lot of creative input into it. Really makes a difference. Shows why his comics have been around for almost 80 years.Considering how many 'big' characters there are, the character development is fantastic. you really buy in to each of their personal agendas and feelings. The guy who plays the Hulk, is just incredible. Never seen him before, I don't think. He gives you the impression that he is a loaded gun that can crack at any point, fly of the handle and turn into this massive green smashing machine (which obviously he does). The tension is incredible. It's got laugh out loud moments liberally scattered throughout, that was making the whole cinema laugh. Most of them coming from either Robert Downy Jr, or weirdly enough, the Hulk.I have to say I felt really comic book geeky as there was one line that only comic geeks would have got. I laughed and about 4 other people behind me laughed. Ironicially enough we were also the people that stayed until after the credits.The last act has some of the best action sequences that have ever been put on film, period. The CGI, which there is a lot of, didn't feel like CGI. You are so engrossed and it is done so well, that you forget that it actually is CGI.It certainly helps to have a grounding in the Marvel films that preceded it, but it's definitely not necessary. I have seen them all, so I can't be completely certain, but I think you'd do OK even if you haven't. There are some quick flashbacks and some expository dialogue about what's happened in the other films, enough to bring you up to a good enough level to get it, I think. Obviously it's better if you've seen them, though, so if you haven't yet, I highly recommend filling in the gaps. I would say that, in descending order of usefulness, you should see: Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 2, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk.. Adding to that, my girlfriend hasn't seen any of them, I thought she would just think it was a geeky film, but she LOVED it, I was shocked. So much so that we'll be watching Iron Man 1 and 2 at her suggestion.I read loads of reviews saying that it is not worth watching in 3-D. I have to say, I completely disagree. There is a lot more they could have done with the 3-D element. For example, Hawkeye, with his arrows would be amazing, you know firing arrows at your face etc, but I prefer the subtle bits of 3-D when you do not even realise. When it doesn't distract you from the film. There are bits at the end of the last act, where there are bits of ash just floating about, in 3-D. Very subtle. Very Good.There is a bit after the initial credits, so stay for a bit, not a lot of people will get the character they show, as it is not a familiar villain, but it does set up for a sequel, which will struggle to top this movie.It is very rare that a movie lives up to the hype, especially for me, but this will be the movie of the year. Spiderman, Batman, will struggle to replicate the success, if they can, they will be amazing too.It's the best superhero film ever made, that's not hyperbole.Oh also Scarlett Johanson is in it and she is my favourite!",10,6,11,2 May 2012
