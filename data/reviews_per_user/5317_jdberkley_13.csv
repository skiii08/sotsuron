Raiders of the Lost Ark," Asps...very dangerous...you go first.
","Some films you can theorize about and speak in solemn tones about the nature of their artistry. Some films, on the other hand, just make you grin from ear to ear as you remember the sheer thrill of experiencing them for the first time. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is happily one of those second types of films, a movie you do not passively watch so much as you careen through with equal measures of fear and glee. It's the two-hour equivalent of the best amusement park ride you've ever been on, and I mean that as a sincere compliment. The opening scene alone is worth the price of a rental, as Harrison Ford's immortal Indiana Jones escapes an evilly booby-trapped treasure chamber only to run right into, and then past, an ambush. It contains one of the best fight scenes ever filmed, and possibly the best chase scene ever filmed. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is one of the first movies I can remember seeing in a theatre, and it is a film I love above nearly all others, because it is the sort of story the movies were really invented to tell.",10,1,2,19 October 2003
The Big Lebowski," The Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!
","There's almost no point in commenting on 'The Big Lebowski'-- there's no way of summing up exactly what makes this movie so tremendously entertaining to the people that get it, and there's no way of convincing the people that don't that they're just stark raving mad. Nonetheless, I feel compelled to say something here, as I've insisted on several occasions that friends and relations watch this film, and no one I've recommended it to has complained yet.I have a theory, which is probably complete hooey, about the genesis of this film. For years, the Coen brothers had made well-reviewed films that were usually overlooked by the Academy. Once 'Fargo' broke through and earned them their deserved degree of industry acclaim, the Coens had a degree of freedom they'd never really had before. So, when they went to make a film to follow up what was considered a masterpiece, they chose the silliest subject matter they could come up with-- a noir comedy starring a unemployed stoner named Jeffrey Lebowski, a business tycoon of the same name, a porn king, a feminist conceptual artist, a wayward young wife, a buddy who can never get a word in edgewise, a gang of German nihilists, and a best friend named Walter Sobchak, who doesn't so much have flashbacks to the Vietnam War as he simply refuses to acknowledge that the war ever ended. Oh, and I left out the bowling pederast named Jesus.Never before, and never since, have the Coens made a film with this much sheer, unadulterated glee. As has been said many times in earlier comments, John Goodman's performance as Walter is an award-worthy amalgamation of loyalty, hyper-rationalism and homicidal rage. Jeff Bridges, as the unemployed Lebowski(he prefers 'the Dude'), has never been funnier(the scene where he tries and fails to throw a cigarette out of his car window is especially brilliant) as he aimlessly navigates the Dude's way through a kidnapping plot that is anything but routine. The Coens pepper the script with some of the sharpest dialogue they've ever come up with, and they're fearless in simply following their storytelling instincts wherever they lead. Any film that includes a musical sequence set to Kenny Rogers and the Second Edition and features both Julianne Moore in a Viking costume and Saddam Hussein as a bowling-alley attendant has more than its share of guts.Do my comments explain why this film has become the cult classic that it is? Of course not-- if I could write that well, I'd have written 'The Big Lebowksi' myself. At one point, the film's narrator, a cowboy played by Sam Elliott(darn, left him out too) is trying to describe The Dude, and he says something like, 'The Dude was...man, I lost my train of thought.' It's ridiculous as narration, but it's also instructive-- this is an entire movie that quite often loses its train of thought. And it's all the richer for it.",10,2,4,4 May 2006
Shakespeare in Love," Master Shakespeare would have liked this, I think.
","There were many who were surprised that 'Shakespeare In Love' took home the top prize at the 1999 Oscars, surprised that Steven Spielberg's powerful 'Saving Private Ryan' didn't win Best Picture.I'll defend the Academy's decision not by disparaging 'Ryan', but by praising both films. 'Saving Private Ryan' honors the men who saved the world. 'Shakespeare In Love,' meanwhile, honors everything that makes the world worth saving-- love, wit, creativity, passion, beauty, and most of all, soul. There isn't a scene in this film that doesn't crackle with the energy of people intoxicated with their ability to express themselves to the world. People create themselves with what they say, and in 'Shakespeare In Love,' it is a beautiful, sad, wonderful world they make.",10,0,0,24 July 2002
Dead Poets Society," One of the worst films ever made...
","I'm revisiting this comment long after I first wrote it, because I simply didn't explain why this film offends me to the degree that it does. First of all, I cannot recall another film made by artists I admire so much(Peter Weir, Robin Williams) that I detest this much. The moment this film tries to find a plot-- when Kurtwood Smith's character(Neil's father) argues with his son and asks, 'Why are you defying me, Neil? Is it this new man? This Mr. Keating?'-- it sounds completely fake. Why would the father assume his teenage son is challenging him because of a teacher? How would he know which teacher to blame? This movie careens through manipulative scenes without ever stopping to really learn about its characters-- Knox's romance with a local girl is given so little screen time, it's absolutely pointless. John Keating's scenes in the classroom use literature as a source for empty sloganeering. That's a concert, not a classroom.But where the movie really fails its own ideals is in its treatment of the students as they begin to challenge the conventions of their supposedly oppressive private school. A movie that cared about them, and wanted to indict an authoritarian environment, would have a scene showing the school administrators leaning on a student, urging him to turn Keating over to save himself. Cameron, the turncoat character in this film, could have been written sympathetically-- he's an anxious wannabe with no friends, so, in a movie with some empathy, he'd be shown making the decision to rat out the group as a means to win his classmates over. Instead, he gets saddled with dialogue that makes him sound like a neo-Nazi, so that the audience can clap when Charlie punches him.At the end of this film, after all the exhortations from their teacher to challenge convention and conformity, these students face a choice. They all choose to lie to save themselves. Wouldn't a good film show its characters making difficult choices and daring to live with the consequences? Wouldn't a film that really cared about education show us characters that have actually learned something?",1,49,125,15 June 2000
Lost in Translation," A film about what matters most...
","You know that feeling when you've met someone, maybe in a place far from home, and you've gotten along well, exchanging small talk and laughing a bit together, and you've reached the point where you've run out of meaningless things to say? You're at the point where you either say goodbye, and wander off in search of more forgettable pleasantry, or you take the chance to say what's really on your mind and to give another person a chance to know who you really are. 'Lost in Translation' is a movie about two people who reach that place in their ongoing conversation, and decide to take the chance. It isn't a romance, at least not in the traditional sense-- these two people don't simply need someone to love, they need someone to remind them why they get up every morning. It's one of the most humane, genuinely good-hearted films I can recall watching, and at the risk of imitating earlier comments and reviews of this movie, I think it's one of the best films in recent years.It doesn't have 'that scene'-- it's never flashy or obvious. Its single best moment comes when we don't know exactly what its lead characters are saying to each other. Its visual style is a sort of oddly placid bewilderment-- the movie does an excellent job of making you feel as if you're lost in a city where you don't understand anything. If you were there, maybe you'd be looking for someone who doesn't understand it either, but might understand you. I loved this movie, because I believed every second of it. Bill Murray has never been better in his life than he is in this film, playing an American movie star who's just a little too smart and a little too wise to be impressed with himself anymore, and he's matched note for note by Scarlett Johansson, as a young woman who hasn't found her place in the world yet but is pretty sure she's made a wrong turn somewhere. This is a movie about finding someone who'll listen to you, someone who doesn't know you well enough to know what it is you want to hear,  but might tell you what you need to hear. In this movie, two people connect, if only for a little while, and it is a wonderful thing to experience with them.",10,0,0,10 January 2004
Top Secret!," A goofy, sublimely stupid masterpiece(Minor Spoiler Alert)...
","Here's a movie cheerfully dumb enough to have this exchange of dialogue: Nick Rivers: I'm sorry, I don't speak German.Hillary Flammond: That's all right, I know a little German. He's sitting right over there.(cut to shot of midget waving to camera).It's also smart enough to have an entire scene based on the premise that English, when played backward, sounds like Swedish(don't even ask).It somehow manages to spoof Frankie and Annette, Elvis movies, 'The Great Escape,' 'The Dirty Dozen,' Westerns, 'Casablanca,' spy movies,'The Blue Lagoon,' and even 'The Wizard of Oz.' I have no idea how this movie was conceived, or what studio executive greenlighted this, but God bless everyone involved with this movie, because it is a sublime idiocy, and one of my all-time favorite comedies. If you loved 'Airplane!' and 'The Naked Gun,' and you've never seen this, you missed the best of the bunch.",10,1,2,30 September 2002
American Beauty," I must agree with those who believe this film is badly overrated(MAJOR SPOILERS TO FOLLOW)...
","In fact, while it is well-acted, it isn't at all a successful film in my opinion, because it bails out on a storyline it doesn't have the guts to follow through on. Let me explain this in detail, because I want to be clear about this-- the people who made this film are exceptional artists(especially its late, great cinematographer Conrad L. Hall), and they're certainly not careless people. But in this case, I think they blew it.The very first scene of this film shows a videotape recording of a girl being asked by her boyfriend if she would like him to kill her father. She replies, 'Yes. Would you?' Now, why is this scene there? It is repeated and shown in its full context later, in which the boy later says, somewhat unconvincingly, that he was kidding. But in showing this scene twice, the movie creates a very real expectation in any viewer who is reasonably well-versed in the mechanics of the mystery genre. That's what 'American Beauty' is, ultimately-- it is the story of a murder, and of a murder victim. You can tell a murder story in many ways, but usually they're just variations of the following two plotlines. You can either make the story about finding out who the killer is, or you can make the killer known early, and make the story about hunting that person down. 'American Beauty' sets up the expectation, by repeating that scene, that Lester Burnham, who tells us in the first scene he'll be dead by the end of the movie, will be murdered, and that these two kids will kill him. Part of the intrigue of watching 'American Beauty' after the repeated scene is in learning how much you like both Lester Burnham and his daughter and her boyfriend, and in hoping against hope that the result the movie has promised won't happen. But then, it doesn't. The movie bails out, and pins the crime on the one wholly unsympathetic character in the movie, a character that has little or no dimension until the end and no real motivation to commit the crime he does. 'American Beauty' cheats the audience out of the family tragedy it promised from the very first frame, in order to give us an easy villain to hiss. How am I so certain 'American Beauty' went wrong? In an interview with 'Creative Screenwriter' magazine, screenwriter Alan Ball said that in his original draft, the kids committed the murder, but in the aftermath of several killing sprees by American teenagers, he and the studio thought that was just too hot a button to press in this story, and so they changed the ending. With this film's obvious intelligence and style, I would have liked to have seen it follow through with its intentions, and give us the tough, tragic story it wants to tell. But it doesn't, and thereby, as good as it is in many moments, it fails.",5,1,2,22 October 2003
The Princess Bride," A gentle, whimsical classic
","I saw this film when it first came out in theatres. I was twelve at the time. In my unusually self-important childhood wisdom, I declared to all of my friends and relations that 'The Princess Bride' was the best film of 1987. I suppose I was attempting to become the next Roger Ebert at the time. Now that I'm older, and I've seen many of the more seriously acclaimed films of that year, I still think I was right at the time. Has any film ever satirized a story form(in this case, the fairy tale) while embodying that form so perfectly? And has there ever been a fight scene written so intelligently as Westley and Inigo's duel? This film is a joy from start to finish, and it is one I will treasure for as long as I live.",10,1,2,24 April 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Gorgeous, terrific movie-making.
","It starts quietly enough. A swordsman returns to the woman he secretly loves, to tell her he's decided to give up the life of a warrior. As a token, he gives her his signature weapon, the Green Destiny sword, and asks her to deliver it to the governor in Beijing. Simple enough.This kicks off 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' one of the most beautiful, passionate action/adventure movies ever made. Much has been made of the wu xia fight choreography, and many, sadly, have expressed their dislike for it as unbelievable. It's not supposed to be believable. It's supposed to be admired for its balletic artistry, its refusal to let the emotions of conflict remain stubbornly earthbound. The action choreography in this film is, like all true martial arts, both thrilling and meditative.Most filmmakers working with this material would have gone overboard on the action. Ang Lee, however, is too good with actors and stories to make that mistake. He anchors 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' on its superb cast-- Chow Yun-Fat(how could it have been anyone else?) as the aging warrior Li Mu Bai, Michelle Yeoh, her face aglow with wary beauty, as Shu Lien, and the astonishing Zhang Ziyi as Jen, the new governor's daughter who is much more than she originally appears. A romance, an adventure, a meditation on how the choices we make narrow our paths in life, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is one of the great films of our time.",10,1,1,24 July 2002
Million Dollar Baby," It deserved every award it got...
","I was reminded of a great observation I'd once read about film acting when I was watching Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby.' I believe Roger Ebert said(I could be mistaken there), in an analysis of great film actors, that Marlon Brando showed us all everything that could be brought to a film performance, that Paul Newman learned that from Brando, and then went on to learn what could be left out. Clint Eastwood learned from a lot of great directors in his days as one of the greatest movie stars in the world, and he's become one of the greatest directors we have, because he's confident enough, and disciplined enough, to know exactly what he needs to show you, so that you understand why the characters have made the choices they've made.Million Dollar Baby is one of the two best films Eastwood has given us(his other Best Picture winner, 'Unforgiven' would be the other one), and it's superb because every single scene, every single line, builds on the one before it. It's a masterpiece of story-telling economy(all the more miraculous because Eastwood shot Paul Haggis' first draft of the script) that pulls you in to the classic story of an underdog boxer that gets a shot at the big time only to then break your heart without ever taking a false or cheap step. This movie doesn't depend on a twist-- the ending is where this story was heading the entire time. It's just that the writer, the director, and the actors(Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman, all perfectly cast and at the top of their game) have too much story-telling integrity to let you ever get ahead of them.It's simple, it's powerful, it's honest, and it's heartbreaking. You can't ask for much more than this.",10,2,4,17 February 2006
The Silence of the Lambs," Already legendary, and deservedly so...
","You realize you're in a different sort of thriller when Clarice Starling walks down that corridor, trying to ignore the cat-calls of a cell-block full of lunatics, only to find that the most dangerous inmate on the block is standing calmly in his cell, waiting for her, almost as if he's welcoming her to a cocktail party. Rare is the movie that gets everything right, but 'The Silence of the Lambs' comes awfully close to providing the perfect example for a modern thriller. It's so disturbing to watch for some people that it's often described as a horror movie, which says more about other films involving serial killing, in my opinion, than it does about this one. We're not used to crime thrillers that actually show killing and its aftermath in gruesome, clinical detail-- 'The Silence of the Lambs' does. We're not used to films showing us psychopaths of unnerving ferocity-- 'The Silence of the Lambs' does. Most importantly, we're not used to seeing this kind of story presented in such a matter-of-fact way-- 'The Silence of Lambs' is never showy in its camera work or its performances. Most crime thrillers don't quite thrill, and certainly don't frighten, because you never quite believe them. You believe 'The Silence of the Lambs', especially when you wish you didn't.",10,1,1,8 February 2004
The Sixth Sense," It's not about the scares, or the 'surprise' ending...
","Those things only work, and only matter, because they serve a story in 'The Sixth Sense' that is genuinely emotionally affecting. You care about what happens to Cole Sear, so hauntingly played by Haley Joel Osment, and you want to see Dr. Malcolm Crowe(Bruce Willis, in arguably his best performance) help him. You believe every second of Toni Collette's brilliant performance as Cole's mother, a woman pushed to her limits of worry and grief. In short, 'The Sixth Sense' is that rare Hollywood thriller that isn't about the plot so much as it's about the characters, and that's why it works.",10,2,3,14 February 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This is the first film I ever saw...
","Having read a lot of the other comments here, I have to say it's interesting to see how many people begin by saying how old they were when they saw 'Star Wars' for the first time(Full disclosure: I was three. My parents saw it at a drive-in theatre, and all I can remember of that experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time, and knowing that he was very, very bad). I think that speaks to its extraordinary impact. 'Star Wars' was an event, I suppose in the way that the Beatles on Ed Sullivan for the first time was an event. It dates you, to a degree, but the reason it was important-- the reason it remains important-- is that it showed you what was possible. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the brutal, heartbreaking truth of our world(The Godfather, Chinatown, Nashville-- some of the best movies ever made), and many of them succeeded brilliantly. But there's a place for dreaming dreams of things that have never been, too, and 'Star Wars', with its epic tale of an Empire and a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, was the dream a generation didn't know it wanted to have until George Lucas gave it to us.Is it juvenile, at times? Simplistic, even? Sure. So's the truth, sometimes. We want to believe there's a Force, and that Luke can master its use in time to defeat the forces of darkness. So we believe it. Are the effects a bit dated now? Sure, although I still believe them. Did the success of 'Star Wars' possibly kick off the modern blockbuster era, which gives us more and more special-effects-drenched dreck every year? Sadly, it probably did. But the thing the wannabe heirs of 'Star Wars' usually lack is the one thing that made 'Star Wars' such an event--courage.Back in 1977, nobody was making movies like this. Nobody thought a film like this, with its mythic storytelling arc and its sweeping vision of intergalactic war, could possibly work...with the exception of George Lucas and his fellow filmmakers.I didn't know all that at the time, of course. Like I said, I was only three. But having watched more movies than most people my age now, I feel comfortable saying that in its way, 'Star Wars' is as much an independent auteur's film as anything by John Cassavetes or Woody Allen-- it has the same sort of daring, the same desire not to settle for less than showing us something we've never seen before. A bold, grand sense of old-style craftsmanship infuses everything in 'Star Wars', and the film delivers on the promise contained in its subtitle. At the time, it really was a new hope.",10,11,14,17 May 2006
