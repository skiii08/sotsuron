Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," worst movie ever
","I went to this movie thinking it would be funny, but it was disgusting. it tried to make jokes about different races and sexism but took it way too far. Calling Jews cockroaches and monsters that lay eggs, and making fun of rape victims. Showing some naked obese guy humping Borat's face, and showing a close up of his sons dick, is taking it too far. This was a waste of film. If this had been rated higher it would have made more sense, but it was 14A, so little kids can see this. i know some people for whatever reason thought this was great, and will probably reply by telling me I'm taking it too seriously, but i think parents should be warned before they let their kids watch this.",1,347,690,26 November 2006
