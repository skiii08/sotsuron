The Ring," Interesting
","A smooth mix between scary horror and put together piece by piece criminal thriller. I most admit, it was quite scary. And the feeling was enhanced when I was walking home that night, pitch black, thick fog and alone in the north part of Sweden. As a film I don't fancy it. Lame actors, no extraordinary sounds, no deep. Not anything remarkable about it. But as a horror film; a little masterpiece. Excellent editing. The flashes in were the corpses are revealed are genial. A very good way to scare the audience, indeed. The picture loses little of it's supernatural charm in the end, but that is typical. Not many movies are good and amusing right through.",6,0,0,3 March 2003
