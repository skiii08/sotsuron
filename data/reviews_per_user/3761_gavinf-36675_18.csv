The Hangover," The funniest movie ever
",The hangover is the funniest movie ever with them going to Las Vegas and it turned into a nightmare. The funniest parts like the tiger in the bathroom and the mattress on top of Ceasers palace it's just an hilarious movie and then when there friend goes missing and they need to find him before his Wendy it's just an incredible movie,10,0,0,2 June 2020
World War Z," Best zombie movie
",This movie had the best actor in brad Pitt and showed how possibly what could happen in a city in a zombie apocalypse. It felt just like a zombie movie needed to be. Seeing him trying to keep his family alive and him running away from hoardes of zombies is what a zombie movie should be,8,1,1,2 June 2020
Happy Gilmore," Great
",When I look at this movie this is the movie I most remember Adam Sandler one of his best movies and how he goes from a hockey player to a golf player in the movie is really funny,8,0,0,2 June 2020
Spider-Man 2," Forgettable
",As you first watch it. It's a good movie. But after awhile and you look back at all the Spider-Man movies you kinda forget this one. And if I was to pick one to watch I would not pick this one,6,0,3,2 June 2020
Terminator Salvation," Forgettable
",This terminator is the most forgettable out of them all there is just no moments that stand out like the first 2 terminators it's just not good there's just not much else to say,5,0,0,2 June 2020
Spider-Man 3," Best one
",This was the best one of all the spider mans. It was great how they made a villain spider man and also how you see sandman grow into a creative villain. And the best is the ending when they all fight it's just great,9,0,0,2 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Shaky ending
",It was a pretty decent movie and the ending was good but a little shaky because bringing back palpatine just didn't make sense and how litterally everyone in the world found this mysterious planet in seconds and fame to help but all in all it was a good ending I wouldn't be surprised if they made more Star Wars movies though,7,2,8,2 June 2020
Armageddon," Great
",This movie started to get me into space movies and wanted to see more. How every aspect is great and how close they get to dying and coming out of it alive makes this movie great,8,2,2,2 June 2020
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Underrated
",This movie is the most underrated out of all the terminators it still might be the same concept but it really isn't instead of stopping a certain person it's a thing. A nuke. This movie is good and still a deserving third movie to the first 2 terminators,7,1,1,2 June 2020
Spider-Man," Great
",This movie started superhero movies for me. The first time seeing this was one of the best things to watch what happens to him and how he adjusts to his powers and uses them well is a great aspect of the movie,8,0,1,2 June 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man," Just why
",Why was this made I don't get it was terrible adding a new spider man and actor was just a very bad idea,2,1,1,2 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great
",This movie is suprisingly funny and it gives a great story. The first 2 hours some people might not like but I still did. But the last 30 minutes is insane with instead of going the depressing way with the murder of Sharon Tate. It went a gruesome and action packed way. This was a great movie,8,5,6,2 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Kind of bad
",It was cool the see Luke again but what happens after is either boring or just bad up until the end and why things just don't tie in with the story it's just ridiclous the only good is the fights are cool,6,2,2,2 June 2020
The Hangover Part II," Good
",This movie is in Thailand now and it's still funny as it was. The funny parts like stu getting mike Tyson's face tattoo and them going through to figure out what happened the night before. There is so many funny moments again and the only problem is it's the same thing but that's still fine,8,1,1,2 June 2020
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Very funny
",This movie is one of the most funniest movies I've seen. Will Ferrell still is very funny and brings the movie to life. Some scenes from this movie you will just remember for a long time,9,1,1,2 June 2020
The Waterboy," Very funny
",This movie is very funny because of how they make a water boy turn into a football star. This movie also has some moments where you remember for awhile,9,2,2,2 June 2020
The Purge," Great horror movie
",After I watched this movie it really made me get into horror movies and it was such a creative movie. To have people go insane and make a day all about killing makes this movie cool,8,0,0,2 June 2020
The Hangover Part III," Wrapping it up
",It wraps up the trilogy nicely and it still has some of those funny moments and some of those are ridiculously stupid.But it's nice to see everyone together trying to get to Chow and to take him down,7,1,1,2 June 2020
