50 First Dates," Boring waste of time and money...
","Wow, this movie sucks! I don't know who writes all the praises and good reviews about it but they're all lies, that's for sure. I'm not afraid of a romantic comedy and like both Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler (though I'm not a huge fan either), but this movie doesn't have five minutes of worth in it. You can see literally ALL the jokes in the trailer and the rest just stinks. I almost fell asleep during watching it; the first 20 minutes were plain painful, then it became slightly better, but it was still boooring. Lots of scenes in the movie have no purpose at all, they're just there.I was particularly disappointed because - judging by the trailer and votes on IMDB - this seemed like a good one with a good storyline. Well, it isn't. If you REALLY need to watch it, go spend $8 for a ticket otherwise rent it or better yet, avoid it.",3,2,4,7 March 2004
Underworld," Worst possible mix of Blade and Matrix...
","I sneaked in into this one and how lucky I was! Imagine that I actually pay for this piece of sh*t.Anyone should be warned: this 'movie' is boring (the lack of a story doesn't help), visuals are mediocre (I'm being generous), music is almost acceptable (but it's a copy of Blade's and Matrix's music, so don't be suprised if you don't know what movie you're watching).There is no acting in this 'movie'; add all these together (and pay for it if you will): the result is two wasted hours of your life (and the loss of your money).I shall never watch any movie in the future with anyone from this cast in it.0 out of 10. You've been warned.",1,5,13,27 September 2003
Blade II," Big disappointment
","I was very excited when I first heard about Blade 2, but when I watched it, it was a big letdown. I really liked the original Blade movie (it was a good action/adventure movie with Wesley Snipes acting as a perfect Blade).Blade 2 has a very weak storyline and the entire movie focuses on showing as much gore as it can. Acting is bad (as if the director, the less-than-talentless del Toro told the actors not to interfere with the movie), the soundtrack is barely ok.Also, there so many special effects, after a while it is just tiring to watch this movie.Watch it only in a cold, dark, boring, lonely day when you **really** have nothing better to do.",3,2,7,6 July 2002
The Italian Job," Boring like hell...
","Well, I actually fell asleep on this one, it was so boring. I gave it 2 out of 10 as there were some half-funny jokes. I should've known better with Mark Wahlberg in this movie; I guess he is just a bad omen for a movie (Planet of The Apes, etc.) I'll never watch another movie with him in it.",2,1,3,7 June 2003
The Butterfly Effect," Quite a disappointment after all...
","Well, this movie has a great (although not entirely original) story about a guy who - because of some 'illness' - can go back to his past and make changes there (which of course changes the present.)Now, acting is fairly good in this one (Ashton Kutcher was surprisingly believable in the role, Amy Smart played all the different roles and the kids were all good as well.)Unfortunately, the movie starts pretty slow and it just wants to be a horror/thriller at all costs - even by ruining the movie itself. Although this could've been one of the best movies, it isn't, because of bad directing, overused and meaningless special effects (some are good though) and bad editing. I was very disappointed at the end, because of the huge promise this movie had. 5 out of 10.",5,1,1,25 January 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Boring
","This movie is boring and lacks any kind of a story. Acting is fairly ok and some of the ideas are really nice, but the actual movie sucks. I didn't read the book and I'm sure you have to to understand this movie. The 2nd part is much-much better.",3,1,2,4 December 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," More like Matrix Retarded...
","Boring. I guess someone lost the storybook somewhere during shooting so they choose to include only action scenes. Those look ok, but really nothing groundbreaking. Otherwise, the music is pretty average, acting is almost nonexistent.The story does not end to make sure you have to buy tickets for the final sequel. Rent it on DVD.",1,3,4,22 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," If you ever liked Star Wars, avoid at all costs...
","I wanted to cry after watching this BAD, BAD, BAD movie. I have waited for the for prequels so long and I was shocked after I saw EP1. Jar Jar Moron and the crappy story of an unimportant planet being blocked from trade? Where nothing resembled the Star Wars universe? Along came EP2, which I found a tad bid better - there was some kind of a story at least and Ewan McGregor was convincing as Obi-Wan Kenobi. But even EP2 was sub-par, in my opinion. However, I still waited, believing that it really gets better. It didn't.EP3 is pure, utter trash. I didn't find a single second to enjoy during the movie. There is no story, the characters are like uninspired wet cardboard, music sucks, the special effects ditto. There is NOTHING Star Wars in this 'movie'. Dialogues are actually make you flinch, they're so bad and corny.There is no moral message behind this movie. Star Wars (the original episodes) had a clear message about good winning over bad and showed hope. In this movie, there was no good character, just idiots and evils. There was no one to root for. I was actually glad when the kids were killed, I so much hated the dumb and pathetic Jedis by that time.Lots and lots of bad, annoying, visible 'special effects' make this film nearly unwatchable. More than 70% of the movie is just effect, for the sake of having effects. Most of the time the effects do not add anything to the film. It's not 'special' anymore when almost the whole movie is digital effect. Especially not, when done as badly as in this 'movie'.There are many characters and scenes that do not contribute to the Star Wars story, but they were excellent excuses to show off the crappy effects.This movie is not entertaining, it's not inspiring, it's just worthless. I feel so sad. 0 out of 10",1,16,31,19 June 2005
The Secret Life of Pets," Not a kids movie and not a good movie
","There may be spoilers in here.The trailer is great and gives the impression that this would be a light animated movie about pets doing 'stuff'. It never gives much of a glimpse as to what 'stuff' and there's a good reason for that: once you get past the first 5-6 minutes of the movie (essentieally the entire trailer), you get dropped into a psychotic chase where a gang of blood-thirsty fluffy animals hunt down 2 dogs that get lost from home.Once the hidden storyline picks up, most characters on screen hit or threaten each other, they manipulate and bully each other, lie to each other, etc. The cute-looking bunny is actually a psychotic ghetto thug that leads the gang and spends the entire movie screaming about killing humans and the 2 dogs.Other animated movies had cartoon violence in the past (Roadrunner, Tom & Jerry, etc.) but this movie is of a creepy, dark, horror quality with the wrong message for kids. The whole movie is done in very bad taste - another reviewer used the word 'schlock' and it describes this movie well.On top of all this, this is a very mediocre movie - there were not one laugh in the theater (which was moderately full) during the whole showing.If any sane parent saw a glimpse of this, there would be no kids at the theaters so marketing chose to lie to all the customers to lure people in.The only reason I gave this 2 out of 10 is the animation: visually the movie is very well done. Unfortunately, the story is garbage and the visuals cannot save this stinker.",2,13,33,15 July 2016
X2: X-Men United," Avoid at all cost...
","Are we talking about a BAD movie or what?? I know that the average of this film is above 7, but don't be fooled, X2 is among the most booooring films ever made. I've seen X-Men 1, it was a great superhero movie (much better than Spiderman, anyway), good story, nice effects, etc. You won't find any of that in this sequel: most scenes are dark, sometimes it's hard to see who does what. There is hardly any action scenes, but the ones there are not exciting at all. Usually I like good action movies, but I was yawning all the time - I'm a movie fan, so that's a bad sign. I give 1 out of 10, because 0 is not an option in the voting combo box.",1,6,16,15 May 2003
