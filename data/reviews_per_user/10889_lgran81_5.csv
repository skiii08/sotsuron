Walk the Line," Joaquin Phoenix is brutally hot as Johnny Cash!!
","Forget North Country, Walk the Line directed by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) and written by Mangold and Gill Dennis is the better 2005 Oscar contender.This romantic tragedy, which is based on the autobiographies of Johnny Cash The Man in Black and Cash: the Autobiography was actually written and perfected alongside the famous duo Cash and June Carter Cash before their deaths in 2003.The movie begins with a young, music obsessed 'J.R.' Cash growing up in a poor cotton farming family in Arkansas. Shortly afterwards, a family tragedy changes his life forever.Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) leaves for the air force, where he is stationed in Germany, buys an old guitar and proceeds to write one of the most recorded songs in history along with many others.Upon returning, Cash's obsession leads him to a recording studio and into the spotlight with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) as well as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and the comical Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne.) The next emotional hour and 45 minutes is filled with great music, drug dependency, infidelity, and most of all love.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, who sang every song themselves, completely shined in this movie. There are no better actors that could have filled the shoes of the Carter-Cash duo. Phoenix and Witherspoon had such great chemistry, by the end of the movie you actually think they might really be in love.However, if you tend to get restless in longer movies, the running time of 136 minutes can start to seem a little long towards the end, but it's well worth it.Overall Walk the Line receives nine out of ten stars. The movie did an excellent job portraying the life of the 'man in black,' his soul mate and their rocky path on the way to love. If Phoenix and Witherspoon are not nominated for their amazing voices and chilling performances, it will be a great disappointment.",9,252,339,10 November 2005
Corpse Bride," The Corpse Bride definitely Rises to the Occasion
","Halloween is almost here and there is no better way to get in the spirit than by watching Tim Burton's Corpse Bride written by John August and Pamela Pettler and directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson.Financial trouble in the family has forced two somewhat dull and unhappy people to be wed. Victor Van Dort using the voice of Johnny Depp and Victoria Everglot with the voice of Emily Watson are meeting for the first time only days before their wedding. Both have suspicions of one another which are demonstrated by Victor's inability to say his vows during their wedding rehearsal. This uncertainty causes Victor to stumble into the woods and change his fate forever.While perfecting his vows, Victor unknowingly slips a ring upon another's finger resulting in a marriage between himself and the corpse bride played by Helena Bonham Carter. From here the plot thickens and the magic continues to unravel.The animation in this movie is spectacular - it could almost be described as life-like if most of the characters were not dead. It is apparent through both the Corpse Bride and Tim Burton's last spooky computer animated movie The Nightmare Before Christmas that skeletons hold a special place in his fantasy world.The skeletons in Corpse Bride are very realistic and eerie. The recent dead appear a pale blue, those that have been deceased for a longer period of time have begun rotting away showing their skeletal interiors and those that have been dead for a while are nothing but bones.This movie is PG for some creepy scenes and frightening scenarios which might scare younger children and those faint at heart. However, this is a great film for everyone - not just children, families and Burton fanatics.Overall the Corpse Bride deserves three out of four stars. Tim Burton's wild imagination has proved magical once again. The Corpse Bride is not as mesmerizing as The Nightmare Before Christmas, but definitely worth adding to your DVD collection.",8,2,4,12 October 2005
Saw II," Better than the Original!
","Following the line of gruesome death scenes, surprising plot twists and creepy clowns, Saw II directed by Darren Lynn Bousman and written by Bousman and Leigh Whannel (he played Adam in Saw) will definitely make you jump out of your seat.The Jigsaw Killer is at it again. The movie begins with an unknowing victim trapped in a room and subject to self mutilation in order to save his life. This crime scene draws the attention of Detective Eric Matthews, played by New Kids on the Block's Donnie Wahlberg.In the events that follow, a group of seven extremely unlucky individuals find themselves playing one of Jigsaw's twisted games while trying to find an anecdote for the lethal poison seeping through their veins and a way out of the booby trapped house.Saw II immediately grabs your attention and keeps it for the entire 90 minutes of blood, gore and death.Everything in this movie fits perfectly - from the camera shots, to the actors, and all the plots. Saw II is creatively mastered from every angle.The sequel also takes time to make a connection back to the original movie to clarify the relationship between Jigsaw and his first set of victims. Jigsaw's motives and philosophy of his work is also revealed in Saw II.At first it's hard to decide which movie is better Saw or Saw II, but in the end I would have to vote for the sequel  shocking isn't it! In the original, Dr. Lawrence, played by Cary Elwes was not a good actor and somewhat took away from the movie. In addition, the single room scene became somewhat stagnant.On the other hand, in the sequel, all the characters were well cast and the continuous motion only added to the suspense.Overall, Saw II receives three and a half out of four stars. Scary movies just don't get any better than this. I truly hope they make this set into a trilogy.",9,2,4,1 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Potter always great, but its just not Azkaban
","Well, the wait is over. The fourth release in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, directed by Mike Newell arrived at the big screen November 18.This year Harry (Daniel Radcliff), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are now 14 years old and find themselves not only exploring magic, but dating as well.As the movie begins, Harry is having nightmares about devious meetings that are causing his scar to bother him more than ever before. He attempts to brush off these premonitions as they begin their fourth year at Hogwarts.Upon returning to their beloved school, the head master announces the Triwizard Tournament and introduces the additional schools that will be participating.However, due to the life-threatening and grueling tasks to be performed during the tournament, only those 17 years and older are allowed to be considered  technically this excludes Potter.The tournament turns out to be more than the school and its participants bargained for with ancient beasts, underwater demons and magical mazes. Of course, like all Harry Potters before, nothing is as it seems.Along with the Triwizard Tournament Hogwarts is hosting, also comes a Triwizard ball. This proves a difficult task for all three as they struggle with whom to bring as dates.First of all, when it comes to rating this movie, it's Harry Potter so it just can't be bad. However, this particular one just did not measure up to its predecessors.The very first two hours of the movie was great with all of the magic and conflicts you can expect from the series, but the end fell sort of flat.A few major issues that have been lingering since the Sorcerer's Stone, as well as new prominent issues, did not get the recognition they deserved. I would like to explain myself a little better, but I don't want to give away major plot points in the movie. I only hope these issues are addressed further in the 2007 release of Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix.Overall the movie was pretty good and deserves eight out of ten stars. It's not as good as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban or the Sorcerer's Stone, but the kids, families and Harry Potter fanatics alike will enjoy this present day classic. It's definitely one to add to the DVD collection  like all the rest.",8,1,2,16 November 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Way too much hype surrounding this flick
","Even after all the hype of the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie affair, if you still haven't seen Mr. & Mrs. Smith, it is now available on DVD.After meeting in a moment of chaos, John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) rescue each other from certain death by pretending to be together. Shortly afterwards and without the support of their colleagues/friends, they decide to get married.They both believe the other has a normal, boring job, but little do they know they are assassins working for competing organizations.After being assigned the same hit, Benjamin Danz (Adam Brody), the target shifts and becomes each other.There are both positives and negatives to this movie. First of all, it is a flick both men and women could enjoy. There is a lot of action with violent shoot outs, but it also has a hidden love story in between.Second the acting is great. Jolie and Pitt played these parts very well. There is definite chemistry between the two in this movie (gee I wonder why.) Unfortunately, they alone could not pull this film together.Finally the last bit of entertainment is found in two words, Vince Vaughn. Eddie (Vaughn), John Smith's partner was a riot without even trying. He definitely adds to the likability of this movie and should have been given more air time.What was not so great about this film is the long running time of 120 minutes. There could have been a lot more editing to not make this movie drag on like it does.In addition, towards the end, there is just too much that is unbelievable. Really, is no one going to notice a swat team and bombs going off at their local home store? Overall, this movie would normally receive two out of four stars, but since it could be entertaining for both men and women and Vince Vaughn's character; it receives two and a half out of four stars.If you haven't already seen the completely over-hyped Mr. & Mrs. Smith, pick it up on DVD and ask a date to join you for some Saturday night movie action.",6,0,1,1 December 2005
