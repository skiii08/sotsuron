It," Not Scary But Passes The Time
","I went into this having never read the book so I can't judge the faithfulness of the screen adaptation.The Clown with lots of CGI effects isn't scary at all - in fact he's a bit of a one-trick pony, if he opens his mouth and extends his teeth once he does it 20 times, there isn't much to him really. We don't get any character development or explanation as to why he is there, or for any of the things he does, killing and otherwise.The gang of children who are being terrorised by him are OK and watchable, they mostly act logically unlike the protagonists in many of these types of movies.I would class this film as a bit of a 'ghost train' ride, it throws lots of things at the viewer and definitely passes the time, but 20 minutes before the end I was itching for it to just finish. As for the strong hint of a sequel at the closing credits.. let's just say I won't be forking out a second time around.",5,0,5,23 September 2017
Annihilation," 50 Shades Of Weirdness - In Beautiful Dolby Vision
","So apparently there were concerns that this film was too intellectual and challenging for the audiences - whaaa? There is nothing particularly interesting or deep about Annihilation. We do get to see some good effects and mildly interesting mutations of plants and animals. All the while the comparison with cell mutations and self destructive tendencies is laboured to death. For what purpose, isn't ever made clear. The performances get the job done throughout the thin script, without getting us to actually care much about any of the characters. The ending, when it comes, is a big anticlimax and doesn't wrap the preceding hours into any sort of satisfying conclusion. It does, however, look absolutely gorgeous on an OLED TV in Dolby Vision. In fact, as a tech demo it's superb.",3,1,2,19 March 2018
