Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," People are too hard on a fantastic film ...
","This film is the pinnacle of what makes going to the movies what it should be:  fun, exciting, entertaining, and satisfied.While many will argue that special effects outweighed the story and the characters - one thing to consider is this;  the original trilogy wasn't very deep in character development - not even Luke himself.  While this film isn't THE COLOR PURPLE, it delivers what it promises.The strength to this film (to me) is the fact that until now, you have seen the Jedi as the 'loner' or 'the underdog' or 'the apprentice'.  You never got to see it as 'an organization' or even more appreciative - as a job. Getting to see the Jedi doing their job as guardians and defenders of justice is fantastic.  With effects no longer an issue, they have taken the task of showing you what it was really like to a new level.  While I feel they could have shown other Jedi 'working' in the film, I have no complaints - they finally have enough lightsaber play in a single movie now!Yes, the children elements are abound (as I call them 'the comic relief'). However, no more so than Return of the Jedi, and this time, they are done not with Muppet-like creatures but with state of the art computer graphics - which entertains the adults as well as the children.  The complex politics behind the situations should more than confuse the children (I know it didme when I saw Star Wars at 8 years old - Republic?  Senate?  All I knew was 'goodguy-badguy').In summary, there are dozens of ways to feel robbed when you open your wallet (like THE MUMMY), but The Phantom Menace delivers and if you go into the theater ready to enjoy it;  you will.",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
The Mummy," Trailer was better than the movie ...
","Maybe the commercials got me too hyped - or maybe I am just too excited about The Phantom Menace, but this film wasn't what I was hoping for.Let's face it - they tried a bit hard to make it a 'PG-13' film.  This sort of film really needed the content and rating of 'R' before it would have shined.  The character slapstick was often 'too slapstick' to be funny (making it feel far too PG-13ish for what the trailers led me to believe) and while the occasional humor was appreciated, there was a bit much for a movie like this.Glaring little things popping up also distracted me from the film (the obvious Small Pox vaccine scar and the 'desert nomad' having whiter teeth than me).Don't get me wrong - the movie wasn't BAD. It just wasn't the hype.  The pre-title sequence in ancient Egypt are almost worth the price of admission and the FX won't make you gasp most of the time, but has some great treats.
Overall - dollar theater or new release renter in my humble opinion, but maybe a director's cut DVD will make up for it.'",Null,0,0,7 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Decent, but not worth the hype ..
","This movie was worth watching once, but the overall hype and press around it made it rather disappointing.  Certainly a cheap renter, not an owner movie.What COULD have saved it from the hype would be if they had expanded the substories (the helping of the ghosts) much more than they did.  Instead, the most captivating part of the film was lost to its brevity.I'm not sure the reason for the hype behind M. Night - but frankly it isn't warranted.",Null,0,0,17 March 2001
Final Destination," Great thriller ... worth watching ...
","Its been awhile since we've seen an original spine-tingler like this (Sixth Sense doesn't count - shame on you).Believers in Fate will tell you that when it is your time to go, it is simply your time to go.  You can't stop it, only embrace it.  This film shows a group of teens that cheated Fate (and death) by (some of them accidently) getting off a doomed plane.The teens try to get on with their lives, but one by one, Death comes back to even the scales and put fate back on track...To tell more would ruin what comes as pleasant surprise after surprise. Sure, as with any thriller, some things you see coming.  Many things - in this case - you won't.Good cast of 'no-namers' basically - which adds to the believability of any good film.  Some of the photography of the film will make you shudder (like when the plane goes up).  And the storyline is actually original for once.I'd highly recommend the movie - if not at a cheap matinee at least on DVD when it comes out.",Null,0,0,1 August 2000
