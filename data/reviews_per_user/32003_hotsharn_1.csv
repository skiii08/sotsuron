Iron Man 3," like half the script and performances in the movie, it's nothing more than a 'Joke'
","There are some spoilers in this review. Read at your own Peril.Okay... I'm not sure where to start but..I was not impressed...at all, I've not left a cinema so disappointed in a long time, especially for a film I was so looking forward to and had high hopes for.This was not an Iron man film, this...this is a Tony Stark film, that tries so hard to be funny and I don't care very much for a film that over uses cheap gags. Come to think of it, they should have titled it as Iron man, The Adventures of Tony Stark.It's a super hero film that has less action than the rest of the other Hero films, too much comedy which felt forced, Too much Stark (Almost felt like he was another Jack Sparrow. Disney's new puppet?), I wouldn't mind on the cut down action if they actually did something deep and innovative with the character. Newsflash, they didn't other than a few panic attacks that amount to nothing, it just seem crow-barred in, so you know, we the audience can see he's struggling with previous events -_- The Villain The Mandarin was nothing more than a Joke and nothing as he should be or what he was meant to be like (The mystic! Which would have been more interesting). Thats actually possible too, making a strange character interesting, look what they did with Bane in DKR. They could have done that with Mandarin, I really did not like Guy Pierce as the Villain. At all, he was boring, annoying and just unsatisfying, he's not someone I'm going to remember for an incredible performance or anything remotely quotable. He just lacked a decent agenda.It was a big come down after the Avengers. It risked nothing and was nothing more to cash in to the Tidal wave Avengers caused, I was expecting something interesting something that would blow me away, nothing in this film moved me, you could see everything coming aside the crap twist with Mandarin.When I first see the trailer, I thought it was going to be a dark story, something that was going to be deep and powerful and not just 'another sequel' I wanted to love this film, but I just found it poor, there was NO real motivation in the plot, would have been more interesting if Pepper was the one in the Coma fighting for her life rather than some dumb ass security guard just so they could do a gag about downtown abbey at the end.Also they did an entire scene that was probably the best part of the film that never frocking happened and I HATE S*** LIKE THAT! It's like a slap in the face and p****** me off! It was one of the best scenes and possibly the best part of the film and it was ruined.The entire fight scene at the end was turd, It was like a 5 minute toy advert! Look at all these cool suits to collect kids! Which apparently we are led to believe he built all of them because he couldn't sleep, but these same suits couldn't help during the initial attack because they clearly needed something big for the finale. I thought the film was called 'Iron MAN' not 'Iron MEN'.Now I didn't expect this to be on the same Level as the Avengers, but I expected it to be good as a individual super hero film, The Dark knight Rises came out after the Avengers and did 'it' right, but this, this should have been, could have been so much more. The plot was just messy, scenes felt drawn/padded out (The part where Stark is tied to the table and they use the same gag several times pf-ff) However like half the script and dialog in the movie, it's nothing more than a 'Joke' and As Banner says after the credits 'You lost me right after the Elevator' It's almost as if they knew.Do I recommend this to Iron Man fans? No.Do I recommend this to people who just want to see Robert Downey JR dally around for 2 hours? Knock ya self out.Oh, and Joss Whedon, reportedly said after watching Iron Man 3, 'How do I follow that' My advice Joss, do the bloody opposite.",1,29,61,1 May 2013
