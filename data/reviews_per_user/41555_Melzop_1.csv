Minority Report," Everybody runs
",I watched this movie recently without knowing what it was about but I was surprised by how good it turned out to be! The theme of the future is used many times throughout the years but this takes on a fresh new plot regarding Precrime that I haven't seen before. It was suspenseful and I was engaged in the movie the whole time. Although there were a couple predictable scenes throughout the film It's great actors and amazing director made up for it.,9,1,1,6 April 2020
