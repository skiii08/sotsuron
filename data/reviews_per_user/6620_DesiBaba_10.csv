Skyfall," Not your run-of-the-mill 007.
","This movie may not go well with those who'd like to have Bond movie cling on to a very specific formula. Cars with 'tricks' up its sleeves, futuristic gadgets, and of course, bond fornicating with a slew of femme fatale before taking care of the bad guy. While this movie retains some of that, it is also a noticeable departure from the past 007 movies. Especially the last hour or so, which feels more like a western rather than a bond movie. For my taste, this was one of the better Bond movies in a couple of decades. Even better than QoS and CR, which are both quite good as well. I hope Craig continues to play 007 for the foreseeable future, he is the best bond since Connery. Too bad M had to be replaced, she will be missed. It is not a surprise that this will be the highest grossing Bond movie ever.",8,2,11,11 November 2012
Thor: Ragnarok," Hollywood, please stop making these garbage Marvel movies.
","Gosh, how many of these does Hollywood need to produce? How about we start making movies for adults with real stories and characters? I mean I like an occasional super-hero movies, but this obsession with big budget Marvel movies is turning cinephiles off. I usually end up seeing this with younger family members who want to see these, I would never see these on my own, not even if I get paid to it. And the 8.x rating made me laugh and cringe, IMDb ratings are a joke and totally unreliable.",3,16,28,26 November 2017
Zodiac," Disappointing snoozer.
","The movie is set in 1970s for the most part and chronicles the events surrounding the Zodiac serial-killer in the Bay area. It is an okay movie that appears to be highly over-rated at 8/10 IMDb rating. No way this should be more than 6-6.5 or so. Fincher has had some good ones in the past so I was generous in giving it 5/10 but his last two offerings (this and TCCOBB have been rather ordinary). The movie might be more interesting for people who lived through the ordeal back in the days but for the rest of us it is just an open ended story that might be fictional based on all we know. There might be more than one person doing this stuff as there is no conclusive evidence to identify the Zodiac or to link Zodiac to ALL of the incidents shown in the movie. It presents a view point which may or may not be accurate in comparison with what might have really happened so to me it was a fictional account of what might have been the case (regarding Lee being Zodiac). Police is shown to be rather incompetent and quite bureaucratic when it comes to dealing with jurisdiction. Average citizens are more creative at decoding the cipher or identifying/following up on leads based on the police reports. It is hard to swallow a lot of what was shown as real or likely, more like the writer (Graysmith) exaggerating his own version for whatever reason, seemed disingenuous to me. Movies in this genre generally build up well in the last quarter but that did not happen here. Those who expect some sort of pay off or closure (se7en/Fight Club) at the end will also be bitterly disappointed.",5,0,4,19 July 2009
"I, Tonya"," A dramedy that is neither a good drama nor a decent comedy.
","IMDB ratings suck. I don't want to waste time reviewing this, it was not worth the time even for a free ticket. The direction was poor and the lead actor was not a good match to play Tonya. Characters were totally caricatured and totally lacking depth and nuance. There is a scene towards the end, supposed to evoke some emotion from the audience, but it falls totally flat. None of the characters are likable or particularly relatable. Pity that such an interesting character was made it into a totally uninteresting movie.",3,14,31,3 February 2018
Life of Pi," Decent movie, but very poorly paced.
","Perhaps this is not for those who are not big fans of the book, it may be thrilling to see the characters from book come to life in this movie. But for those unfamiliar with the book, the movie was somewhat tedious at times due to poor pacing. The movie starts out really well, all the way through Pi ending up by himself in the boat (with 3 other animals/people). The remainder of the movie just drags on. If you like glitzy CGI work, it may keep you enticed. But otherwise there is no reason for their journey to be that long in the movie, it could have been cut by 25-30% without any meaningful impact on what it was trying to convey. Debut by Suraj Sharma is impressive, especially considering that he has no prior acting background at all. Direction by Ang Lee is masterful but editing could have shortened the movie a bit more. Acting by Irfan Khan is okay, not his best, not even close. Tabu and Gerard Depardieu were wasted. This may be a good movie for those between 11-17 YO who are not sure about religion and its meaning/purpose in life. As a grown-up, I personally found the meaning to be trivial. Only go if you're taking kids with you.",6,1,9,5 December 2012
Bridget Jones's Diary," Add one more to my list of worst movies ever...
","I simply cannot comprehend why so many people like this movie; I can understand 30 something SF liking it, but no one else. I am a big movie-fan; I have 100s of DVDs and watch 100s of movie every year. I rented this movie on DVD this week and boy, what a waste of time this one was. I don't know what one good thing I can say about this movie, may be that it did not go over the excruciating 97 minutes. Trust me guys, unless you want to be tortured or bored to death, buy a movie that really entertains.Movie Rating: -2* out of 10* (Worst movie of 2001) DVD Rating: 3* out of 10*PS: Academy Awards- To do for 2002 - Stop nominating superficial acting.",1,4,8,22 March 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Overrated movie. Catch it on TV next year.
","I saw this movie yesterday and thought it was a poorly made movie. There were few parts here and there which were truly touching and realistic, but otherwise I did not enjoy the movie. Spielberg said he made this movie as a tribute to the soldiers who lost their lives, he failed to deliver on that tribute. For the great sacrifice we made for the freedom, this was a half-hearted tribute. Tom Hanks fails to deliver as a captain, he is Tom Hanks all through the movie, not Capt. John Miller. Tom Siezemore and Edward Burns steal the show. Matt Damon had very small role, I don't understand why would he worship just John Miller and not others ? Does not make sense(except Dir wanted to add some emotion that was not build up). I mean the two hardly knew each other, just like the other soldiers.Also, it was insulting to see soldiers hang out like a bunch of high-school drop outs calling each other 'morons' and so on. Did that sort of thing happen back in 1944 ? I don't know for sure but it surely does not fit into the scheme of things...May be I had too high an expectation from the movie, in any case I would give it ** out of *****. No Oscar for Spielberg. Supporting Actor Oscar for Tom Siezemore or Edward Burns or even the frightened kid would be good nominations.",4,1,6,18 January 2000
Garden State," Pretentious, dull, and boring after the first 10 minutes...
","I found the first ten minutes or so of the movie intriguing, I wanted to know more about Andrew Largeman. But after the funeral scene the movie is a complete drag all the way to the end credits. Andrew, like the 'retarded' football player he plays on TV, is mentally and emotionally disabled, partly due to the fact that he had been drugged profusely throughout his childhood as a treatment for aggression he would exhibit as a child, one such incident left her mother paraplegic bound to a wheel-chair for the rest of her life. Four days, a few drugged orgies, and two days of romance later he may have found his way out of his 'disability'. But the journey there was dull and uninspiring; weird cannot substitute for experiences that are meaningful and truly transformational. Good soundtrack or cast does not always equate to a good movie without a script of substance.",5,1,2,18 January 2010
Edge of Tomorrow," Like playing a video game...
","Have you ever played a FPS video game? You get better as you play the same scenario over and over, figuring out ways to survive longer than the previous iteration. That is what this movie felt like. Cage taps into Omega, the central nervous system for aliens (aka 'mimics') invading the planet. Among other things, this gives him the power to 'reset' the day and start over when he dies or is killed. This is an interesting concept and lends itself naturally to some comical situations. The movie is a good mix of action, humor, sci-fi, while still promoting some thinking on the part of the viewer. I thought the first 10% and last 15% of the movie was a little dull, but the rest is edge-of-your-seat exciting. Surprisingly there is humor throughout, and it is well timed and works.",8,4,9,29 May 2014
Halloween," Super lame horror. This may be horror for those with super low threshold.
","I am a huge fan of horror movies. I have watched most of them. I had never watched the Halloween original, had watched one of the other ones and found it to be quite lame. So one weekend when I did not have anything better left in my Hulu queue, I started the original Halloween. Boy, this movies is super lame. There was not a moment in the movie where I felt on edge or did not anticipate what will come next. This as formulaic as any horror movie can get. I lived in a single secluded apartment complex across from a cemetery, occasionally some horror movies get in my skin for a while. But this one did nothing, NOTHING. No rush as tall. This may tickle those with super low threshold for getting scared, it didn't do a thing for me. Grossly overrated crap.",3,6,14,1 December 2012
