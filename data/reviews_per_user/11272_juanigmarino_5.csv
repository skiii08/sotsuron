Hereditary," Masterpiece if you can taste it. Not for everybody
","I am a big horror movie fan. I watch every horror movie release in theaters, when I talk about this movie, I compare it to the shining, two awesome movies which are scary, but the first adjective I come along thinking about this movie is awesome movie, not scary . This will be a future classic. Since The shining I haven't seen anything similar.",9,1,4,21 October 2019

It Chapter Two," so dissapointed!!
","It is an insult to the original film. I really love the 1st chapter because it sticks to the original story. This one is terrible. It is not a horror film, it is not a comedy I don't know what it is. Just wasted 3 hours of my life.I give 3 stars because I am a pennywise hardcore fan.",3,0,0,26 September 2019
Halloween," Best slasher film ever made
