Catch Me If You Can," Catch Me...
","This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic movies like Jurassic Park, Schindler's List and E.T., yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end. Dicaprio is believable as a guy that can convince people that he's someone else. Dicaprio is a charmer and is very smooth as we watch his character do some fancy talk to the young ladies. Tom Hanks as the FBI agent reminds me of his cynical character that he played in 'A League of Their Own' and his mere presence adds more to this film, perhaps more as we see him in 2nd lead Just like the opening credits, this film is very much a chase movie with a nice sense of period. The plot starts at the end and jumps back to see the whys and the hows of the tale. It is told with a slick energy that keeps the story moving and never really lingers on any scene longer than it has to. It is for this reason that the two hours goes by relatively quickly. When his parents file for divorce and he has to choose between them for custody, Frank Abagnale Jr. runs away from home. He begins to con his way around - getting better and better at it with each step he takes. Posing as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor he earns his money from cashing forged cheques. He is able to do all these sort of crimes inspired by comic books and experiences he got from things around him. As the numbers go up, FBI agent Carl Hanratty starts tracking him in a game of cat and mouse. Overall this film is a slick, stylish chase movie which should be enjoyed as such and is more enjoyable for being a true story. If anything it is a little too slick for it's own good, but that is a petty complaint to make against a film that kept me pleasingly entertained for the entire film length!! To be fair – the film didn't sets out to be some massive thought provoking film; it was a chase movie and it was a very stylish and enjoyable one at that.My Rating – 9/10",9,2,3,6 February 2013
L.A. Confidential," L.A. Confidential (1997)
","People seem to feel the need to compare this remarkable film with the film noir genre as well as with the time honored classic Chinatown. Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... 'Go back to Jersey...'), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it.My Rating 9/10",9,1,2,25 August 2013
Milk," Milk (2008)
","Going through Harvey Milk's story was sad but extremely inspirational and looking at what people said about him, he seemed like the most lovable guy in the world. He was funny, charming, and just a wonderful person to be around, it was extremely sad to find out how his life ended and over something so stupid. Milk was made with great taste and Sean Penn delivers the performance of a lifetime playing Harvey Milk Unsatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Harvey Milk decides to move to San Francisco with his boyfriend in hoping of a better acceptance. They open Castro Camera in the heart of Eureka Valley, a working class neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly gay neighborhood known as The Castro. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a gay activist, eventually becoming a mentor for Cleve Jones. After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the California State Assembly, Milk finally wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in the United States. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White, a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially conservative, has a difficult relationship with Milk. He faces more problems as Proposition 6 is about to be passed. It's only a matter of time until someone gets angry with Milk and decides to deal with the matter themselves. It is not all that surprising when we discover who kills Milk and Mayor George Moscone, but it is all the more thought-provoking.I highly recommend anyone to watch Milk, as the film was extremely moving and really makes you think before you say something stupid because someone else is different from you, not just sexually, but in general. It really breaks your heart to see how hard it must be for people who are different to express themselves and to be rejected by society. Sean plays Harvey with the love and compassion that the real Harvey would respect. Sean Penn's performance as Harvey could not be bettered by any actor living today, so we owe him a great debt for making this movie, and giving his heart and soul to the role. I believe it is Penn's most mature yet also most lovable role ever. I wanted the movie to go on and on, because I felt like I was actually there in San Francisco in 1978-79. Gus Van Sant recreated that world perfectly, and Sean Penn showed us the potential of this very real man with this unique ability to inspire and transform us. Van Sant and Sean Penn each earned a very special chamber in Heaven for giving us this beautiful tribute. This was a phenomenal look into politics and equality among all men, and was very inspirational and moving from the opening scene to the closing credits.My Rating -9/10",9,0,2,6 February 2013
The Town," The Town (2010)
","I must admit that I hate Ben Affleck and don't watch his movies usually because I personally think he is not a good actor, but I watched this movie just because of his good show as a debutant director in Gone Baby Gone. And I must say he did a wonderful job here continuing from where he left in 2007 and if you ask me he could possibly be the next Clint Eastwood in the making if he keeps growing from here in the field of Direction. Adding to that, I think his effort out here will definitely earn him the Oscar nomination this year. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) was born and raised in Charlestown, a blue-collar neighborhood in Boston, where crime is a part of life. Charlestown is the world's capital for carjacking, kidnappings, and armed robberies. The tricks of the criminal trade are passed down from father to son. Doug is the brains and ruthless leader of a gang of bank robbers who have been able to get out clean after each bank robbery. But Doug knows that his luck will not last forever, and he is looking for one last big heist that will give him the chance to leave the town in his rear-view mirror. But no one will let him, especially, his right-hand man Jeremy (James Coughlin); because he believes that it would be a personal betrayal to him, and he is not going to allow that. In a recent bank job, Doug forced the bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) to open the safe, and then took her hostage as leverage for the getaway, eventually setting her free unharmed. Doug knows that he should leave Claire alone, but she only lives four blocks from him, and he can handle it, but he begins to fall for her. Their romantic involvement is about to take them down a perilous path. The film also has a terrific pace to it. It does have very little action scenes in it and they are not really needed to make this film more exciting. I say this because the lives of these characters become so involving to us that we really want to see what happens between them and what decisions they make and we do get in a sense to even care for them. It is so involving and fascinating that the over two hour running time is rarely felt because everything is so captivating. I would not single out a single performance as being the best because I think the whole cast does good work here. The direction is tight and focused and really brings the film together and makes for a really entertaining and thrilling watch. I personally liked The Town better because I really felt we got to know these characters better and the on screen chemistry was great. This film also successfully blends different genres including drama, action and even romance and all were pulled off terrifically and it felt more human to me. The Town is one of the best films of 2010 and I am glad it is doing so well with audiences and at the box office.My Rating- 8/10",8,2,3,6 February 2013
Notting Hill," Notting Hill'99
","It was a pleasant, simple and mostly implausible romantic comedy about a famous fictional actress and the man that loves her. A romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts is not normally my sort of thing but sometimes, a good girlie film such as 'Notting Hill' can be just what the doctor ordered. 'Notting Hill' is one of those movies for people who appreciate the particular British sense of humor. British humor is a full plate, let's face it. This movie, when it comes to humor, romance and simplicity, is at the same level of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Bridget Jones Diary', which makes it a good alternative to these movies. Although it contains some vocabulary of discussable taste, it isn't profane at all and doesn't contain dirty humor which makes this a much more intelligent movie.The characters here are interesting and humorous, without being great (in fact they deliver an ordinary performance especially Julia Roberts). The supporting characters, on the other hand, have more depth than I expected. Unfortunately, it's not their story. Nevertheless, the actor who portrays Spike is who makes this movie so hilarious. Spike is so goofy, so silly and so humorous - congratulations to the actor (Rhys Ifans) who played him, 'cause he did a perfect job for this kind of role. I really didn't like the overuse of pop music in the film, especially the overblown music used to bookend the film. It felt a little tacked on or inorganic to the soul of the film and almost seems to try to 'sell' the scene as emotionally related to the piece of selected music. In terms of romantic comedy, this film basically gets the touchstones right. There are quirky, but fleshed out supporting characters. Silly scenarios are quite good. It's cute enough to be smile- making funny, albeit nothing laugh-out-loud. It's likable.My Rating - 7/10",7,1,3,7 February 2013
Before Sunset," Before Sunset- Perfect way to explore your Love.
","I think most people will find this movie more interesting than Before Sunset (the prequel) because the characters are 'more mature' in this movie. It plays out in real time as the characters spend one afternoon together in Paris.It has been nine years since events of Before Sunrise happened. Now Jesse has written a novel named 'This Time' accounting the happenings of his time with Celine as per the prequel of the movie. To promote his sales in Europe, Jesse on his last stop at Paris happens to met Celine, though this time it was not accidental and Jesse has to leave Before Sunset to catch his flight back home. Jesse is now married and has become a writer. Celine is there with boyfriend of hers ,who is a photojournalist. CONVERSATION continuing from the last movie has gone a level or two ahead and maturity is pretty much visible First it appears that both leads are leading a pretty happy life. In fact it is not. It becomes clear in the course of their talk that both are dissatisfied to varying degrees with their lives. Jesse reveals that he only stays with his wife out of love for his son. Celine says that she does not see her boyfriend very much because of his commitment towards his work. A meaningful personal talk at wonderful locations of Paris and great shots of steadicam followed by awesome Screenplay says enough in itself. Life is unpredictable. If Jesse and Celine exchanged some contact information with each other, the story would be different. But there were not so many 'ifs' in life. You must grasp the opportunity or regretting is unavoidable. The themes in their conversation have a universality to them, and the connection between the characters makes the viewer forget that there is a clash of cultures, for she is French while he is American. The film manages to isolate bits and pieces of what it is that truly connects two strangers - soul mates in a once or twice opportunity in a lifetime. Personally to me,Before Sunset is better than its prequel because the characters Hawke and Delpy wrote the dialogue themselves inspired from their respective personal lives & conveys message of many unsaid things regarding LIFE in a pretty convincing way.

Good Will Hunting," Good Will Hunting '97
","Highlight: Nominated for 9 Oscars and won two Oscars that includes Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (Robin Williams) and Best Screenplay (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck) Good Will Hunting proved to be a rise to Stardom for Matt DamonThis is an intelligent film about Will Hunting (Matt Damon) a young genius, who because of his disadvantaged and abusive childhood, ends up as a janitor at MIT where he could easily be the head of the Mathematics department. Though the story is a bit far stretched (it is hard to believe a kid this bright wouldn't have been noticed by someone who would have guided him towards higher education), once you put that aside, it is a fascinating character study of a very complex and dynamic young man. Will is discovered after solving a math challenge left on a blackboard by the head of the math department at MIT. This throws his life into turmoil, as the mathematicians want to make him into a prodigy. He also begins seeing a therapist (Robin Williams) who forces him to confront many deep emotions and experiences he had been repressing. The effect this has on him, and his relationship with his friends is powerful and makes for an engrossing tale. The cast is well-assembled with Matt Damon delivering a fine performance which snagged him his only Oscar nomination till date. Minnie Driver, as Will's love interest, also landed out with an Oscar nomination. Robin Williams won his first Oscar for his role after three previous nominations. The rest of the cast is solid, particularly the under-appreciated Stellan Skarsgård The story is interesting and quite entertaining .The comedy is done well and placed well throughout the film. I do have a complaint about the film that is the absurd amount of swearing in the film. I agree that sometimes it is necessary, but there is a truly unnecessary amount of language in the film. But please, don't let that discourage you from seeing the film; it is a great film to watch. Overall, 'Good Will Hunting', despite the incredibly precious title, is worthwhile a film. Fine performances and a compelling (Oscar-winning) script combine to produce a memorable film that should be fondly remembered for years to come.My Rating - 8/10",8,1,3,7 February 2013
Gran Torino," Gran Torino
","Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran. GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on American Family While at first it may look to be another episode of Dirty Harry or 'What would a retired Dirty Harry do?', this is a much complex movie. Yes the character depicted here by Clint Eastwood, has some similarities with his 'Dirty Harry' character, but in the end, he's very different from him (you will get what I mean, if you watch the movie).I wouldn't call this a masterpiece yet it is a great movie, a little slow paced but entertaining enough. Eastwood here suffers from the abandon of his family and the death of his wife. For an old man, it could mean a depression and neurosis but he's capable of teaching a young boy what life is about. He also demonstrates he's a kind man and with an exquisite sense of humor. The movie is about Eastwood learning tolerance and befriended with Hmong neighbors. He befriends the young girl there, Sue and her brother, Thao. Thao has a cousin in a gang that keeps trying to get him to join and Walt becomes involved. The racist jokes and commentaries suit the movie's tone. Those dialogs are filled with black humor and tongue in cheek humor. Although Bee Vang delivers a great, emotional performance as Thao 'Toad' Vang Lor, he is eclipsed by Eastwood's performance as Walt Kowalski. Some sad moments will even make the viewer feel mad and hate the gang members. But Walt Kowalski is an old matured guy and knows exactly what life and it's burdens mean.So through his experience, fierce attitude, badass behavior, and unique sense of humor, he teaches Thao a lesson of life. The way the plot unfolds is awesome to watch. From an unapproachable and unpleasant old guy to a friend you can rely on in times of need is a pretty amazing transformation, and the film excels in detailing this change. The film spends almost 25 odd-minutes to prepare the viewer for climax, which left me engaged, worrying about the calamity that might happen. This sort of suspense and engagement is almost unprecedented. And when the inevitable climax finally happens, I felt overwhelmingly sad within myself. Yes, 'Gran Torino' is profoundly moving and must watch for any EASTWOOD fanMy Rating - 8/10",8,2,3,6 February 2013
Donnie Brasco," Donnie Brasco: Brass, Brassiest, Brasco
","The first time I watched Donnie Brasco, I did so with a bit of trepidation. The director, Mike Newell's previous work was Four Weddings and a Funeral, which didn't exactly line up well with gritty crime drama.The story itself is based on the real life story of Federal Agent Joe Pistone, who went undercover as the titular Donnie Brasco to infiltrate one of the crime families of New York. Donnie meets Lefty, an aging hit-man who takes a liking to Donnie and they form a rather strong friendship. Soon after, the mob starts going into internal turmoil, threatening Lefty, Donnie and their associates. Meanwhile, his longterm undercover stint, and growing role in the mob, causes problems in Donnie's real life family. Overall, it's a very convincing drama and the pull-apart between the mob world and his home life credibly strains the character. Also amazing is to watch Al Pacino's Lefty, a truly interesting character, a hard man who's feeling left out of the spotlight after years of service. The relationship between Donnie and Lefty is believably built, along with Donnie's entry into the mafia underworld.The film is well produced as a late 90's film but also manages to get the 70's details done well enough that, if not for its production polish, you'd think it could've been shot in the era. Performers are top notch, with Jonny Depp showing a strong transition from quirky young character actor to dramatic leading man material and Al Pacino showing that he can be subtle with a remarkably subdued character.Watching Donnie Brasco again was a treat and I'm pleased to say it holds up very well. I sometimes feel that it just suffers from being undermentioned when it comes to strong crime/mob dramas. With such a potent story of friendship, loyalty and self-destruction at its core, great performances, a solid production, it's a film that deserves a more mention. So, if you haven't seen it and you're up for a crime drama, I can recommend Donnie Brasco without reservations. My rating is 8/10.",8,1,1,6 February 2013
When Harry Met Sally...," When harry Met Sally- Highly Recommended!!
","Highlight : Went on to be a Trend Setter among Romantic Comedies'When Harry Met Sally...' is one of those rare, one in a million motion pictures that becomes a cultural icon. It's been needlessly ripped off, and endlessly spoofed since its release in 1989. There have been romantic comedies that don't quite appeal to me, but When Harry Met Sally is just wonderful. It is for me everything a romantic comedy should be, funny, witty and charming. The screenplay from Nora Ephron got nominated for an Oscar, and so it should have done. There were times when I laughed out loud (I'll have what she's having), and other times when I was like 'that's really sweet'. The direction is wonderfully astute and detailed, as is often the case with Rob Reiner ( Director of The Bucket List and A Few Good Men). It's a wonderful romantic comedy about a man and a woman who struggles to keep their relationship afloat after the threat of sex endangers it. Two perfectly cast stars benefit from a sharp script that deeply explores friendship, romance, and the differences between men and women.The New York locations are really beautiful, and the soundtrack is awesome. The lovely story argues the question of whether men and women can ever have a friendship without sex, and there are so many funny and charming scenes, particularly the fake-orgasm set piece. And of course the acting is outstanding. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan(at her prettiest I think, though she was stunning in Sleepless in Seattle as well) are perfect together, while Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby give a real sense of edge to their supporting performances. Overall, a delightful romantic comedy. Highly Recommended!!My Rating - 9/10",9,0,0,7 February 2013
Ray," Love you Ray
","This is the true story of the great pianist and jazz singer/legend Ray Charles (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Jamie Foxx) telling how he became one of the most loved souls of Music that people of America ever saw . He was born in a poor African American-town, and he went blind at 7 years old, but with his skills of touch and hearing, this is what would later in life would lead him to stardom. By the 1960's he had accomplished his dream, and selling records in millions, and leading the charts with songs and albums. But the story also showed his downfalls, including the separation from his wife and child, because of his affair with a band member , his drug and alcohol use, and going to prison because of this. It is a great story with a great singer impression, the songs, including Hit the Road Jack, are the highlights due to which the movie is must watch for any music fan. Also starring Regina King as Margie Hendricks, Kerry Washington as Della Bea Robinson, Clifton Powell as Jeff Brown, Harry J. Lennix as Joe Adams, Bokeem Woodbine as Fathead Newman, Aunjanue Ellis as Mary Ann Fisher, Sharon Warren as Aretha Robinson, C.J. Sanders as Young Ray Robinson, Curtis Armstrong as Ahmet Ertegun and Richard Schiff as Jerry Wexler.Talking about supporting cast, Kerry Washington is superb as the understanding and long suffering mother and wife, Della Bea Robinson as are the rest of the supporting cast. While Foxx does some of the singing, we mostly hear the voice of Ray Charles from his hit recordings. But Foxx is so good we have to remind ourselves that it isn't really him performing them live. The ending feels a bit raffled, as if they were saying Hey the movie is 2 and a halve hours long now, lets put an end to it. But yet the movie covers that needed to be covered, so I tend to forgive them makers for that.A good biopic movie. You don't have to be a fan of Ray Charles or his music to like this movie.My Rating - 8/10",8,0,1,7 February 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," 'I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged'
","'Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not but one of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM'Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a slowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by 'Red' (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the 'hell on earth' they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing 'the guy who can get it for you' with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good 'Forrest Gump.'My Rating - 10/10",10,2,2,7 February 2013
Blow," BLOW : Cocaine Dealer's True Story
","Crime doesn't pay in 'The Ref',director Ted Demme's 'Blow,' a Martin Scorsese-style, biographical crime expose about the real-life rise and demise of Boston-born drug trafficker George Jung. 'Donnie Brasco' star Johnny Depp portrays the amoral entrepreneur credited with stringing America out on cocaine as everyday, ordinary, and even honorable. In other words, 'Blow' is a far cry from Hollywood's stereotypical depiction of drug dealers as despicable dastards. Moreover, 'Blow' treats its convicted protagonist as a saintly casualty of the American Dream, shrewish women, and a self-destructive materialistic society. Veteran moviegoers will spot the allusions to Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' , John Glen's 'License to Kill' , Brian De Palma's 'Scarface'. Johnny Depp gives a fantastic performance as George Jung, a real-life drug dealer whose story is embodied in the 2001 film 'Blow.' Depp also narrates as the viewer is brought through how drugs brought George a life most people only dream of living while it took away the only things that matter.The story spans 30 years and focuses on George's relationship with his parents (Ray Liotta and Rachel Griffiths), his early marijuana supplier (Paul Reubens), and first crowd of friends and spans his various imprisonments, a shift from marijuana to cocaine, involvements with cartels in South America, his marriage and the birth of his daughter. Ultimately, nobody can gripe that Demme's compelling but depressing film celebrates illegal drug use and the criminal lifestyle. 'Blow' opens and closes with references to George Jung's status as a Federal prisoner. Director with Depp weaves a very engrossing story here, that I still believe is yet to get recognition. The last thing I would have expected was for a film like this to bring me to tears, but Depp's final scene does. A sad morality tale, excellently told. Highly recommended.

Raging Bull," Raging Bull (1980): The rise and fall of Destructive Boxing Sensation
","'Raging Bull' clearly ranks as one of the better films of all-time due to it's compelling story of the rise but yet human tragedy downfall at the end. At it's time when done in 1980 the cinematography was fabulous the film's black and white take was a neat and nice concept. Plus the Martin Scorsese does a fine job with the directing as his theme of character study and development into downfall is perfectly done. One could say 'Raging Bull' is about boxing, but it's really about how boxing for one particular boxer shaped and affected his life in positive and ultimately demising ways. Being cautious to call this a sports drama, boxing does play an integral role in the movie without question. It simply goes to show the deeper human stories behind some of the world's greatest athletes and how it's not simply all about hard work and overcoming the odds. There are more themes in the world of sports than just that. It doesn't have to come down to who is going to triumph in the end. In 'Raging Bull,' you couldn't care less if he wins or loses, you just want to see how it affects the rest of life of DeNiro. Robert DeNiro gives a tough and fired up performance as former real life and ex boxer middleweight Jake LaMotta, the film showcases Jake's life and career from the early 1940's till his washed up downfall as a low rent club owning stand up comedian in the early 1960's. The scenes are memorable not just the boxing ones but, the scenes of rage and blow ups from the LaMotta character. Joe Pesci gives a strong performance as LaMotta's brother Joey, he always gives encouragement and advice in an aggressive and upbeat manner, really one of the better supporting roles ever done by him. This movie is a great character study of rage, anger, and obsession just wanting to make your dream happen, but it proves many times that a downfall in the end happens can be sad and tragic. Overall good work from all involved especially Scorsese and DeNiro with a great supporting turn from Joe Pesci. What I liked most about the movie was the depiction of a person who did not hit the deserving note in life even though he carried enormous talent just because of the work ethics he carried. Definitely among Scorsese's best and still don't understand why it did not won an Oscar and losing to Ordinary people is beyond my imagination.My Rating - 10/10",10,2,2,6 February 2013
Before Sunrise," Before Sunrise- Exploring the beautiful art of Conversation!
","The reason why I like this movie and recommend is that it highlights the basic and the most important part of the relationship that according to me is everlasting and forever, is to be in a comfortable position and being able to carry out CONVERSATION to a person next to you and express yourself in an effortless manner..While traveling by train through Europe, the American Jesse Wallace (Ethan Hawke) and the French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet each other and decide to spend the evening together in Austria and go to their respective destinations as they don't have enough time after all. Jesse and Celine shared some great conversation, and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion with each other .On the next morning, Jesse returns to United States of America, and Celine to Paris. Its so wonderful to see in the movie that a guy and gal of early twenties being Conversing and sharing their views with each other and ultimately confessing their attraction towards each other .Ethan and Julie will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years. The duologue's are realistic enough & I still loved the line that HAWKE used to convince JULIE to spend the day with him in Vienna .If you haven't seen the film it is worthwhile just to hear this line and to discover what is the basic art of making any sensible romantic movie .

Munich," Munich (2005)
","Munich ,a thriller that deals with Mossad's response to the siege and killing of 11 Israeli athletes by Black September at the 1972 Munich Olympics, is a near flawless piece. There is a definite message in this film and it's obvious to anyone who sees this movie and understands politics. It's important to point out that this film is 'based on real events' and is not true-to-life as far as the history of Munich's aftermath. If you're okay with that, then it's an excellent story. The Jews had always been a recipient of numerous conflicts and atrocities since the ages of antiquity. They had been involved in slavery, territorial conflicts, racial discrimination and struggle, religious controversies and several other misunderstandings and for that the Jews is considered to be the most sensationalized race in this world. The most often miserable fate of the Jews has countlessly been re-portrayed in film and has captured considerable sympathizers. Since the Jews had been in conflict with different races and countries, their never-ending history of war is not anymore new to the world. And movies with their struggle against countries like Egypt, Greece, Rome and Germany had continually haunted every audience. Spielberg didn't reside on what just actually happened on the Munich Olympics hostage tragedy and its aftermath but it tried to depict the characters' dilemma on their given assignments since the predefined missions were not really clear and pure. Although the veil of nationalism and justice was the major pretext of their elders, Avner(played by Eric Bana) was caught between conspiracies he had no clue of and would somehow fail to understand unless his elders feed him the truth. The already sensationalized history of the Arab-Israeli conflict has smoothly shifted to the dilemma of the character and his allies, giving us a point of view that we need to reconsider and reflect as well as it is often overlooked in most sensationalized and biased situations as that. The memorable aspect of this film are the tragic flashbacks of the events at Munich with the Israeli team being taken hostage to their haunting deaths at the end but to me personally best part was a postscript note that says 9 of the 11 men targeted by Mossad were eventually assassinated. It's again nothing less than a masterpiece from a great director and one could just imagine how Spielberg was able to harmonize and give rhythm to a number of short scenes on the movie to create an overall theme of pure drama and portrayal of the effects of the Black September tragedy in Munich to the individuals related and to the world.

Casino," Casino (1995)
","'Casino' is another modern classic from Martin Scorsese. Drawing parallels with his earlier 'Goodfellas' , 'Casino' again teams Scorsese up with writer Nicholas Pileggi having De Niro & Joe Pesci in lead traditional favourite of Scorsese. The result is a truly engaging tale of mobsters setting up a new gambling empire in Las Vegas and the subsequent ripple effects that involve the local authorities and the police.A joy from beginning to end, 'Casino' is an example of a perfect movie. There's nothing you'd want to change about this film. It's full of memorable scenes that are rich with outstanding performances and dialogue and it simply demands a repeat viewing.Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos. Robert De Niro plays Sam Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and Casino. Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance. As the viewer, you can't stand her, but that is the point. Scorsese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary. A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion. The entire production however, is sleek and very quick. The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorsese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene. Scorsese doesn't just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone. One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of 'Satisfaction' by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.Being a complete movie buff, I generally don't watch films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorsese is definitely one of them. The man is a complete genius, and a gift to any movie buff - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, 'A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies' which was done the same year as Casino. The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres. You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert De Niro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joe Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film.My Rating â€“ 9/10",9,1,3,25 August 2013
Jackie Brown," JackiE Brown- A Tarantino Movie
","Jackie Brown is a 44 year old air hostess who also acts as a money carrier for her boss, gun dealer Ordell Robbie. When one of Ordell's other employee's is caught he is forced to kill him, however, before he can get to him the employee tells the police about Jackie and they pick her up. With Jackie facing jail or being killed by Ordell she strikes a deal with both the police and him to bring in a large stash of money. However to help her retirement she plans to play the game to her own ends. The film is still full of Tarantinoisms for the fans - the heavy soundtrack, the pop culture references, the witty, slick dialogue. It is in Jackie and Max where Tarantino has grown up a bit - although in fairness this was an adaptation rather than his own script, but he still manages them better than some of his own thin characters. Tarantino takes a breather between Pulp and the Kill Bill movies here with a nonviolent drama. It's slow, but it's refreshing. The characters are all well conceived and all of them sustain and give an extra strength to the plot. I appreciate especially two acting jobs: The one by Samuel Jackson, which does one more time the role he does best; Pam Grier, who plays the main role (JACKIE BROWN), and does a magnificent work playing a strong and intelligent woman that can deceive everyone and ends fulfilling her goal. About DeNiro's role, LOUIS GARA, which is not a very important to this movie, I think he does a character with a personality from what I'm used to watch in other movies. Here, he's silent and nervous and almost seems like a 'poor little devil' thief. I think Tarantino did a great job one more time. It's not a masterpiece like PULP FICTION or Kill Bill but it's a great film and must watch for any movie buff Overall I enjoy this film and can understand why it will never be loved to the extent that Pulp was and is. However to me this is a satisfying film with an enjoyable plot and a more traditional delivery. The development of actual good characters beyond snappy dialogue is what impressed me the most.My Rating- 8/10",8,0,1,6 February 2013
True Romance," True Romance'93
","It is one of those movies that combines the genre of action well with the comedy like any of the other Tarantino's movies. Christian Slater plays Clarence, who works in a comic-book and happens to meet a prostitute named Alabama (Patricia Arquette)and soon they get engaged. Clarence then confronts Albama's pimp played by Gary Oldman where In a remarkable turn of events the couple found themselves involved in a Cocaine deal which they stole from Drexl(Gary Oldman) and try to sell in tinsel town... In the end you will find yourself caught in the trademark Tarantino scene Mexican Standoff(where roomful of guys waiting to see who shoots first) I like to applaud the efforts of Director Tony Scott for directing this movie well along with the efforts of Quentin Tarantino.MY RATING: 8/10",Null,0,1,7 February 2013
