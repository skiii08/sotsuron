Ford v Ferrari," Not my cup of tea, unfortunately
","I give this film three stars only because it wasn't my type of movie - I am certain folks who are into racing and action films will truly enjoy it. I saw it because it got nominated for multiple Oscars, and because a friend of mine assured me I would like it. Unfortunately, the combination of my lack of interest in the subject matter coupled with the rah-rah Go America message (at the expense of the Italians, naturally) was a bit too much. I do love Christian Bale and Matt Damon as actors, and the technological prowess on display was impressive (sound, editing, CGI, etc.), so I am still glad I saw it. I also appreciated the fact that it was based on a true story and that the Ford Motor Company and the characters involved came across realistically as the less-than-admirable individuals they were.",3,3,6,12 February 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Fan-fricking-tasting!
","I was looking so forward to this film coming out because usually the summer is a dismal stretch of endless loud, stupid blockbuster films appealing to the lowest common denominator. It did not disappoint in any way, shape or form. I was transfixed for almost three hours and got completely choked up at the end, wishing the events of August 9, 1969 had gone down as depicted in the film. Leo and Brad Pitt are shoe-ins for Oscar noms, and the supporting cast was fabulous - each and every one of them. In fact, my husband and I are going to see it again next week (I've never seen the same film twice in the theatre), so that is indicative of just how much I enjoyed it. Well done, Mr. Tarantino!",10,43,67,31 July 2019
