Hereditary," How can I get a refund?
","Who do I need to talk to get a refund? I have to say that this is by far the worst horror movie I have seen in years, worst than The Grudge 5 or Final Destination 15. You get my point. To the critics that posted 9 and 10s, I would like to know what movie they watch because what I watched was the stupidest horror movie even created. The critics that gave this movie good reviews have to be family members of the writer, director, producer and feel pitty for their family members and they just had to support them. Do not waste your time and money on this one, watch ANYTHING else.",1,4,8,27 June 2018
