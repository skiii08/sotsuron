Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Jack's Talent
","A question that has been brought up in the other three movies, is how does Jack always manage to escape, Does he have a plan or does he improvise as he goes? The escape From the Palace answered my question and, I'm sure, many other viewer's. He is simply genius. Of course, he does have to improvise, but all his escapes are planned with a great deal of care. Thus making his captors always remember the day they 'almost caught Jack Sparrow' I'm relieved that this movie had more of Jack than the previous 3. As he is the reason we run to theaters every time a new movie of the franchise is released. A breath of fresh air. Also, it is funny to see how time and time again, Barbosa cannot live without Sparrow. They hate each other but are always thrown together for whatever reason. I really enjoyed watching this film",10,2,3,8 June 2011
