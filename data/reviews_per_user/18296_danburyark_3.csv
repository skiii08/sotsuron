Captain Phillips," A Gritty, Fantastic, Brutally Realistic Film
","When I first saw the trailer for this, I wasn't very interested and only saw it at short notice for a friend's birthday, but I was truly amazed by the portrayal (especially of Abdewali Muse)and the reality that just over 4 years ago, this happened. Some of my friends remarked that this needed more action and that it was boring, yet I found that the film had enough action and was effectively well-paced with a constant sense of fear and apprehension. As I said, the portrayal of all characters was in my opinion; perfect, the unknown actors who played the Somalian Pirates had a perfect sense of helplessness, brutality and fear for their respective characters, and Tom Hanks just oozed emotion with a realistic sense of fear. In the end, the film was near perfect, the only quarrel I have with it is that the film went on for too long, yet I felt every moment was necessary.",9,4,8,19 October 2013
The Maze Runner," Would have enjoyed more if I hadn't read the book
","First off, I loved reading the entire book series and although, I know films are never as good as book; I was expecting this to be excellent. The acting is terrible, except for the portrayals of Alby, Newt and Gally (Aml Ameen, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Will Poulter respectively). Thomas, who is meant to be at least slightly likable is not; he comes off as stupid, condescending and arrogant through an awful performance from Dylan O'Brien. Kaya Scodelario also portrays Teresa quite badly; however Teresa plays barely a part in the film; so I didn't have much to judge her on. The acting is not at all aided by the script; which is badly written and either too blunt or over-complicated.Alby's characterization is well-off target; in the book he is tough-as-nails and very unwelcoming. Whereas in the film; he is very friendly towards Thomas and doesn't come off as a leader. Gally also changes moods too quickly, as he first is horrible to Thomas and then alright and then hates him; while in the book he hates Thomas throughout. Gally is also portrayed too sympathetically; in the book I'm rooting against Gally, but in the film I feel sorry for him and am rooting for him because he honestly makes more sense and seems more likable than Thomas. Chuck is meant to be the sympathetic character and when he dies; it's meant to be like when Rue dies in the Hunger Games; but Chuck doesn't have a large enough part in the film to make that much of an impact.The film is too cramped that it has to skip parts out and rushes other parts so much that half the film doesn't even make sense.The film is marginally exciting with action-packed fights and well-used and not over-done CGI.",7,0,1,12 October 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," Batman Begins Again
","I think the film, overall was not as satisfying as the previous two. I think it was too much like Batman Begins and didn't have enough to do with Dark Knight. I think that Anne Hathaway as Catwoman was a horrendous villain and Bane was quite sinister but he could not compare to Heath Ledger as the Joker, also Bane's back-story was interesting and insightful into the character but I think it was too different Bane's Comic Origin. A question I pose is if Bane was stronger than Batman mentally and physically then how did Batman beat Bane in a fight (considering that Bane was a master strategist). Now I see this as a good thing (as I'm British) but this is an American Film but Batman is British, so is Alfred and Bane and Commissioner Gordon.",8,1,4,28 August 2012
