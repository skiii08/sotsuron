The Blair Witch Project," A lame, irritating movie that is never scary.
","I can't remember the last time I saw a theatrical film as lame as 'Blair Witch'.  Oooh...a mysterious pile of sticks....am I supposed to be scared? The fear of the unseen can be potent in a movie, as evidenced by the creepy forest scene in 'Night of the Demon' (1958).  But 'Blair Witch' is strictly an amateur affair from start to finish.  The characters were poorly developed and not the least appealing.  I didn't care what happened to them. As for the hand-held camera, it was effective for maybe ten minutes, then its effect became irritating...very irritating.  I will say this:  The studio did a super job of marketing the film and generating a tremendous amount of hype.",1,2,3,22 September 1999
U-571," A time-filler at best. Watch 'Das Boot' again instead.
","'Das Boot' proved that submarines can provide the settings for claustrophobic action, intense crew interactions, and nail-biting suspense. Unfortunately, 'U-571' fails miserably on all three counts.  The culprits here are obvious plotting, mediocre acting, and pedestrian direction. The film has one legitimate surprise (no plot spoiler here), but it's way too easy to figure out the rest of the action before it happens.  Harvey Keitel fares the best of the cast, but he's stuck with the stereotypical role of the war-hardened chief petty officer. Matthew McConaughey shows no screen presence as the lieutenant who has to take command.  As for the direction, the film moved too slowly (especially at the beginning). Since I was always sure of the 'U-571''s outcome (unlike 'Das Boot'), the suspense factor was the film's only lure and it was simply too weak.",3,0,1,16 May 2000
Gladiator," Pretty good, but this overrated historical epic lacks heart.
","'Gladiator' has a lot to commend it: Awesome fight scenes in the Coliseum, haunting images, and fine (albeit brief) supporting turns by Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi.  But it's ultimately a three-character movie (Maximus, Lucilla, and Commodfus)and none of those three characters are all that interesting. The ending should be devastating in terms of emotional content, but it just lacks the heart of earlier Roman epics like 'Spartacus' and even 'Quo Vadis'.  And, despite the lavish computer-generated effects, the film is sorely missing an epic scope.  Contrast Commodus's arrival in Rome with Cleo's spectacular entrance in the '63 'Cleopatra'.  Maybe the latter film wasn't all that great either, but it captured the scale and pagentry that 'Gladiator' misses.",5,0,0,9 May 2000
