Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino Does the Impossible
","Quentin Tarantino actually does the impossible:  He is able to get David Carradine to act.  And act he does, for one of the best and possibly ONLY performances of his career.  The final chapter of the second volume is incredible...although predictable...I also love the fact that they use Gordon Liu, not once, but twice in the movie.  I have enjoyed the popular Chinese movie star with my two boys for a number of years and it was a hoot to see him playing Pai Mei;  he did, in fact, play a student of Pai Mei in the movie, Fist of the White Lotus (a movie that one should see WITHOUT subtitles 'cause they are generally the same color as the background and completely invisible for much of the movie).There were fewer interesting villians in this movie; however, it was the better of the two 'volumes'.  Killing is all well and good in an action movie; but, the truly evolved action movie sends you out of the theater thinking...and not about how to rig up a motion detector, fertilizer-bomb to rid yourself of your neighbor's barking dog.  You will remember the 'Bride', Bill and O-Ren Ishii for quite a while...I'd give this movie three and a half out of four stars....",Null,0,1,4 May 2004
Citizen Kane," One of the Greatest Movies of All Time? Or Just a Lot of Stuff That Happened?
","I watched this for the second time in my life, with my oldest boy. Although we love stupid movies, there is also a soft spot in our hearts for well-crafted older movies as well...Was this movie well crafted? Yes, although not on an empirical level. Welles seemed to be producing this film on a gut level. He seemed to know which rules to break and when to break them. Indeed there wasn't a single likable character in the entire movie. Most of the women in the movie are better thrown back into the cast of Macbeth. I understand that the women are intentionally bad to illustrate what Kane experienced with the fairer sex after his mother gave him away. Brilliant casting of Agnes Moorehead in that role, by the way...Kane's two best friends are a gad-about and a sychophant. The only reason that you feel anything for these men is that Kane turns out to be such a dastard...I think, though, that basing a movie upon the psychology of a man was a very dangerous premise. Let's face it: Welles was a genius. Not only in his production of the film, but in his acting. His scene with his second wife where he begs her to stay with him is utterly amazing. He has an age in his face that makeup could not possibly have been responsible for.The movie world was growing up. This movie walks a line between older dramas and modern dramas. It is a dark and unhappy movie; however, in many cases that will be overshadowed by the sheer brilliance of the production as a whole.",Null,3,9,13 December 2004
Oldboy," Been hearing about this movie for ages
","I've been hearing about Old Boy for years. I finally ordered it from Netflix.The movie was well-made. That I expected; however, what I didn't expect was the plot. You know before you watch it that there is going to be a twist. You expect it in the normal places, but the revelations are disappointing. Then, the twist makes itself known and blows you away...There was some humor in this movie. The acting was excellent. The direction and cinematography were well above par. The movie is very violent in spots, with some nasty dental violence. Beware if that bothers you...",9,0,3,21 June 2010
Spider-Man 3," Too Many Subplots?
","I was wary of seeing Spiderman 3 after reading the reviews in newspapers and on IMDb; however, the movie was as good as the first two. I think that there are many who don't realize the amount of Spiderman's plot that actually revolves around Peter Parker (in the comic). Like it or not, if you watch or read Spiderman, you will be spending a lot of time watching the mediocre life of a lovable nerd.The movie had three villains and each villain had a story behind him. Some of the stories were well thought-out and well-acted. Some of the stories were simply thrown together without much thought. The special effects were strong and the acting, for the most part, was strong as well. The most disturbing personality in the movie is that of Mary Jane (Parker's girlf). As a stage actress, she spends so much time second guessing herself that she destroys her relationship with Parker.Bugle editor J.J. Jameson is especially funny in this third installment of the Spiderman series. Enjoy!",8,0,0,14 May 2007
Underworld Awakening," Better than I've Been Led to Believe
","I ordered this movie from Netflix with some trepidation; but, I was pleasantly surprised. It was a good movie. Maybe not as good as Underworld: Evolution... more on par with the first movie of the series.The character Michael was missing from this one. I expected that to hurt the movie. It did in that they felt compelled to keep mentioning him. But, the relationship between Selene and her daughter more than compensated...Humans get killed in this one, unlike the other Underworld movies. The vampires are no longer the arrogant royalty that they once were. Admittedly, that was part of the fun of the previous two movies...the British accents and the air of self satisfaction. The hunted vampires are less fun...But, Selene, is grouchier than ever. She manages to destroy anyone chasing her without a second thought. In one scene, she calmly walks away as bullets tear through her milky white flesh (sorry... got caught up in it for a moment). So, with a super-powered Selene, they have to break out the giant werewolf. This makes the epic battle at the end interesting.I did notice a LOT of similarities between this movie and Ultraviolet. When you watch it, it won't be hard to discern. I give it an eight out of ten...",8,2,5,2 February 2013
Hero," Too Short...Way Too Short
","This was a GREAT movie! It was a lot like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but with almost non-stop action. Jet Li played his usual quiet unassuming, but confident hero. He is a good martial arts star, but he is NOT what made this movie great...The direction and cinematography were what made the movie great. Spectacular scenes like a rain of tens of thousands of arrows and a duel in the autumn leaves. There was the constant blowing of silk in the breeze. It was a stunning motion picture...Ziyi Zhang, from Crouching Tiger and Rush Hour 2, was her usual snarly self.The characters of Broken Sword and Snow were much more complex and enjoyable. In the various retellings of the same story, relationships are invented, changed and destroyed. People die in flashback, only they didn't REALLY die, only maybe they did...who knows.An interesting feature to this movie is that you never see blood on any of the characters (my son noticed this). It might pool at their feet or drip off of a sword, but the wardrobe remains untouched. I feel that this symbolizes the god-like purity of the characters.The only problem that I have with the movie, outside of wanting more, was they death of key characters at the end (I won't tell you which one(s)). As I told my with after Crouching Tiger, 'If every character isn't dead by the end of a Chinese movie, the audience demands their money back'...See it!",9,0,1,17 September 2004
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," So, What was Wrong with it?
","With all of the mediocre reviews of this film, I was worried about taking my nine year old to see it. As it often happens, the movie was much better than the critics conveyed. There was less time on individual characters dealing with their powers and more time on either the four as a team (or Sue and Reed as a couple) or the action. It was interesting that they had the U.S. Army torturing the Silver Surfer, as it mirrors the reports from Abu Garib and Guantanamo Bay. And, Reed's hate/hate relationship with the General in the film is also surprising.Alba is beautiful as ever and she gets a few good lines. The Thing has less screen time than the last film; however, what he does have, he makes good use of.The only problem I see with this flick is the strained angst of Johnny (The Torch). So, his womanizing has caught up with him and he wants something different for his life. The metamorphosis is a little too fast...even for a comic book...",8,1,4,18 June 2007
Shrek 2," Not as good as the first one...but not bad
","The first Shrek had more going for it than this movie in that there were more surprises; moreover, the personalities of the characters were deeper than in the newest Shrek.  Fiona barely speaks at all in this movie and Shrek seems much more two dimensional.  The friendship between Donkey and the ogre doesn't have the same magic.  In short, the movie seems smaller...like a sitcom.But...Jennifer Saunders is GREAT as the fairy godmother.  Antonio Banderas is hilarious as Puss in Boots.  And, John Cleese is very good as whoever he is.Don't expect the same feel as with the first movie and you'll enjoy this. By the end, you should feel some of the same rush you did with the first one...",Null,0,0,24 May 2004
Clash of the Titans," The Clash is with the Original Story
","The producers of Clash of the Titans brought the story of Perseus to a place it has never been to, then told it to get out of the car and walk home. It was definitely no more brutal than being hit in the face with a bag of bronze statues; moreover, it was more interesting than the instructions that come with a hair brush.Fortunately, the story doesn't diverge from the original myth until a good sixty seconds in. Perseus and his mother are found in a box set to the mercy of the sea. So, what motivates Perseus to go on his famous quest to behead the Medusa and kill the sea monster? Why, revenge o' course! The gods killed his family with some sort of ship seeking death ray made out of dirt. Specifically, Hades, the evil death god, killed Perseus' family.Forget that Hades was no more evil than any other Olympian god. The producers of Clash of the Titans felt that its target audience, retarded chimpanzees waiting out a rain storm, would be confused. Also, the original motive for Perseus adventure would've actually required over fifteen seconds to relate; too much time for today's busy, rain-fearing simian. Perseus swims away from his dead family with a hatred for all the gods, effectively silencing any fundamentalists who caught wind of the production...Did I mention Liam Neeson plays Zeus? I'm pretty sure I didn't. He looks pretty embarrassed to be a part of the movie; it almost looks as if there is a professional negotiator, just off camera, in case the actor loses his nerve. Fortunately for Liam, after a barrage of giant scorpions, aliens(?), black Pegasus and a Perseus who looks more like a United States Marine than an ancient Greek, Zeus is pretty much forgotten.And, the effects! A Medusa that seems to have stepped right out of Sim Life; an incongruous sea monster that belongs in a Freaky's cereal commercial (Note: Please bring Freaky's back); and, CGI death and stoning that could've definitely been produced on my son's Macintosh.Ray Harryhausen's silly version of this movie looks like a masterpiece in comparison...",2,9,13,21 April 2011
The Red Violin," A Single Flaw
","In an otherwise perfect movie, I only note one flaw.  The tarot reading was WRONG.  It was so wrong that I, a rank amateur, could tell that it was wrong.  Moreover, the tarot segment was not important considering that the auction was already used to separate the segments.I'll leave the rest to the others who have commented before.  Needless to say, the music is exquisite...",Null,0,1,5 January 2004
Lucy," I Liked this Movie
","I turned this on expecting a Matrix or Desperado type juggernaut of destruction and there is some of that. But, it also has a nice mix of styles. Some Oliver Stone, some Kubrik, some Matrix, some Ultraviolet and a little Altered States tossed in for good measure.Johannson is competent in a role that tosses emotional content out the window pretty early on. Morgan Freeman acts as both narrator to the beginning and a character later on, a little like Shawshank Redemption.The cinematography is very interesting and very vivid.The only thing missing is characters the viewer actually cares about. Lucy commits an outright murder early on, making her alignment very ambiguous. She comes off as amoral and a little scary.I'm definitely glad I saw this movie.",8,2,3,29 March 2016
Jackie Brown," It's the Characters, Stupid
","What makes this a great movie? EVERY character in this movie could stand on his/her own in their own movie.Jackie Brown: This is her movie; but, consider the compelling personality of this woman. She's more afraid of growing old without money than she is of her psychotic boss; so, she coolly schemes away money from a sociopathic killer.Ordell Robbie: The sociopathic killer. Not bright, will kill at the drop of a hat and somehow has made big money in arms dealing. The man has a great ability to convince himself that what is does is justified.Max Cherry: Twenty years as a bail bondsman, encyclopedic knowledge of sentencing guidelines. No fear...Louis Gara: Unbelievably dumb career criminal. The fact that he still breathes is a testament to the reptilian brain.Winston: Bail bondsman who finds people who don't wanna be found 'cause 'that's what he does'.The Judge: Maybe not a compelling character; but, I just like Sid Haig.This movie is actually better the subsequent times that you watch it...",Null,1,1,9 August 2011
Sin City," Mediocre for Rodriguez, Good for Anyone Else
","I liked this movie; however, I was expecting more from the director of El Mariachi...The movie was violent and gory, but in glorious black and white so that the violence seemed a little further removed. The Marv sequence was the most fun; but, I believe that the Jackie Boy sequence was the best and most memorable. NOTHING in the movie was complex...and the plots intersect ever so slightly.Ms. Alba was the most memorable thing about the Bruce Willis sequence. Bruce Willis was just being himself...although, he calls himself 'old man' a lot, despite the fact that he doesn't look particularly old...The images in this movie are probably the best feature. The yellow villain, the old farmhouse, tight alleys... I think that the movie has some things to say about corruption in today's society and that will make the viewer think about the movie; but, the images will be in your dreams...",7,1,3,12 April 2005
The Birds," This is not a flighty movie
","Due to the large number of references to this movie in The Simpsons, my children had a keen interest in seeing this movie.  It's been around thirty years since I'd seen it, so I felt it was about time for a second viewing.Like Psycho, the movie opens with a blond woman who's just a little bit bad. Fortunately, Hitchcock lets her live longer than he let Janet Leigh.  The woman is an unusual character...almost malevalent, even when she is flirting.The first fifty minutes are spent introducing the characters and building relationships.  There is a single bird attack, beautifully directed, during this period.My children were skeptical about a bunch of birds being a threat; however, the scenes of the mass attacks by the gulls, ravens and sparrows MAKE you believe.One last thing:  I'm sure that this is often talked about, but I have to say that I was impressed with the sequence in the schoolyard.  The woman is smoking and listening to the children sing as a few crows perch on the playground equipment.  They cut away for a moment and then there are hundreds behind her.  Very well done...If you haven't seen this movie, I would heartily recommend it...",Null,1,2,19 April 2004
The Simpsons Movie," Wonderful Beyond My Wildest Imagination!!!
","What can I say? The Simpons Movie delivered...At a laugh out loud gag rate of about four per minute, it is easily the funniest movie since Airplane. Homer was as aggressively stupid and a man can be without being institutionalized (actually, he was once, in the series). At one time or another, every member of his family has incited the entire town to mob violence and this movie gives us that and more.Albert Brooks (Dr. Scorpio and Fat Camp facilitator) is back as an EPA official. The character is an obvious slap at the Bush administration (a wealthy man who turns to public service and screws that up). He is intense, dishonest and brutal.Homer is the most compelling character in this movie. Spider-pig is a hoot (wait through the credits for the choral version). There is a brief (very) moment of dark soberness, much like in A Goofy Movie. It passes quickly to a dynamite hallucination sequence.Overall, as a lifelong fan, I give it a nine because there are few tens; but, it is well worth the five hundred or so dollars that it takes to bring the family to the movies these days...",9,1,5,6 August 2007
