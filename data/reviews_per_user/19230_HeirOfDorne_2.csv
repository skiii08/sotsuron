Skyfall," Another Successful Addition
","To start off I will say that Craig is by far my favorite bond, and that I enjoy his movies more than the others. Skyfall is a nice addition to the bond franchise, however I expected a little more. After watching the film it's apparent that Ian Fleming is trying to break the mold that current bond films have followed. The first difference which is slight, is there really is no 'Bond Girl'. In just about all of the films we are accustomed to 007 seducing a gorgeous women and then having her play an essential role in the film. In skyfall however there is no such girl. Bond is then left facing is most recent threat alone. Secondly, it was usually a common theme that bond left England to pursue an external threat. In this installment the threat becomes internal and bond, along with the rest of the secret service is the party being attacked. Unless I am mistaken this is a first for the franchise which may be a positive alternate. My largest critique is that the script was not such that Craig was not able to show his acting skills to the fullest. The biggest disappointment was the lack of twists and turns. Although these are some minor flaws the acting is still superb and Skyfall is without a doubt the front runner for movie of the year. Casino Royal is still my personal favorite.",8,2,10,10 November 2012
Mad Max: Fury Road," No back story.
","First off, I don't understand why people are rating this a 9/10. It is a descent movie, but not great by any means. The visual aspects, and the special effects are out of this world. However, what reviewers seem to be forgetting is that visuals alone do not make a great movie. The only thing we know about the two main characters is that they lived a bad life and were being used as slaves. The movie follows these two characters which we know nothing about on a car chase for 2 hours, that's it. That being said, the movie felt like a car ride to the beach with relatives. Little dialogue, and not leaving the car for two hours. I believe they may have left out a back story to the characters so that they have material for a prequel in coming years. If you like a well developed story with characters that are developed this is not worth your money at the theater. 7.5/10",7,2,7,18 May 2015
