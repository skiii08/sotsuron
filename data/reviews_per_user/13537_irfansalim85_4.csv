It," good remake
","All in all I can say that this is a good remake of the old IT movie with slightly more gore compared to the previous one. It was not as scary as I anticipated, but the story line is still good.Even though I have not read the Stephen king novel of IT but was anticipating the movie. Considering it was the first time watching a horror in the cinema, it wasn't as horror as was being told by reviews. It is more of a thriller and adventure sort of a movie.",8,5,10,16 September 2017
Baby Driver," worth a watch if you like music and fast and furious sort of driving
","Baby driver is the sort of movie with its typical plot and driving scenes as any other conventional movie. Though they put in the health problem to make it seem interesting.It was a good watch and you would sit through the movie enjoying it. But you expect it to be more, which it fails to give.The movie ends on a strange note which sort of makes you feel as if something was left out. It is more of a sort of musical extravaganza with lots of nice music, so if you are watching at home a nice sound system will make you have fun with it. Other than that it seems more like Fast and furious with a touch of music and comedy.",7,3,9,17 September 2017
Get Out," loved the movie
","When i saw the trailer I was expecting it to be a dark movie with a dark ending. Surprisingly it was a fun watch, the movie lived upto its mark and till the end it keeps you fully involved in what is happening. The actors nicely played their parts and till the end you will keep on guessing only to be surprised. A must watch and has been a fun watch for me as well. Not a cinema movie though, I would rather watch this movie at home with a bag of popcorn.",8,10,19,17 September 2017
