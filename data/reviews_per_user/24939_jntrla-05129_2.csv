","Not scary the kids like steal all the scare out the movie i wus thinking like 'am ii watching a comedy or a horror??' i laughed more in that horror movie than i have in many horror movies and ive seen a few horror movies in my life, disappointed, so mad, still mad now that i was in writing reviews mood today and emotions resurfaced . they better do a better job in part 2 forrealz cuz this after all these years and ANYTHING LESS than it not being utterly terrifying pull no punches gritty should never have been made (yeah, i said it, never. should. have. been. made.) bet anyone $20 bucks if the french made this it would b RAW, this is made for mainstream horror fans so they didnt get raw enough with it probably because they thought they would get negative responses , well u know who cares? make your movie raw and uncut i hope they can redeem themselves with part 2. watch this if your heart desires.",7,0,0,21 July 2019
