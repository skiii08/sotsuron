Alien 3," Amazing.
","Darkened golden, oily metal surfaces crusty with grim, decaying technology that has outlived its use, gloomy corridors dripping with nameless dirt: this is the nightmare into which we are released, to race the devil. This is the most hopeless Alien world-scape. It is a perfect dystopia, a terrifying image of a future gone irreversibly wrong. Furia 161 is its own hell, and long before the advent of the monster in its decaying premises, it already harbored the horror of a 'locus horrendous' where distances expand into oblivious recesses of barren bleakness. And that is exactly what transpires through this movie, a bleak atmosphere enhanced by a slow pace digested through a strong set of impressive imagery to which we add a convincing character study that deepens the ruthless onslaught of merciless despair. The viewer is treated to a whole display of intensely disturbing scenes that have a double impact: a visual expressiveness that doubles its narrative relevance and a sub-textual message dictated through somewhat ambiguous lines. '***spoiler*** That is the case of the autopsy done on Newt's frozen body, of which we see preciously little but that hits a nerve nevertheless: the bloodied surgical instruments clanging against the hard blue metal and Ripley's intense anguish are enough to sober the audience into a sense of profound and unrelenting grief. Or the scene in which we hear the sermon on death being but a new beginning: interspersed with the funeral of Newt and Hicks we are treated to the birth of the Alien, thus hinting to yet another possible interpretation that links this passage to the corrosive ending.***end spoiler***Alien3 goes back to the basics: there is only one Alien, and the means to stop it are far from being competent to the task. And our heroine is a battered, hurt and still unbelievingly strong character, bent on destroying the beast within. In a very literal way, this nihilistic installment is the concretization of all of Ripley's fears: we have seen her panic at the thought of becoming impregnated with an Alien embryo, witnessed her formidable struggle to keep innocence alive in the shape of Newt, were privy to her all abiding combat skills being honed to the extreme as she became the icon of never desisting mankind, all this wide range of emotional states have been shared with us, taking this particular character as the medium. And Alien3 seems to raze out all of her former accomplishments, it gives the desolate impression that all of her efforts were for nothing and that nothing can be sheltered and saved from destruction. This time, the enemy is truly within, and Ripley finally becomes the transcendental figure of conquering victory as she embraces her destiny, in the way she deals with all that befalls her. ***Spoiler*** The temptation scene, in which Ripley is offered a life at the expense of letting the Alien species survive, is one of the most intense of the whole series, as is the one in which she decides to forfeit that life for the sake of something greater. It is through this act that Ripley manages to give continuity to her project of an Alien-free universe.***End Spoiler***There are quite a few hermeneutic subtleties that find their way to the gritty, blood smeared screen, and there are a few that most likely escaped me. The role of fire in its most symbolic form, how religious belief is brought to its shocking hollowness when put in contrast with the flesh grinding reality, the inversion and double role of maternal instinct entwined with deadly consequences, the horrifying intimacy and rape-like situation that the Alien's reproduction entails, the complete pervasion of giving birth distorted to an image of bloody slaughter, the duality of gender issues in the awful figure of the Alien, all elements combine and interact to build a strong, fierce and final chapter of the series: making all further entries nothing but flawed and completely unnecessary watered down versions of what should never be duplicated or cloned (read that as you will). ***mild spoiler*** This is proved by the simple way in which the very ending ties Alien3 to the grand original: This is Commander Ripley, last surviver of the Nostromo. Signing out.***end spoiler*** Without a doubt, it is brilliant in its sheer violence, tactful in its emotional appeal, perfect in its thoughtful use of imagery, and altogether sublime.",10,11,18,20 January 2006
Hostel," The Plot less mess or....
","Indeed, Hostel is a very disturbing movie. Not for its graphic content, nor by its inherited nihilism: these two elements, by themselves, do not necessarily vouch for a disturbing cinema going experience. Instead, what does qualify as shocking is the complete lack of knowledge of the director as far as Europe is concerned. Accordingly, completely by passing important cultural aspects and reducing whole countries to vapid stereotypes, everyone in Amasterdam seems to speak fluent German, Slovakia is peopled with evil hearted creatures bent on exploiting foreigners, and Europe, overall, is the arena for sexual pervasion. Yet, achieving a sad kind of balance, we are introduced to a configuration of American clich√©s that walk about in the guise of characters. The joint effect of the process of simplification becomes redundant and ultimately undermines the whole movie, virtually ruining whatever impact it might have sought to achieve. And that impact revolves around, and is centered on violence and how it can dehumanize both those unto which it is committed and those who sustain the injuries. So we are shown a parade of torture scenes that, by themselves, do manage to create a locus of hopelessness and despair and might even make fans of exploitation movies cringe and will certainly earn their praise. Yet these are the only scenes that have any interest and rammed between a slapstick beginning that is painfully bad in terms of both cinematography and content and a random escape sequence that dominates the movie almost right to the very ending when we are presented with a grand revenge. Overall, the only redeeming aspects of Hostel are its adhesion to the exploitation mode and its somewhat watered down social comment that might be elicited from the similarity drawn between the brothel and the charnel house. And I am afraid these are not enough to save a very flawed movie and give it the cult status I suppose it hopes to garnish for itself.However, one thing ought to be said about Hostel: at least it wasn't afraid to portray raw violence at its worst, offering a more realistic approach to the phenomenon than we are likely to find in American movies these days.",4,2,2,28 April 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," There are people living on those hills
","Remakes, either a clear sign that a particular genre and/or artistic approach is exhausted of original content, or a heart-felt and invigorating tribute to a classic effort of cinematography: opinions diverge and each case seems to be so particular as to render too strict generalizations somewhat trivial. If one is to judge The Hills Have Eyes (2006) on how well it achieved what it set out to accomplish- a truly disturbing, violent and convincing portrait of human depravity- then can is fair to say it is nothing short of brilliant. However, it naturally follows that this is not an experience that everyone is likely to enjoy, it does contain very graphic gore and quite gruesome acts of sheer horror which will obviously alienate a certain audience. But, in a way, that is part of its impact. Horror, and particularly this kind of insane gore-driven horror, is not for everyone. Plot-wise, The Hills Have Eyes is nothing amazing, it follows a pattern that has been long established to explore highly tense situations that include as major elements a complete sense of isolation and vulnerability, which is keenly felt by the victims, and naturally presumes a group of villains to 'ignite' the action, so to speak. What is quite well conceived is how these basic structured is handled and delivered to the viewing audience.First of all, the setting was simply perfect. The desert is described with a lucid camera, creating a truly bleak and desolate atmosphere that only gains by reiteration. That we are not presented any alternative location only makes the claustrophobia more sublime. Clever light filters transform the world of rocks and ravines into a near surreal worldscape of nightmarish proportions. In terms of character, we are given enough time to empathize with the people of the movie, and even though it is far from being a study on character, there is more attention paid to the emotional interactions of the characters than what one would expect in such a movie. Which is always refreshing as it adds a grim intensity to the horror such characters undergo. Now, for the monsters. Truly disgusting, viciously horrid, mindlessly abject. And amazingly menacing, their presence is enough to make one uncomfortable. Which does say a lot about people in general and how they react to deformity. Yet, in this case, it is simply impossible not to follow the formulaic rhetoric offered, ugly= horrifying. ****Spoiler****It should be added, however, that this same logic is not strictly adhered to. Ruby, although not as deformed as her kin, is far from normal and she acts as a redeeming force nonetheless. It could also be said that the very fact that she manages to show and feel mercy is only a proof that the actions of the rest were, indeed, the product of a choice and not the result of a genetic pre-disposition. ****End Spoiler****Overall, this is a movie that is not afraid to show violence on screen, a raw and vicious kind of violence that is not diplomatic and makes no compromises with the audience's expectations.And even though The Hills Have Eyes is a cult movie, it is, nonetheless, a coherent work of cinema that displays a mature and sophisticated attitude towards shooting a film.",7,0,1,13 May 2006
Event Horizon," Horror gem
","**contains spoilers* It is a well known fact, to most horror fans, that horror and sci-fi hardly ever manage to come together in a coherent way. The tendency is to let the plots slide into cartoonish 'it's the creature from out of space-here-to-gobble-us-all'. One genre ends up imposing its own clich√©s upon the under, making the ship sink. Event Horizon is not the case. Not even remotely. First of all, as already been pointed out, what matters most about this movie is the atmosphere. It is dark, the angles are odd, all the gore attests to a level of insanity and mindless violence that really IS hell.Instead of re-creating a whole new world or a completely different society as a standard sci-fi would do, Event Horizon takes us to the heart of every day human existence when submitted to endure the horrors of space. And these are Hell. It is psychological horror in that, in a very factual sense, the character's fears end up being their own perdition. The sphere itself may be responsible for some of the most awful sounds ever to star in a horror movie. It reminds me a bit of nails scratching glass only warped out to get under one's nerves. That it truly accomplishes. Event Horizon closes the characters within themselves and once they are trapped, there is no escape. That is also a key element of this movie's power...it's ability to present a ending that opens to a never-ending cycle of suffering in a way that differs from the obvious (you know, shark movies that end with ominous shark tale looming in the distance; haunt-stories that finish with some object being moved around; whatever hero/villain gathering strength from the ashes, all the way to the famous classic The Bulb). I once read a book about the Gothic ethos of horror romances in which it was explained that one of the major sources of fear is morbid reiteration. This movie is a clear proof of that.Disturbing.",7,43,66,27 May 2005
