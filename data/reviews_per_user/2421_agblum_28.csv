The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," For the Most Part - MockingJay Soars!
","'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1' is third installment in the Hunger Games Movie Series, based on the popular young adult trilogy of novels. As per the title, the 3rd novel is being split into 2 movies, ala recent other young adult novel series last installment being split in two movies. As someone who has read the books, I felt there was more than enough material to justify two movies. The movie picks up where the last one – 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' left off, with protagonist Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, living in District 13, after being liberated from the Arena by the Rebellion. District 13 President Alma Coin, played by Julianne Moore & former Game Head, revealed as a Rebel at the end of Catching Fire, Plutarch Heavensbee, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, want Katniss to literally be the MockingJay, the face of the revolution. Katniss is still mad over the failure to rescue Peeta, by Josh Hutcherson, from the Arena, but as one would expect, she eventually acquiesces with a couple of conditions. Jennifer Lawrence is once again outstanding as ever playing Katniss. In the last movie, Jena Malone was the scene stealer as Tribute Johann Mason. This movie it would be Natlie Dormer, as Cressida, the Director of filmed propaganda pieces, that Katniss has agreed films to help spur on the rebellion. In her fairly brief scenes, she portrays a power and confidence in her character. Elizabeth Banks, returning as Effie Trinkett is also a stand out, and Woody Harrelson, also returning as Haymitch Abernathy continue his great performance in the series. For the most part I liked it, particularly the mending of scenes in the book in one of the final sequences in the movie, which effectively build tension, and other variations of things in the book. My rating may go up on second viewing, for now - 3 ¼ stars out of 4.",9,20,55,21 November 2014
Fury," The First Act needed improvement. The Other Two Acts are pretty good!
","'Fury' tells the story of a World War II Tank Crew, behind enemy lines in April 1945, as the Allies make a final push into Nazi Germany. Brad Pitt plays Don 'Wardaddy' Collier, the Commander of the crew. Among the rest of are Shia LaBeouf, Michael Peña, Jon Bernthal, and in a Permance worthy of consideration for an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor - Logan Lerman as 'Norman Ellison', a typist, enlisted as a replacement for a deceased member of the Tank Crew. Pitt and Bernthal's characters particularly show the effects of war – You have mixed emotions about them as the film progresses, as they both do things to Lerman's character that make you despise them, and then later on their actions do make you pull for them. Peña and LaBeouf are pretty likable, and again Lerman's does well as a man forced into a being a soldier, in this rag tag crew, again, where some are morally questionable. The characters do come out stereotypical at times in terms of past performances of soldiers on screen, and pretty much nothing is given on their backgrounds before the war. The first act needed improvement, but the other two acts are good with some powerful scenes. Worth Seeing – 3 1/4 out of 4 Stars",8,3,7,19 October 2014
The Maze Runner," It's Alright - Leaving you wanting to know what happens Next!
","'The Maze Runner' is the latest in a slew of Young Adult Novel Series to come to the big screen – Following 'Twilight', 'Mortal Instruments', 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent'. Outside of 'Mortal Instruments', all of them have been hugely successful at the Box Office, with 'The Hunger Games' getting the most critical praise, and deservedly so in my opinion. Like 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent', 'The Maze Runner' seems to take part in a Dystopian future. I read the first book, on which 'The Maze Runner' movie is based, after I saw the first trailer. While not into the book as much as 'The Hunger Games' Books and the first 'Divergent' Book (Haven't read the others yet), I still liked it. The movie adaption mirrors my feelings for the most part on the book. The movie was not great, but it was alright, and at the end – You want to know what happens next. The movie opens with a teenage boy, played by Dylan O'Brien, ascending upward in a freight elevator. The elevator opens to a bunch of teenage boys. O'Brien's character does not remember his name, nor his past. He is told all of the boys went through this, and he will remember his name in a day or two – and this comes to pass, eventually remembering his name is Thomas. The boys are all living in a community, with a grassy square, they have named 'The Glade', surrounded on all sides by giant concrete walls, one of which opens to a Maze. The oldest boy dates back 3 years being there, with a new boy a coming up in the elevator every month, along with supplies. Some of the boys, named 'The Runners' explore the Maze during the day, in hopes of finding a way out, but must return to 'The Glade' at night, before the doors close, and creatures they call 'The Grievers', who they haven't seen, but heard, come out in the Maze. Anyone who has not made it back before the doors closed has been killed by 'The Grievers'. For those who read the book, there are some changes, but the narrative is generally followed. The young actors all do pretty well. As I said the movie was alright. Sometimes I though additional parts were needed or parts needed to be elongated to make it a great film. But in terms of setting the table for the series (I admit presumably – I will be starting the 2nd book soon), and in wanting to know what happens next – Mission Accomplished. 3 out of 4 Stars.",8,0,1,20 September 2014
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Trust in Capt. America for an Entertaining Ride
","As one person I heard who had seen it before me said, the movie does play like a Tom Clancy and or Old Spy Novel.The movie does a good job of clashing Capt. Rogers's 1940's clear sensibility of right and wrong, to the Modern Day Nick Fury's view of taking the World as it is, not how we would like it to be. The whole movie plays on that issue, and 'who do you trust?' in today's complicated world.For the most part, the acting is very good. Chris Evans plays Capt.Well again, as do Samuel L. Jackson as Fury, and Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff– 'Black Widow'. Anthony Mackie is an outstanding addition as Sam Wilson – 'The Falcon'. He is instantly likable.The one major knock I would give it, comes mostly in the 1st portion of the movie,where the fights are moving so fast, sometimes they are hard to enjoy. I think slowing it down a bit would have made it better.Having said that, it's still a Very Good Movie.For us fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Concluding Act changes things in a major way going forward for the coming films, and no doubt for TV's 'Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.LD'. And as in all MCU Movies – Stick around - 2 Post Credit Scenes.While I didn't hate either Iron Man 3 or Thor: The Dark World at all, I definitely rank this one above those 2. Where I rank it compared to rest – I'll save that ranking after seeing it more.3 1/2 out of 4 Stars, 9 out of 10",9,5,10,4 April 2014
Interstellar," Some Powerful Scenes - Does Make You Think
","Christopher Nolan's latest film 'Interstellar' plays off a number of themes and subjects. The movie is held in the near future. Earth is becoming environmentally unlivable, with Blight and Dust Storms scoring the land. Matthew McConaughey, plays 'Cooper' a Widowed former NASA Pilot and Engineer, turned Farmer, who lives with his father-in law 'Donald' (John Lithgow), Son Tom, and ten year-old daughter 'Murphy', better know as 'Murph', in what I feel is one of the best performances by a child actor in a movie I have seen, played by Mackenzie Foy, as she portrays deep emotion that is impressive for an actor of any age. Murph believes there is a ghost haunting her room, trying to communicate with her. Cooper discovers that the 'ghost' is an unknown form of intelligence, sending them coded messages, by means of gravitational waves altering the dust on the floor, directing them to a secret NASA installation led by 'Professor Brand', played by Michael Cane. Cooper is recruited by Brand for a Space Mission, believing that humanity's fight to survive is a losing battle and proposes that the solution is to colonize another galaxy. Cooper is joined by three astronauts, including Brand's Daughter 'Amelia', played by Anne Hathaway. As mentioned, the movie plays off a number of themes and subjects. To Name Some - The Environment, Science, Space, Worm Holes, Other Dimensions, Passage of Time and Human Relationships – Parent to Child Love and Romantic Love.. The movie does have power moments, and is a visual treat at times, though there is one short visual sequence in the first 3rd of the movie that took part in Space, that didn't look that impressive to me. Caine, Hathaway, and Jessica Chastain, playing an older 'Murphy' as the film progresses give very effective supporting performances. McConaughey, in his first major leading Film Role since his Oscar Winning Turn in 'Dallas Buyers Club', performance gets more effective as the movie progresses. In the end, the Movie does make you think, and the powerful scenes are very emotionally moving. The science talk may go over one's head at times to a point. It is a film I will see again, and it may improve for me. For now, on first viewing, while not among my favorite Chirstopher Nolan Films, I give it 3 Stars out of 4 for it's emotionally moving scenes, played well by it's cast.",8,2,7,6 November 2014
American Sniper," Very Effective and Entertaining!
","'American Sniper' is an auto-biographical film about the life of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle, played by Bradley Cooper (also a co-producer) and Directed by Clint Eastwood (also a co-producer). Kyle was proclaimed the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, having accumulated 160 confirmed kills out of 255 probable kills. The movie traces Kyle's life from his childhood in Texas, to meeting and marrying his wife Taya, played by Sienna Miller, and the birth, & moments of their marriage & 2 children, to his military service following 9/11. The movie portrays Kyle's father teaching him to be one to protect others. This theme plays throughout the film – specifically in Kyle's military service, in that prior to going home for good, he is motivated to finish the task of taking out an enemy sniper, possibly at the expense of the relationship with his wife and children. In short, I thought the movie was great. In earlier parts of the film, I though some of the Dialogue needed improvement, but following that, I have little complaint. I found Cooper's performance very effective. Maybe there could have been one or two heavy Dialogue scenes from his character to add more gravitas to the performance, but perhaps that was just the way the real life Kyle's personality was – And this would be more of reflection on the writing and other aspects of the movie, not Cooper's performance. If you read about the real life Kyle, he seemed to be a very complex individual, and some of his views may not totally vibe with many, including myself, but I feel this should not detract from his service, and certainly not from Cooper's performance in the movie. Sienna Miller I thought was also very effective as Taya, Kyle's wife – who sees that her husband's military experiences are changing him, and simply wants him home. In the end – the movie keeps you engaged and is very entertaining – 3 ½ out of 4 Stars – 9 out of 10.",9,7,24,18 January 2015
Divergent," Solid, Though not Great.
","Divergent is a solid film. For those who read the book like me, it generally remains faithful and captures the spirit of the book well. Shailene Woodley shows great acting chops in the lead role. It's not a perfect film. Sometimes you wanted to see a bit more of the political backdrop going on while the main character is going through her personal journey. Unlike the Hunger Games Films (Of which I love those books - haven't read the 2nd and 3rd Divergent Books yet) thus far, with similar themes - the Movie doesn't peek into scenes beyond the Protagonist's prospective to add depth. But overall the film keeps you interested. 3 1/4 out of 4 Stars.",8,6,27,21 March 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X-Men's Journey into the Past, is a treat in the Present!
","Brian Singer, Director of the first 2 Critical and Fan Praised X-Men Films, return to the Director's chair for 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' brought High Expectations. My Verdict – Singer and Company Delivered!!!The movie does start out a bit slow in the first few minutes, but quickly picks up steam as Hugh Jackman's 'Wolverine' is sent back to 1973, to try avoid the creations of the Evil Robot 'Sentinels' which basically appear set to wipe out Mutants and Humans alike in the present day. The X-Men First Class Cast Members – James McVoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender (Magneto), Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique), and Nicholas Hoult (Beast), reprise their roles for the 1973 setting, 11 years after the story of 'First Class'. The acting from the entire cast is pretty much wonderful, including newcomer Evan Peter's Quicksilver, a subject of on-line worry leading up to the film, is great!!! And special mention should also be given to Mark Camacho, who scenes as President Richard Nixon are well done! The 70's jokes and references are a treat, and the Special Effects are Great!Simply Put – A Lot of Fun – X-Men fans should be very pleased – 3 ½ Stars out of 4!",9,7,11,25 May 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Very Little Fault in These Stars!!!
","A couple of months back I read the Young Adult Novel 'The Fault in our Stars' by John Green, in anticipation of the movie. It is the story of Hazel, a teenager living with cancer. At the start of the story, the cancer is seemingly terminal, but she has survived for the time being. Her mother makes her go to a support group in the basement of a Church - To get out there, live life, make friends, etc. In this support group, she meets Agustus, also a teenage cancer patient, in remission, who has an amputated leg due to his illness. The two fall in love, and I will stop there.If you have not read the book or seen the movie, your mind can imagine where the story goes. I won't spoil it. For those who have read it – It is a good adaption of the book. The First Half of the movie while not bad, is not perfect at times – the Second Half Shines! Shailene Woodley, has some very strong individual scenes as Hazel. She is one of the most popular younger actresses out there (lead of the 'Divirgent Franchise) and it shows why in those scenes. She is bubbly when she needs to be, and can turn serious when it's time. I think she hasn't even become the best she can be yet. Ansle Elgort's Agustus is as likable and charming as you want him to be. Laura Dern is very effective as Hazel's mother, and in his brief turn – William Dafoe is effective as Van Houten - The author of 'An Imperial Infliction' - a book that ended with some unanswered questions, which Hazel and Agustus desire to get, prompting a desired trip to Amsterdam to meet him.I know it is cliché - Suffice it to stay – If you have a heart, you will not helped but be moved – And you don't have to have read the book. 3 ½ out of 4 Stars!",9,0,3,8 June 2014
Gone Girl," While it keeps you interested, in the end - Unsatisfying
","'Gone Girl' is the first most anticipated movie of the Oscar Season to be released. Based on the popular novel, Nick Dunne's, portrayed by Ben Affleck, wife Amy, portrayed by Rosamund Pike, disappears. Nick, the focus of intense media scrutiny, becomes suspected of murdering his wife. The first part of the movie flashes back to Nick and Amy relationship, meeting five years ago, until the present day. Both the characters are writers, and the theme whether they are being their real selves with each other plays out. In regards to Amy's Disappearance, you know that only 1 of 2 things is possible – Which it is – That is revealed half way through the movie. Positives – Carrie Coon's performance as Nick's Twin Sister Margo, whose character adds good humor and or spirit, while a lot of the other characters are often dry, and for the most part Kim Dickens and Patrick Fugit's performances as the detectives investigating Amy's disappearance. I like Ben Affleck, I think he will make a great 'Batman' - for this movie, certain scenes I would say he nails it, and certain ones, I would have wanted another take – so an uneven performance. While Rosamund Pike isn't bad, I would not call it a 'Breakout – Oscar Worthy' performance, as I have heard it hyped. In the end, while the movie keeps you interested in terms wanting to know what ultimately happens, I have to give it a slight thumbs down, and the end of the movie I found particularly unsatisfying. I checked, and the critical response is so far very good. I predict this will be one of those films where critics and audiences for the most part are split, and in terms of the critical reaction, I will think of it as ultimately overrated, and not in the it was Good, not Great way. 2 ½ out of 4 Stars.",7,2,28,2 October 2014
The Theory of Everything," Very Engaging!
","'The Theory of Everything' tells the story of physicist Stephen Hawking, played by Eddie Redmayne. The movie covers the love story of Hawking and literature student Jane Wilde, played by Felicity Jones, coinciding with Hawking rise to prominence, for his scientific theories to the world's birth. The movie portrays Hawking's changing of views on the subject, coinciding with his diagnosis of motor neuron disease related to Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis lateral sclerosis (ALS), a condition that has progressed over the years, and it effects on his marriage to Wilde. Redmayne gives a great performance, as does Wilde – Oscar nominations are likely to come. Overall, the movie does keep you very engaged. It's not a perfect 10 – Perhaps at the start, you could get a little bit more incite into how Hawking came to be interested in his field of study. The protagonists romance is charming at the start, andthe movie is effective in keeping you engaged as the story progresses. 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars.",8,6,11,29 November 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Spidey Swings back into Action for an Entertaining Time!
","I enjoyed 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. It was effective particularly given it was a reboot, not too long after the Rami-MacGuire Movies. Andrew Garfield did well, but one complaint many had was he was very introverted, and it lacked a lot of the classic humor from the character in the Comics. Not So in The Amazing Spider-Man 2! Garfield's Spider-man is much more humorous and outgoing in this one! Garfield and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacey) continue their great chemistry from the 1st one, and Sally Field (Aunt May) also returning is great again. Dan DeHann's Harry Osborne is a true highlight. Jamie Foxx does well as 'Electro'. It should be noted not too much is given on his character's background, but it does little too diminish the movie. Tone Wise, The First 'Amazing Spider-Man' is much better, and much more consistent. The changes in tone, is a fair criticism of the movie, as at times possibly the movie may be too fast paced, but in the end - It was Fun! 3 out of 4 Stars!",8,9,22,2 May 2014
Big Hero 6," Good Messages to Young People and a Lot of Fun
","Walt Disney Studio's New Animated Movie 'Big Hero 6' is based on the Marvel Comic of the Same name. It tells the story of Hiro Hamada (voiced by Ryan Potter), a 14 Year-old genius, living in the fictional futuristic city of San Fransokyo (A hybrid of San Francisco and Tokyo), who spends time participating in back alley robot fights. Hiro and his older brother Tadashi (voiced by Daniel Henney), also a genius, who is a college student, parents are deceased, and they are raised by their Aunt Cass (voiced by Maya Rudolph, of Saturday Night Live Fame). Tadahsi, in order to try to try to get his brother to use his talent for something other than robot fights, takes him to the robotics lab at his University (Where his age will not restrict him from applying), and introduces him to his friends - GoGo Tomago (voiced by Jamie Chung), Wasabi (voiced by Damon Wayans, Jr.), Honey Lemon (voiced by Génesis Rodríguez) and Fred (voiced by T.J,. Miller), as well as Baymax (voiced by Scott Adsit), a personal health care robot Tadashi created. I don't want to go into too much as to spoil the plot, but in a nutshell, a tragic event spurs the plot forward, as Hiro uses Baymax to try to solve the mystery, and the Superhero team eventually forms up. Overall I like it. The film plays has major themes of dealing with loss (Parents and Guardians be warned if you think your kids won't be emotional enough to handle that – It is rated PG), and using your Brain. I like that aspect of it, sending positive messages to kids, comparable to 'Wreck It Ralph' which had the theme that's it's OK to be different. The only major knock I could give it, is I would liked a little bit more time on the supporting players in the movie to begin with. Other than that, a fun ride, with some good laughs, a lot coming from Baymax's programmed robotic personality. 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars.",9,9,24,15 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," An Entertaining 2 Hours!
","The 10th Movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe upon it's announcement was considered a risk. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' is not the among the most popular of Marvel Comics, and is or should I say - was mostly unknown amongst the General Public. To Date, for the Previous 8 MCU Movies, there are some I love, some that I like and or find entertaining - not 1 Dud amongst them. Guardians continues that streak. The movie begins, with a young Peter Quill, played following the opening sequence as adult by Chris Pratt, being abducted as boy in 1988, by a Space Ship, immediately after a personal loss. Fast Forward 26 Years - Quill is now an outlaw in another Galaxy, giving himself the personal moniker 'Starlord'. He ends up hooking up with the 4 fellow outlaws/orphans - Green skinned 'Gamora', played by Zoe Saldana, who is adoptive daughter of 'Thanos', voiced by James Brolin (Last seen post credits in 'The Avengers'), 'Rocket' a talking Raccoon, voiced by Brad Cooper & his partner in crime 'Groot' – A Tree Creature, voiced, and motion captured by Vin Diesel, and The Gray and Red Skinned 'Drax The Destroyer', played by Dave Bautista of WWE Fame. I expected a lot of Humor going in, and I was not disappointed. It's the movie's strongest trait. Pratt's character, when he was abducted, was left a mix tape of 70's Hit Songs. That and some 80's references he makes, help define the movie's personality, coupled with downright hilarious and or quirky humor from Rocket and the other characters. As you may have heard,regardless of what he means to say, Groot simply says, 'I am Groot', as he his has vocal issues, explained briefly by Rocket. This gag if you define it as such, is not overused, and is used very effectively! As per the title, the 5 must band together to save the Day, At times, I feel the Dramatic Quotient of the movie could have been better, and sometimes during the first part the movie, you might feel things are rushed along, but in the end – you are entertained for 2 Hours. And for us children of the 80's - A treat of Post Credit Scene at the very end of the credits! 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars.",8,6,11,2 August 2014
The Imitation Game," A Great Film!
","'The Imitation Game' is based on the true story of mathematician Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who is recruited by the British Government to help crack Nazi Germany's enigma code, to discover planned attacks during World War II. The film tells the story of Turing, who is gay, and has to keep in secret, as it was a crime in Great Britain then, and the efforts of his fellow code breakers, including Joan Clarke, played by Keira Knightly. I think saying anything else involving plot would give major spoilers. Plain and simple – this is one of the best movies of 2014 that I have seen. Cumberbath's performance is Oscar worthy, and Knighty's I believe is worthy of a nomination. 3 ½ out of 4 Stars, 9 out of 10.",9,3,9,4 January 2015
Jurassic World," At times Entertaining, at times Uneven.
","'Jurassic World' is the 4th movie in the 'Jurassic Park' Series, and the first, since 'Jurassic Park III' in 2001, and it takes part 22 years after the first 'Jurassic Park', which came out in 22 years ago – in 1993. Like the other films, this one is led by an ensemble cast. Basic Set-up: Brothers Zach Mitchell (HS Age), played by Nick Robinson, and Gray Mitchell played by Ty Simpkins (Appears to be Pre-Teen to early Teen-Harley Keener in Iron Man 3) go to visit their Aunt Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who is the Operations Manager of 'Jurassic World' a theme park of Real Dinosaurs on Isla Nublar in Costa Rica – first envisioned in the first movie by the character of John Hammond. Another main player is Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt (Peter Quill/Star-Lord of 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and Andy Dwyer of TV's 'Parks and Recreation'), a Velociraptor expert and trainer. Like the previous movies, as you can imagine, things will go array with the Dinosaurs, and chaos ensues. Like the previous films, the Special Effects, particularly the Dinosaurs, are first rate. The cast, which is good mix of races, generally do a good job. The two young boys I thought were outstanding, not a surprised with Simpkins, who was I felt was also so in 'Iron Man 3', 2 years back. While slow at the start, Bryce Dallas Howard improves as the movie goes goes on. Pratt, does admirably playing a character that is not at all a carbon copy of 'Star Lord/Peter Quill' from 'Guardians of Galaxy' which released last summer, heightened him to super stardom – And he got the role prior to 'Guardian's' release. Overall, while at times the film is entertaining, it is also at times uneven, trying to do the dual stories of overall the Mitchell family aspect, involving the parent, and the dynamic of Howard character and her sister – the boys' mother, and the plot line of how things go array with the Dinosaurs in this installment. Both plot lines, particularly the family aspect, could have been developed more, and be executed more evenly. and there are a 1 or 2 moments which just didn't fit. With that said, it still entertains you a great deal of the time. It's an improvement over the last film the series, and overall I would rank it third behind the first one, and 'The Lost World – Jurassic Park'. 2 ¾ Stars out of 4 – 7 ½ out of 10 Stars.",7,5,18,14 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A Fun, Entertaining Ride!
","'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the 11th film entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that began with 'Iron Man' in 2008. Joss Whedon who wrote and directed the first team up movie of the MCU - 'The Avengers' in 2012, returned to do the same for the sequel, and as confirmed by all, barring a changing of minds, or a surprise return down the line. will be his swan song for Marvel. 'The Avengers' is generally considered one of the best, if not the Best Superhero film of all time. The first trailer for the sequel suggested a much darker tone, while the trailers that followed showed the trademark Whedon humor he injected into the first one – indicative of his past work, ala his TV series - 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer', 'Angel', etc., would be there as well. While there is some dark tone to it, with some great moments when it goes in that direction, ultimately most of great parts of the movie for me were the great humorous one-liners, spread out practically amongst all the main players, and one or two non main players. Returning Avengers are Tony Stark – Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America - Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) , The Hulk – Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow – Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansen) and Hawkeye – Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner). A number of their supporting players from other MCU movie figure prominently as well, and they are also joined by new comers – The Maximoff Twins – Pietor – Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson), and Wanda – Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), as wel1 as the Vision (Paul Bettany). The antagonist is the Robot 'Ultron' (voiced by James Spader - Yes – The voice of Tony Stark's computer Jarvis – When you the see movie – all will be clear). In as nut shell – the movie is a mostly fun and entertaining for the around 2 ½ hour running time. It is well paced, so it never feels long. All the characters are given moments, and different story arcs are touched upon with each of them. Sometimes that does create a jumble, and if some were fleshed out more, while it would have sacrificed time for some of the other story arcs, I think it would have improved the movie. Having said that – In the end, while not as good as the original, it is an enjoyable, fun ride, and Whedon's great Dialogue, humorous and non-humorous, when it does hit, and it hits often - shines! 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars - 8 ½ out of 10 Stars.",8,4,11,30 April 2015
Selma," Loved it!
","'Selma' tells the story of the Voting Rights Marchs from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, Alabama of 1965, led by among others, Famed Civil Rights Activist, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., played by David Oyelow. Even though the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ended Segregation and gave African- Americans the rights to vote, those right were being restricted, particularly in the state of Alabama. King, and other Civil Rights Activists were invited by the local civil and civic leadership to protest to repression. While King is the central figure, and the movie does some spend time on him and his wife Coretta Scott King's, played by Carmen Ejogo, relationship, and it's how it's effected by King's activism, the movie is not all a mini-biography o the late Dr. King's life at that point, and gives time to a number of the other prominent figures having do with the marches. As reported, the movie does indeed humanize King, perhaps as a metaphor that just as the way our country was flawed back then, Dr. King had his flaws as well. In the end, King is seen as the man who through sacrifices he and others made, endure to achieve the goal of the just cause of equal rights. I loved it – It was well shot, and well acted – you simply moved with it. Much credit to Director Ava DuVernay, and the production team, including the one and only Oprah Winfrey, who plays Civil Rights Activist Annie Lee Cooper in the film as well. Oyelowo, while performing Dr. King's speeches in the movie, doesn't try to do a perfect impression of the late Dr. King's voice (though that would have been fine if it had been the case), but does try to capture the physical movements, and powerful vocal style, and all around gives a very effective performance. I still have a few more I want to see, but for 2014 Releases – this is the best I have seen thus far – 3 ¾ out of 4 Stars, 9 ½ out of 10.",9,6,15,11 January 2015
Jersey Boys," For the Most Part - Jersey Boys Sings!
","Director Clint Eastwood employs the technique of characters talking directly to the camera at times during 'Jersey Boys' - The story of musical group Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, based on the Broadway Show 'Jersey Boys'. I don't know if the same technique is employed in the Broadway show. The acting performances by all four main players are good – John Lloyd Young as Valli, Vincent Piazza as Tommy Devito, Michael Lomenda a Nick Massi, and Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio. Christopher Walken also does well is his supporting role as Mob Boss Gyp DeCarlo. The first half of the Movie is really good. The second half dips a little, and then turns dark understandably. Usually when the technique of talking to the camera is employed, it is one character. In 'Jersey Boys' the 3 other members of the group to Valli narrate at different points, with only Young talking during a Final Sequence at the end. It becomes Valli's story alone during most of the last 3rd of the movie, while it seemed to be the story of all of them prior, though mostly Devito and Valli, which makes using the multiple narrators slightly odd. Overall – an entertaining movie – 3 1/4 out of 4 Stars.",8,0,6,6 July 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Getting to Tomorrow is what your waiting for here in the movie
","In a nutshell – An Action-Adventure Sci-Fi version of 'Groundhog Day'. Aliens are taking over the world, over a period of years. Tom Cruise's Character – Major William Cage, a US Officer, who is a member of the NATO- lead United Defense Forces (UDF) fighting the Aliens, gets a caught in the classic conundrum of the living the same day over again and again, trying to finally break of it. Except for his first initial major scene, Cruise does an adequate job. Emily Blunt is a good as 'Sergeant Rita Vrataski', his co-lead. At a couple points in the movie, you start to feel you may get tired of the going back to the beginning of the day, but the story does then start to move forward, and when things re-set, they skip ahead so you do grow tired of it. It could have better, but still enjoyable – 3 out of 4 Stars.",8,1,3,15 June 2014
Whiplash," Makes You Think, and Great Performances from Teller and Simmons
","The fictional story of 'Whiplash' is that of 19 year-old Jazz Drummer student Andrew Nieman, played by Miles Teller. Nieman is a student at the fictional 'Shaffer Consevatory' in New York, the top music school in the U.S. Nieman aspires to become one of the drummer 'greats' and ends up in the class of conductor Terrence Fletcher, played by J.K. Simmons. As the movie progresses, Fletcher is revealed to have display both verbal and physical abuse in his teaching to Nieman and other students. Despite this, Nieman is determined to please Fletcher is his quest for greatness. Both Teller, and Pre-Oscar Nominations Announcement, presumed Favorite Simmons for Best Supporting Actor, both give great performances. At times I rooted, loathed and then rooted again for Teller's character, as his own morals and values are questionable at points in the film. The question of how far is too far for a teacher to push a student, and a student to push his or herself is there, and the movie does make you think. As I heard, the last 15 minutes or so are something, and there is one surprise moment earlier in the film, that you just don't see coming, that really shocks you. In the end, while not the best, it is one of the better films I have seen this year, and I will want a repeated viewing to judge it further. For now - 3 1/2 out of 4 Stars (The ½ Star for Teller's and Simmons's performances and the last 15 or so minutes), 9 out of 10.",9,1,3,29 December 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Really Great Movie, to end a Very Good Trilogy!
","'The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies' concludes 'The Hobbit' Trilogy – 3 Movies based on 1 Book, a prequel to 'The Lord of The Rings' Trilogy of books, made into 3 movies prior to the Prequel Trilogy – The Books all written by J. R. R Tolken, all the films Directed by Director Peter Jackson. The movie picks up where the last one - 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' left off - with the Dragon 'Smaug', voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch, about to attack the city of Laketown, after his departure from the Lonely Mountain, now reclaimed by the Dwarfs, led by 'Thorin', played by Richard Armitage. The Dwarfs have been aided by among others, the Hobbit 'Bilbo Baggins', played by Martin Freeman, the Wizard 'Gandalf the Grey', played by Sir Ian McKellan (reprising his role from the LOTR Trilogy), and Elves 'Legolas', played by Orlando Bloom (also reprising his role from the LOTR Trilogy), 'Tauriel', played by Evangeline Lily, and Lakestown resident 'Bard the Bowman', played by Luke Evans. Overall – I enjoyed the movie very much. The Visual Effects and Cinematography are wonderful. The Battle scenes are a joy. Emotions are often stirred, by great acting, particularly in the love triangle relationship of Lily's 'Tauriel', Dwarf 'Kili', played by Aidan Turner, and Bloom's 'Legolos'. Other highlights for the acting would be the journey the character of 'Thorin' takes, as well Freeman and McKellan's performances of 'Bilbo' and 'Gandalf' the Grey respectively, continuing to fight to bring everyone together for the battle that centers the 2nd Half of the Movie. Luke Evan's also gives a great performance as 'Bard the Bowman' - a man trying to save his family, and lead his townspeople at the same time, as well as attempting to keep the peace by all to avoid War during the 1st half of the movie. There are a few moments that maybe could have been improved, but it doesn't hurt much for the overall enjoyment. I thought the first movie, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' was alright, and I really liked 'The Hobitt: The Desolation of Smaug'. So – a really great movie to end a very good trilogy – 3 ½ out of 4 Stars.",9,6,14,17 December 2014
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Solid - Repeated Viewings Needed to judge if it's Amazing
","'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)' tells the story of washed up actor Riggan Thomson, played by Michael Keaton, who in an Art imitating Life Scenario, ala a former 'Batman' in Keaton – played the Superhero 'Birdman' in a comic-book movie franchise 20 years ago at the time of the film. Thomson is trying to revive his career by writing, directing and starring in a Broadway play, an adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love'. In the style of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rope' - The movie appears to be told in one continuous long shot, thanks to some manipulated camera-work and editing. The movie feels like a cinematic version of a play – or more perhaps 2 plays, as you go between characters performing the play based on Carver's story and their real lives. Keaton and Edward Norton, who plays Mike Shiner, an ego driven actor who is a supporting player in Thomson's play, has been getting Oscar Buzz for the performances. They both indeed have moments of greatness in the film, as does Emma Stone, who plays Thomson's daughter' Sam, and Naomi Watts, who plays Thomson's girlfriend Lesley, another actor in the play. Zach Galifianakis is a particularly hoot as Jake, Thomson's Best Friend and Lawyer. There is a good deal of Symbolism going on in the film between the play and the characters' lives, culminating in the last shot of the movie. I enjoyed it, though I am not ready to say it is amazing as others have – at least not on just the first viewing. I may adjust my feelings upon repeat viewings. A Good Solid Movie upon first viewing - 3 ¼ Stars out of 4.",8,2,13,5 November 2014
Unbroken," A Very Good Tribute to a True American Hero!
","'Unbroken' is the true story USA Olympian and World War II Prisoner of War Survivor Louis 'Louie' Zamperini, portrayed wonderfully in the movie by Jack O'Connell, based on the 2010 non-fiction book by Laura Hillenbrand 'Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.' The film also marks the Directorial Debut for Academy Award Winning Actress, and Humanitarian Angelina Jolie. The movie traces the story of Zamperini being bullied in childhood, as a child of Italian immigrants, to his rise as a Track Star in High School, leading to him becoming an Olympian, to his service in the US Air Force in World War II, where he was eventually captured by the Japanese, and was imprisoned in different prisoner of war camps. Zamperini must overcame horrible torture and abuse by his captors to survive until war's end. The movie has been receiving mixed reviews. While I won't say it is a 4-Star Masterpiece, and I could think of what one or two things that could have made it more effective - but I liked it very much. I think the movie is a Very Good Tribute to a True American Hero. Certainly applause should go to all involved with the film for putting Zamperini's story on screen. Considering the subject matter, and the fact that it is her first time Directing, I believe Jolie deserves some praise. I am not saying she deserves a Best Directing Oscar, or the Film deserves a Best Picture Oscar, but I can say this – I was moved at film's end. 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars – 8 ½ out of 10.",8,3,10,28 December 2014
Godzilla," More Godzilla Himself Next Time Please!
","Long Story Short – The Cast - Ken Watanabe, Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor- Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, and Co. do well with what there are given. There is a personal story of their characters, to go along with the Main Godzilla Crisis. Godzilla and the other creatures look convincing enough. My Qualm – Not enough Godzilla. You wanted to see more of him, and more of him fighting. The Directors and Writers no doubt tried to create the old time feel of the earlier Gozdilla movies, with the music, pace, etc. Just No Enough of the Monster himself!If there is a Sequel – Here is hoping that Ken Watanabe's probably most memorable line will be foreshadowed more - 'Let Them Fight'. Not Bad – Just could have been a lot better – 2 ½ out of 4 Stars.",7,5,8,26 May 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A Fun Movie!
","'Kingsman: The Secret Service' - Directed, and Co-Written by Matthew Vaughn, is a spy action comedy, based the comic book 'The Secret Service'. The movie centers on 'Kingsman' secret Agent Harry Hart, played by Colin Firth, and his protÃ©gÃ© Gatry 'Eggsy' Unwin, played by Taron Egerton. The Kingsman are a secret spy agency, based in England. Hart, whose past history with Eggy's father, which is revealed at the start of the film, ends up recruiting the troubled Eggsy to try to become the latest Kingsman. The movie is a great tongue and cheek/often campy spy comedy! The movie turns serious, with a couple surprises when it needs to be, but returns to it's tone, without missing much of a beat The cast do an all around great job. Along with great performances by Firth and Egerton, Samuel L. Jackson is a hoot, as the villain 'Richard Valentine', and the rest of the cast are great as well! As soon as you accept the tone and roll with it â€“ A Fun Movie! 3 Â½ out of 4 Stars, 9 Â½ out of 10 Stars.",9,2,10,14 February 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," A Good Thrill Ride.
","'Mad Max: Fury Road', is the 4th film in the Mad Max Series, from Director George Miller, and the first to be released in 30 years. It takes part in a post-apocalyptic future,, where humanity's survivors are battling for life-saving and potential life resources such as gasoline and water. The movie stars Tom Hardy, replacing Mel Gibson in the title role in the previous movies as 'Mad Max' and Charlize Theron as 'Imperator Furiosa'. I have heard that this film takes part in between the 2nd Film –'Mad Max: The Road Warrior', and the 3rd Film – 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome'. Prior to this, I had only seen the first film - 'Mad Max', which I admit, I did not like, partially because there was practically no explanation that it was an post-apocalyptic setting, which I believe was explained in the next movie. Long story short, the action sequences – all in the form of action taking part in or around automobile chases, is indeed first rate. In terms of the story - I had heard you had not needed to see the others, but it would give you depth. My gut tells me that seeing the 2nd film, would have increased my enjoyment significantly, particularly as the film is not too Dialogue heavy in the about the first half of the film so. With that mind, the action sequences make it a fun thrill ride, and the actors do well with what is given. When I get a chance to see the other movies, I will certainly revisit this one, and it may improve. For now - 3 ¼ Stars out of 4 Stars – 8 ¼ out of 10 Stars.",8,1,6,17 May 2015
Furious 7," Good Fun, and A Wonderful Legacy for Paul Walker!
","'Furious 7' is the latest in 'The Fast and The Furious' Franchise, whose production was halted due to the tragic death of Paul Walker, who played the co-lead, character of 'Brian O'Conner' in the series, along with Vin Diesel's 'Dominic Toretto'. Reportedly less than half of Walker's scenes had been completed at the time of his passing. Through digital magic, Walker's two brothers, who closely resemble him, stepping in for him at points in the film, and re-writes, production then resumed, and now the film, Walker's last – is out. I hadn't seen one of movies at the time of I heard of Walker's passing. I watched all the previous shortly thereafter. While there are flaws, some cheesy Dialogue at times, etc., the movie to me are just guilty pleasures, simply meant for fun – And I really like or love each one. 'Furious 7' is no different. Car chases,fight scenes, laugh out loud moments from Tyrese Gibson as 'Roman' in particular, the theme of family, and Kurt Russell's 'Mr. Nobody' is a great addition. Yes, there are some unbelievable moments, but it's fun, and you don't care. Without spoiling it - The exit for Walker's character is handled with class as reported. Will there be more? There is one aspect that is left open-ended, and the plan was for 10. I predict there will an 8th, or they will spin-off Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's character of 'Hobbs', as has been a past rumored, and pick up that story line that was left open in that film. For this movie, a wonderful legacy for Paul Walker, May he rest in Peace – 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars – 8 1/4 out of 10 Stars.",8,4,9,2 April 2015
