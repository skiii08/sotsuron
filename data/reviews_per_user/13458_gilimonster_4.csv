The Benchwarmers," If you really want to waste your life, ruin it by seeing this movie.
","I must say I was not expecting much when I saw the trailer. My friend still dragged me off to this movie and you know what, i think he owes me 90 minutes of my life back. My god this was bad, The acting was just awful. The jokes, if you can call them jokes, we're NOT FUNNY! And what's with that napoleon dynamite guy, can he play anyone other than that character. He's probably not even acting and is that big a loser in real life. And Rob Shinider is not funny. I don't think i've found anything he's done remotely amusing, and this movie will certainly not end that trend.DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE, you will regret it for the rest of your life.",1,20,63,29 March 2006
Alien 3," Normal Movie
","The thing about Alien 3 is that it's OK. Is it outstanding? no. Is it bad? Not really. The reason this movie got such bad reviews is that we were expecting more, but we didn't get it. I loved the first two movies. Alien had a great sense of panic and uncertainty built around it. Of course, after you know everything you can't really repeat it, which is why Aliens, probably my favorite of the series, was so great. It took what we already knew from the first movie and expanded on it. It didn't try to create uncertainty around something we already knew about. It took what we knew and built upon it, resulting in a great movie. Alien 3 however just tried to repeat the uncertainty from the first one, which is hard to do when you've already had that aspect played out. We already know all about the alien. It didn't bring anything new resulting in an average movie. It's not as bad as some say, but it's not as good as the other alien movies, although it is far better than alien resurrection.",7,1,3,10 May 2006
Saw II," Interesting, if overblown
","Saw 2 is an OK movie thats a little over the top. The opening scene was hard for me to watch as it had do with eye gouging, which is the one type of gore i can't take. Anyway, it involves 8 people trapped in a house, including the son of a detective that has just busted jigsaw. Jigsaw is not only playing a game with the people in the house, but also with the detective. As the story progresses you learn more and more about the people and why their there. It does keep you hooked and i would have rated this movie higher had it not been for the ending. SPOILER AHEAD,As it turns out, Ammanda is Jigsaw protégé, which sets it up for saw 10000 or however many their gonna make of these, end up ruining the series of course. The ending kinda ruined it for me, had they had a better ending i would have rated it an 8.",6,0,1,22 May 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Ao Good
","I loved this movie so much. It is not the type of thing I would normally watch but I was on a cruise and it was late at night with no activities and this was the only thing on. Needless to say, I was completely blown away. I had never really seen Jim Carey in anything except his movies like dumb and dumber and i thought he surprised me with his performance here. I was expecting just another love movie but trust me, it's much more than that. It's story is complicated and overall good. The ending was a little sad, but i like that it didn't have a cliché Hollywood ending were everyone lives happily ever after, without giving it away the ending is open to interpretation. So in conclusion GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",10,1,3,24 January 2006
