Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Just OK -- Nothing more or less
","Never hilarious, but often funny -- sometimes even laugh out loud funny. It was OK. Really not much more. Maybe the build-up was too much ('funniest movie since . . .') which made the bar too high -- but, IMHO the movie never really came close to being that good.I thought the pacing was somewhat odd -- and am I the only one that didn't understand why they were attempting to do a TV spot in Jackson, MS for a rodeo that I am sure I heard them announce was in Virginia? Wouldn't that have been back-tracking in their quest? I didn't feel cheated, or anything like that -- it was entertaining and had some yucks. It just wasn't the end-all-be-all that many others claim.",7,0,2,3 February 2007
