Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hitler would love this movie
","Unfortunately this movie is not just stupid and boring (unless naked ass of an obese man makes you laugh) but it is extremely racist. The way Cohen portrays people of the 3rd world would make Nazis very happy. It is not just one Kazakh that happened to be so stupid and backwards, it is the whole village and the country that is shown like that. OK, people there are not wealthy and they have to work hard just to get food on their tables. But to laugh at that? Next time show a starving boy in Africa and tell us it's funny. Imagine the main character of this movie being a Jew or an African American... You can not? Then the movie IS racist. What really troubles me is that many Americans do not even notice. Very sad and disgusting.Watch this film and see if you pass the test. First 10 minutes will do.And by the way: It's not that I object to politically incorrect movies - but this one is way beyond that.",1,6,13,31 March 2007
