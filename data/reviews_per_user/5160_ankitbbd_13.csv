Scarface," Al Pacino made it unforgettable
","Scarface is surely one of the best crime movie ever made.Al Pacino's performance as a sharp minded,angry,dangerous and powerful criminal is phenomenal.Al Pacino is playing a character which is brutal,angry,fearless and at the same time has love for his sister. Although movie is 2 hours and 50 mins long,but you will not find any dull moment in the movie.Alhough Al Pacino is playing a drug dealer but you will still like him as a person.Dialogues were excellent and there were couple of good songs in movie too.I also liked the way in which Al Pacino's character used to flirt with Michelle Pfeiffer's character.It was funny sometimes and was gentle too.I have seen many criminal movies but there is something special in Scarface.It is realistic and touching.This is Al Pacino's one of the finest performance.There was violence in some scenes but this is a crime movie and we expect some fighting scenes with violence.I heard a lot of positive things about this movie and when I finally watched it, I became its fan too. I am surprised that this movie even did not received any Oscar nominations.This movie surely deserves to be in top 250 list.Movie is a treat for Al Pacino's fans.This movie is recommended for all adults. Overall I give Scarface 9/10.",9,23,29,21 February 2016

The Others," perfect suspense movie
","Story-A woman who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive children becomes convinced that her family home is haunted.The others is surely one of the best suspense movie ever made.Story is the uniqueness and hero of the movie.Full marks to Alejandro Amen√°bar for writing and directing such a wonderful movie and that too without any action scene.Nicole Kidman played role of a mother who loves her children and is perfect in her role.This may be her best movie.Both children were also good.Rest of the actors also provided the exact efforts that was required by them.Movie may seem little slow in the starting but suspense movie needs to build characters and story otherwise audience may not digest the conclusion of the movie.Just watch this movie as a regular drama horror movie and by the time this movie is finished , you will be a fan of this movie.Overall this movie can be watched again and again and is a must watch(especially for suspense thriller lovers).I give this movie 10/10",10,9,10,12 February 2016
Elf," a feel good Christmas movie
","Story-A child raised as an elf at the North Pole is sent to the U.S. to reunite with his dad. Will Ferrell plays the role of innocent and has done a great job in it. This is surely one of his best movie.Movie has many funny moments, like when buddy first goes to U.S. he does some stupid things because he does not know anything about cities and technologies,dinner scene with his family.It feels so nice if you can watch a good comedy movie with your family because most of the comedy movies cannot be watched with family.I highly recommend this movie for kids and adults if they want to watch a good family movie with comedy and Christmas spirit in it.Overall I give this movie 8/10.",8,2,2,16 February 2016
Sultan," Good Wrestling Movie
","Story-Sultan Ali Khan (Salman Khan)is a small town wrestler in Haryana who faces problems in his professional and personal life.Salman Khan is perfect in his role.Its a good sign that Salman is choosing nice scripts now and focusing more on his roles.Anushka Sharma and Randeep Hooda were also good.Anushka has been given a very important role in this movie and she has performed it maturely.Ali Abbas Zafar,who is director of the movie,has done a good job.Background score is good.This movie may be biggest hit of Salman Khan.Story is simple but screenplay is intriguing.Wrestling scenes are well directed and performed.There is a perfect mixture of emotions,humor and action in the movie.Editing could have been better.As expected from Salman Khan,movie is family entertainer.Salman Khan fans will surely enjoy this movie.Overall I give it 8/10.",8,63,98,6 July 2016

3 Idiots," bollywood's best movie of 2009
","3 idiots is directed by Rajkumar Hirani,who is considered as one of the best directors of bolllywood. It is inspired from the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat.Aamir Khan has done it again.His acting in the role of an engineering student is simply flawless.He lives by the philosophy that one should pursue excellence, as when it is achieved, success follows.Sharman Joshi was perfect in his role.R Madhavan also played his role quite well.Kareena was as usual great.Boman Irani has shown us that he can do serious roles as well as comedy.He is a brilliant actor.

The Witch," Dark and Creepy
","Film was little boring at the starting but once story takes turn,you will start enjoying it.You need to have little patience to enjoy it completely.There are several dialogue in movie which are difficult to understand as movie is set around 17th century.This movie is really different.It scares you and there are some twists and nice screenplay.cinematography was good.Background score was perfect for the movie.Horror film fans will definitely enjoy it.Not one of the best,but still watchable.Overall I give it 7/10.",7,1,3,25 May 2016
Whiplash," Must Watch
",Whiplash is a beautiful movie that shows perception and expectations of a young drummer and an experienced band teacher who is short tempered and very strict.Movie is boring in starting but last half hour was amazing.JK Simmons was amazing as a Band teacher and he really deserves that Oscar for best supporting actor in a Supporting Role.Other cast was also nice.Watch this movie if you want to fulfill your dreams no matter how much hurdles are there in your life.My recommendation is that don't watch this movie with higher expectations.Overall I give this movie 8/10.,8,7,13,11 May 2016
Dark Shadows," Horrible
","For me ,it is one of the Worst movie of Johnny Depp.I watched this movie due to Johnny Depp,but he disappointed me.Movie is boring with bad screenplay.I don't know why this movie is put in comedy genre.There is no comedy scene.Even there is not any horror content.There is no story in this movie.Acting is average.This is truly director's fault that movie is so awful and boring.He should have worked more on screenplay and characters.There is nothing in this movie that I was expecting.I give this movie 4/10.",4,3,5,26 May 2016
Deadpool," Funniest super hero movie
","Story - A former special forces operative who works as a mercenary in New York City is subjected to a rogue experiment that grants him healing powers.I liked Deadpool very much due to its unique character and funny dialogues along with some fabulous action scenes.Honestly, I didn't expected much from this movie and I thought that this would be a disaster.But this movie proved me wrong and I am happy about it.The thing which I like the most is humour in the movie.Ryan Reynolds is the perfect choice for the role of Deadpool and he has shown us that he can also make you laugh.This movie will be remembered due to its comic scenes and dialogues.Debut director Tim Miller has done a great job in his first movie and it seems that movie has been directed by an experienced director.Deadpool's character reminds of Spiderman sometimes as both of them talk too much to villains.But this movie could have been much better if there would have been a stronger villain and a good story.Movie is a must watch for Marvel fans.Overall I give this movie 9/10.",9,45,97,16 February 2016
