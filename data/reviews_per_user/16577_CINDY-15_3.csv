The Legend of Bagger Vance," It was Okay
","I am not a big golf fan, but the guy I went to see this with is, so since he was paying, I went along with it, out of courtesy.  I don't like movies that are set in the early century.  Even more, I don't like Robert Redford movies.  It is definitely a Robert Redford movie, with the narration and such. So, I'm with the other person, that recommended waiting for the video to come out.  If you have cable, just wait 'til it comes out on cable.",5,0,1,9 November 2000
The Exorcist," Yikes
","I was never permitted by my parents to see this movie, so at age 25 I thought it was time to check it out and see what all the commotion was about it.  I went to see this at the movies.  I must say that the language at times was disturbing.  But the craziest part that was included in this movie that wasn't included in the 1973 version was when Linda Blair was crawling down the stairs in a back-stand manner, with blood poring out of her mouth. One word:  FREAKY!!  I wanted to see that again, but of course, there was no rewind.  Other stuff that was added was mostly medical tests that were performed on her.  I think the devil statue idea was lame.  The ending was quick and disappointing.  That thing killed two priests, and all the jibber jabber they did to try and exorcise this girl didn't work.  The only thing that worked is a priest beating the H E double L out of this girl and telling the devil to go into him instead, which 'they' obeyed and did so, thus saving this girl from death.  Other than that, it kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next.",5,1,5,9 November 2000
Schindler's List," Wow
",This movie was extremely touching.  The only thing I didn't like was the sexual content--one scene.  I don't think that it was necessary to include in the movie.  I still give it a 10.  It showed a lot of what happened in death camps and the horror Jewish people faced that I only read about.  It brought it all to reality.,10,9,19,9 January 1999
