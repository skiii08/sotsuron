Changeling," Two lost hours
","I was expecting a great movie and was thoroughly disappointed. Changleing is just another high-budget-no-idea movie, screaming out 'give me an Oscar, give me an Oscar'. Jolie's acting is below criticism: She just STAYS there, with a stupid look on her face and does nothing. The plot, although based on a true story or is it) is somewhat difficult to believe and brings me to think that the 'true story' was heavily interpreted. The 'mental intuition' b*****t is (badly) copied from 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'. One point for the 20's LA.... but, hey, the millions had to go somewhereBottom line: Don't GIVE MONEY TO SEE THIS MOVIE (maybe consider downloading it out of curiosity... like me :) )",1,11,38,8 March 2009
