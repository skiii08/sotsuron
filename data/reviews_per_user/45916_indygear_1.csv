Raiders of the Lost Ark," The return of the great adventure.
","If adventure has a name, it has to be Indiana Jones...No other film has captured the spirit of adventure quite like Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It is the best film of the genre, and introduced us to one of the most identifiable movie characters in popular culture.Raiders is a high octane adventure based on the classic 'B' movie serials. It features a well written plot, great musical score, and the acting talent of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.",Null,0,0,10 August 2000
