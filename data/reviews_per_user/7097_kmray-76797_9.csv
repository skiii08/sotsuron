And the sounds effects very well. I was more excited or impressed to hear that. This movie uses less dialogue but easy English. Words such as 'be good!' and 'Stay!' are easy but I feel it is effective. The short words have much power. And the flower has an important role in the movie.

This movie doesn't goes along time series. For example, day400 comes after day5. The actors perform well. I was surprised to know that people change so much if they lose their lovers. And this movie's main character is pure. So I think many Japanese people see it from his stand point. His character will gain sympathize of many Japanese. The name, Summer is nice idea. The last scene, a woman, Autumn appears. It is beginning of his new love. Summer is beautiful. I enjoyed this movie.",Null,0,0,17 August 2015

Enchanted," Pretty princess
","The music is great. I like all of the songs. It describes what we can't face in our daily lives. The main character is a princess. She comes to society from a fairy tale. It has a unique style in that the story suddenly changes into a real society from the fairy tale. She does many things we can't expect. But the actions make the movie more wonderful. The actress performs the character very well. She is beautiful and sings very well. I thought as if she is a real princess! The story is easy to understand. Young and old women can enjoy this movie. In common Disney movies, a princess will marry a prince. But this movie doesn't have this last scene. That is unexpected turn for me. There are many unexpected turn else. I enjoyed this movie.",Null,0,0,26 July 2015

Stranger Than Fiction," I would like to see another result of this movie!
","I felt even a little change affects our lives seriously. When he heard about his death, he seemed to be crazy. But if I were him, I might become crazy and lose my composure. This movie made me consider about my living. In this movie, the main character decides to follow the story. But I wonder what he would do, if he chose to be alive. I think the last scene is good. I think, if he didn't do that, the story may have become more interesting. As the story goes on, I felt he became a more human person. At first I thought he was a strict person. I think changes of our lives may make our lives better or richer even if we can't adjust to it easily.",Null,1,1,17 December 2015
The Breakfast Club," interesting communication
","The main characterｓ are five students. They have their own problem in their life. Through communicating, their relationships become better. Almost all scenes of this movie are set in school. The student's characters are all different. A group with so different people is rare. So there are many conflicts with each other. But it is interesting for me because I can see the scene I can't experience in my daily life. Their conflict is so hard and I can't understand some of the cases. However, if they conflict, they make up somehow. The more they express something honestly, the more their relationship seems close. If we have something shameful, we are reluctant to say it. But in the movie they say about themselves honestly and they got along with each other. I thought trying to express ourselves without being shy is important in order to have good relationship with others. Whatever you have trouble, having friends you can talk honestly with is important for you. I enjoyed this interesting movie.",Null,0,0,4 July 2015
