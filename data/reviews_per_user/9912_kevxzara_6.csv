Hereditary," My head was rolling
","WTF did I just watch, I actually have no idea what I watched or why I watched it in the first place, I remember seeing superwoman flying from a ceiling, some naked people don't know where they come from, I saw some kid whining like a baby (which was really bad acting by the way) I saw a film that was not only boring to the core and a film I had no idea what was actually going on.
The last 15 mins were totally stupid, there was a tin man jesus looking thing, naked old people (who the hell are they?) then a boy with a Christmas hat/crown on and declared some sort of demon King lol.. This film had the same stupid ending as that other rubbish film the vvitch (the witch) instead of a flying talking goat had flying mums. It also reminded me of the visit. Boring as hell don't bother, the other good reviews of this movie must of just dreamed about seeing it or they are just kids under 12 because if an adult can like this and find it scary then they need to stop watching horror films right now.",1,4,9,27 August 2018
Us," Overrated
","The second most overrated movie since 'Veronica'
This movie makes no sense at all, confusing storyline to say the least, bad taste comical areas, unrealistic scenes (plenty of them),
It's boring truly boring, I was looking forward to this movie but I would bet my life that people just as I did only got hooked because of the luniz 'I got 5 on it' remix song. Apart from that this movie stinks,do not waste your money or give money the the makers of this movie they don't deserve it. Poor very very poor. Do not believe the hype",3,2,5,26 May 2019
Bird Box," Copycat
","This movie is boring to say the least.
The movie tells you right from the begining who survives so what's the point of watching the rest of it now.
MGK was in this movie but left the house with a women and you never find out where they went or even survived they just got forgotten.
The rapid scene in the movie is just plain unrealistic. 2 kids survive the rapids and rocks when in reality they would of drowned, the 2 birds in a cardboard box also survive and dont drown and the cardboard box is still intact it's just stupidity to watch that scene.
The movie also in my opinion copied Mark whalbergs 'the happening' which made my own watching enjoyment ruined.
All in all a good Friday night movie that will soon be forgotten.",6,0,1,16 March 2019
Here Comes the Boom," Ufc never felt so good
","An absolutely fantastic family feel good movie, gets very heart warming and lumps in the throat moments towards the end of the movie.. A ufc film for the family,, brilliant!!",9,0,1,30 September 2018
Midsommar," Flower power
","I must tell the truth I hated this movie it was boring, slow and I have no idea what was going on.
Bland story telling, bland characters lack of telling us what was going on. I found it yawn worthy, artistic yes but as for anything else no.
No horror genre here at all just the same predictable stuff we see in every movie, plus calling it a horror is like calling The Raid a kids film.
Some will like this others will most certainly not.
Way to much flower power going on here.i hate every film like this just as I did hereditary, vvitch, the visit,mother, amongst others.
Enjoyable movie?? No not really.",3,7,12,24 September 2019
Creed II," Rocky IV remake??
","Seemed a little lazy in story telling it felt like rocky IV with a twist and character change, not a bad movie but the writers etc should remember it's called CREED not ROCKY. It was to much of the same as rocky movies just because stallone is to old to make more rockys they just felt they would make a rocky film but call it creed 2 instead with a different fighter.
I was dissapointed in the movie really just for the laziness of story because there was no story as the story was already there in rocky IV. Wait for creed 3 and then 4 and then 5 just like rocky films on and on but rocky was a classic creed is not.",5,7,10,13 February 2019
