Skyfall," Worst bond movie ever made
","This is by far the worst bond movie ever made.!!James Bond is supposed to be the greatest MI6 agent in the world....... and is now armed with a radio and a gun? WTF??? Where is all his high tech super gadgets, explosive pens, ANYTHING? That's whats James Bond is all about! And where's the girl that Bond always end up with in the end?Yes is was a 'beautiful' film and the scenes where great shot, with a nice intro... but this is so far away from a bond movie and is similar to many another common action movies.I have always loved the 007 movies, but i'm truly sorry i wasted money on this one! I would rater go down to Blockbuster and rent Golden Eye again.",2,32,67,1 November 2012
