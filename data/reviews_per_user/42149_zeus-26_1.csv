The Blair Witch Project," Sveet
","I was a bit leery about watching the film after all of the hype I've been fed for almost a year now (yes, we even get hype here in Kansas) but I was pleasantly surprised.  For the first time in my life, I was actually scared during a horror movie.  The acting was superb and not contrived, like some people like to claim.  The actors should also receive extra kudos when its made known that the whole movie was pretty much ad-libbed.  I absolutely loved the movie, and am recommending it to all those I see and meet. Did somebody actually claim that the Mummy was a horror flick?",10,1,2,1 August 1999
