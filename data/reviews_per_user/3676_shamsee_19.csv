Black Swan," Runaway Tragedy
","Exhilarating! That says a lot about a movie about ballet, about done to death ballet, and about a tortured mind of an introvert girl.I suppose when I do get to see a ballet, I would have much greater appreciation of the hard-work and dedication to their craft that goes behind the scenes.As for rest of the movie, it is brilliantly made. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, because the character of Natalie Portman is a good person, so it is our natural inclination to wish a positive and happy outcome for her. However, since she is descending into madness, the suspense arises from the fact, whether she would hurt herself, or would she make it, and resolution of this fact is what gets your full attention.Since she is called upon to perform a role that is complete opposite of her entire being, and the fact that only if she successfully transforms herself from a completely noble Swan Queen, to her diametrically opposite character of completely evil Swan swine, can she successfully make it, the audience is almost drawn into rooting for her to embrace darkness, so the real her can succeed.There can be endless discussion of what went behind her psyche and caused complete breakdown, but it is safe to say, there were plethora of reasons. A Mom who is living through her vicariously, and to whom she doesn't want to disappoint, a Mom who has unintentionally sheltered her, and her normal development as a woman has not taken place, her limited world of home and studio, her lack of any real friends, her lack of sexual maturity, her fear of failure, her self-imposed trauma of achieving perfection, and lack of any helpful or consoling voices.The Director of the ballet clearly lays out what Swan lake is about, and how it ends in suicide of heartbroken innocence, and it is clear to everyone, that this ballet would have no different ending. You go in expecting tragedy, sadness and self-destructive behavior, and still the actual suffering and pain shown in the movie, far exceeds your expectation. As an audience member, you feel helpless, as there is not even slightest hope of positive outcome.The most beautiful and exhilarating sequence is when Portman's character is actually transcends her pure nature, and is able to touch the darkness. She makes it clear to her Director that whether she is late or not, and whether she is feeling good or bad, it is her role, and she will do it, unless he wants another controversy on his hand, like the retiring ballet dancer, character of Winona Ryder, who he knows jumped in front of a car on purpose. This is sort of a blackmail and it actually gives hope to people rooting for her, as you believe now she can successfully play the role of black swan.The filming of the actual scene of black swan for the first show is just beautiful and brilliant. They show how she transforms, growing one feather at a time, and how her eyes dilate and become read, her snake like movement of her head, the force of negativity she exudes, is all brilliant. Then of course we find out, that our choice are either dead heroine or a fallen heroine, who has committed a murderer. It is better that she did not become a deranged murderer and the hurt she inflicted, was on herself.Since this is a runaway tragedy, one wonders what can we salvage from this movie? I suppose that a moment of peace that she felt, right before her demise, knowing she reached perfection in her craft, to which she devoted her life, is something positive that one can latch to. Yes it is grasping at the straws, but the only way her tortured mind was going to find any peace, this might be her happy ending.",8,2,5,24 January 2011
The Hunger Games," Glimpse of our near future
","So to most people this is pure fiction.If they would pay any attention, whatever the Elites are preparing for in this Country, would probably be much worse than what is depicted in this movie.As for the movie itself, there were things that could have been done better.Below is the list of few flaws in my opinion: The way system of 'Elites' works is that few rule and control many.Even if that was intention, it was not depicted in that manner. It almost looks like each district was comprised of few hundred, maybe thousand people. However, the 'Capital' itself was much more grand so the whole the concept of 'few' vs. 'many' was upside down.The people who are constantly battling hunger, should they really be this strong and powerful? There was dialog about how 'too much hope is dangerous'. That is correct.However, in battle of good vs bad, unless at least one or two so called 'Elites' could start to question themselves, and realize they lack the basic human traits, there is no hope.In a movie that touches the subject that this movie does, I would have liked some hope.Now getting away from the bigger subject, and concentrating on the plot itself, in the end the two 'tributes' from the District-12 are encouraged to fake love (at least the girl is) so some 'Elites' would root for them. In the end the 'Show Master' tries to turn them against each other, but fails.Why not have them be true lovers? Why not let the movie also be a true love story? Why not have the 'Elites' not only try and break them, take away their basic humanity, but also try to extinguish their love. That would be way more powerful.Finally, I appreciate that people of District-11 have had enough and at least rioted. For sake of humanity, I needed more.Maybe the movie's real purpose is to simply acclimate us to what is coming.We are not in Kansas anymore ladies and gentleman.Real hunger games are coming, and they would make the ones depicted in movie look like picnic.",8,3,11,5 April 2012
The 13th Warrior," John McTiernan's worst effort ever!
","Director John McTiernan is one of my all time favorite directors. After watching Thomas Crown Affair, one of the most beautiful movies ever made, my hopes and expectations were raised even higher. This is the guy  who gave us 'Die Hard', 'Predator', and 'Hunt for Red October'. If that was not enough, Antonio Banderas, who gave a tremendously entertaining performance in 'Mask of Zorro' further convinced me that it can't be bad.I was wrong in my calculations. John  McTiernan was inspired by some of his own previous work and sort of tried to combine 'Die Hard' (in the sense these 13 guys are sort of locked up in  a village) and 'Predator'(in the sense that their are man hunters, and people who collect skulls as a tribute to some diety). However, there are so many illogical inconsistencies that whatever one or two semi-decent action  sequences this movie has, can not make up for rest of the shortcomings.When the man-hunters attack for the second time at night, could someone explain to me why they just turned back and left? Were they on some kind of synchronized clock? The point at which they decided to quit was the time when they were about to complete victory.Second, It didn't really was made clear that they were actually man-eaters, or just using skulls for some pagan ritual. In addition, the hero of the movie, the 13th warrior really does not contribute anything additional to the mission. Also what's the deal with just 13. When the other side apparently has thousands, then shouldn't everybody be putting an effort to not get eaten or avoid having their skull used for decoration purposes?In beginning of the movie Director makes the point, the man-hunters are smart, as they not only camouflage well, but hide their tracks well. Then the director shows them as complete idiots, when it comes to launching an attack (which should not be the case for those who make their living hunting and killing). There are thousands of them, and why do they decide to cross into the village at the only spot where the remaining 5 or 6 guys were defending? Even animals, predators like wolves and rest of them have enough intelligence to surround, and plan their hunt etc. On one hand they are shown so smart that they never suffered a casualty for hundreds of years that could have revealed whether they were animals or men, and on the other hand they just run themselves into blades for no apparent reason.
In the end of the movie, the victory  comes in the form of killing of the evil female leader, and the strong male warrior leader. Once again its illogical to show that only those two guys were the source of inspiration for killing. After-all the plot indicates that they have been hunting for hundreds of years. That means there has been some continuity and power is inherited among them. Even in animal kingdom that happens everyday. However, according John McTiernan, those logical events do not apply here.
The biggest robbery in the movie is that in the commercial it was shown he fights for love and the beautiful Arab woman in  veil is shown. In reality, there is no romance or love, which makes the whole thing even more dry. You don't get the true feeling of adventure either as the final mission turns out to be easy. They track, go in, kill the leader, and get out.
A bad movie. I hope John McTiernan just turns the page over, and helps us forget about this effort.",4,0,1,20 January 2000
The English Patient," Absolutely Shameful!!!
","How can one feel for Adulterers, traitors, murderers, and Nazi Collaborators.True Love is supposed to make you strong and Good. Instead, it turns these two lustful maniacs into all of the above.It was like rooting for Mickey and Mallory from 'Natural Born Killers'. Just can't do it....People who ignore the moral implications of the movie, and simply want to focus on the romance and love, do not know the meaning of 'Love'!",1,15,31,7 October 1999
The Town," Heat it is not!
","Ben Affleck with Irish accent - it is tormenting to watch. He tries so hard, but he can't do it. He should have stuck with directing.Second, bits and pieces of this movie remind me of the epic DeNiro/Pacino movie, 'Heat'. That movie remains consistent throughout, and characters remain true to themselves and are brilliant on top of that.Here, characters start out OK, but then they forget who they are supposed to be. The character that least remains true to himself is Ben Afflec himself.Jeremey Renner's character, James Coughlin is the BEST and is consistent and never wanders for a moment. Same could be said about character Slaine, although it is not as prominent as other characters.Ben Afflec falling madly in love with a cliché good-girl and putting all his BROTHERS at risk, simply doesn't jive. No self-respecting bad-guy/bank-robber would allow that to happen.A line from heat is that you can't let yourself get attached to anyone or anything that you can't walk away from. Now that is how you maintain your edge.Not saying it is not OK for Ben Afflec's character to be weak, but it is simply not consistent. When you are able to take people out at moments notice, you are supposed to operate at different plane, then normal good guys.Why does Afflec's character want to be a good guy so desperately? Why not just turn yourself in? Also, even when he discloses to the girl he is a bank robber, she is so madly in love with him, that she is OK, with the man who kidnapped her and threatened to take her life? Is that Stockholm syndrome on roids? In Heat, DeNiro's character never admits to the girl what he does, and remains consistent.Also, character played by Blake Lively is inconsistent. It didn't appear her and Ben Afflec's character had strong relationship and it was mostly about sex, but as soon as she hears about Diamond Necklace he has given to another girl, she gives away supposedly her son's father, her brother and her friends out of anger? No way. If a character that is supposed to be cool with a man being bank-robber, then despite cheating or not, she won't resort to throw her own brother and her child's father to FBI.Problem is that Ben Afflec got hung up on a TYPICAL Hollywood cliché, 'bad guy wants out'. So he tried hard, ignoring natural instincts of characters to form the story where the guy just wants out at all cost, because he is in love with cliché good girl, who plants community gardens.In real life, how many successful bad guys want out, specially when they are doing great? Who wants to risk prison, and throw their best buddies in jail for a woman? Better story and more consistent story would have been if the girl he fell in love with, comes to realize who he really is and she turns the whole crew in, which she tried later on as well, and not Blake Lively's character. Afflec's character being true to himself, should have realized he is in fact bad guy, and should have gone after that girl to revenge the death of his friends due to her and taken out the FBI guy and her and then we would have a proper ending and a better movie.",6,2,5,7 January 2011
Collateral," It takes a Genius to make movie this BAD.
","The Badness of this movie can not be described in the 1000 word limit imposed by IMDb so I would only describe some of the obvious blunders.How many young hot US attorneys take cabs to work? Then hand out their business card to the cab driver after a brief conversation? That is the opening seen of this movie.If you are a professional hit-man, are you going to take a Cab driver hostage and make him drive you around and kill five people in high profile case including the US attorney and then hope that JUST LIKE one previous time in nearby city, the detectives would conclude that a Cab driver with impeccable history just lost his mind? That is the PREMISE of this movie.If you want the detectives to conclude that Cab driver indeed lost his mind, are you going to sit in a restaurant with the Cab driver and with the owner of the restaurant that you are going to kill and expose yourself to all the employees of that restaurant? Do you think a detective following up on the case would ask the waitresses, whether the Cab driver was sitting alone by himself? The 'Hitman' in this movie feels he is invisible and hundreds of the people around him are not able to see him.If you are driving around town with a Dead Body in your trunk, are you going to stick with the same cab on which you threw a dead body and SMASHED its windshield? Is this the way to NOT draw attention to yourself?Right after the third Hit, Cruise comes out and kills two more people in the alley.Two people that Cruise shot in the alley who tried to rob his hostage, the Cab driver, actually started out as four people. However, even though there were loud gunshots, two of the four did not bother to check on their friends.As a matter of fact, just before that, hundreds of people were passing through alley perpendicular to where the Cab was parked, and even though they could hear the car horn, they couldn't hear the gunshots, leaving Cruise and Fox to have a nice humorous conversation in peace.The Conversation: Apparently Cabbie's Mom was raising a ruckus by calling his company, and his Boss was trying to reach him to tell him to call her at the hospital where she is at.This is the same Boss, who Cruise (Hitman) and Fox (Cab Driver) told only a few minutes earlier that 'they would shove a giant Yellow Cab up his....' if he demands that Fox pay for the damage to the Cab. Cruise actually pretends to be a US attorney passenger and threatens to prosecute the Boss for extorting Cab driver.If your EMPLOYEE cursed you in absolutely insulting manner, are you going to convey a message from their Mom to them a few minutes later? Then RIGHT AFTER the conversation, Cruise and Fox head to the hospital to visit Fox's Mom. However, even before Cruise and Fox arrive at the hospital, the CORPSES of the 3 victims have ALREADY arrived at the SAME HOSPITAL, and the detective who is searching for them, shares an elevator with them.Congratulations to LAPD for their efficiency in cleaning up Crime Scenes!If you are a FBI agent or a LAPD detective and you have your suspect under surveillance and the CAB that you are looking for, in which you believe the assassin working for your suspect is going around and killing your witnesses, that Cab is parked at side of the building, what would you do? If you think the Cabbie is the Killer, and he meets your suspect, and you know that he is heading to next witness, what will you do? Would you try to take down the killer right at the building which you have under surveillance? Most likely.Not in this movie.Here the entire LAPD and FBI get into a caravan and head to the club where witness is supposed to be. Apparently they don't want to take out the killer at relatively empty spot on the side of the building, instead they prefer to shoot the killer in middle of a Night Club where hundreds of people are dancing. Since both sides (Cruise/Fox & FBI/LAPD) started out from same spot, they arrive at the club at same time!Finally, if you are a hit-man and you leave your hostage for dead in a car wreck, and you are about to shoot the US attorney and your former hostage shows up with a gun pointed at you, are you going to ignore him? Even if you thought the guy was a total loser, the fact that he still walked out of the same car wreck as you and got to the same place as you and has a gun pointed at you, are you still going to ignore him? Cruise does and gets shot in the face, but doesn't die.Chases the Cabbie and the US attorney in a train, and as he is about to get to them, he YELLS and warns them of his approach and thus promptly gets shot. Is this how professional killers approach ARMED victims who are anticipating them?Last Blunder: Fox kills Cruise and then he and the girl walk off the train and he immediately takes his coat off and puts it on her.This after they have been running for miles, jumping trains, crashing through glasses, and have been shot at repeatedly. How cold do you think the girl was at that point? How cold does it get in LA anyway? It takes a genius like Michael Mann to make a movie this bad.",1,135,227,22 December 2004
American History X," Good Movie
","I will give this movie an 8/10. It did a good job of tackling and explaining tough issues. It also showed how little incidents just become excuse for venting built up anger. It also showed the power of love, especially power of mother's love, love between two brothers, and love of a teacher to rescue students, perfectly. Mother's character and the scene where the argument turns into a fight was just too powerful. When mother is shown battling poverty as  well by sacrificing comfort for her kids, it moved me to tears. Also it shows that sometimes one good person, like the black guy in prison who becomes a friend to the main character, his niceness and attitude changed that man's life and saved him. Just imagine if that character had his own problems and rage then what would have happened. It also showed how foolish and shallow people associated with hate-groups really are and how it is an expression of their other problems.Despite all those power, moving, and terrifying moments, the liberal director and writers missed the point of their own movie. The movie that is supposed to be warning to those who hate and is supposed to show power of love and ability to overcome rage, and as a matter of facts wants to be a guide for people struggling with those issues, itself engages in demonization and unfair characterization, which will hurt the feelings of those who are being labeled and cause a rage to built up in them, a result opposite of what this movie should have and hopes to have.Is it really fair to describe opposition to Affirmative Action as a first step towards becoming a skin-head? That's what movie seems to be suggesting. Good people can agree on the issue and on ideas how to help those who need help but demonization of the extremely large portion of the population is hardly useful. Also the skin head is shown to use the words 'Democrat' and 'Liberal' as curse words. Yeah, that's fair, and that should really bring people together. It is sad that those who made the movie about overcoming anger and rage could not control their own negative feelings and had to demonize innocent people.In any case see this movie, if for nothing else, to see a mother's love and sacrifice.",8,0,0,24 August 2000
Quantum of Solace," Like the new Bond!
","Daniel Craig Rocks! I assume next movie would be a bit lighter and happier since he got his revenge for losing the woman he loved! I like the lack of emphasis on gadgets! Bond has actually become human! Realism Rocks! The villains are becoming even bigger losers and less and less memorable. They need to create a bit stronger role for them.Action was fast paced and awesome! They used some background action, like horse race, combined with fight scene and went back and forth at high clip to try and create even intense action! M had the best lines! She is the one who made me laugh! One of the guys from 'Solace' that they were trying to 'squeeze' the truth out of, mocks M, and says they have men everywhere.....and M's personal body guard betrays her, at that very moment. She survives. Later on, she is upset and having a meeting with Bond and says, 'who uses phrases like we have men everywhere'......'florists use that line'. LOL! Bond is forever!",8,1,4,22 November 2008
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Opportunity Wasted
","This could have been one of the best movies, but alas! It is not. It is a visual spectacle that is indeed stunning, and it has martial arts choreography that is beautiful and unique. At least  I have never seen anything like that before.However, one thing without which no movie can even be regarded a good movie, the ability to move audience's heart is COMPLETELY missing. The plot is non-existent, which is contrary to any other movie that is regarded as an epic. The goal that hero of the movie is fighting for is so pathetically trivial that it means nothing to me whether he succeeds or not. He is NOT fighting for love, for romance, for country, for honor, for family, for good(against evil), but instead he is pursuing a spoiled teenage girl who has come into possession of a 'book of martial arts secrets', and  has shown some talent. He is willing to give up his life and his heroine's life so this retarded girl will accept his as his teacher.As I said above, this movie has characters that do not have any higher purpose. An emotionally unstable girl is hardly a worthy cause for a man of hero's capabilities to be wasted.Ang Lee wasted an opportunity to create one of the greatest Romantic epics. He could have exploited the opportunity for creating a romantic triangle between the two leading women and the hero. Instead he focused solely on the cinematography and martial arts choreography (and did a tremendous job) and created a movie without any objective or purpose. Two many noble characters wasted for NO cause at all. The battle in this movie is not between 'Good and Evil', but between 'Obsessive (hero) vs retarded (heroine)' (who have NO feeling for each other what so ever).",6,0,0,24 September 2001
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Holocaust through the eyes of pair of 8 year old kids.
","Maybe because I only saw the movie last night I am thoroughly infatuated, but this could probably be one of the best movies about Holocaust.Schindler's list showed unspeakable brutality, but it was so shocking and done from a safe distance that it almost seemed like a work of fiction. Shock numbed your senses.In this movie, the film makers take us into a child's world and if you were 8 years old from either side of the fence, what did you think, what you saw, what you felt, what you believed! When you see the the world through the eyes of children, all your senses are enhanced, innocence is magnified, beauty crystallized.Two kids in this movie, a son of a Nazi General, Bruno, and a Jewish kid in Concentration camp, Schmoel, they form a friendship but are separated by an electric fence, across which they sit and chat and even laugh and play games, and try to make sense of the world they live in and try to interpret events and actions, unable to comprehend the underlying evil. Their innocence is moving! Through their eyes we see the best in Humanity! The ending sneaks up on you. You don't expect it till the very last moment.One could say that in the end there was justice, but this is one case where you would root against justice.This movie is going to leave me with a permanent mark and I think I am better off for it.Go see it!",10,5,10,9 January 2009
Clash of the Titans," Crash of Titans
","Badness and worthlessness of this movie leaves me speechless.Usually, there are certain aspects of a movie you like or dislike. One could agree or disagree certain take that director chose to do, certain changes, something that was below par, something that could have been better, that one could talk about. However, in this case, the task of reviewing this movie is difficult as from the very first scene to the last scene this movie is one unbearable, soul-less, boring, ugly and horrible disaster.The original is a classic! It has heart, romance, soul, humor, sweetness, feel of an epic, beauty, nobility, overall feeling of an adventure, a quest, and yes it also had certain spooky quality, and deviousness.This remake has NONE of those qualities. As if lacking anything interesting or worth liking was not enough, this movie tortures you with horrible darkness and senselessness. A fisherman comes up with empty catch, so declares war on Gods. Really? Why even be a fisherman then? Just sit at home and demand food and other necessities be delivered to you, and if that doesn't happen, just declare war on Gods.From Andromedae to Zeus, the characters are either evil or robotic. Its a world of mindless creatures. There is no way to get emotionally involved, even though you go to the theater with every intention to like it, and enjoy and give it every break possible.The girl playing Andromedae doesn't even appear to be a leading lady and appears to be sick and weak. The Princess is a meaningless entity in this movie. She was his love in the original. Even the monster, Cracken is boring. Medusa left a permanent scar in the original, but here it just might be a giant mindless snake. However, the soldiers trying to kill her are even more determined to be killed by her gaze. One of them could have simply avoided that fate, but the writers probably ran out of script for him, so he had no choice but to gaze straight in Medusa's eyes.Just a bad movie. Avoid it at all cost. I am disgusted the time and money I wasted on this one. There is absolutely nothing, not one thing in this movie that is worth cherishing.",1,75,138,5 April 2010
Avatar," Visual Epic - Independent Day in Reverse
","So for once it is us, the Humans, who invade another planet! Tired of these powerful aliens who come and wreck our planet and treat us like vermin. For once, stress that comes from the prospect of being eliminated and toyed with is not on us.Just for that this inter-galactic action adventure is worth a view.As someone noted, this movie is not a deep intellectual exercise.The themes are all old and one could say this movie had elements from movies such as 'Dances with Wolves' (Soldier switches sides once he is exposed to the enemy and empathizes with them), '10000 BC' (Walk through the jungle with dangerous exotic creatures everywhere), 'Apocalypto' (The warriors), 'Last of the Mohicans' (The jungle, the warriors, the native tribes, the romantic vibe', and so on and so forth.There have even been Star Trek Next Generation episodes, where the space-ship was actually a living creature! So from that perspective there really was nothing new. What was new was what I noted above, for once we get to be the aggressors, albeit the evil ones. Feels good to be superior in technology to at least one alien entity.The Navi people are shown to be child like Innocent in one sense, very spiritual as well as they are one with nature, but also brutal in the sense on moments notice the leader of the tribe was going to decide whether the 'Avatar' lives or not.What is hard to believe is that human consciousness and morality would reverse going forward. With all the opposition and Wars to invasions, unless the 'un-obtanium' was curing some kind of plague, it is impossible for me to believe that humans in general would turn away from private looters raiding and brutalizing this alien world. One could draw a comparison to Halliburton led wars to acquire oil, but it is not really same. Navi would have to have done something horrible to humans, in order for even looters to come up with justification for uprooting and brutalizing them. Since they are incapable of threatening Earth, such a case would have been hard to make.I also feel, no matter what, the way Navi recognized that 'Avatars' were in their words, 'souls in false bodies', they would be so comfortable with the idea and just accept them, and the leader of the tribe would appoint his daughter to educate the 'Avatar' in their way of life. Why? Why wouldn't they believe they are spies and here to endanger them? Anyhow, James Cameron knows how to make the movie exciting enough for us to enjoy and want to see it multiple times! Good entertainment value and gives something to think about, even though it doesn't have emotional content to move you, it is thrilling enough to enjoy and a visual spectacle!",8,1,3,11 January 2010
From Hell," JACK-THE-RIP-OFF
","After watching this movie, I think the tag-line should have been, 'Got Grapes?' (Got Milk?) or 'Ah, The Power of Grapes' (Ah, the Power of Cheese).
     The hero is an opium addict who has ability to envision tomorrows murder, today. He is supposed to be very smart. At one point he is drawing locations of different spots where bodies were recovered, and based on that he figures out that this has some significance in terms of some cult and predicts the location of next murder. At that point he had a good idea that the reason those women were being murdered was that they were witness to a wedding of some loser prince and somebody wanted them to be eliminated. My question is, why didn't he post all the idiot cops right outside that ONE room where all of those women lived? Wouldn't it be easy to just ask a pair of cops to FOLLOW the remaining two or three women in that ONE room? He knew who was getting killed, and why, yet there were cops everywhere but outside that one spot. This is level of idiocy not seen before in any crime movie.    Another question: Shouldn't the hero have told the remaining women, NOT TO TALK TO STRANGERS WHO GIVE YOU GRAPES? How about questioning couple of fruit vendors? He also knew the killer was rich and educated, and there were more than one suspect at hand. Yet Jack-The-Rip-OFF gallops through those narrow streets in his carriage, and no one seemed to take a note.
    The dialogue, the acting, the sets, the cast, the characters, were so horrible, that I found myself rooting for Jack! His acting was best in whole movie, but could not save it from being one of the worst movies ever made.
    Instead of buying a ticket for this movie, I would have been better off if I had bought grapes.",1,12,25,3 June 2002
The Da Vinci Code," Near Flawless transformation from Novel to the Big Screen (However, nothing else can better illustrate the loss of 'Sacred Feminine')
","One thing that 'Priory of Sion' value and the whole novel is all about is the 'Balance' between Man and Woman. From 'Mona Lisa' (the reason she is supposed to have the 'all knowing' smile) to Da Vinci's 'Last Supper' (the true Chalice that holds the blood of Christ), the concept of 'Balance' (Equality) between Man and Woman is re-enforced. However, that point either completely missed the creators of this movie or they didn't care. Eitherway, nothing highlights the 'Im-Balance' between Man and Woman today than this movie. In the Novel, the character of Sophie played by Audrey Tatou is not supposed to be completely helpless and clueless. In fact her character contributes equally to the effort of solving the mystery, just as much as the character of Robert Langdon played by Tom Hanks. They BOTH take turns in finding the answers to different puzzles.It is Sophie who translates the Annagram 'So Dark the Con of Man' and not Robert Langdon. It is Sophie, who rescues Robert Langdon, by first sending the cops on wild goose chase, by removing the 'bug' from Robert Langdon and planting it on a dump truck. It is Sophie, who takes the valuable painting hostage, and threatens to tear it apart, unless the guard trying to arrest them disarms. It is her training by her Grand-father all her childhood, that makes her the best person to understand the clues left by him. In the novel, just when they are about to open the Vault, they get one and only chance to enter the correct account number, which they don't have. If they enter it in-correctly, then the contents of the the vault will be forever lost to them. While Robert Langdon is about the enter the scrambled Fibonacci sequence, left by Jacque Suniere written in invisible ink next to his body before his death, it is Sophie who figures that the sequence is way too random to be a password and would be too difficult for her Grand-father to remember. An unscrambled sequence would be a better password to remember as it can always be figured out. Unfortunately, in the movie, the credit for all those efforts is entirely given to Robert Langdon's character. This pattern continues throughout the movie. This is truly tragic! After coming so far, even today, its impossible for this world to accept that a woman can make a meaningful contribution, aside than being eye-candy. No, the only appropriate role for her is to be a damsel in distress who has to be rescued by her knight in shining armor.Even bigger sin is to portray Sophie's character as one who truly doesn't care about solving the mystery. She seems to be upset at being thrown into this mess, and it seems that she doesn't really care about something so important that it could shake the foundation of Church and change mankind forever. Anyone dealing with that prospect would find themselves enthused about the resolution of the facts. However, in the movie, Sophie's character is 'apathetic'. That is exactly opposite of how she is portrayed in the Novel. In fact, she truly wants to find out what her Grand-father wanted her to inherit. She does not want to be left behind by Robert-Leah team.Apathy is one of the reasons behind woman being treated as inferior over the ages. A man is the one who ask 'Whys' and would go to any length to get them answered. Woman supposedly only care about surviving, pleasure and material things. All things that are unworthy of being the main purpose of life. By portraying Sophie's character as 'Apathetic', the same libel has been thrown upon her as on every woman since dawn of mankind. She doesn't care about 'IMPORTANT' things, so it is natural to keep her out of matters of 'IMPORTANCE'. Aside from messing up the underlying main theme of the Novel, the main focus of 'Kninghts Templars' and 'Priory-of-Sion', this is a nearly flaw-less movie! Usually one finds that novel was way better than the movie, but here the difference is minimal. You could for all practical purposes either watch this movie or read the Novel and you won't miss much, aside from what is pointed out above. Some of the facts are unnecessarily distorted like Jacque Suniere was not really Sophie's Grand-father, but in fact he is shown to be her real Grand-father in the novel. She even has a brother that she is re-united with in the end. Most importantly, the reason, a man would entrust the most powerful secret in history of mankind to a man he has never met before is once again given a sexist explanation in the movie. Sophie is too clueless and too helpless to resolve the mystery on her own so the wise Grandfather tells her to find her Knight in shining armor, Robert Langdon. To an extent that maybe the case, however, even more important reason is that Robert Langdon had written a manuscript that his publisher had sent to Jacque Suniere to get his praise for the book and in that he unknowingly spells out the location of the Grail itself.That was the main motivation for the old man in contacting Robert Langdon. Once he knew his life was coming to end and he could not reach the one person he could trust his secret with, who he knew was not compromised, but who he has failed to fully prepare. His last thought was to team up his Grand daughter with one person beside him who knows the location of the Grail but doesn't know that he does - Robert Langdon.I recommend every man and woman to watch this movie!",9,5,9,13 June 2006
Inception," Travelling through someone's mind for trivial reasons
","The idea is obviously scintillating and grand by its very nature - traveling through someone's mind, visualizing the world their mind sees, extracting secrets, and even planting new thoughts. This sort of canvass opens door to infinite possibilities and nothing is off the table.However, if one did have this capability, you have to assume US Government would get the wind of it and would be all over it. There are tons of special psyche-ops projects as we speak. I don't believe individuals could just market that ability to corporations for their benefits. If you are a head of some corporation now, how would you even think this option exists, and how would you even approach it? There should be a better explanation of how the talent and its employer found each other and it should not be shown as something that occurs as normally as one hiring a contractor to fix their house.The objective in this movie was so trivial - one corporation wants the destruction of other.Bankers on wall street accomplish that 100 times a day, and they own media too, not only to travel through one persons' mind, but mold mind of entire population, as a matter of fact, entire humanity. So there was nothing too exciting for me about the conception of 'INCEPTION' itself. People are doing it to entire populations, so what is so great about doing it to just one person.To me it would have meant more and I would have cared more, if the objective was as grand as the tool of inception. Something that impacts entire humanity and not just head of one corporation.Also, the visions created by so called architect, are just lame. I think you would find lot more titillating and morbid stuff in a healthy male American brain, then just people walking around in suits. I have had lots of dreams, and none of them ended with a plot of B-Action movie. How does a teenage girl know what corporate world looks like?I do like the main idea of the movie, how it opens doors to reckless imagination, even though it was barely tapped upon. I liked the acting of different characters. Most importantly I liked the personal suffering that the main character experienced, because he had this power, and he misused it, so it is the law of Universe, he pays for it in maximum. I however, don't like the attempt to show relatively happy ending for him. In epic battle of right and wrong, wrong can win all the way, but NOT at the very end. Otherwise, there is no basis for anything.Finally, the last trick to not let the audience know whether the spinning top stops or not is just so cheap, that it should be ridiculed by critics who know what they are talking about.",6,1,2,2 August 2010
Trainspotting," A movie with a message that brings the tragedy of drug addiction home....
","I only chose to rent the movie because it was on IMDB's top 250 list, and thus didn't have any clue or ideas what to expect. The way it started, I figured it will be one of those teenage crime/comedy movies. It was that and much more. This movie is going to leave a permanent mark on me. No one who is not an addict, can see this movie, and even think about trying drugs.The scene where the the dead kid is discovered, has to be one of the most tragic, horrifying and scary scenes of all time. Even though I quickly fast forwarded it because I can't watch gory stuff, but whatever I saw is still haunting me now. At times its a comedy, but that one scene will make you forget everything else. This movie should be required viewing for high-school kids.I hope my review doesn't convince the reader that it is a documentary or has no entertainment value. On the contrary, majority of the movie is extremely entertaining, but if you are sensitive person, then the moral message will strongly effect you.",8,0,0,28 April 2000
Sin City," Don't think Quentin Terrentino was needed
","Quentin Terrentino is amazing but why he was invited as guest director for this movie is beyond me.He added the time line scramble from 'Pulp Fiction' and the character of a viciously violent ninja girl, 'Meeho', seemed ripped off from one of the characters from 'Kill Bill Vol. 2'.I don't think the time line scramble added any new or extraordinary dimension to the movie. The character of 'Meeho', although exciting, was still not only out of place, but kept reminding me of 'Kill Bill'.The only thing inclusion of Quentin Terrentino did to the movie is spoil its purity.This is an amazing movie by itself. I have never seen anything like this. Who knew shameless violence could be so cool! If you like movies, you have to check this one out.",9,0,1,19 September 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," As Yogi would say, 'Deja vu all over again'!
","I am surprised by the popularity of this movie.Anyone who has ever watched Indian Movies would know that 99% of them have same exact plot, and same exact twists and turns and they are all love stories with someone getting in between the guy and the girl.So when I watched this movie it felt like every other Indian movie I have ever watched. The difference being the characters all speaking in English.I found it annoying when the host of the 'Who wants to be a Millionaire', played by Anil Kapoor, kept saying after every answer, 'Lock ki jiye computer ji', which means 'Lock that answer Sir or Mr. Computer'. Really? I haven't been to India in long time, but I find it odd to refer to a computer as 'Mr.' or 'Sir'.I also didn't like the ending where the hero doesn't know the answer to the question who the third musketeer was and he uses his 'life-line' to call the girl, and her answer is, 'I don't know'. So he guesses it and gets it right.What purpose did that serve? She was supposed to be the third musketeer with the hero and his brother when they were growing up. So they could have flashed back and shown another conversation that the three had as children where she remembers the name of third musketeer. That would have been more fun and exhilarating then pure guess.Finally, after his first night on the show when the hero is taken in custody by police and they torture him, even electrocute him, and then they simply return him to the show on next day.I don't know even in India such torture is that brazen. That part of the story didn't fit.In some ways that all fits together because that makes it TYPICAL Indian movie.If you have seen 'Slumdog Millionaire', you have watched 99% of ALL Indian Movies.Congraturaltions ji.",6,7,13,15 February 2009
The Island," Destined to Be a Cult Favourite
","This Movie is the reason why producers pay huge moneys to likes of Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts, Tom Hanks - OPENING WEEKEND. Then the word of mouth gets around and Opening Weekend turns into a huge success at box office.The producers of this movie should definitely get rid off the marketing team for this movie. They spent 100 million dollars to make this movie, yet the first time I heard about this movie was when I saw Conan O'Brien make fun of the fact that no one was watching it. And I am most certainly what you call a Movie Buff. If they couldn't even get my attention, and get me enthused to see this movie, then no wonder it failed at box office.My sole motivation to rent this movie was Scarlett Johanson and to see what 100 million looks like in a trash can.How wrong I was! This movie is beyond good, it is a GREAT MOVIE - equal to the likes of 'Army of 12 Monkeys' and '5th Element'.The problem with this movie was the cast, which although is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, but failed to attract an audience. It also lacked the necessary 'spook-level', especially in the commercials, which also caused the audience to be lost. I believe by the very nature of the movie, it would have been extremely easy for director to introduce enough spookiness and that alone could have helped it become a hit movie. It has tons of exhilarating action sequences, yet watching the ads you wouldn't know it was an action-packed movie.Despite all the sci-fi, the thrilling action sequences, this movie is totally entertaining, with enough comedy to make you laugh as well. However, most importantly, the reason it deserves high praise is that this movie also has HEART. It would move you to tears. It would compel you to think. Someday this movie would be used in debate regarding cloning. Kind of movie where you have to think hard to find flaws and you come up empty.Scarlett Johanson plays a clone of a Model and that is great because it preserves her beauty forever at her absolute prime. Ewan Mcgregor is great and the movie could not have been cast any better.When the truth is revealed about the purpose of their existence it is truly shocking and heart-breaking.I love the two main characters, especially Scarlett Johanson, the ease with which a complicated plot is handled, the suspense, the innocence of characters, the heart that this movie shows, and I totally love the ending, especially the last scene.This movie will form a Cult following for sure.",10,2,4,18 January 2006
