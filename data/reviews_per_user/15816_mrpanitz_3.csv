Catch Me If You Can," Thought this movie was cute/neat
","I thought this was a nice movie no real violence -(you see enough of that in a lot of movies)I also got a laugh from just the titles -you see these little figures chasing others.. and it was funny how Frank (Di capo) alwasy called FBI agent on Chistmas eve.. I also figure it was an inside joke this movie incidently was release on Chistmass eve!  the only thing missing as it starts out with Frank going on game called to Tell the truth and they start playing the game.. it would be nice to find out in the end who the Reall Frank was. was he number 1, number 2 or Number 3? so if you want  nice non violent movie go see it!",Null,0,1,1 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Warning you *must* see the first Lords of the ring movie first! or you will not understand this movie
","Since this is apparently a sequel to another Lords of the rings I didn't understand one bit of the movie and I never got around to see the first one so of course I didn't know who the good guys or bad guys  I almost walked out of the theater since I didn't understand the movie.. also be warned the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes long as well,, so thats my comment",Null,0,0,1 January 2003
