Ghost," Still entertains, one big flaw...
","Ghost, unfairly I think, gets slammed for bad acting and miscasting. I just saw it again (unfortunately on commercial-laden AMC) last night for perhaps the 5th time and it's held up remarkably well. My biggest gripe is the god-awful 'evil' special effects that contrast so poorly against some exemplary night shots of New York. I can sense Adam Greenberg howling at the special effects supervisor. It leaves me wondering how much better it could be made today from just a technical standpoint. Swayze did his best work here and injected just the right level of humor and horror--- unfortunately some of it is marred by less than state of the art SFX work (oddly, I could make the same argument to STARMAN, albeit Jeff Bridges' performance was far superior). Still watchable and highly entertaining! An 8.",8,0,1,4 February 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Astounding performances
","Austrian Christoph Waltz' menacing performance ranks among the top 5 of any actor I've ever seen (anyone tried to memorize 30 pages of dialog for a single scene and switch between languages lately?)--- reason alone to see this movie. I read where some reviwers found the scene 'boring' (?????!). The film itself is thoroughly entertaining. Tarantino delivers phenomenal performances from everyone, wrapped around historical revisionism with an anachronistic score straight out of a spaghetti western (yes, there are innumerable minor historical flubs, but yeesh, history it ain't!). The set design and visuals are remarkable. I had some very minor gripes: Pitt's character lacks depth, to the degree that I felt like some of his stuff was left on the cutting room floor, the Basterds deserved more screen time doing mayhem and Hitler's make up was iffy (contrast that with Mike Meyers' pasty British)---- gaaah! I didn't recognize Rod Taylor as Churchill (!). The visuals are stunning (the image of the screen burning: astounding) and Tarantino is obviously up on his knowledge of WW2 German cinema (Emil Jannings was a cool touch). I thought I heard Harvey Keitel 's voice on the phone--?! 10/10. See it for the acting! Not for kids...",10,3,9,29 August 2009
The Best Years of Our Lives," One of the finest movies ever made!
","I first saw THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES on some AFRTS TV station in Japan years ago on active duty and was amazed. I've seen it several times since and several scenes stick with me: Harold Russell's hooks peering through his pea coat, the humiliation of Dana Andrews' character returning to his old job at the soda fountain after being a decorated bombardier, the frustration felt by the retread sergeant/banker's inability to assist returning vets--- and especially the gut wrenching scenes of Russell's adjustment to his prosthetic arms shown without even a twinge of self-pity. This is absolutely masterful film-making and if Bill Wyler had never directed another film this alone would rank him at the very top of his craft. It stands the test of time as a testimonial to our ability to adjust and accept any burden life throws at us as a country, our spirit is effectively summed up by Andrews' last line in the movie, 'I can learn.' I understand this was originally made under the independent Liberty Pictures banner (as was Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which still sports the logo) but was absorbed under United Artists due to the financial implosion of the fledgling company. THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES belongs near the top 10 of AFI's all time greats... a timeless classic that deserves to be seen again and again. This is an example of art in American cinema.",10,2,3,16 September 2004
21 Jump Street," A good movie...?
","21 Jump Street (the series) is notable for just about 1 thing: Johnny Depp, who's matured into an interesting actor. How 21 Jump Street (the movie) rates these glowing reviews is beyond my comprehension. It's dumb... the central characters are not believable as cops or high school students. The plot--- what there is--- involves infiltrating a designer drug operation. The best that can be said about this mess is that it's ---slightly--- more coherent than most other idiotic TV show retreads (Starsky & Hutch being the crap standard against which I measure them all). Hollywood: Please stop making TV show adaptations!!! They all blow! But if anyone's interested I have a boffo idea for a HAZEL update...",2,6,13,29 July 2012
1941," And I Saw it on opening day...
","I vividly recall the (packed) audience's reaction at the end of 1941: eerie stunned silence... then some guy yelled 'what the hell WAS that?' and laughter erupted. I'm a huge Spielberg fan, but 1941 is just wretched excess. It's loud, destructive, unfunny and plot less (it's strictly situational). It's also a bit painful to watch all the now deceased wasted talent (Murray Hamilton, Lionel Stander, Wendy Jo Sperber, Belushi, The great Slim Pickens, Toshiro Mifune, Samuel Fuller, Bob Stack & others...). The film's uncredited cameos are strange (Penny Marshall? James Caan? Lenny & Squiggy from Penny's series??? C'mon...) This was a monumental waste of time, talent & piles of money. (1) unfunny star/10.",1,52,86,6 June 2009
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Easily Stiller's Best...
","Living in Chiang Mai, Thailand doesn't lend itself to seeing a wide variety of English- language films. You hit the 4th floor of one of the big malls and cross your fingers... today, this ritual paid off: The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was a thoroughly enjoyable experience (wait, wasn't this the guy to subjected me to Zoolander and Starsky & Hutch?). TSLWM is, at the core, about remaining engaged to life. This 2013 Mitty has little in common with it's 66-year namesake (Kaye's garish Technicolor daydreams advanced the plot line, here they're symptomatic of a 42-year old man realization he's lived disconnected to life itself). Kaye carried his daydreams into his conscious world, Stiller just checks out.-- but this isn't wrong here. Stiller's Mitty is forced to come to grips with the fear of entering middle age and having been nowhere and having practically done nothing. His most significant friend is a freelance photographer (Sean Penn) who he's never actually met--- through 16 years of contact through his work cataloging photo negatives for a dying Life Magazine. His leap into the rest of the world is amazing... taking us to parts of the world unknown to Hollywood (I could add that this is easily the best movie ever shot in Iceland)--- and it's great to see something again that leaves you smiling walking out of the theater (weird phenomenon: no one left until the lights came on! The theater was packed full of us foreigners and not one person left--- I've never seen that happen--- this could also be described as the perfect date movie for middle aged people who met on Match.com).",10,1,5,30 December 2013
Schindler's List," Negative comments?
","Excluding the alleged twist of historical facts, I'm really surprised at the number of people that hated this film. The acting is phenomenal and Spielberg may be rightly accused of being manipulative, but any film that can move 80% of an audience (I attended an opening night showing) to tears is incredible. There's a technical kudo: review the tracking shot Spielberg used when the Nazis invade the city (Schindler's on horseback on a date)... an astonishing achievement (superior to famous 1962's The Longest Day tracking scene...). I also love some of our foreign friends' opinions vis-a-vis our treatment of Indians, the Ludlow Massacre, etc. (inarguably horrible chapters in U.S. history). But that's akin to saying a British film stinks thanks to the Crusades. This is an outstanding film and certain scenes still resonate in my head (the child in the latrine, Schindler's end-of-film breakdown... or how I never could seem to pronounce Ralph, Rafe... Raphe... Finney... Finez... oh, forget it). This rates a 10++++ (and I hated 1941 and had a difficult time with Empire of the Sun...)",10,11,16,27 December 2009
Amadeus," A Rarity
","There are so few films that qualify as revelatory over repeated viewings (yeesh, this sounds like a snob piece straight out of the New Yorker). I can add nothing to the nearly unanimous kudos of the previous reviews except to note that Amadeus is one of those rare films that allow the medium to be called an art form. It's enormously entertaining (Foreman & Co. deserve credit for making gross historical inaccuracies so excusable) and deservedly earned it's 8 Oscars. Personally I would rate it alongside The Godfather (and II), Chinatown, The Hudsucker Proxy, The Best Years of Our Lives and Fargo as meeting my standard against which everything else is measured. In a world that gave us Porky's 2 and made Will Farrell a star, projects like this are still capable of being made. Incredible entertainment! ****************************************** out of 5.",10,1,2,1 April 2010
The Wolf of Wall Street," Marty... please stop with the voice over narrations already...
","Wow, WoWS is getting critically mauled on these user reviews! But indulge my 2-cents: What works: The level of acting is terrific. I'm not a Jonah Hill fan and I'll give his chops (rumor has it he was paid a paltry $60K in what's purported to be a $100 million production--- if true, he was robbed). His Donnie Azoff (aka in real life as Danny Porus) is a difficult character, having no redeeming qualities to draw from. DiCaprio also manages to pull off a convincing Jordan Belfort and as he possesses a face that has refuses to age, we see Belfort as a hungry 23-year old through about 1998. DiCaprio has a firm grip on the guy, and there's one outlandish scene involving a fistful of Quaaludes that kick in at an inopportune moment. Watching Leo chemically melt on a pay phone and throw his body like a mangled Slinky is the one best scene in the film. What doesn't work: The script is pointless. There's no moral center, not a single redeeming character to empathize with. The inevitable outcome happens with no great surprises, no clever plot twists, nothing. These people are all scumbags. A lot has been said about the nudity. I'm no prude and find it sadly amusing that we Americans don't bat an eye at catastrophic body counts in mindless action movies but howl at skin. But okay, WoWS has an unusually high amount of nudity, sex, raunch and Marty seems perfectly willing to give us what he wants. And I will agree that it should probably have been more correctly released as an NC-17 (the fact that this received a R at all makes me question the rating board itself). Another criticism: I've grown tired of the Scorsese narration. It worked in Goodfellas and Casino but without a tighter script, listing to a voice over pieced out over 3 hours weighs the film down. Although I enjoyed it more than most people here, it would've been greatly improved by whittling 25 minutes off a better script.",4,3,5,18 February 2014
Taken 2," One of the worst sequels ever made
","Taken 2: the audience. It's difficult to say anything positive about this mechanically constructed piece of crap. The fact that it earned over $100 million in profits is a horrid testament to the movie going public who apparently don't mind bad scripts, xenophobia, the suspension of disbelief required to have grenades tossed within a major city and not attract the attention of the police, horrible fight scene staging, and a ridiculously stupid drivers test subplot. This should be used by film schools everywhere as a textbook example of a bad sequel. What I really hated: the daughter is, in fact, played by a 30 year old actress who happens to look 30. Overprotective Liam obsesses about her having a boyfriend (gasp!) and the impact it has on her all-important drivers test... Yet she drives like an F1 driver with a stick while dodging bullets in Istambul. The writer-director also managed to relocate Albania and place it next to Turkey. How people can pass through post 9/11 borders armed to the teeth.And how it cheats the audience out of the fight scenes, real reason most of them were drawn to the damn thing in the first place. They are flash edited and incomprehensible, robbing any impact that would've made the stinking thing at least somewhat redeemable. This is a bad, bad, bad movie. I gave it an overly generous 1.",1,5,7,17 October 2013
Apollo 13," SUSPEND BELIEF...
","Take a second and consider the similarities between APOLLO 13 and TITANIC... you'd have to be a dolt not to know how both of these film were gonna end but think about the leeway James Cameron had over Ron Howard in the fictionalization department. Howard has accomplished something truly remarkable with APOLLO 13--- he's skillfully wrought out the personalities of (mostly still) living people and makes care about the dire peril they faced. While not diminishing Cameron's accomplishments with TITANIC (I had to be dragged into it, but found it affective), APOLLO 13 is the standard for all fact-based films in the future. Side note: Tom Hanks has worked on two continuation projects where you get the feeling he didn't want to let go of the subject matter: after APOLLO 13 (RACE TO THE MOON) and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (BAND OF BROTHERS), which is some kind of testimonial to the impact he felt in being involved with these projects. This was absolutely THE BEST film I saw during 1995 and deserves to be a part of any DVD library. Ron Howard easily ranks as one of the most compelling directors ever to work in Hollywood.",10,0,0,6 July 2003
Pineapple Express," Worst movie of 2008
","Pineapple Express is an excellent argument against smoking dope. The movie is amateurishly made, poorly plotted and the acting never rises to the point beyond where you're amazed everyone managed to memorize their lines (at one point Rosie Perez nearly breaks out laughing inappropriately in a scene). The violence is horrible. One drug dealer is shot twice and doesn't seem to have a pain threshold. Ed Begley Jr. is (no pun intended) wasted. While I can't accuse this piece of crap as glamorizing drug use, it amounts to 2 hours you'll regret. At the theater I was in, 8 people walked out--- and it was raining buckets outside--- and I saw one guy demanding a refund. P.E. is absolutely the worst movie I've seen this year!!!! Rating this one star is one too many. I can still smell it.",1,13,29,15 August 2008
The Wizard of Oz," Always a delight
","This rightfully ranks on the list of most folks' 10 best of all time. I grew up with it on annual re-runs (in the fog of my brain they were always hosted by Danny Kaye) that were a big deal every Easter. The film itself is full of ironies: it was released in August, 1939 to an indifferent audience and bombed. Producer Mervyn LeRoy was so financially damaged he swore never to put another cent of his own money in another movie. No adaption of Oz has ever been a hit in it's initial release. The film didn't achieve it's classic status until it was recycled on TV in the 50's (more irony: the vast majority of the first TV audiences viewed it in blazing black & white, taking out much of it's color transforming wallop). The back story production drama is well documented and only adds to the film's mystique. Unlike so many movies of our childhood, it remains as delightful as ever. It's an honest 10/10.",10,3,4,18 December 2010
