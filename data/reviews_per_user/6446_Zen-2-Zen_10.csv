Blade Runner 2049," Lame casting, mediocre flick
","Well at least it's officially box office looser (unless budget figure was faked) so we can hope that there won't the the 3rd. If they really wasted that kind of money, at least thy could have hired better actors.Ryan Gosling is simply incapable of doing anything. Yeah, he's a face that girls like but that's all - a Mamma Mia material. This is not a chick-flick, this required someone with serious acting chops.I don't know if he pulled the came con here like many times before. Running around show and magazines and serving lines to 'explain' that he's really a method actor and camera just doesn't see it because he's 'very subtle'. Wooden board is also very subtle :-)) Would have been much better if they used CGI for the character - seriously :-)Ana de Armas was 100x better (as virtual character). Sylvia Hoeks was so forced and artificial (as evil replicant) that just her scenes were already enough to kick viewer out of the film. Robin Wright was good but that's expected and she was alone and had short screen time.Nothing left to say, let's just forget it.",Null,4,7,27 July 2018
Ready Player One," Has Spielberg lost all his marbles?
","Or another greedy and nasty wife took over while keeping him in induced coma? Happened to him before :-) so I'm not kidding at all.Remember how people were spitting on Michael bay over the 'Transformers' ? Well, he turned out to be a total artist compared this - don't know even how to name it. His game-like sequences had actual purpose and integral place in the story (which did always exist, despite delusional naysayers).This thing is one colossal nothing in comparison. When I want a video game a fire up an Xbox. If something is declared to be a movie I expect a movie - not a copy of someone's YT recording.Someone please help wake up Spielberg from that coma repo his wife is keeping him in. Pretty please :-)I stumbled upon this just by looking around to see what else has Hannah Kamen done (quite legendary 'killjoy'). Shouldn't have clicked on it, but what can you do when your mice gets faster than your neo-cortex ? Took a long time to find her scenes so I can leave without admitting total waste of time.",Null,2,4,23 July 2018
Shutter Island," Inconsequential Pileup, Misleading Advertising and Scorsese as a Technician but not Artist
","First reason for giving this film 1 is misleading advertising. It's declared as a drama about a US Marshal investigating a disappearance case but it's actually a psycho horror movie far away from a case investigation drama by any standard and that is completely different and not particularly respected genre. So, unless you actually like psycho horror genre (with creeps and disfigured faces) you might as well save yourself time and grief.A greedy rookie looking for a quick score might be forgiven for cheating but for experienced director like Scorsese it's undignified gimmick persisted as a false description here on IMDb which is supposed to be truthful.Second reason is that it leaks water left and right and wastes enormous time to drag viewers through completely inconsequential pileup of scenes as if director couldn't make up his mind what to do or couldn't bear to give up scenes just because he had them. That's a trait of a technician who just collects scenes, not an artist who does scenes with a goal. Again, forgivable for a rookie but not for Scorsese.Writing something negative about Martin Scorsese is risky business these days but understanding what, how and why went wrong with this film may help to explain why after raising to early prominence with 'Taxi Driver' Scorsese never managed to become the artistic force that people expected and rooted for him to be.He doesn't seem to know where to stop when faced with inconsequential pileup of anything or to say no to a horror affectation in a film that's not declared as horror. Reaching for a horror affectation is always the sing of a director lost, and the place of easy slippage for a director trying to do a film noir and forgetting the line that can never be crossed.This problem becomes very clear in this since Scorsese started with a mystery novel which is choke full of pointless red herrings but the novel can't be blamed since for it's genre that's normal. People don't buy these books for artistic value but to spend disproportionate time reading throw-away red herrings.Director is the one who bears the responsibility for taking apart both the book and the leaky scrip which forgot the nature of the film as a form, reduce clutter and polish up till he has a coherent form. That is where the principal failure of Scorsese lies - not expending any artistic effort and acting as a technician greedy for more and more scenes which lead nowhere.This is again a thing that a rookie on a thin budget can be forgiven for but not Scorsese who is expected to refuse a script when it's too leaky to be worth fixing and is above all expected to have his films honestly declared as belonging to a genre they actually belong to.Mind you that this is not an academic point - when a film is as leaky as this one that destroys aspects that could have worked well. Clear example is how it ruined otherwise excellent concept of nested dreams. It uses conceptual structure of a nested dream that Nolan used with great brilliance in 'Inception' and the two films were produced during roughly the same time frame but with Scorsese starting and finishing first and DiCaprio playing in both. So it's fair to assume that the nested dream concept was the fashion of the season and that Nolan was a copy-cat so to speak.Nolan however made the nested dream concept fully consequential and held the whole structure of his film tight and fully functional. At the same time Scorsese allowed it to disintegrate into inconsequential mess of not even red herrings but completely sideways fluff. In hindsight one can say that Nolan saved the concept of nested dreams from being ruined forever by Scorsese's careless use.It's hard to say if this is the worst film in Scorsese's opus, because fragments do have technical quality if considered in isolation, but it is the most disingenuous and incoherent.",Null,1,3,13 April 2011
Baby Driver," Now this is a good thriller with good acting
","I had a laugh reading how some people wrote stuff as this was advertised as a Cannes winner or something.It's a thriller with good driving sequences. Sub-genre that has it's rules.That keeps it way ahead of the usual pack is acting. At least 4 actors created great miniatures that the'll be proud to mention even in 10 years.This is why I'm so sorry that Lily James allowed herself to be attached to that stain named 'Mamma Mia'. This is the caliber that she can actually do. Given the good director who knows his light sculpting (watch her face, compare to 'Mamma Mia' - huge difference).Jon Hamm also good, as expected, Ansel Elgort, interesting surprise (for people not in the know it takes a lot of discipline and skill to do that kind of frozen face, but steaming and ready to explode), even Kevin Spacey was good (I don't expect anything from him, ever :-) and Jamie Foxx had his on bats-crazy sub-show (proving that that Oscar wasn't political).The 'problem' this flick has is that it is ensemble piece and they never get Oscars since they can't have distinctive 'stars' by definition and Academy keeps stubbornly refusing to add ensemble award.",Null,0,2,26 July 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The most boring disappointment of the decade
","It is indeed so boring and painfully pointless that one can comfortably browse news on the web and chat and still not miss anything. I suppose this is what happens when some people get too obsessed with their childhood readings. Perhaps it had faithful audience at the time of release among Tolkien and/or child-lit fans, but just a decade latter it's thoroughly unwatchable unless you are a kid and a Tolkien aficionado.Littered with pompous and meaningless Tolkien language and large fillers with a narrator dumping drivel with 'illustrations', in the end it's simply a pile up of fragments leading literally nowhere.Interesting thing to compare is the 'Harry Potter' opus since it's also a child-lit but has been transfered into much more dynamic and at least semi-interesting to watch set of movies which have decent dynamics even if you are not a Rowling aficionado at all.",Null,1,4,22 April 2011
How to Train Your Dragon," No Oscars For Highest Quality? Again ?
","I watched this and 'Toy Story 3' out of curiosity and to stay well informed, without any expectations of an actual high quality material. Imagine my surprise when my eyes remained glued to the screen and how soon I forgot the plastic-looking faces of some characters (common problem with with today's 3D animation attempts). This film has just about the strongest (and even layered) story seen in animated features in decades and transcends the basic (kid) audience in every aspect. Not to mention impeccable animation, flight scenes and black 'dragon' close ups in particular. Think 'Avatar' meets 'E.T.' but with some decent character development as well. In comparison the 'Toy Story 3' is just an infantile plastic to the last shot unless you are bellow certain age.It's a sorry state of Oscar affairs in the Animated Feature category when a forgettable flick like 'Toy Story' gets declared 'better' than this masterpiece. Whether it was just a stupid bow to the highest box office number, old grudges or a refusal of a film with some intellectual and emotional depth will remain a mystery.This film will remain a highly respected work decades from now when 'Toy Story' is long forgotten even by those who were young enough to swallow it initially.",Null,1,1,2 September 2011
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Might be the last Lily James flick worth watching
","The one who did deliver earth-shattering performance, albeit as a miniature, was Jessica Brown Findlay. She didn't need any hand-holding. Took what little she was given and ran with it. Now it becomes clear why was she so afraid of Downton Abbey and wanted early exit. She used similar 'method' there - took whatever little was given and turned it into something substantial on hew own. She was probably not given anything further to work with which was a red flag indeed. Now I wish someone would put her Ophelia somewhere on-line. Lily James wasn't anything close to it, just a sketch of what she can, or could have done. After that horror named 'Mamma Mia' I don't have much hope left but I hope I'm wrong and that she was terribly sick while ding that 'other thing'. But she will have to get back to top shape, both physically and mentally very fast.Decent, watchable flick, albeit sinking into ridiculous 'designer romantic' ending. Director doing much more than the lead, but showing what she can do with good guidance and decent light and photography. Unfortunately all that is gone after that other thing and no one can have the faintest idea whether that's reversible or is she going to remain the premature 50 that no one dares to do a close-up with anymore. It could also be that Lily James tends to fall for chick-lit-ish content.A warning for people reading this - if you haven't seen that other thing - just don't :-) It will haunt you like an early childhood trauma for years. Keep your eyes closed, pray hard and wait the next year - might help :-))Oh and another great miniature, by that redhead chick called Isola :-) I kept staring at her, sure that I saw that face before but I just couldn't place it anywhere. Because she looked much younger here. We know her as the matriarch from 'Humans'. They should have let Mia do a cameo - that would be something :-)",Null,2,4,5 August 2018
Mother!," Simply Boring
","I think it took me 5 or 6 times to force myself to see it to the end. He lost the thread and momentum quite early and then went to fake 'drama'. Disconnected patches of affectations. Attempts to fake continuity long lost. A lot of way too obvious fake 'developments' and quotes but really nothing. When you start noticing that it's forced and not once but X times you are completely out of the 'flow' (in part because it stopped existing long time age) and you have to force yourself do continue watching just to be able to say that you saw it. In between you read and answer a lot of e-mails, go to eat, go to online chat, catch yourself actually procrastinating but you know that you have to finish it for the sake of finishing it. Becomes a chore.I'm sure that in his mind he was doing something 'mythical' and probably wouldn't listen to anyone at all. Ended up with Aronofsky himself repeating a variation of 'it's controversial' in attempt to sell a few more tickets, betraying that he's fully aware that even that is fake.The reason why it tanked at the box-office is not that it's 'controversial' but simply boring.",Null,7,13,7 October 2017
The Greatest Showman," What a waste of celluloid, padon disk space
","Sooo producers started paying bots to post early praises by the pound ? Seriously ? :-))))) The 'industry' has gotten THAT desperate ???? I had to sort by time since 'most helpful' reviews looked so ridiculous. And then everything became clear.Musicals are usually stupid, pretty much by definition, but the genre manages do produce something good once in a decade. Needless to say that this thing is not in that group. One shouldn't expect anything from a flick that Zac Efron is attached to anyway. And that girl named 'Zendaya' ?? They should do cartoons with them - to save on ink and labor for frame drawing :-)Hugh Jackman apparently got a water running through his ears after 'Les Misérables' and 'conveniently forgot' that Anne Hathaway actually carried that one on her back, together with several equally brilliant actors, and that he was really not much more that a furniture there. Or should we say mise en scène ? :-)Thank god for for the skip button.",Null,5,10,26 August 2018
The Soloist," Excellent Foxx, good Downey, lame direction (Wright)
","I was curious to see why was this film a distinctive looser among otherwise excellent Wright's films. It's hard to guess how and why it happened (the crack in L.A.'s air maybe? :-) but he completely lost any sense of pacing, building up and maintaining the momentum. Kind of as if he was doing a documentary instead of a feature with a sizable budget. One even has to wonder where on earth did all that money go?Part of the problem is the script that was way too much burdened by trying to be 'true to life' of actual Steve Lopez which is rather boring. Actual Lopez just talks/writes drivel on and on and on and it's natural to him since he's a journalist. A dramatist needs to have the sense of building up a momentum and making characters more intense and colorful than they are in real life or the audience falls a sleep.So the principal fault of Joe Wright as a director was that he didn't tear a lame script to shreds but followed it and even worse go influenced by it and made the film even more flat, slow and boring. If doesn't help to have one Jamie Foxx who can deliver as much intensity as you'd let him when you don't let him. It doesn't help to have Robert Downey when you force him to be a talking head. It doesn't help to have an ex wife as a figurehead when you don't develop some juice and intensity without being self-conscious about whether actual Lopez had some juice with his ex or not.Full feature film is not a documentary and fails every time it tries to be. That's the principal rule that Joe Wright forgot while making this film and Foxx and Downey bailed him out only to a degree to which they were allowed to. It also looks like Catherine Keener was ready and willing to do much juicier ex wife but also wasn't allowed to.",Null,0,1,2 September 2011
