50 First Dates," Loved the Movie
","I gotta say this is probably my favorite Adam Sandler movie.  It had enough laughs to keep it goin, while was serious enough to draw you in.  Even though I have seen all of his other movies, the jokes never seemed stale. Everytime you get used to Sadlers humor, sean astin or one of the other characters step in and pick up the slack. My only complaint is ten second tom, really annoying and at the end when he interupted them in the studio. It did nothing but kill the mood.  It wasn't funny, it should have been left out.  The ending with 'somewhere over the rainbow', just ties the whole movie together and gives you a good feeling to take home with you when you leave the theater.",10,0,0,23 February 2004
