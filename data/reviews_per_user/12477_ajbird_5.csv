First Man," Boring boring boring
","Ryan Gosling is the most boring, unintesesting actor who consrantly gets cast as boring and uninteresting roles.. either he is brilliant at his job or just boring and uninteresting.
Seriously .. how do you make a film about going to the moon so BORING??
Apparently Neil could not give a damn about flying or crashing or going to the moon",3,2,6,10 March 2019
Ready Player One," ignore the book moaners
",After reading all the negative reviews on here from those who read the book 1st I went and read the book. The film is a perfectly good representation of the book material. Both are great experiences in and of themselves.Do not be put off.,9,1,7,28 April 2018
Logan," slow, depressing, plot hole ridden nonsense
","We have been putting off watching tis for a while.. The kids did not seem interested but we eventually ran out of things to watch so this was next.
Had we read some of negative reviews we might have been prepared.. However, I had seen a few claiming this was great.. should have known better.From the start you are hit in the face that every Xman movie that has gone before. including some set in the future are all wiped clean and count for nothing.All mutants are gone and only wolverine and charges (and presumly a few others) are left. All was for nothing.. quick silver might as well have let them all burn in the explosion at the school.In this crap vision of the future we run into the plot from Dark Angel (you can add Stranger Things into the mix).. without Jessica Alba. The mutant kids have again broken out of Manticore and one of them was built from Logans DNS.Max.. I mean Laura is total bad ass and can taken on dozens of armed men.. except at the end when her and your entire band of escaped mutants can't take on anyone. The whole films is dreary and depressive. Jackman and Stewart ham it up as best they can.. but by the end we are left wondering why bother. They could so easily have thrown in a happy ending which would have justified the previous 2 hours.. but no.. the kids run over the border to Canada to an uncertain future with no one to guide them.",3,3,5,17 December 2017
The Witch," fails is every possible way
",In our house there are two films we use an in-joke references to all things terrible.. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 and Angel Dog.. and now... The Witch.Fist of all it fails as a horror film. A horror film only has one job.. to be scary.. There is nothing remotely scary or even slightly spooky about the whole film. There are a few gross moments but nothing that remotely concerns the viewer.The family have no redeeming qualities so there is little reason to empathise with them. They are a pair of religious nuts who have been banished because they are too nutty for the other religious nuts to live with.The setting is nice and there is a good opportunity to build some suspense about the wood they live under... which is never taken.One of the biggest problems with the show is a technical one. The sound mix is horrible.. The score is ridiculously loud and jarring (irritating rather than spooky) and the voice channel is really low. This is compounded by the fact that the actors barely pronounce their dialogue in a coherent manner. I appreciate they are trying to recreate old dialects but there is no excuse for the muttering they deliver. In order to hear anything you need the volume way above normal and the the horrible score will kick and shake the windows. Seriously.. we had to rewind a few times just to hear what had been said and shrugged a few times.There is one good point.. Harvey Scrimshaw who plays Caleb does a really good job.. the others are very forgettable.I was ready to turn if off with 30 mins ready to go but the wife insisted we have come this far and should push on. After all the ending might justify this bore fest.As for the ending.. please let there be a good ending.. fat chance. This makes no sense what so ever.. the twins vanish.. the nice girl who has just watched her whole family die decides to join the devil and go wondering naked through the woods. Really...I can only assume those who are rating this more than 2 stars got the film mixed up with something else.,1,6,14,13 June 2016
Mother!," 3rd worst film I have ever seen
","The witch is the worst film I have ever seen.. followed by Angel dog.. but this is a good contender for the top place. For a story to be an allegory (for anything) it has to be an actual story.. not just a series of meaningless events. This is a hack attempt at portraying humanities disregard for nature? or something like that. However, the only conclusion you can take away is that god is a narcissistic psychopath who cares for neither his creation or the humans he placed in it only his own adoration. Perhaps that was the film makers point.. who knows. The killing of the baby was totally gross and uncalled for and worthy of Blood Drive or Evil Dead.Like The Witch the manner is which is was made was almost as bad as the plot.. cameras were constantly in the face of the protagonist or bouncing all over the place constantly throwing the viewer out of the film back to the living room. The characters behaviour made no sense .. the poet or the 'mother' or the humans for that matter and the further the film went on the more silly it got. We were laughing by the end it was so daft.",1,4,8,15 April 2018
