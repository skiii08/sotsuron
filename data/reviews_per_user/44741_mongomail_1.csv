Marie Antoinette," The worst movie ever made!!!
","It moved slow, was historically inaccurate. It was her daddy giving her a Multi-million dollar doll house to play with. I would rather spend an evening with an IRS auditor or getting my finger nails slowly pulled out.The historical inaccuracy was insulting. Marie Antoinette was not a clueless victim. She was a frivolous, self-involved, and incapable individual and queen. It was a miserable failure at communicating the source from which it was taken. The movie conveyed nothing. It taught nothing. It was utterly worthless. It was as much a waste of time as it was a waste of celluloid.",1,17,30,21 October 2006
