Deja Vu," Fine Film
","I am trying to recall any film Denzel Washington made that wasn't well acted, and without an interesting plot. The man is both a fine actor, and highly selective about the films he chooses to be in. I notice the vast majority of reviews show 8 or 10 stars. I was amused by a few that gave around 3 stars, attempting to explain why. One in particular explained why the 'science' was wrong. Well, this is a fantasy film, not a doctoral thesis. Who cares? It is inventive. One of the 'issues' being, how could there be 2 Denzels. Well, if someone really could travel back in time, how does anyone know one would 'disappear', so there would be only one? If it is possible to change history, what makes that impossible? Another remark which amused me was the car was not moving fast enough to push the other car off of the ramp. If that is the case, then Double Jeopardy (Tommy Lee Jones & Ashley Judd) and a whole lot of other films are equally wrong. Well, the cars were not that far apart, you couldn't accelerate to 60mph on that short a distance. But if the pedal is down the the floor, you likely could push it. Somehow that didn't really bother me either, when watching the film. Maybe I was just being entertained, in the manner the film really intended me to be?",8,1,2,25 June 2007
