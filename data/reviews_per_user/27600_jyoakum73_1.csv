The King's Speech," vote for Geoffrey
","A modern classic. No need for fluff.This movie has character, rhythm, pace, good lighting, wonderful stages, timed exchanges...So years later I recall the voice/stutter coach and his artistic ownership only to discover an IMDb offense that requires addressing.Geoffrey is a main character. A main actor. A main influence.Silliness! Please Raise this man in the actors tree and be forgiven. For crying out loud I flat out feel imbalanced and need a swig.Regards, JonathanBe good.",9,0,1,14 October 2014
