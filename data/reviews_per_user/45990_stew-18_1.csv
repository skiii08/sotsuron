Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," think about it
","I as anyone one else was looking forward to this film. After seeing all the previews i thought this would be s**t hot. O the day i went to see it i decided to have a few beers with my pals before.......bad mistake. After seeing it i left the cinema feeling dissapointed. I called the film one of the worst films id seen. Two weeks later i decided to go and see it again in a sober frame of mind. What a difference.I REALLY , REALLY enjoyed it second time around. I put this down to the fact that the first time i saw it i  was really looking forward to seeing Darth Maul, and i kept willing the movie to hurry up till i saw him. When i actually sat down and watched it for its story, it turns out to be an actually good film and it leaves you with various questions as how it will turn out  eg.1.Palpatine.....my personal favorite ...How does he become the emperor. 2.C3-P0  how does he become embroiled in the saga 3.the obvious question about Anakin.The movie itself:Why was Darth Maul so underused? He had the makings of beihg the greatest villian EVER.... Maybe im alone in this thought.. but..apart from the Empire Strikes Back. all the movies have a 'happy ending'  .Most people really like the DARK side and would like to see the BADDIES get their way.(im i alone in this thought..let me know)NO ONE WILL PROBABLY EVER READ MY REVIEW BUT IF YOU DO LET ME KNOW.I WILL APPRECIATE IT. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU. STEW.....",Null,0,1,6 August 1999
