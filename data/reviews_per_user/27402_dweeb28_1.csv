Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Original To the Max
",Need I say more? Absolutely stunning and a creative marvel. The problem with Hollywood these days is they have run out of good scripts to use and this is just perfect. Pamala Anderson...sure she is having some problems in her personal life but this will no doubt revive her career. I think us moviegoers are tiring of the same old good guy bad guy nonsense that Hollywood has been exploiting for way too long. We need more original ideas and less Tom Cruise movies.Any Oscar potential for this one? I just hope the old farts that run the academy have a good sense of humour and give this movie the credit that is deserves. What stuns me is to why Kid rock would be upset at Pamela for such a good job she did here. Maybe he is just jealous or maybe Pamela see's stars and doesn't want to drag along her trailer trash friend for the ride. Anyways....like I said this movie is going to be a classic and defiantly deserves it's place in the IMDb Top 250 movies of all time.,9,0,5,19 December 2006
