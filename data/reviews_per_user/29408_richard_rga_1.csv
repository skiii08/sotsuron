Ford v Ferrari," More than meets the eye
","The movie is more than what the title tells you ,more than a competition between Ferrari and Ford owners, it's the passion for racing and the connection you develop with your car when you build it from scratch. Highly recommended. When you leave the cinema you want to take your car for a perfect lap",9,3,4,7 December 2019
