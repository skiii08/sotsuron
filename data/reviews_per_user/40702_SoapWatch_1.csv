Walk the Line," No Orange Blossom Special~no Boy Named Sue??
","How can they possibly make a Johnny Cash song without 'Orange Blossom Special' the song that had that famous harmonica sequence and Johnny's most famous line, 'I don't care if I do die, do die, do die...' And then there is no 'A Boy Named Sue' probably one of his popular hits.I just can't help wonder if they might do a sequel with all the success the movie has received.Both leading actors do a tremendous job playing the characters. I would have never expected Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon to make these characters practically their own while still seeming like the real actual people.Excellent movie except for the things it's missing.I am also stunned at some of the deleted scenes that should have been left in the movie. Some of the deleted scenes are a part of what would have made the movie so good.",7,1,2,5 March 2006
