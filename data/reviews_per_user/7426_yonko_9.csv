The Blair Witch Project," Great 'Movie'
","The first mistake viewers make when they watch this movie is they treat it like a 'movie'. The Blair Witch Project is a movie but it wasn't filmed as a movie. It was filmed as live footage. It's a mocumentary.
Everytime this movie comes up in conversation people say the acting was bad, it was in black and white, the cinematography was non existant, you never saw the witch, and so on and so on. If any of those elements were different the movie wouldn't have been what it was supposed to be about. It would have ruined the entire production. The actors weren't actors. The shakey filming made the film seen more amateur. And you never saw the witch because how could you? The students filming the documentary had no idea what was after them. How could you know more than they knew? You watched the film through their eyes. There was no second or third party in this film. You only saw what they saw and that's it. If there was a script, you saw the witch, and the film looked professional it would have been completely pointless. This is a great little film. But no one watches it the way it was intended.",10,1,3,2 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Menacing Experience
","Ugh.......Where shall I begin?Bad acting.No plot.Bad script.Jar Jar Binks....I grew up with Star Wars. I loved the original trilogy. This movie makes me want to puke. The entire movie is just a miss-match of junk. There's no coherency in this film what so ever. It's hard to follow and it's boring. And why have we been subjected to Jar Jar? Spare me, please. The light sabre battle at the end of the film was probably the best part of the film, but that's not saying much.",4,0,1,3 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Crap
","Being a kid of the 80s I loved Star Wars. I watched the 3 original movies over and over again, and I never got tired of them. Well, tonight I watched Attack of the Clones and it has to be one of the worst films I've seen in a long time.The acting is really bad. I've seen better acting in Skinemax soft-core porn movies. Natalie Portman and Hayden Christiansen are down right terrible. It's painful to watch them try to act. And Samuel L. Jackson isn't much better, and that's sad because he is a fine actor. Honestly, Christopher Lee, R2D2, and C3PO steal the show. At the end of the movie I was hoping that Christopher Lee would just kill everyone and end Star Wars forever.
The script is bad. I think that's mainly why actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan MacGregor seemed like cardboard cut-outs. The script is held together by amazing special effects, but at times I think the special effects were overdone.Also there's no depth in any character. No character in the film makes you want to like them accept for Christopher Lee. Like I said...I just wanted Lee to kill them all and end this miserable film.Natalie Portman looked good in the tight and skimpy white outfit at the end of the movie. Lots of computer generated images and Natalie Portman in skimpy clothing. That's all you need to sell a big Hollywood piece of trash.",5,3,7,3 November 2003
Armageddon," Thank God for Hollywood
","What would movie goers do without Hollywood? Films like Armageddon make the movie experience for the viewer to be enjoyable and entertaining. Lots of loud noises, special effects, machine guns, American flags, rednecks, hot girls, and beer. That's what makes a good Hollywood film. Every movie should be just like Armageddon. It's the perfect film. There's really nothing to understand in the film. All you have to do is sit back and watch the mindnumbing trash on the screen. That's all. The script is totally pointless so that's why we have TONS of special effects and really loud explosions and big machine guns. Who cares about what the 'characters' have to say. Just have lots and lots of explosions. In other words this is one of the worst 'films' ever made. It's a piece of trash that should be strapped to a rocket and sent to an asteroid in the middle of space.This 'film' has nothing. It has no 'characters'. It has no 'dialoge'. It has no 'plot'. I think if all the actors were replaced with apes it would have been just as effective.",Null,0,1,3 November 2003
Pearl Harbor," This film should be at the bottom of Pearl Harbor
","Wow. Where to begin? When I sat down to watch this movie I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be halfway decent at best. Well, I was wrong. Way wrong. The movie is so long and drawn out it's terrible. You just sit there and think to yourself, 'why am I watching this and why should I care about what's going on?' There is NO plot that's worth while and NO depth to the characters. It's just a bunch of Hollywood garbage. The love story and the war were not tied together enough. Actually, they weren't tied together at all. It was like there were two stories going on at once that have nothing to do with each other. The movie is called Pearl Harbor, but it wasn't about Pearl Harbor, it was about a romance that has no depth. Blah. Boring. The only decent scene is when the ships are being blown apart. Wonderful. And I love how Hollywood film makers add in garbage to spice things up. Like the dog fight with the American planes and the Zero's. That never happened. Atleast make something that's SOMEWHAT historically accurate. No history No story. No depth. No plot. Gotta love the special effects, though! BOOM! BANG! POW! Watch everything explode.
This is one of the worst movies ever filmed. It's one example that Hollywood would do anything to the public in  order to sucker them in to make a buck. This is Hollywood garbage at it's finest.",1,10,16,8 July 2003
Pearl Harbor," Terrible
","I am watching the movie right now. The second part just came on. Top Gun/Titanic/The Return of Martin Guerre that turned out worse than Titanic. The special effects are great but that's about the only positive thing about this movie. It's a 3 hour waste of time. The love story is long, dull, and pointless. The historical facts are all wrong, too. I have watched better movies on Lifetime.",1,0,1,12 January 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," People don't know what they are missing.
","I couldn't get anyone to go to the theater with my to watch this movie. A friend told me it was good, but when I asked other people to see they heard so many people say it was horrible and they wouldn't go. Well, I went by myself, and I sat through that movie and was truly amazed. This movie had a wonderful story line, the cinematography was amazing, it reminded me of old kung fu movies but 100 times better. Most people don't want to accept and they don't want to use their imagination. This movie requires you to do both. Most people want a movie served to them on a plate and you see what you get. Probably the people that dislike this movie think Pearl Harbor was a masterpiece.",Null,1,2,16 December 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Visually Stunning
","2001 and is not about dialogue and that's why many people say it's boring. There is enough dialogue to hold the story together and that's it. But the story line of 2001 is told through visual effects and scores by classical composers.This film also contains some of the greatest moments in cinematic history. when the ape-man learns to use the bone as a tool, and when ape-man tosses the bone into the air and when it comes tumbling down it turns into a space station. But there are other scenes within the film that are absolutely amazing, too. The characters in the film lack complexity except for HAL. The computer is the only character that you can actually develop feelings for. All of the other characters are one dimentional, which they are supposed to be.
It took Kubric 5 years to make this movie and you can tell. It's a masterpiece.",10,0,2,1 June 2003
The Bridge on the River Kwai," 'What have I done?'
","I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago on TCM. When I sat down to watch it I had no idea what to expect. The openings scene with the troops marching and whistling was confusing at first but then everything fell into place. I have noticed that many people seemed to think the film was too long. But for some reason I don't think the film would have worked if it was chopped in half. For about an hour of the movie it is just British troops toiling in a Japanese prison camp, while Alec Guinness is caged in a box. That hour of the film set everything else up and everything fell into place.
I doubt a movie like The Bridge on the River Kwai could ever be made again. If viewers don't see sex and explosions in the first 45 minutes people get bored. If this movie was released in 2003 it would be a major box office blunder. This movie really shows how cinema has changed in 40some years. Too bad movies like this can't be made today.",10,3,5,9 September 2003
