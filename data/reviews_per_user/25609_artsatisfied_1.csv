Blade Runner 2049," You can't please everyone.
",I thought this movie was excellent. The cinematography is stunning. I really enjoyed the storyline. The cast is wonderful. Most people are mad because it leaves open the possibility of another movie. So be it. Some of y'all just need a big hug.,9,4,12,9 August 2018
