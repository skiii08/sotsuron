Kill Bill: Vol. 2," plop plop (western reference-sound effect from rear of horse)
","Quite liked the original and got the homage to the old Hong Kong kung fu movies. I read a number of pre-release blubs saying Vol II would have a western theme, great I like old westerns. If mister Tarentino is a master film maker he used all that skill on Vol 1 and had nothing left for Vol II this 'in my opinion' is the worst movie I have seen in the last ten years. Some other reviews here have said the distributors wanted to split Kill bill into two 1.5 hour movies, this sounds good but KB2 had at most 30 minutes of useful footage the rest was longwinded dialogue sessions that in most cases added little to plot or character development and should have been left on the cutting room floor. It should have been left as one 2 hour movie",1,21,41,11 May 2004
Mission: Impossible III," there's no I in team, Tom
","The first MI Movie would be in my top 10 favs it had the style of the old TV series but was updated well, the second was complete rubbish. I remember reading a critics review for the second film saying Mr Cruise is on the screen most of the time, this didn't leave much time to develop any other characters, this seemed to be even more the case with the third film. I don't seem to remember more that 30 sec in the whole film that dosen't cut back to scene with T.C. even Ving Rhames 'the only other recurring part' is reduced to almost a bit part and Philip Seymour Hoffman is great but should have had a bit more time to develop the bad-guy character. The set piece at the Vatican lifts the whole thing a little a bit. It is pretty obvious most of the budget was spent on effects and toms pay cheque and not the script.",1,9,16,14 May 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Good effects, needed better plot and dialog
","Saw this a couple of days ago, I liked the previous movies episodes 3-4 'Phantom Menace' was Ok, with the exception of Jar Jar Stinks. Thankfully in Clones he is reduced to a bit part. Anakin seemed to spend half the movie moaning about this or that, the movie itself was a tour de force 'pardon the pun' of special effects and it was good see more of the star wars universe than just deserts and space stations. BUT the plot was the worst yet, the love story was lame. And even a plot error C3p0 & R2D2 now seem to be main characters in these movies too, but in Stars wars 4 Obi wan has no memory of them. Maybe if George Lucas didn't try to do all the main jobs director, writer and screenplay. Episodes 4-5 were directed by other people and where the best of the five movies so far.In Clones, when Obi Wan goes to the street cafe, for information, two of the digital characters 'the cook and robot waitress' seemed to have some sort of shimmer at the beginning of the scene, which looked like a fault. A full digital Yoda was very good and quite handy with a lightsabre, a good number of the audience laughed as this scene started but it worked better as it went along.Overall good effects but needed better story, effects only carry a movie so far, although I'm sure it will still make a zillion dollars",1,0,1,23 May 2002
