Iron Man 3," So underrated
",I just finally watched this for the second time. What a fantastic addition to the MCU. The air rescue sequence is stunning. Such a great sequel.,8,0,0,14 February 2020

","Reading through all the criticism it seems to generally add up to these issues for everyone:
1-It didn't go the way they wanted it to.
2-It wasn't like the other movies.
3-The ending was sad.All three of those actually contributed to me loving the movie. I disagree wholeheartedly that the ending was totally sad. Their was definitely some serious sadness that an era was ending but I found myself also celebrating the new beginning for some characters. The animation was the best I've ever seen in a movie and the bar is now set extremely high (as per usual with Pixar). Was this movie necessary? No, but what movie is? (I've never understood that argument). I thought 3 (still my favorite in the saga) wrapped up things perfectly but that just made 4 a pleasant surprise. To each his own, but my wife and I loved it and so did our kids!",10,2,5,18 October 2019
