The Blair Witch Project," Unforgettable
","Gripping....this movie is gripping.  For all those folks who enjoy camping and don't think much of those noises you always hear during the night, this movie will change your thinking.I've been replaying scenes in my head since I walked out of the theater 4 hours ago.  THIS is the true definition of a scary movie.  Will it begin a new trend in movies?  I think so.",10,2,3,30 July 1999
