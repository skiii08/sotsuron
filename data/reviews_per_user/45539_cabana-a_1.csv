Black Swan," Black Swan.
","'I felt it â€” perfect. It was perfect.' At first I was hesitant to watch this movie. Nothing in the trailer really appealed to me, but I am so happy I did! Often times the best films are not the big blockbusters with all the A list actors (not that the Black Swan lacks these) or the action-packed ones with the generic story lines, but are the ones that are able to arouse intense feelings and emotions, whether good or bad, within us. Black Swan induced emotions from anxiety to fear to pity to disgust to awe. At one moment I wanted to cringe, and the next moment I wanted to cry, all in between repeating intervals of one another. The dimensions and progression of Nina's dynamic character left me constantly changing my perception of her. Being caught up in Nina's delusional world often made it hard to predict what would happen next or what the final outcome would be, which ties the movie together perfectly. I highly recommend this movie and predict at least an Oscar nomination for this well thought out, acted and directed screen play.",10,1,4,5 January 2011
