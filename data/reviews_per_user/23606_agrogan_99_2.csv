Skyfall," Another masterpiece of 2012
","So, we have a James Bond film that stars Judy Dench, Javier Bardem, and Ralph Fiennes, along with a song by Adele. This movie should be a success.And, good enough, it is.The movie stars Daniel Craig as James Bond, but, to tell the truth, it doesn't seem to be ABOUT Bond. Yes, of course, he's the reason why we want to see the film, but the plot of the movie hardly revolves around him. Rather, Dench, who plays the Mother character, has a sort of Norman Bates-like fellow trying to kill her, and has herself and Bond in a vengeance plot that affects quite a lot of innocents.Speaking of the Norman Bates-like character. I love Bardem as an actor, especially the chilling role of Anton Chigurh in 'No Country for Old Men'. Here, the creepiness levels are through the roof; having an unhealthy obsession with Mother and cyanide eating at his brain, he's quite a twisted, but interesting villain.The references to older Bond films are genius. Everybody in the theater actually clapped when Bond's old car came out, and everybody laughed when Bond gave a cutting line about the Union Jack bulldog. And of course, Eve Moneypenny was another great throwback to the old days as well.Let me talk about Bond. Whereas before we had a cheesy, perfect, and charming 007, this time we have a complex Bond who is armed with only a gun (of course, a Walther PPK) and radio. It makes this Bond seem more human (or as human as a top secret agent can be) and he does have a sort of charm and humor about him one typically associates with Sean Connery.The plot itself is rather clever. While there are a few throwaway moments, like that woman working for Bardem and the new Quartermaster, they are usually enjoyable in their own right. The main plot is strong, seeing some of the inner workings of MI6 and it's connections with the British government.So, combine this with classic and new Bond themes, a brilliant changing of the guard in MI6, and some big name actors, and we have one of the best Bond films to date, up there with Goldeneye and Goldfinger. It truly balances out the bad films this year, and reenergizes a classic fictional hero.And frankly, I believe it deserves more than the 8.1 IMDb ranking it has at the time this review is being written.",10,23,39,17 November 2012
Lincoln," An almost perfect film honoring one of America's greatest
","Summary: An almost perfect film honoring one of America's greatest Steven Spielberg is one of those directors, who can almost perfect anything he touches. Well, not always perfect it, but make it good enough. So, now he touches upon the 16th president of America. Does he succeed? Well, if that 9 out of 10 didn't tell you, I think he did.Every actor in this movie is perfect. While their lines aren't always great and are often cheesy and forced at points, each actor was a superb casting choice. Daniel Day-Lewis alone seals this film with his high, reedy voice, and tired and lined face. Tommy Lee Jones's character was amusing, as was each member of the House representatives.That's not to say all of them were, as I said, eased into the movie with little force. For example, Jeremy Strong's performance as William Seward rather annoying, and even some of Lincoln's outbursts I found unnecessary and long. But probably the biggest unnecessary plot point was Gordon-Levitt's performance as Robert Lincoln, which never influenced the main story and just lead to character development we already know is there.It's fairly hard to explain. In historical films, the attempt to use character development and classic clich√©s doesn't always work. Now, you could say it is pleasant to really experience the drama of a tragic and legendary event by buttering up the victim to the point of the victim seeming like a messiah. But here's the problem here: Lincoln already is a messiah-like figure, so trying to make his personal struggles more dramatic seems forced in some areas.But that's only in some areas because there are incredibly powerful moments in the film involving historical drama. The scene where Lincoln and his wife argue about his son's decision was quite strong, and led to a touching and relevant scene. And of course, the scene where Lincoln finally passes the 13th Amendment is brilliant.Finally, let's talk about the special effects and lighting. I applaud Spielberg for his use of lighting, making the happy moments especially bright and the depressing or intense ones particularly dark. Also, I believe Day-Lewis didn't stand that tall; if he did, well then I congratulate a very good effect. Dead bodies and makeup are also given props.So, that's Lincoln. I'm surprised people actually found this boring, for it's a very over-the-top film. The struggles presented in the film, despite the sidetracking, mirror daily life events. Maybe you aren't abolishing slavery, but persuasion, trickery, grudges, inconveniences, and tragedy can be present. Combine these common struggles with a iconic figure in history, and you have a heartfelt and clever story that does sometime stray from the main ideas it presents.So, like I said, if some plot points didn't go anywhere, this would be a flawless film. Kudos, Steve.",9,4,12,25 November 2012
