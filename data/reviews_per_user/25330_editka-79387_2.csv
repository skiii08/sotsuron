It," A fairy tale
","I expected to see something scary, but there was not even a bit of tension. It's a movie about kids with some blood in it. The clown was just ridiculous. And the whole movie was just boring.Horror and thriller? You must be kidding! :(",5,1,3,4 November 2018
A Quiet Place," Don't understand the hype
","The idea with the silence was great and interesting. Acting was good, I (almost) didn't care about the plot holes, but the first half of the movie was not far from boring. After that we had some jump scares which at least kept us awake. Otherwise it was just another family drama with some disgusting monsters thrown in. We would both give it 6,5-7/10. (But I made it 6 because it's 7,9 now, and I don't think that is realistic. Or reasonable? I don't know which word to use. :D) 
It was not bad, we did not regret going to the movies, but I advise you to wait until you can see it on HBO or Netflix.",6,1,3,21 June 2018
