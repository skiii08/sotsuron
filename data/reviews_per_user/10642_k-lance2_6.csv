Casablanca," Casablanca
","'Casablanca' starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid was an outstanding film. This movie shows a little bit of drama, romance, and a slight comedy. In this movie what really stood out to me was the singing. It really caught my eye and it showed me the significance it had between Rick and the girl.In this film there is a cafe called Rick's Cafe. Everybody comes to his cafe no matter what your background was. Rick has a lot of power and not too many people mess with him. He claims that he doesn't help anybody but in reality he does. At some points in the movie it was hard to follow the plot but besides that I loved this movie and I would highly recommend.",Null,0,1,9 March 2015
Chinatown," Chinatown
","'Chinatown' starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway, and John Huston was a great film for 1974. This was a great film noir. This type of genre can either be loved or hated because it usually involves dark, horror, detective type of movies. In this case Chinatown deals with a detective type of movie. The cinematography, sound, and editing were all brilliant in this film.Jack Nicholson plays a great detective in this movie as he has to overcome many distractions during his investigation. This movie always kept you on edge because there was a a lot of action and suspense. This movie was phenomenal and I would highly recommend it to others.",Null,0,2,12 May 2015
Annie Hall," Annie Hall
","'Annie Hall' starring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts was a very good but unique film. It was unique in many ways. For example in one scene where there was dialogue at the bottom of the screen while they were on top of the balcony. Another example of how it was unique was Woody would stop in the middle of the scene and talk to the audience. I thought that was very special to the movie and it made it work really well. There were a couple flashbacks as well which always can add to a movie's greatness and that's what it did. This movie was unique in its own ways and I would highly recommend this and other Woody Allen movies to others.",Null,0,0,4 May 2015
The Graduate," The Graduate
","'The Graduate' starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, and Katherine Ross is an outstanding film. Dustin Hoffman plays a great role as Ben Braddock because he is very intelligent but at the same time very awkward. As he seems very intelligent he is very confused on what do with his future throughout the whole movie. The music was a great fit for this movie. Mrs.Robinson by Simon and Garfunkel couldn't have been a better fit for this movie. There is a lot of drama in this movie and that's what makes it special. This was a great love movie with a happy ending and I would highly recommend to others.",Null,0,0,4 May 2015
Singin' in the Rain," Singing in the Rain
","'Singing in the Rain' starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds was a great movie for it's display of music and color. This movie really set the tone for musicals from the 1950's and on. The acting and choreography in this movie was just spectacular.This movie was very fun and it kept me entertained throughout the whole thing. The colors were so bright and the music was so catchy, as a viewer it was hard to take your eyes off the screen. The voices on each actor/actress were very good as well. As a viewer I really enjoyed the ending of this movie because it was a happy one and who doesn't like a happy ending? This was one of my favorite movies and I would highly recommend this to others.",Null,0,1,9 April 2015
Rosemary's Baby," Rosemary's Baby
","'Rosemary's Baby' starring Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, and Ruth Gordon was a great film for many reasons. This was a good horror film for the 1960's considering what they had and what they were working with. They made it work though because this was a great horror film especially for this time period. The setting in this movie was great and the acting was excellent as well. Everything that happens in this movie is what you would expect to be in horror films. The objectives that Rosemary has to go through are extremely haunting. This horror film kept you on edge at all times and that made it really exciting yet really suspenseful. This movie was excellent and I would highly recommend it to others.",Null,0,1,12 May 2015
