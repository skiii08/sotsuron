Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Heart stopping, visually stunning film experience.
","Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the kind of movie that you don't see anymore. The kind that, when I was a kid, I would sit through twice in a row. Tarantino is, for me, so amazing that he may be the most innovative film director since Orson Welles. Everything about this movie is fascinating. I felt not one moment of boredom.I hate long winded reviews so I'll just say go see this movie today. The acting is first rate ( watch for Michael Parks in this one!) with Thurman, Carridine and Madsen all turning in stellar performances but, oh my gosh, that wonderful Daryl Hannah is absolutely *the* femme fatale for me. She makes evil look so sexy and so beautiful that it's scary. Tarantino is so wonderful in his casting choices and I'm grateful that he gave Hannah this role because it seemed that her best years were gone but this is the best I've ever seen her. I give this movie ***** out of *****. One of my all time favorites.",10,3,6,21 April 2004
