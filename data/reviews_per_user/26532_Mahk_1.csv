The Blair Witch Project," This movie is sooooo amazing!!!!
","I totally recommend this movie to anyone out there who is sick of the latest trend in teenie-bopper 'horror' movies. This is so amazing! It is one of those movies that you will be talking about for days after and making sure that you understood every detail. I warn you though, DON'T cover your eyes...you might miss so very important details into figuring it all out. GO SEE THIS!!!!!",10,1,2,2 August 1999
