The Blair Witch Project," A movie that could be scary as hell, if shown to the right people in the right place.
","I enjoyed the Blair Witch project, and thought it was very well acted especially.  However I think it could have been FAR scarier if shown to people who thought it was an actual account, and not fiction, in an atmosphere such as a small screening room, or basically anywhere that is more close in and personal than a large movie theater.",7,0,2,11 August 1999
Lost in Translation," The Most Realistic Movie This Year
","I thought this was one of the most well made, entertaining, and certainly most realistic movies I have seen.  The ending is, in a word, perfect.  I can't think of a more appropriate or realistic way it could have been done. Modern film has simply departed from the realm of reality, and 'Lost in Translation' has done a wonderful job of inspiring me to believe in cinema once again.",10,0,0,13 October 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Extraordinary Spiritual Thriller
","This movie attempts something unique in film.  It attemps to allegorize the essence of humanity in a style that will appeal to the modern audience. Clearly this film is being widely misunderstood (and in my opnion underestimated) at the moment, but it is still drawing massive crowds and encouraging people to ponder things (if they take the time to listen carefully to the script of the film) they might not be reminded of otherwise.  I urge everyone to view this film with an open mind and open heart, and take from it what you will.  I personally believe it has a wealth of things to offer anyone who will give it a chance.",10,1,2,9 November 2003
8 Mile," 8 Mile will have potent impact on America's youth.
","It is rare that an established filmmaker and production company create something that young people are able to grasp the complete meaning of. Intellectual jargon or unnecessary vagueness of plot often take precedence over lucidity and appeal.Eminem's '8 Mile' has managed to break this cycle, presenting in poignant audio/video style the nature of the life so many of our nation's youth live, and how despite it all there always remains the possibility to break through.The film's meaning is largely overt, not subtle, and makes itself available to a much wider variety of viewers than most films with any sort of dramatic moral.  Just look at the box office reports for '8 Mile's opening weekend.I won't attempt to speculate on the effect the film will have among our youth, but I personally believe it will be positive in nature.  It will be impossible for this film to become as transient as an action blockbuster or as esoteric as a cult classic.  It's depth and range of appeal are simply unparalleled in our time.",8,64,88,10 November 2002
