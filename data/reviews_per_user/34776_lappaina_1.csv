The Lobster," I've lost 2 hours of my life !!
","The rating and the trailer were actually dishonest. I found the movie boring, depressing and tastless. I get the idea behind it, but its execution could have been much better and in a creative way.
I regret the time I spent watching this movie until the end, hoping somthing interisting would happen or that it would get better in the end.
I don't understand how Rachel and Colin agreed on this absurdity.",1,2,4,23 January 2019
