The Hangover," Had it's moments, but overall unrealistic and uneven
","This movie is just one of many in it's sub-genre of comedy, this one just having been far over-hyped. The Hangover is not the sort of movie that appeals to it's audience with realism, instead deciding to use either very stereotypical characters or unrealistic characters. An example of this would be the school-teacher. He is a teacher who hates the kids he teaches and spends a weekend out drinking with his buddies in Vegas. It would have been more prudent to have him as someone who was unemployed, or just in a profession not working with kids to create a more realistic character.The movie does however create some laughs in the middle section of the film, where the characters were essentially on a wild-goose chase. These come from shock comedy, such as the naked guy in the boot of the car coming out and beating up all of them. Mike Tyson's cameo was also quite funny.The movie also had issues with it's pacing, with the beginning and end seeming to drag, particularly at the end at the wedding was far too long and I was very bored.All in all the movie works if you take it for what it is, a fairly average comedy with some great moments but poor characters and a very, very stereotypical plot.",6,3,6,11 August 2009
