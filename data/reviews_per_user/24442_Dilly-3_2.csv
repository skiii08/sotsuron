","Right.  I have to concur that this flick let me down.  When I went to see it, a couple people got up and left close to the end.  I wasn't sure if they were leaving because they were afraid of being traumatized for life, or if they found it rawtha boring and wanted to salvage as much of their lost two hours of life as they could.  In any case...I actually laughed during some of the scary parts, because I could imagine myself running around and screaming with a camera and getting much the same results. 'AAUAUUAGH!! OH MY GOD! JOSH WHERE ARE YOU!! JOOOOOOOOOSHHHHHHHHHHH!!!'Usually I am very susceptible to scary movies, so this movie must really be a dud if it didn't even scare ME.I do have to hand it the filmmakers though.  What a return on their paltry investment of time and money!  They even have some of MY money, so there ya go.",4,0,1,10 August 1999

","I couldn't get over all the people who came out of this film saying 'I have to go back and see it a bunch of times in order to get all the subtle nuances; it's a very deep film.' Ha!UHHHHH, it seems to be saying that consumer culture is bad...  sheesh, tell us something we DON'T know! This kind of slick big budget film couldn't have been made without the very things it deplores.  I love how so many people shell out money to be told that they shouldn't be shelling out so much money.  The producers are laughing all the way to the bank.Misogyny, too! Now THAT's original! It's also homoerotic, but oh, that would make it YUCKY, so let's not acknowledge it.Other things:  I admit that there was interesting cinematography and editing.  But down with annoying voiceovers! Ever so pretentious.  It's even worse than in the non-director's cut of Bladerunner. 'My blood felt like BATTERY ACID.' Ooooh, it's so gritty!In order to prevent total discord, however, I have to find some way of reading this film that allows me to coexist with my friends who liked it, so here it is:  A mostly trite flick which has to be viewed as a badly done satire.
