Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Entertainment At It's Best
","First Jack Sparrow and our favorite pirates dealt with a curse from gold that makes you a zombie under the moon(Black Pearl), next they dealt with creatures that looked like a sperm whale's puke(Dead Man's Chest), then our pirates dealt with... A bunch of random things (World's End). Now in Stranger Tides, it's a race for the fountain of youth. With a load of new characters, and not a sight of William Turner or Casey Jones.The one thing that everyone wants to see in this movie is another enjoyable watching of Jack Sparrow, who captures the fun of being a pirate for us all like a master. Johnny Depp delivers the performance everyone knows and love, with a number of humorous moments given from screen writer Ted Elliot, who wrote the first classic film (Curse Of The Black Pearl).There are two ways of viewing this movie, you can watch it and enjoy it at it's own terms or compare it with the 3 previous Pirate movies. On the movie's own terms, it's great entertainment with sword fights around every corner, and tactical situations solved in goofy ways. The movie is loaded with improbable moments, such as the idea of an English ruler letting a pirate loose in his palace during a discussion about the Spanish.In light of the franchise, the film wont compete with Curse Of The Black Pearl, but will sit roughly around the level of quality as Dead Man's Chest. At World's End not only was cheesy, it was incredibly weird and the story didn't really know what it wanted to do. In comparison, On Stranger Tides beats At World's End very much. Stranger Tides actually had a plot that stayed on track and wasn't extremely desperate and confusing.Dead's Man's Chest was heavy on special effects, especially with big objects. The directer was Throwing what he can that looks action pack. Stranger Tides doesn't fall into that tiresome routine. I was entertained while watching this movie, and any Pirates Of The Caribbean fan will be as well. A fan will be disappointed if he or she expects this movie to up the level of the first, or for that mater, even be as good as the first. I walked in the theater with the expectations that this was actually going to be worse then At World's End, and it wasn't. So I was pleased and enjoyed myself.",6,0,1,23 May 2011
Coraline," Gorgeous animation, but the plot was a little choppy
","despise the fact that I am a stop motion freak and am dieing to buy this movie on DVD, I can easily see why someone would dislike Coraline. The film is definitely worth watching and I would never say it's bad or OK. I would say it's a pretty good film, but the whole film just feels like it's a short story with one or two creative concepts with a bunch of uninteresting aspects added so the movie wouldn't be too short. I watched this movie with really high expectations, which is probably why I was slightly disappointed at the end. I was mostly disappointed that the best scenes in the whole movie were spoiled in the trailer. If you watch the film and than watch the trailer you can tell they had to spoil the best parts of the film in order for the trailer to get you interested in the movie. For those that have not seen the movie and have not seen the trailer, I warn you not to watch the trailer, it will make the movie much more interesting and unpredictable if you don't.The plot seems to have a pattern where basically two ideas in the movie are repeated constantly through half of the movie. I wish they added something to the plot that made you more interested in the constantly repeating ideas. I can see they tried to do that a little but it didn't do well enough.There is something about the pace that bothers me also. The movie is too fast pace in some scenes.Coraline is one of those films that has it's best moments in the middle of the movie. Unfortunately the exciting middle is TOO much more interesting than the beginning and end. So after the exciting middle was over I didn't really feel very interested in how the movie was ending, the last 20 minutes of the movie just seem like it was something they made up at the last minute so the movie wouldn't have an ending that comes too soon.The music and animation really keep this movie on it's stand. I love the music at the main titles, it's creepy but relaxing at the same time. The end credits is like a fast moving energetic version of the main titles. Coraline isn't a musical, but it does have two short songs, which works perfectly for the movie. The animation is the best thing about the whole movie, which is probably why the movie doesn't have that good of a story. The story was okay but just by a few points I would sadly have to put Coraline in the category of 'movies that focus too much more on animation than the story'. However, it's well worth watching just to see the amazing images and flawless stop motion. So all in all, worth seeing. Just keep low on the expectations and avoid seeing the trailer.",7,1,2,21 December 2009
Yes Man," Absolute corn ball
","Jim Carry stars in another comedy (what else) that is obviously inspired from Liar Liar, which is was a hilarious comedy released 11 years prior to Yes Man.Jim Carry plays a man named Carl who gets dragged into a convention, full of people who pressure him into becoming a Yes Man. This apparently means that Carl for the good of his life, should say yes to every opportunity in life.This premise leads to Carl saying yes to questions he usually would say no to. Such as giving a homeless man a ride, while also giving him change after the smelly man begged for it.You'd think with Jim Carry there would be comedic energy, unfortunately it's not so. This movie is slow in it's tracks, with Jim Carry acting as if he forgets he's in a comedy. The premise of the movie is tired enough, you'd think an idea like this would lead to funny pay off, but it absolutely doesn't. There's nothing funny about a guy saying yes to an invitation to learn Arabic, which is what happens. Along with other boring scenarios.Like most uninspired comedies, there's a clichéd and very corny love subplot with a woman named Allison. The movie has NO pay off what so ever. Instead, a miserable attempt to patch things up with Carl and Allison as they YOU GUESSED IT, have a misunderstanding. All in all, the movie has only about two laughs and the rest is just boring and dull. The story has every comedy cliché in the book.",Null,0,1,14 July 2011
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," OK movie
","Before I begin what I have to say about this movie, let me say that I will not compare this to the 1971 version, I will only compare it to the book that surprisingly a lot of people say this is more faithful to...The movie was good in the beginning with the Charlie and his family, all the stories about that grandpa Joe told were in the book and it followed the book very well. When the golden tickets were sent out and one at a time a kid finds one, I didn't like how the kids are, Veruca isn't very demanding for what she wants like in the book, Mike Teevee is NOT LIKE EINSTEIN in the book, Violet is not athletic and confident in the book. As soon as all the children get into the factory the movie started to get worse. Johny Depp's portray of Willy Wonka was not at all the Willy Wonka in the book. Yes I know Willy Wonka is suppose to be a crazy genius like in the book, but Depp's Willy Wonka wasn't like that, Depp's Wonka was bizarre, annoying, childish and pitiful. The looks of the candy room are beautiful and mouth watering, but I didn't like the kid's expressions for the place. They were all in the most 'amazing place on earth' and they looked bored except for Augustus Gloop. What really kicked this movie away from the book is the added subplot about Wonka's past, it was so unnecessary and took Charlie away from the plot for a while. The children didn't really make a whole lot of sense in many ways, especially in the ooompa loompa songs; Violet is a girl that is very athletic, yet the oompa loompas say she 'sits around chewing all day long', Mike Teevee is really smart! He's apparently the only one on the earth that knew how to find a Wonka bar with a golden ticket, and yet he's a video gamer and his brain is 'soft as cheese' and 'can not think'. The kids in the book weren't like the kids in this movie except Charlie, Augustus and possibly Veruca. The overall mood of the story is not like the world the book brings you in. The book wasn't really that dark, but is wasn't very happy either, sort of in between and yes the book had it's dark moments but the rest was just normal. This movie tried to capture a different world, the lighting was way too dark, the factory was made to look dark and scary and Willy Wonka was freaky looking.The thing I felt was the most faithful to the book was the Oompa Loompa songs, Danny Elfman did a good job taking the lyrics from the book (even though he left out a lot) and singing them they way they should sound.",5,1,4,11 December 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Awesome visuals couldn't save the dull story
","I walked into the theater with the expectations of the movie having great Elfman music and outstanding visuals. I was counting much on the story. After Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, I knew I was in for a screwed up script, but wow.... it was worse than I thought! The visuals were good but that's all that stood out in the movie, the screen play felt like it was written over night, and was cold. If you thought Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was heartless, this movie was even worse and disappointed me even on my low expectations. -I was disappointed in the score too, I listened to the soundtrack and none of it's awesome music was in the movie except for back ground music for scenes. I expected to see an opening credits with Elfman theme and another magical piece of music at the end, but not only were there no opening credits, the end credit song wasn't even Elfman, it was some other song which I was disappointed. I didn't know I had to wait for that song to be over to hear Alice's Theme so I missed it.-The beginning with Alice and the proposal is okay, I felt like they were trying to create a wonderland and real life connection but in the end of the film Alice learns that she's different from society and shouldn't be bossed around and forced to marry. That's all okay. -When Alice first comes to wonderland we hear of the Red Queen taking over wonderland and that Alice needs to defeat the Jabberwocky. So at that point I already knew that in the end Alice would defeat the jabberwocky, and they didn't even make an effort to at least play with the audience a little on that point. -When ever there wasn't an action scene it was Alice convincing herself that she's is not the right Alice and that it is all a dream.... that's week, do they really think we're going to be surprised that it's not a dream? -Alice was a boring character, and Mia's performance is almost razzie worthy. Throughout the entire movie she only has about too expressions and always speaks in the same monotone. The mad hatter was okay, the mouse was okay, the only characters that were really had interesting and likable personality was the Red Queen. In fact, the Red queen was so too likable, enough that I really felt sorry for her with the battle and how Stayne tried to kill her, I don't get how she's evil. I thought I was suppose to hate the villain for it being evil and look forward to it's defeat, but no not with her. On top of that, I could not stand Anne's over acting for the Whit Queen, I wanted her to die in the battle. -The whole plot of the story is just dull and boring, the entire premise is: Alice grows up and returns to wonderland and needs to defeat the jabberwocky because a magic piece of toilet paper says she does, she goes through Wonderland in a bunch of action scenes thinking it's all a dream. Through the actions scenes, we learn important plot points about the past, such as how the Red Queen had taken over wonderland and some back ground on the Red Queen, but it doesn't save the film or add up in a strong way. mostly because it's rushed. -There is nothing in the movie that is gripping at the least, or anything that makes me want to seat to wait for the end, I knew Alice would realize it's a dream, I knew she will defeat the jabberwocky, I knew the red queen will be defeated and I knew that red queen has taken over wonderland. There's nothing that gets my interest, by halfway through the movie I was finding myself yawning waiting for it to be over. I didn't care for the plot, why would anyone? The awesome special effects couldn't save the film, after a while I started to wish I saw it in 3D. There, I have proved you wrong, the movie gets negative reviews and hate because it's not a very good film. True a lot of people like to be trolls and slam Tim for the fun of it, but I'm not like that. I judge a film by it's quality, not by it's box office, director or cast. Now having that review posted, it's your turn. Give me a specific review on how this film is good, if you can't than you are the one with vague reviews on the mater.",5,6,13,11 May 2010
