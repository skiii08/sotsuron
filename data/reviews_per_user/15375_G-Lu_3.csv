The Rock," Every scene is a rollercoaster of excitment
","The Rock is a great film, with non-stop action from the hilly streets of San Fransisco to the twisting tunnels and cellhouses of Alcatraz. The story itself was no less superb; Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris), a renegade general, fed up with the lies and treatment that the government has been giving to its people and its soldiers, recruits some of his best men to help him rob a naval weapons depot. Having been ignored on several occasions by his government, he steals 15 rockets armed with a tremendously destructive material(VX gas) in order to get their attention. Hummel indeed gets the government's attention as they receive a ransom demand from his makeshift base on the rock: a large amount of money to compensate for the lives of the soldiers that he claims were abandoned by their government, or he deploys the rockets and incinerates the whole of the San Fransisco bay area. The government then calls on an unlikely superhero, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a frail FBI field agent who's speciality just happens to be chemical weaponry. John Mason (Sean Connery), supposedly the only man who has ever escaped from Alcatraz, is also recruited to help navigate through the tunnels he knows so well. The characters are all very well developed, with fascinating sub-plots to each of them. Whether its Stanley and his pregnant wife waiting for his questionable return from the dangerous mission, or Mason and his long lost daughter, or Hummel and his valiant fight for justice, the characters alone make this movie worth watching over and over again.P.S.- In addition to this gem of a movie, the soundtrack is also excellent.",Null,1,1,8 November 1998
Happy Gilmore," A pleasant surprise after Billy Madison
","After I had seen Billy Madison, I thought it to be all over between me and Adam Sandler's comedy. But then, shown to me was Happy Gilmore, a movie with a decent plot and much, much more intelligent humor. The other characters are not tailored to make Sandler look less like an idiot than he should look like (Billy Madison), but rather they are great elements of the story, and Sandler himself is a more sensitive, intelligent person in this one, and even after toning himself down he is able to execute a hilarious performance.(to all billy madison fans I mean no offense)",Null,0,1,8 November 1998
Face_Off," Intriguingly elaborate stand-off scenes
","Great movie. The traditional 'Good vs. Evil' story, with the twisted excitment of seeing the head honcho of each side adapt to his rivals' environment.The only questionable aspect of this movie would probably be why Travolta decided to accept the ridiculous, awkward, as well as mind-boggingly dangerous mission and risk what he had spent 10 painful years trying to do.At any rate, John Travolta and Nicholas Cage executed a scintillating performance as the good, as well as bad guy.",Null,0,0,8 November 1998
