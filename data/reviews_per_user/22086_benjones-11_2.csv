Black Swan," Too good to watch
","This is possibly the best movie I have seen for a long, long time. It was next to flawless. I hated it. The direction is incredible, with camera angles, scene usage and lighting being used to their utmost. Portman's acting is the most Oscar worthy I think I have ever seen. I will never look at her the same again. So, why did I hate it? Because it was too good at what it intended to do - to show you the mind of a deeply psychologically disturbed person. The combination of acting and direction made me feel as if I was undergoing all of her fears, rather than just watching them on the screen. At the beginning you want to protect Portman, and feel terrible at the isolated world of bitchiness and exploitation that she is in - a world too intense and demanding for someone as delicate as her. This is perhaps the brilliance of casting Portman for this role. She is naturally a very delicate person, whose beauty owes to the innocence of her looks. This is an innocence which, as a man raised to be a gentleman, I feel obliged to protect. But in pretty much every single scene in the entire movie, her innocence is being tested, exploited, broken down and abused. By the end you are terrified of her and what she has become. There is not one single moment in the movie that did not have me wincing and tensing, and once the movie was finished it took a long time for me to relax. Had the acting and directing been less than brilliant I think I could have shrugged it off a bit more easily. If you are in any way sensitive towards the subject of female suffering in film, then under no circumstances watch this movie. If you are harder and less sensitive towards other, then under no circumstances miss it.",10,9,19,4 January 2011
Requiem for a Dream," A must!!!!!!
","I have been sitting here at my computer for nearly fifteen minutes, staring at a screen, wondering how to even begin to describe the effect this film had on me.This is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. No, that is a lie - it IS the most powerful film I have ever seen! Of course, films are subjective, and not everyone can be pleased by the same film. But make no mistake, this film will 'please' no-one. Having seen it, I feel it has affected me almost like the drugs that it displays. I am shocked, spaced out, paranoid and I feel the need to share it with everyone.In a modern day society where singers trill joyfully about drugs and children deal them out in school like sweets, I feel like I need to show this film to everyone who has even listened to such a song, never mind tried such a drug.The film shows the rapid decline over one year of four linked individuals, each driven to differing styles, but equal depths of despair and pity by their chosen drugs. While the story is strong and the acting stronger (especially Ellen Burstyn), the directing is what turns it into such a tour de force. The film begins with simple shots of drug taking, in throwaway style as if the characters were simply doing something as matter of fact as eating a biscuit, but as the effects begin to take their toll, both physically and psychologically, the camera becomes your enemy and the soundtrack feels like a torture as you begin to feel as if you are personally enduring every torture yourself. And the soundtrack is incredible - with the string ensemble summing up the movie perfectly - powerful, unforgettable, driving, intense and a thing of haunting beauty.",10,1,2,27 February 2011
