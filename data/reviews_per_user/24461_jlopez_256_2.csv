Resident Evil: Afterlife," This is not Resident Evil 4 ! - It's 'Ultraviolet 2'
","I'm totally disappointed, I expect far more from the Resident Evil franchise. This film is dumb, nonsense, even boring; the open and last sequence are totally out of context. Even Milla looks bad, is like see that Ultraviolet crap again !!. The 3D is fine but not enough to save the film.The film rating over 5.0 is absolutely false, voted for brainless teenagers !!. I'm never going to see a sequel (or video-game based) movie again, before the votes on IMDb are over 10000. The first votes come from the unconditional fans who overrated the film.If you like the previous films, don't waste your money in this 'thing' -A zombie movie without zombies !!-",3,7,14,15 September 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A painful disappointment
","In advance, sorry for my English.I'm just return from see the movie and I think that compare with the first one this is a failure. Excessive long (even boring at times), plenty of bad jokes, many 'funny' characters without sense. A weak plot. It's just a waste of time. The kind of movie that you don't remember at the exit of the theater.There is not excuses to make a movie around special effects, brute force and confusing action, weak dialogs, a beautiful girl expose like a poster. Add military stuff, ancient enigmas, a robot like 'species' creatures and many other clich√©s like horny school parties and so on ...",5,2,7,23 June 2009
