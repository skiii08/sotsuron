Ford v Ferrari," Bound to be a classic of the genre
","Not being a rev-head I did not know what to expect, but Le Mans '66 / Ford v Ferrari was a wonderful surprise.
The story behind Caroll Shelby the man and his relationship with Ford and the racing team is great drama.
This is a film full of great acting, well directed, flawless cinematography that varies from beautiful to exciting, with a perfect sound track and absolutely brilliant editing.
There is a lot of depth and emotional range in the interactions of all the characters.",Null,2,4,21 January 2020
Marriage Story," Not bad, certainly not excellent
","For those that have not gone through a divorce it is a challenge to connect or empathise with the characters. Personally I did not care for any of them.
The acting is good, and I get that those who once were in love and are now divorcing will say some horrible things, and lawyers will go for the jugular to leverage a result, but I found some scenes seemed forced such as the heated argument in Charlie's apartment. For example accusations resembling fathers and mothers came out of nowhere. There was nothing that set this up.
There's nothing particularly innovative about this film. The cinematography and editing is perfunctory, nothing special about the soundtrack, wardrobe set design etc but there are many nods to the stage for those looking for something a bit deeper.
MARRIAGE STORY was nominated for Best Film category and therefore I expected a lot more than was delivered.",Null,0,3,20 January 2020
