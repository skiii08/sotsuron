Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Just plain dumb
","What a boring/silly movie it was, seriously, I should have left in the very beginning. My overall impression was that the producers were so in rush to release it by June (as the first summer blockbuster) to cash in on it that they didn't really have time to think on a storyline or character development. For me it's quite funny to observe how everyone tries to be politically correct and have the cultural minorities represented in every movie – in and out of context. After seeing Afro-American pirates and mermaids I knew there were some Asians missing, and some minutes later – there you go – two Asian pirate-characters popped up. The movie itself felt like a boring bus ride – no novelty, every thing was done and seen before hundreds of times. Depp looked like a loner abandoned by Bloom and Knightly who probably got fed up by this never ending pirate story. He is really a captain of a sinking ship. In a nutshell, it was just plain dump, stupid if you want. I understand it's a fiction, but the escapes and the fights were so unrealistic and unbelievable that it made me even more disappointed and left feeling deceived. Only 10 year old could buy that. Seriously – a man is capable of bending a palm tree for 30 degrees with a rope while standing on a top of another palm tree and then using it as a catapult to fly like a rocket-man?If you have kids – they might enjoy it, if you're looking for a few laughs – go watch 'Bridesmaids' instead. P.S. what's sad is that for sure there will be a new instalment with lonely Depp in it...and it will suck just like this one.",4,1,2,20 May 2011
