The Expendables 2," Really?
","Really? OK.OK. - First: Simon West should never ever (NEVER EVER) direct a movie again (not even Murder she wrote) The Movie is not completely bad, but it tries so hard to be. Its a solid action-film most of the time. Stallones facial hair works against that and so does the poor cgi-effects - but still solid. Schwarzenegger, Willis and Norris (especially) make it really hard to watch without being really ashamed of my generation. How is it possible, that Van Damme is the best actor in this. Not even Lundgren is as bad as the great heroes of action cinema. the story is bad but that doesn't matter - it could have been a decent action-film but Arnie, Bruce and Chuck work so hard against it - its a shame. I'm from Austria and my English isn't really good but i was so full of anger that I had to write this!... and, please, keep Simon West away from anything that got to do with a camera, actors or anything near to film ... PLEASE!But... by the way ... this film was so much better than the first! But that's really easy!",Null,0,1,6 October 2012
