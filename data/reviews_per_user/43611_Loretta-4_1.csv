The Blair Witch Project," What Idiot Would Run Around a Supposedly Haunted Forest Without a Cell Phone???
","It might be a cleverly crafted, extremely well-edited movie, but I found it dreadfully dull, unsuspenseful, and downright NOT scary, not to mention boring.  I never was drawn into the plot and never had any sympathy for the characters.  I was never made to care who they were as persons.  It was like sitting through someone's home movies of a backyard sleepover.  I'm sorry but unscripted, improvisational dialog does not work with this story.  They needed some effects, ANY effects, even extremely simple ones to at least stir our imaginations.  If they had had more thrown at them to react to and play against, it would have been gripping.  As it is, it was lukewarm and even more unworthy of the hype than The Phantom Menace.",1,1,3,2 August 1999
