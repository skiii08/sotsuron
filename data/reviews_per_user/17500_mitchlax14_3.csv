Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," worth watching even if you are a Jewish, retarded, gay, kazakhstany woman who hates America.
","if you are not Jewish, kazakhstany and have a pulse you should love this movie. Borat does every thing people wish they could to a does it with an immunity to punishment because the people he is interviewing (whom you can call victims) believe he is a foreigner and does not know any better. his political incorrectness and overall poor taste are a laugh riot. this movie is so chockful of funny moments that when leaving the theater you don't want to repeat them for fear of leaving something out. i have never laughed harder at a movie in my life, and i saw Plan 9 from outer space (inside joke for anyone who has seen that piece of crap). worth watching even if you are a Jewish, retarded, gay, kazakhstany woman who hates America. 10 out of 10",10,2,16,14 November 2006
Yes Man," A very good flick!
","I saw this movie as a early showing and having gotten the tickets for free I said 'what the heck, I'll see anything for free'. So right off the bat I went in with low expectations. The previews made it look like the same old Jim Carrey Schtick. However, I was pleasantly surprised. There was no ridiculous plot line (Liar Liar) or over the top characters (Ace Ventura) but a simple yet humorous story-line that is played to perfection by Carrey. There were plenty of good chuckles to be had and some down right laughs (and yes for those into it, a gross out scene that will make even this amazingly desensitized movie going generation cringe).Overall, Yes Man is definitely worth the 10 bucks or so that movies are now ridiculously priced out now a days. But most definitely worth the trip if its free :-p. *7/10*",7,95,142,17 December 2008
Armageddon," If you liked this, you're what's wrong with America
","this movie put a tear in my eye, mainly because i had to stab myself in the leg to take my mind off of it. all my friends like this movie and i can only look at them with astonishment. i watch movies to be entertained not have my life sucked out of me. the only thing that could have saved this...Thing is if the earth was destroyed that way i could have at least enjoyed Liv Tyler's emotionless death. this is the old testimate that no matter how much money you put into a movie and how many big stars you get you can't fix a bad script. you can spray paint a turd what every color you want it will still have a nice poopy core.",1,3,8,20 November 2006
