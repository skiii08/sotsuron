Iron Man 3," Just Amazing...
","You can judge from my rating (9 out of 10!!) how much I loved this movie. Watched it yesterday and and found it simply awesome. I have seen earlier sequels of Iron Man too and I think this was pretty amazing it not the best and most importantly i found it an advancement over others. The movie has a WOW factor especially in some scenes including the one in which he saves people falling from the sky. I also liked the idea of controlling his machines (probably the right word for those suits) that too not just one but so many by his brain. One of the movies where you can see it is not just actors but overall crew, technical team, designers and directors are making the movie great. Cast wise everyone played a pretty good role but there were two who stood out - one of course Robert and another Ben. Overall Superb Job and hope we get to see some more action, better movie in Iron Man 4!!",9,18,29,9 October 2013
This Is the End," It was alright...
","I was eager to watch this movie primarily because of its talented cast and promise of being funny. And yes it was but not to the extent I expected it to be. I could only find few scenes where I could really laugh. Not to mention, I really like watching Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill but somehow this movie's plot was not for them.If you're expecting it to be very funny then lower your expecting and you'll probably enjoy it more. Some of the scenes were disturbing but that's okay since it is supposed to be a comedy. Some of the actors were really funny sometimes but some were like they've been forced to play their roles. Overall, i think the movie is one time watch with reasonable end. Go for it and hope you like.",5,1,4,5 October 2013
Man of Steel," Usual superhero movie but a great one...
","A good superhero movie with pretty much usual story of having a man (from earth or outside world) trying to save our beloved planet earth from havoc from negative parties. I was not expecting it to be that good but it turned out one of the nice movies at par with any good recent Marvel movie for example Iron Man 3. Special effects and overall acting of everyone in the movie are pretty nice.Henry, Michael and Russell played pretty decent roles and did excellent acting. I never saw Michael in such a lead role and he did very well. Russell, being one of my favorite actors, as usual, played a nice role. Although he spent less time on screen, he did fine. Henry - the Superman - looked pretty much suitable for his role.So overall the movie is pretty good and worth watching but it just made me think (as such movies always do) that how weak are we as humans. We all live on this planet called earth and really have no power to save it. We can claim to have all the power in the world - but whenever aliens come we find ourselves pretty ineffective and in end someone like Superman saves this earth from the damage. I always wonder what if there are such superpowers out there who are ready to claim this world but there is no such superhero to save this planet then what? But on the positive side - humanity has always survived and earth lives forever. Maybe it is just the way we think - we might be fine having challenges throughout the journey but in end everything should fall in place. Having said all that - again it is a nice movie worth watching. So relax and have a good time!",8,3,5,11 January 2014
Prisoners," Intense Suspense and Thriller Where Every Moment Counts...
","What a movie? I really didn't expect it to be that good. I was not aware of great reviews of this movie before I picked it to watch this weekend. So my expectations were not that high to start with but before watching it I looked at IMDb and saw great ratings this movie has received. So my expectations rose and I was sort of carrying a real time rating meter in hand - trying to push myself to rate it while I was watching it and really I could not find any moment where I would have given it 7 out of 10...hence overall 8!Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal have both played a great role especially Jackman. I can say this is his one of the best roles. His acting is commendable - as a helpless and tired dad but the one who is ready to do anything possible (or even impossible) to find his daughter and he did all he could while facing push back from all people around him. He broke the rules for good and kept trying. Overall, awesome acting by all. Kudos to the director Denis Villeneuve and his entire team. Very emotional and suspenseful movie which will keep your heart pounding all the time. You fight with hope and reality and in the end wish for everything to end well. To sum it all - A great movie worth watching...do watch and hope you enjoy!",8,1,2,20 January 2014
The Great Gatsby," More Visual Less Impactful
","Although I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, I wouldn't call it a great one. It was a nice movie set up in old times with modern actors doing a good job pulling everything together. Leonardo did a good job but I was not impressed by his acting at all. He is one of my favorite actors and maybe that's why i was expecting more from him. Having said that, I liked Tobey's acting and role more than anyone else's in the movie. He was, sort of, in the background in the entire movie - moving the story forward. Connecting the dotes and being there to help and be right was what he did well.Visually the movie was spectacular. Cinematography was awesome and sets were worth watching. But somehow, intensity and depth was missing. It is like you're watching it and enjoying it but you're not in it. On the other hand - I liked the story, of course it is one of the great literature jewels, in general but not it's end. It was tragic love story which didn't end well.You might like it or you might hate it...but overall worth a one time watch.",7,0,2,20 January 2014
