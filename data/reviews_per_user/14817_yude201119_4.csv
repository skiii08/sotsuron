First Man," Boring!!!
","Long winded and boring!
I really can't see this high rating of the critics of 84/100! Where do they get it?
The movie lost me within the first 45 minutes. At least I tried!!! ...",4,2,4,26 January 2019
Oblivion," OBLIVION... send it to oblivion.
","I must say I have been privileged to watch (partly) one of the worst movies ever. Unbelievable!! I simply walked out after about half an hour. This was utterly boring and stupid. I do not like post apocalyptic movies in general. However, I thought ... Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman ( I never saw him)... This must be good. Was I wrong!!! I would never recommend this to anyone unless they are big fans of senseless crap. Very disappointing. Tom Cruise is a great actor and I do expect a lot more that this. I must say he has his moments. He has done many good movies as well as bad. This is one of them.OBLIVION... send it to oblivion.Very appropriate title.",1,11,26,23 April 2013
Drive," Review for Drive (and get away as fast as you can)
","Tried to figure out what this was all about throughout the movie (at least when I was awake. Was this a mobster sob story?? trying an artistic edge to it!! Very bad. What a waste of time (at least not money as this was a download.) I considered Gosling a good actor but I guess I have changed my mind. What an expressionless character throughout the ... plot?? if you can call it that (I have my doubts). As for the length of the movie, I assume they did not have any more crap to write into it so they drew it out as much as they could. I think they could have conveyed the same s**t in about half an hour. Shameless!! Will they push for an Oscar nomination for this abomination?? I wonder! That would be really something. Was there a deeper meaning to all this? I am stunned! I love cinema and always appreciate good movies. So, please, no more of this. Senseless killing, a story that leads to nothing, no beginning or end to it. However, I did watch the whole thing thinking that maybe I could make head or tails of it but to no avail. People should be warned about this before they decide to go see it and waste their own time and probably money. I do not usually criticize movies as a lot of effort is put into making them but this was a blotched job. This review is probably too harsh but so was this movie.",1,5,12,28 September 2011
