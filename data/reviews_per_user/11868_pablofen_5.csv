The Blair Witch Project," Biggest piece of crap ever!!!!!!!!
","Oh my god!!!!!!! I saw this movie a few years ago but I need all this time to recover myself of watching this awful piece of waste of celluloid. I remember all this comments about that was the masterpiece of the horror movies and the best horror movie ever, but oh no!!! when I went to the cinema..... yeah I was really terrified of seeing how one movie can be so bad, the acting sucks, the camera and its movements gave me headache, the plot..... no comments boring, idiot, absurd, I was even tempted of start laughing in the famous scene with the girl and the lamp saying I'm Scared!!!! I had to make a great effort for not leave the theater before the ending, so please don't waste your time and your money trying to see this piece of crap.",1,1,3,13 November 2005
Cloverfield," Another 'Blair witch project' subproduct
","I am sure lot of people like me were so excited to see one film that come from the same company as the excellent series 'Lost' and I am sure most of them left the cinema disappointed as me.Well there is nothing new or original in this film, also the plot is inexistent, but anyway you can have a decent entertainment product without all of that , but that was also here not possible cos the way how the film is shooted (like one amateur camera did, like the 'Blair witch project' thing) made all the fun disappear.I hope in future the creators of Lost surprised us with a great film again, not like in Cloverfield.",4,8,33,3 February 2008
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The Dialogues suck
","how can this be the second best action movie of the history???? itÂ´s too slow and the dialogues are terrible...the story could be taken farther.For example why was the sword so important?, what would the people learn in the training that would allow them to fly?",5,0,0,1 May 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Boring boring boring......
","I really liked the first part of Matrix and i went to the cinema sure that the second part will be better than the first, and a great desillusion, the first part of the film is very boring, the argument is very poor, then come the scenes of action, i expected to see news special effects, but is the same, nothing new, and repetitive, so i left the cinema with a great decepcion and thinking this film was made only for make money and not for mantein the spirit of the first part-",6,0,0,10 June 2003
300," This is Spartaaaa!!!
","I am so amazed of what i just saw, this film is an excellent adaptation of the Frank Miller comic, the ambiance, the photography and the acting are great, the special effects are amazing, like the sound and music. The only 'but' of this film is that if it is supposed to recreate an historical event like the battle of the Thermopiles, OK is not exactly what really happened. But i don't think the author wanted to have historical fidelity, just offer his personal vision of the Spartans. But anyway,this is a great movie i can guarantee that you will have a great time with. I will give it a 10 because it was the first time in months i really had fun in the cinema.",10,0,5,3 April 2007
