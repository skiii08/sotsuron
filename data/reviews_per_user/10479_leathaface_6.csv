Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great, fast-paced action.
","This movie is fun to watch.  It really never gets dull as Jones is on the move the whole movie.  The plot is very simple, Indiana Jones must obtain the rare, priceless Holy Grail from a group of Nazis, thugs, and government officials.  He chases them the whole movie, and there is plenty of suspense and edge-of-your seat action abound.  Plus, if that part of the movie didn't blow you away, the last 15 minutes or so will.  It seems that the Ark is SO powerful it has the ability to melt people's faces off.  This results in one of the most shocking endings in a movie for this time period, probably ever. It sure beats the crap out of the ending from Fire in the Sky or The Beast Within.",Null,0,0,2 April 2004
The Big Lebowski," Was I the only one that didn't like this? (spoilers)
","This movie was a confusing, mixed-up mess that took a while to piece back together in the end, as well as leaving a few plot holes behind.  Like what happened to the guys in the beginning that threw Jeff into the toilet, demanding his money?  And instead of a clever kidnapping/ransom story, we find out in the end that the girl Bunny never really WAS kidnapped.  What?!? Jeff Bridge's character, also named Jeff, or the 'Dude' (oh, god) goes through the movie trying to save another man named Lebowski's slutty, porno-star wife (Tara Reid)and gets his ass kicked all the way.  This movie sucks.  Watch Fargo instead.",Null,0,1,16 July 2003
Hostel," Don't watch on a full stomach.
","It seemed like this movie was over-hyped until it actually hit the theatres, then it became a sort of a flop. I liked it personally, I thought maybe it could have been done better, but it was alright. People on the board are complaining about how it was sick and disgusting. I look at it more like a rebirth of the trashy era of cinema that started in Europe (mainly Italy). This was a trash film. It exploited and objectified women, showed lots of graphic violence and was filled with foul language. Maybe you're not familiar with the work of Lucio Fulci, Joe D'Amato, or even Dario Argento but this sort of thing thrived in the 80's. Anyway, about the movie. The only thing that bothered me was the abundance of inane dialogue among the Americans, proving that most of us between the ages of 18-30 can't say a single sentence without using the 'F' word. But that's what you get when you rent a 'teen' movie nowadays (Look at 'The Girl Next Door' for example.). Two American college students take a trip across Europe looking to party and find some girls. They do just that and the audience is treated to some of the most explicit sex scenes I've seen in a while. One is kidnapped and taken to a slaughterhouse to be tortured and killed. Why? You'll have to watch and find out. The second half of the movie is for die-hard gore lovers only. It's got some truly revolting make-up effects, including an eyeball scene that would have made Lucio Fulci nauseous. See this movie if you're tired of those other slick, glossed over, minimal violence, new horror movies.",8,3,4,27 May 2006
The Fly," This movie really isn't as bad as the posters here make it out to be!
","This is probably one of my favorite Cronenburg films.  I liked it better than Videodrome, The Brood, and Naked Lunch.  It's the story of a scientist (Goldblum) who creates the first teleportation device.  A journalist (Davis) talks with him about it and decides to go to his apartment for a closer look.  He tries to teleport a few things (apple and a cactus) and ends up screwing them up.  He tweaks the machine a little bit and puts a monkey inside, only to find out that it came out inside-out on the other side.  He tweaks it yet again and tries to teleport himself.  What he doesn't know is that a fly flew into the pod with him and their genes fused.  Geena Davis eventually has an affair with him, and finds coarse black hairs growing on his back.   This is where the movie really picks up.  People say this movie is gory, but I wouldn't really say that, it's more gross or nasty than anything.  We get to see Jeff slowly transform into a hideous mutant, losing his hair, parts of his teeth, his fingernails, and even an ear.  He also gains superhuman strength, the ability to walk on walls, and he is also able to spit corrosive acid from his mouth for digestion purposes.  Weeks later we find out that Davis's character is pregnant.  She has a weird dream where she gives birth to a giant maggot.  Towards the end of the movie, she makes one final appearance at Jeff's apartment.  He is hardly human anymore, looking more like a hunchbacked neanderthal with a bad complexion than anything.  Her ex-boyfriend comes to the rescue, only to have acid spit on his hand and ankle.  Finally, in the goriest scene in the movie, Jeff Goldblum's head splits open as his eyes melt from their sockets and he sheds his diseased-looking skin.  At this point, he looks kind of like the Toxic Avenger with a giant mosquito head.  He grabs Davis, and drags her to the teleportation chamber in hopes of fusing her with him.  Instead, she breaks loose and her ex blows the lock off the door after it closes so Jeff can't get out.  The computer makes a mistake and fuses Jeff with the other teleportation chamber (what?!?) and he comes out the other end missing his legs but instead sports a bundle of wires and cables in their place.  Geena Davis blasts him in the head and the movie ends.  This movie was great because Craonenburg is simply a great director.  If he makes a film with violence in it, he tries to make it a more creative, surrealistic effect rather than the always conventional shotgun blast or stabbing.  If you like his artistic and surrealistic flair, be sure to check out Videodrome and Naked Lunch.  This movie had a sequel, but it wasn't nearly as good as the first.  It's a lot different (in a not-so-good way) and the final creature looks more like the aliens from Species than it does insectile.",Null,0,1,3 March 2004
Total Recall," Paul Veerhoeven's Total Recall
","Total Recall is an action packed, bloody, surrealistic, and sometimes confusing sci-fi movie. Arnold stars as Quaid, a construction worker who is bored with his blue-collar life and decides to take part in a 'virtual vacation', where he is able to pick the location he travels to. He picks Mars, in a different age where humans have begun to colonize and build a mining operation. Mars is ruled by an evil dictator (Ironside) and filled with freaks and mutants. Arnold's wife in his 'trip' is Sharon Stone, who is offed early on and replaced by the slightly less attractive Rachel Ticotin. Of course he takes over his vacation and becomes a somewhat of a vigilante. His job is to destroy Ironside's evil empire and restore peace (and oxygen). Oxygen you say? Yes, Mars has no oxygen. Ergo, Ironside has placed everything in a protective shield a la Bio Dome which came out five years later. He controls the amount in the air inside the city. The movie is great. It, like most other Veerhoeven films (Robocop, Hollow Man, Flesh and Blood) never skimps on the blood and gore but at the same time emphasizes human pain and suffering so as not to make his movies mindless gorefests. There are always a lot of emotional moments on his films. The special effects range from hellish looking mutants with fetuses on their abdomens and women with three breasts, to cartoonish over-the-top violence. A perfect example is the ending scene where Arnold, Rachel, and a bad guy fall out of the volcanic fortress where Ironside resided. What happens to a person who is on a planet with no air pressure? Why, their heads inflate like balloons and their bodies explode! What else? I think the fact that the whole experience was simply a 'dream' that Schwartzenegger took over allowed a little leeway to be pretty illogical and off the wall. Many people don't like this movie dismissing it as preposterous and unrealistic. Well in a way it's just as much a FANTASY as a sci-fi. If you watch it with an open mind and don't read too much into it like your lame critically acclaimed psycho-thrillers and highbrow comedy movies, you'll have an interesting trip.",Null,0,1,30 June 2007
Donnie Darko," mindless teen crap. (spoilers)
","Everyody I knew that saw this said things to me like, 'oh my god, it's so good and the ending is open to so many conclusions, it's so powerful', blah, blah, whatever.  What I saw was a hastily put-together, heavily stereotypical teen movie. When it first came out I thought maybe that Hollywood was trying to cash in on the success of Donnie Brasco by putting out a sequel.  Even that would have been more interesting than what I saw.  Donnie Darko is a disturbed teen living at home with his yuppie scum parents.  He gets drunk in his spare time, sees a therapist (of course), gets made fun of by bullies that could have come straight out of American Pie, and meets a really hot girl who would never have even given him the time of day if the movie were real. Halfway through the movie, he begins to have hallucinations of a man who looks like Lou Diamond Phillips in a f*cked up looking rabbit mask.  This character, named Frank, tells him about how the end of the world is coming. As a result of that, Donnie basically goes out and does what he wants.  He meets this crazy old lady that was supposed to have written a book about time travel.  If there was anything that explains the whole freaking premise of the movie, it was this scene, and we NEVER see the old woman again.  He begins to read the book, and during that time he starts going out with the hot girl, Gretchen.  They eventually go to some party and (it is assumed) has sex with her.  Towards the end of the movie, Gretchen dies.  At the VERY end, Gretchen is still alive and Donnie Darko dissapears off the face of the earth, leaving us to assume he traveled back in time, killed himself, or moved to Sri Lanka.  Sound like it makes no sense?  It doesn't.This seemed like some kind of nonsense art movie, that the director made because he had extra time, or maybe as a tax writeoff.  The reason why I disliked it was because it was just another teen movie, complete with it's cast of 'pretty' characters and unreal situations. I'm sorry, but you can't make a serious teen movie.  It just isn't possible.  And you can't make a teen movie then throw in some intelligent sounding time-travel/armageddon/hallucinatory concept to make it, uh, NOT a teen movie.  Also, during the movie, every two scenes or so, we get to see just how many days are left until armageddon. It almost seems like they put those in there to keep the person watching the movie.  If you want to see an intelligent, avant-garde art movie, watch Naked Lunch.  If you want to see a rushed, stereotypical teen movie with some sci-fi elements thrown in, watch this turkey.  Maybe two out of five stars.  Maybe.",Null,1,2,25 March 2004
