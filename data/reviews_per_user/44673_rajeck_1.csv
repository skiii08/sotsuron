Requiem for a Dream," Overrated and patchy
","I was surprised to see the all the positive reviews for this film as imho it was an overly dramatic portrayal of unrealistic characters in a constructed world.  I felt that the writer basically took four characters, imagined a terrible ending for each of them, and then used the middle of the movie to get them there.  I didn't feel as if it was a realistic or meaningful portrayal of any of the characters' crises in finding fulfillment in life. What can you take away from this film - 'drug addiction is bad??' - umm I think I already knew that...Yes, the cinematography was great and it had its funny moments - but it was a confusing and patchy story which left me exhausted by its 'shocking' scenes...",Null,0,0,19 February 2001
