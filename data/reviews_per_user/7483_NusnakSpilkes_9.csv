Iron Man 3," After all that noise and explosions, what was it about again?
","Robert Downey Jnr's acting in this movie summarizes the whole movie very well: half hearted, bored and tired, can't wait to get it over with. That's how he portrayed the character, I am sure that is what he was thinking for real, and that is exactly how I felt watching this.Plenty of ridiculous CGI effects, that all look the same as every other movie with CGI effects these days, to the point that they are getting tiresome now. And the story.... well, what was this movie about again? Having just watched it, I can't tell you what the story was about. Did they hire some deluded psychoanalyst to write the script? It was a bad. What was the point? Except for the special effects, everything else was lame, forced, and none of the actors had their hearts in it. It was almost as if they, the actors, realized once they started filming this, that this was going to be a PAINFUL EXPERIENCE and this comes through in all their acting. With every word coming out of Iron Man's mouth I could imagine Robert Downey Jnr thinking 'how much more of this do I have to put up with?' Iron Man 1 and 2 were good. There was a story to be told. Iron Man 3 is just a mess of over the top, unbelievable special effects with no purpose. A colossal waste of time, believe me!",3,2,5,16 June 2013
Star Trek," Absolutely disgraceful mockery of Star Trek
","Star Trek was about character development and always a voyage of discovery with a positive message, boldly going, etc. All I can say is that Gene Roddenberry would be turning in his grave at this dumbed-down, Homer Simpson mentality mockery of his Star Trek.JJ Abrahms should be tried with treason for this mess. Without giving any spoilers I can summarize the movie this way: Lots of distracting lens flares (WHY does JJ Abrahms think that is cool - it's BAD camera work), a completely different turn of events, and the whole Star Trek 'universe' sabotaged in one fell swoop, leaving nothing recognizable of the original franchise. Perhaps this was purposeful, but the end result is a movie, that is so full of plot and scientific holes that only children under the age of 10, or dumb Americans loaded up on meds could not see through the gross flaws. You have to have a very low IQ to like this movie. Very bad job Mr Abrahms. You should not be allowed anywhere near this franchise every again.The one thing I will say positive is Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr McCoy. Brilliant homage to Deforest Kelly, the movie's ONE and ONLY positive. Chris Pine as Kirk was just PAINFUL. He made Kirk unlikeable and moronic. The rest of the cast were horrible too, even Simon Pegg as Scotty (who I like as an actor) was hideous in the role. And Spock? Let's just not go there. Terrible. This is just not Star Trek - period. Actually, it's not really ANYTHING unless you are a moron.",1,3,4,20 May 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Thanks for utterly destroying Star Trek, JJ Abrams.
","This movie is truly awful. Utter junk. JJ Abrams has a lot to answer for. JJ has no idea what Star Trek is. This is like some porno-parody of Star Trek The Wrath Of Khan with the porn edited out.Anybody whom said they 'liked' this movie is clearly and simply NOT a Star Trek fan. Period. Only a person with the IQ level of Homer Simpson would 'like' this trash.It's like JJ Abrams INTENTIONALLY MOCKED everything that made Star Trek what it is and PURPOSEFULLY SET OUT TO INSULT all the long time fans that have supported this franchise over the last 40 years. (And for non fans who are simply intelligent people, you too would see this as utter, brain dead nonsense.)This is NOT Star Trek. This is a slap in the face by a thoroughly UNCREATIVE MORON who should be frog-marched out of Hollywood..Leave Hollywood, Monkey Man JJ Abrams, find a hole to crawl into and die, you talentless HACK. THIS FILM IS UTTERLY DISGRACEFUL. In no way is this movie 'Star Trek'",1,3,9,23 January 2016
Finding Nemo," The modern child's 'Bambi'
","40 years ago, when my generation were kids we were traumatized by the story of Bambi. For some, that story was their first contact with the concept of 'tragedy'. 40 years later the kids of today have their 'Bambi' too - in 'Finding Nemo' although that parallel (Nemo losing his mum = Bambi losing his mum) is quickly glossed over by the the rest of the story taking place. However, at the end of the story (which is a wonderful story by the way minus the 'Bambi Effect') you still have a 'kid' who lost his mother, but all of that HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN. Wow! Losing one's mum is not a nice experience for any child - not now, not in the past, and never in the future. How was it for Bambi? How SHOULD IT have been for Nemo? How many of you readers reading this thought of that?",5,1,2,16 June 2013
Thor: Ragnarok," New Zealanders hijack Hollywood and give them a dose of 'The Kiwi Way'
","I hated the previous Thor movies. All flashy, noisy, grandiose nonsense. This Thor movie was definitely very different, almost a comedy. In fact this movie is nothing like the previous Thor movies or any of the Avenger movies. Why?Question: What does Taika Waititi (Director + voice of Korg), Carl Urban (Skurge), and Rachel House (Topaz) have in common? They are all New Zealanders. After the first 20 minutes of this film I was expecting Jemaine Clement and/or for Rhys Darby to show up (alas, 'twas not to be.) But let's not forget New Zealand's blood brothers and sisters from 'over the ditch.' We have Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and Cate Blanchett (Hela), both from Australia. ANZAC Spirit is alive and well in this movie! This whole movie runs like a New Zealand-style comedy, reminiscent of Flight of The Conchords TV show or The Hunt For The Wilderpeople movie. Thor Ragnarok is in true Taika Waititi style. Give a Maori 'bro' some big bucks and some special FX people and you get 'Thor: The New Zealand Experience' ... aka 'Thor Ragnarok.'Personally I think Waititi stole the show with his rendition of Korg as 'a Maori bouncer from K Road.' (Waititi said in an interview that was the voice he based Korg on.) For those who don't know, K Road is the Red Light District of Auckland City, New Zealand.Even Mark Ruffalo's David Banner character came across (to me) as a typical, matter-of-fact 'she'll be right mate' New Zealander.Jeff Goldblum was... well, Jeff Goldblum LET LOOSE! Great work Jeff!And Chris Hemsworth looked like he was HAVING TOO MUCH FUN. There are scenes in this movie which are obviously ad libbed and Hemsworth is laughing for real. I would love to see the gag reel from this movie. Happiness and fun permeate this movie. It's pure 'Kiwi humour.'Now to the movie? I haven't read the comics. I watched the movie as a movie. Some of the humour was a bit out of place and the story was OK. The Special FX are fabulous and interesting. A real highlight. A surprising highlight for me was the SOUNDTRACK. What a fabulous soundtrack this movie has. Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song' was a great choice for the action scenes. The other incidental music was really awesome too.Here's the real highlight:Hollywood should learn a lesson from this. Stop being LEFT WING SJW's and get back to telling stories that make us FEEL GOOD and SMILE and LAUGH and have a GOOD TIME. Hollywood of America is Dead. Long Live Taiki Waititi. God Bless New Zealand and 'The New Zealand Way.' Making Hollywood great again.",7,0,2,10 December 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Good story but ruined by offensive, PC, racist, Left Wing smear
","POINT1: Apart from reeking from Left Wing stench and poison, this was a good ol' yarn. Purposefully aimed at the brainwashed Millennial/Gen Y members of our PC-crippled society. There's the obligatory black, Asian, African, and other non-white cast members, not that I have problem with other races - but when you ram that down our throats as an over-compensating suck up to the PC-abiding, Left Wing passive-aggressive racists then that is TOO much... and I am OUT! And as a special mention: of course the bad guy is a .... WHITE guy! Of course! Go the Left Wing agenda! ('we are so sorry we are white.') This movie would appeal to anyone irresponsible enough to be inclined toward the Left ('Love conquers all' etc delusion) and would probably just annoy the hell out of anyone with any other more sensible and analytical social/political leaning. POINT 2: Another in-your-face assault and insult to the viewer is the rampant PRODUCT PLACEMENT. Come on, Hollywood! You're just prostituting yourself to the Capitalist Monster which is such a contradiction in terms considering that in itself is what the Left despises so much and seeks to destroy in order to achieve their goal of a one-world, one-culture, no-individuality Dystopian future. 5/10 and would have scored higher without the Leftist stain. The leftist, bottom-feeder Whores of Hollywood churn out yet another one!",5,2,11,26 October 2017
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Absolute Crap
","After the first 10 minutes I switched off. The story was just so ridiculous but that was not the thing that turned me off. The 'technology' in the film was so far ahead of the era the story takes place in that one starts wondering if they are even on EARTH! Gatling guns didn't appear until the 1800's - 500 years later! They never even had bullets in those days. Only steel balls, one shot, one reload, at a time. So where did that massive belt of bullets for the Gatling gun come from? Half way through the film I was waiting for the nuclear weapons and the infra red scopes to make an appearance as the story progressed, or perhaps a Stealth bomber to land somewhere and take them away. Just ridiculous.This is not a family film. It has swearing which is offensive and unnecessary rather than appropriate or realistic to the era of the story telling. Why did they do that? To offend? Obviously. And there is the blood and guts, NOT suitable for children. Overall a nasty little film, and a perversion of the original story, designed to insult your intelligence and take your money. For the producers and the studio this film is merely a thinly-disguised 'get rich quick scheme.' It sure ain't a good movie!",1,15,33,16 June 2013
Zero Dark Thirty," Brainwashed Americans will see this movie as 'good'
","The story of Bin Laden the US government WANTS you to believe.The movie ignores the basic facts of 9/11 which of course aren't the published 'facts' which anyone with even half a brain doesn't believe anyway. By this it paints the true 'bad guys' (US GOVERNMENT) as the 'good guys' and therefore the very premise of this propaganda film is FALSE. The untruths abound. Do your own research or just be a brainwashed puppet. Up to you.So if you can stand back a bit and unaffectedly watch a propaganda film about the 'heroic' Americans bringing 'justice' to an event THEY THEMSELVES STAGED as a False Flag Operation to bring the world into fighting Israel's war against Islam, then here it is: Zero Dark Thirty. Utter Elitist propaganda. Zionist Jews at their finest.A LOT OF US ARE NOT FOOLED ANY MORE, USA.",3,1,7,26 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," JJ Abrams does it again!
","Franchise killer JJ Abrams strikes again. December 20, 2015. I have just watched Star Wars The Force Awakens and I am appalled, disgusted and deeply disappointed. I was never really a hardcore fan of Star Wars but I did respect and admire the series. Fanboy Abrams has ended Star Wars for me. I turn my back on this appalling insult to Star Wars. IMPORTANT, DISTURBING THEMES NOT MENTIONED BY OTHERS ARE MENTIONED IN MY REVIEW. Parents take note!Firstly, I have just read 55 pages of IMDb reviews and most of you people have given this atrocious movie a 1/10 star rating, a few 3/10s and a very few above 5/10. 95% of people appear to have disliked this movie. SO HOW THE **** DOES THE OVERALL IMDb RATING FOR THIS MAJORITY PANNED MOVIE HAVE A 8/10 RATING???? By my calculations this movie should be sitting around the 2/10 to 3/10 mark. What's going on IMDb? Secondly, there are a few nostalgia-blinded people who voted high on this movie and made such statements as to how this parody had 'the feel of Star Wars' and it was 'everything you would expect' or how 'fun' it was (so shallow.) Who are you people? What medication are you on that has you so DISCONNECTED from the Real World that you would praise this movie as a 'Star Wars' movie? Seriously, what is WRONG with you! Is Sharknado the new bar to set the standards of a movie against with you people?The clear majority who have reviewed this movie on IMDb minimally were disappointed and maximally despised this monstrosity. Its near-unanimous. Look for yourself. As for the movie: *** some spoilers ahead ***A lot has been said by others, the same things have been said over and over:--- the PC pandering --- the bad acting (I have to say: Carrie Fisher can't act. Her scenes were cringe-worthy) --- the blatant rehash of the original 1977 movie story --- the hack script --- the stupid villain who was just some snotty kid with daddy issues --- the ridiculous plot holes --- bad acting (Oh, I said that before) --- the rushed and incoherent pace of the 'story' --- the play-safe special effects and 1977 technology which in the end were just sub-par --- killing off Han Solo = JJ Abrams giving the middle finger to the REAL Star Wars fans. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME! (Harrison obviously only did this movie for the money.) And a couple of things of my own to add: a) the Force is now some super-charisma thing you snap your fingers and you've 'got it'? Students don't need teachers any more? What the ...?!? b) like Sharknado, people running around senselessly in the background (as a note, at one stage I thought this was a Mockbuster and was waiting to see The Asylum mentioned somewhere in the credits. The acting was certainly no better than your average Asylum mockbuster.) c) the 'super-teen' main girl running off to places and back, thats all she seemed to do. Lots of running. Yeah we get it, she's athletic! d) the 'suddenly reformed' super-teen stormtrooper's whole motivation in the story was to run away. (Despite being an utter coward, super-teen girl suddenly 'cares' for him yet she's only known him for 5 minutes.) e) Luke Skywalker had a tantrum at some stage in the past and ran away when some recalcitrant teen in his class turned to the Dark Side. f) Super teen, son of Han and Leia, ran away from his parents because of some unknown beef with daddy and mummy. He throws tantrums every time he can't get his own way. Boo frickity hoo! DO YOU SEE A THEME HERE? The moral of Star Wars The Force Awakens in one sentence: How to deal with challenges in Life? Run away from everything. Is that the lesson we want to teach our kids? JJ Abrams is to me the Uwe Bolle of Sci Fi. I heard there's an online petition with some 4000 odd names on it recommending Uwe Bolle be unceremoniously booted out of Hollywood and banned from ever making another movie. WE SHOULD DO THE SAME FOR JJ ABRAMS. Get this guy out of Hollywood where he can do no more damage. He deserves no less. I hated JJ Abrams for what he did to Star Trek. I hate him even MORE for what he's done to Star Wars. Abrams, you have to GO. You're a destroyer of other people's creations.And just like you fanatical Star Trek fans that dished out on Rick Berman and Brannon Braga before Abrams wrecked Star Trek, you fanatical Star Wars fans now too owe George Lucas a big apology. Do it. ... and let's get this petition happening meanwhile.",2,132,224,22 December 2015
