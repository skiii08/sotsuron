The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Pretty good job with this one
","I read all three books of this series a few times. The first two were terrific, and no matter how many times I read the third book I just plain didn't like it. I didn't like the direction the story went, it lacked excitement and what made this series so interesting was completely missing. I wasn't crazy about the first movie, the second one was vastly improved and this movie might have been the best adaptation of the book that I've seen yet. I can tell you that this movie was more interesting to me than the first half of the third book. I've been going to the theater with the same group of people for all of these movies and I expected this one to be really bad and it wasn't. It kept my attention, the acting was decent (except for Liam Hemsworth, I still fail to understand why he's allowed to be in movies) and it created some suspense that the book didn't have. Aspects of the book that seemed downright silly didn't appear that way in the movie. It gives the finale some hope, not that I wouldn't go see it anyway. I give it an honest 7 out of 10 and I'm a pretty hard grader. It's worth going to see. It doesn't have the pizazz that Catching Fire did, but they're on the right track with this one. And a big reason it's not higher is because of the lack of material they had to work with. The last book in this series was really bad.",7,1,12,13 December 2014
The Hunger Games," Pretty good, could have been better
","Things I liked: 1) Josh Hutcherson played a great Peeta 2) Jennifer Lawrence also did great portraying Katniss 3) Anything that varied from the book plot was done very well, and should be considered an improvement 4) The movie is on the long side, but you wouldn't know it because it moved very quickly 5) Woody Harrelson and Wes Bentley were strongThings I disliked:1) Lenny Kravitz was very weak as Cinna. I thought he'd be great and he just wasn't. 2) Not enough time was devoted to many parts of the movie. It felt rushed, especially at important parts of the story (it'd be a spoiler if I said where) 3) Like #2, they tried to pack too much into the plot. It really could have used another half hour to be a little more thorough. 4) Cinematography was awful. Often the camera seemed out of focus from my view in the theater. Too many close-ups and the resolution just seemed off. Didn't look like HD. 5) Could have used more dialogue. Main characters barely spoke to one another. 6) Capitol scenes seemed very cheaply done and the editing was sloppy, as many have already said. I was mildly disappointed but the movie was still pretty good. Definitely worth my $5 at the matin√©e, I just loved the book and the movie wasn't as good. Acting was spot on for the most part.",7,2,8,24 March 2012
Interstellar," Excellent Movie
","Deep space travel and finding another habitable planet are two of my favorite topics to read about online. I had been keeping up on this movie's development since a year ago. I like Christopher Nolan's movies, even though I always feel like his plots tend to squander some brilliant ideas. The best example was Inception - he could have done so much more with that brilliant premise for a movie. He sort of did it again with Interstellar, there was an opportunity to do much more, but the end product was a highly impressive movie that I really enjoyed. Seeing the visuals of this movie in an IMAX theater is enough enjoyment for the ticket price. But Nolan managed to make the plot worth following as well. He took the plot in a direction that I wasn't crazy about, but I can't really talk about it because it would become a spoiler. I kept thinking during the movie - 'If Nolan would have done this, or taken the movie this way it would have been so much better...' the same way I said it to myself during Inception. I ended up not being impressed by Inception, but this movie was different. His way was pretty darn good. There were several scenes that had me literally on the edge of my seat. Great suspense. I had a preexisting hatred of Anne Hathaway's acting, but she was actually pretty good in this. She played her part perfectly. I've always been a fan of Wes Bentley and I hope to see him take on some bigger roles now that he's back and recovered from drug abuse. And I don't get why so many people don't like Matthew McConaughey, but he is on some kind of a roll lately with his movies. He was superb in this one, very believable both as an astronaut and as a caring father. I really think he's going to win another Best Actor for this, he was that good. We need more great, serious space exploration / sci-fi films, and this is a terrific start. I really liked the effort by Nolan to make this movie seem real. You could tell that they spent a lot of time with Kip Thorne and incorporated his ideas very well. I know that it's far fetched, but I would really like to see a sequel to this movie. As great a job as Nolan did, I'm already anxious to see more. I think he could do it and I think that with the story he built, it could be even better.",9,5,13,10 November 2014
Marriage Story," This is why Adam Driver is awesome
","I really liked it, although I'm getting a little tired of hating Laura Dern. Every time I see her on the screen she becomes more and more detestable. Scarlet Johansson is great, and it was cool to see Ray Liotta again.Adam Driver is a great actor, and he's great at conflict. He tried to be reasonable and then he's awesome at losing his mind. His meltdowns were the best part of the movie.",8,5,7,26 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Way, way better than the prequels...review from a huge fan
","I'm almost 40, which means I saw two of the original three movies in the theater as a kid. I had all of the old toys, stupidly threw them all into the bathtub and wrecked them and constantly begged my parents for my own light saber. Take all of the annoying garbage from the prequels and toss them out. The horribly sappy dialogue, the horrible acting, constantly changing outfits every scene and annoying characters (Jar Jar) that refuse to go away. You'll thankfully get none of that this time. When I saw that JJ Abrams was in charge, I knew at the very least we'd get a solid attempt with this new trilogy. We definitely got that, and a little bit more. Just a little. It felt like he knew what the old die hards wanted to see. He also managed to find some really good actors. I knew Oscar Isaac would be good, but I didn't know the Rey or FIN characters at all. All three did a great job, but I was particularly impressed with Adam Driver. Being a great goof-off on Girls doesn't necessary mean you can be a key character in a Star Wars movie, but he did a super job. It's a grittier, more human movie with far more interesting characters. For the most part Abrams played it safe, nailing the action scenes and adding some quirky CG animal characters. But he did try a few things that worked. For example, we've never seen a non-Jedi handle a light saber, and I thought that was very cool. There could have been more light saber action, but what you do see is very well done and believable. The real test was taking my six year old daughter to the movie, the most exciting part for me. She hasn't watched any of the old movies yet, but she spent most of the movie with her eyes half-covered. That's always a good thing. She loved it, and now she's asking me to play the first movie for her to see. So thanks Disney, you passed the test.",8,0,10,20 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Vast improvement over the first movie. Still a little lacking, but definitely worth seeing for $10.
","I bought all of the Hunger Games audiobooks and listened to them several times. I know the story backward and forward. I wasn't thrilled with the first movie at all. I thought it was completely devoid of emotion in what should have been a moving picture. It was just OK.Breathe easy Hunger Games fans, this one was a vast improvement. Considering the volume of material, they did an admirable job of squeezing it into a little over two hours. The whole thing was a still a little rushed, but the important parts were done very well. Jennifer Lawrence was tremendous again and Josh Hutcherson was decent. When you read the books, you have a picture in your head of how the events play out. This movie really did match my ideas of how things looked. The director did a tremendous job of creating the quarter quell arena - it was perfect. The second book required a little more imagination based on the things that happened in the arena, and all of them looked realistic. Considering the amount of revenue these movies generate, I still think they could have put a little more money into the CGI because it still looked a little cheap in parts. But overall, I was pleased. I took six other people to the show this time and all of them enjoyed it much more than the first movie. More time could have been spent on the arena action, but the pacing was much better in this movie.The Finnick casting wasn't perfect, but the guy is a good actor and passed the test. Johanna Mason was a pleasant surprise, the woman nailed her part. I really liked the job she did, and she actually turned her into a likable character. As expected, PSH was good as Plutarch. Woody Harrelson is one of my favorite actors and he was just OK in this one. They can't seem to get his character right...it's just off a little. Liam Hemsworth once again was god-awful, and the romance sequences in these movies are terrible.Overall the movie was solid. Money well spent.",8,2,20,23 November 2013
