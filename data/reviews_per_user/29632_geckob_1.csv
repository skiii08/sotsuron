Walk the Line," Joaguin Phoenix was fabulous! Reese Witherspoon sang her heart out!
","Wonderful, heartfelt portrayal of one of our great contemporary love stories. Joaguin Phoenix captured the heart & soul of Johnny Cash - his expressions, voice & mannerisms made me feel that Johnny was still with us and starring in the movie. Though I respect Philip Seymour Hoffman & his fantastic acting abilities, I so wish that Joaguin Phoenix had received the Oscar for his magnificent portrayal of a music icon who I grew up listening to and watching. From the time I was very little & we had our first TV, we started mornings watching The Louisiana Hayride & the Carter Family, with June stealing the show most of the time. Reese Witherspoon brought her spirit & spunk back to life. I will never forget the joy Johnny Cash & June Carter Cash and their music & faith passed on to us. Joaguin Phoenix is most certainly my favorite contemporary actor. Tom Cruise may be a 'star,' but Joaguin is an ACTOR in the finest sense of the word.",10,0,0,25 April 2006
