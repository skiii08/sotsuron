The Blair Witch Project," Hungry, Cold, and Hunted
","Three filmmakers go to the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland to shoot a documentary on a mysterious local legend but what they discover in the reenacted film, 'The Blair Witch Project', is much more tragic than they could imagine.  This is a unique and terrifying film in which all that we see comes through the lens of two cameras that the three bring along - one, 16 mm black and white, for the documentary and the other, full video color, as a tag-along. This depiction is already spooky enough because the audience becomes voyeurs through the eyes and senses of these filmmakers; indeed, they accurately reflect upon this technique as a sort of filtered reality'. Therefore, we see a blending of the images of the two cameras which, while sequential in time, comes across as choppy rather than continuous because they decide when the camera should be turned on and when it should be off. This adds to the heightened suspense as the three people get totally lost in the forest and we never get a full picture of what is confronting them because our vantage point has been micro-sized to their level.  'The Blair Witch Project' is challenging, tricky filmmaking but it works because it is one of the few times in cinema that you can feel and experience what the participants are experiencing that very moment.  Toward the end of the film, one of the characters, Heather, looks into the camera and poignantly apologizes to each of the three mothers about how sorry she is in getting them all involved in a tragedy that she well senses.  That is a particularly powerful message about taking responsibility for one's actions.  For me, the appeal of 'The Blair Witch Project' goes beyond the chills and frights of a brilliantly conceived form of cinematography.  It boils down to accepting failure as a necessary part of life, however tragic and final that might be.",Null,1,1,7 August 1999
Requiem for a Dream," You've made your point
","Hulbert Selby Jr.'s  underrated 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' portrayed self-destructive characters with no escape from their eventual fate.    In Selby's 'Requiem for a Dream',  director Darren Aronofsky revisits the same territory with an engrossing cast and an ingenious array of camera tricks that work up to a point before things clearly get out of hand.  Whereas 'Last Exit' knew when to back off, in 'Requiem', we are tortured with excesses that overstate the premise of the film.  The final nerve-racking denouement ruined this film just as a similar technique doomed the over-the-top 'Natural Born Killers'.  It didn't have to be this way. 'Requiem' built up the four main characters (Sarah Goldfarb who imagines being on the same infomercial she is constantly watching, her son Harry, girlfriend Marion, and buddy Tyrone who imagine raking in riches from selling drugs if only they weren't hooked on it) as they each ride the wave of their addictions before crashing violently down.  It used split screen to show the devious son trying to steal his mother's TV while she is locked in her closet afraid to come out; or another time to show the sensual caressing touches of Marion and Harry.  It used the imagined world to show Harry and Ty toying around with a policeman that they could not do in real life or Marion putting a fork into the hand of lecherous Arnold when she really had to submit to his grasp.  And in the case of  Sarah, the imagined and the real became virtually the same when the commanding refrigerator dictated all her actions. We even see rapid sequencing used to show the mundane act of getting up in the morning or Sarah swallowing up her skimpy diet of eggs and grapefruit or the final, maddening act when all four go down the sewer in quick succession. Ellen Burstyn's Sarah comes across initially as interesting and appealing, then as sympathetic, and finally as repulsive. She deserved better.  She must have identified with Linda Blair from 'The Exorcist' after the stunning makeover from a prim eccentric widower to a drug-crazed, fiendish looking psychotic.  Sadly, 'Requiem' went beyond sensibilities to try to make a point.  After a while, you wanted to tell director Aronofsky that enough is enough.",Null,0,0,23 November 2000
Catch Me If You Can," Of Mice and Yankees
","'Catch Me if You Can' is an acceptable, feel-good movie involving characters we want to succeed, Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank Abragnale Jr, and Tom Hanks as FBI agent, Carl Handratty.   Guns are drawn but never fired and a disillusioned son never gets to express his outrage at his opportunistic mother.  Steven Spielberg injects the 1960s look of a  Robert Wagner 'It Takes a Thief' TV series or a Peter Sellers 'Pink Panther', even bringing back Kitty Carlisle for the 'To Tell The Truth' show.  But he doesn't give us  the inventive nor provocative spirit of his trademark films.  De Caprio excels in his very believable conversion, from a bystander witnessing his father dangling lockets or overly praising strange women to do his biding or his mother's philandering, to an active participant in fraud.  Tom Hanks has to suffer the role of the fall guy, failing at least four times to catch his man.  The interesting women in De Caprio's life, especially the hotel hooker (Jennifer Garner) who fails to appreciate a con and the sheepish young nurse (Amy Adams) whose genuineness is as clear as the braces on her teeth make for interesting distractions but their roles are too transitory. This is an OK film but, by Spielberg standards, below what was expected.",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
Minority Report," Unfinished symphony, unfinished film
","'Minority Report' is a mess from the obvious holes in the story (a premeditated murder that isn't, a drug seeking father who mourns his dead son by mysteriously divorcing himself from his loving wife) to the poor plot and character development (3 bodies plopped on a watery bed who we have to accept as being able to decipher the future, a Holy-Grail type search for a 'minority report' embedded inside one of the female subjects).  It has a storyline that, like Shubert's Unfinished Symphony, seems unfinished even as the film mercilessly hurries to a contrived ending.  It is sad that with such talent, Steven Spielberg, John Williams, Philip K. Dick, Tom Cruise, Samantha Morton, Max Von Sydow, and Colin Farrell, the film would come to this.  The film should have been told without the convoluted and unbelievable twists and turns ( the arrested Agatha coming back to life to selectively remember what will happen, the contrived bad boss portrayed as milquetoast , the cunning federal agent who magically puts all the pieces together before his fatal end).  Toned down and told from a more philosophical viewpoint (yes, we can believe in soothsayers) with better character development (particularly between Atherton and his wife and also the three future telling misfits), this would have been a more sensible and intelligent film rather than the mess that we have.",Null,0,0,13 July 2002
Unbreakable," Man and Superman
","M. Night Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' never advertised itself as a 'Sixth Sense' clone so we can't claim bait and switch if 'Unbreakable' doesn't meet our expectations.  The suspense involving what is and is not real is just as juicy and the performances from Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis among others are well done but the payoff doesn't seem to merit all the effort. The only way to enjoy 'Unbreakable' is to understand the mindset of a comic book aficionado, one who lives and breathes that special form of reality, for which Shyamalan was no doubt paying homage to.  Ironically, even from that vantage point, 'Unbreakable' fails to deliver any action pack adventures nor special effects.  We are stuck in Philadelphia in someone's mind.  There are also some incongruities you have to swallow - the Bruce Willis character, David Dunne, who doesn't seem to notice that he never gets injured nor sick; or his being a security guard but living in a well-to-do house; or his estrangement from his son Jeremy (well played by Spencer Treat Clark) and wife Megan (Robin Penn Wright) because he wakes up every day 'sad'; or the preposterous motives behind certain acts of terrorism.  But 'Unbreakable' does bear a strange homey value.  There is the opening sequence in which Willis is trying to pick up an attractive woman on the train, his son Jeremy witnessing his astounding bench-pressing, Jeremy again wanting desperately to affirm his father as a hero, and the comforting arms of Megan trying to relieve David's nightmares.  In his two efforts, Shyamalan has shown the keen ability to deliver suspense and storyline without overly spoon-feeding it to us.  It's too bad that 'Unbreakable' didn't have as much substance nor imagination as his first work.",Null,0,0,26 November 2000
Billy Elliot," Ba-lay
","'Billy Elliot', in an earlier version, could have been 'Flashdance' or 'Educating Rita'. But what this film lacks in originality, it more than makes up in athleticism and spunk.  This is a special film about a special time and place in the life of an eleven year old boy, Billy Elliot (a remarkable performance by Jaime Bell), growing up amidst the turmoil of losing his beloved mother, of identifying who he is, and of facing down his stern father (Gary Lewis) and troubled older brother (Jamie Draven). Besides the close family bonding, Billy befriends Michael, a neighborhood chum who is only beginning to accept his sexual identity.  And then there is 'Miss' (Julie Waters in a role reversal from 'Educating Rita'), the ballet teacher 'slumming' in the nearby gym, willing to put Billy through the paces because she sees his real talent.  It would be misleading to frame this film as just about a boy growing up in trying times because the only way Billy can achieve his dreams is if others around him grow up in lock step.  His father must break away from the provincial mold that says the only masculine activities are playing football and boxing.  'Miss' must confront her 'swan-lake' fable that seemingly has stunted her own life - a lovely swan left in waiting by her wandering prince.  This film is also heartfelt through and through from the tender advances little Debbie makes on Billy to the sobbing father wrestled by the older son from becoming a scab, to the rolling street, filmed dead-on with the placid bay on the horizon, that Billy triumphantly runs up and down after mastering a dance turn and later his dad repeats when Billy gets accepted to dance school.  The memory of Billy's mother pervades his life and yet her physical presence shows up only once, a minor oversight to a film that envelopes your heart for two hours and lingers yet on and on.",Null,0,0,21 November 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Lopping Heads
","When an Oscar-winning actor (Martin Landau) can't make it past the first minute of a film, there is something wrong.  Indeed, Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' is a special effects vehicle looking for a movie.  The Washington Irving story depended upon imagination to give it a creepy, frightful rendition.  This film spoils everything by showing lopping heads, headless horseman flying off the bark of an old tree, and pursued victims who meet their vividly bloody demise.  Like the striptease artist, Burton leaves us with little to imagine.  'Sleepy Hollow' becomes boring, predictable, and not very scary.  Its main characters mirror the unnecessarily complicated plot by becoming obtuse and dull.  Johnny Depp, like his earlier film, 'Dead Man', comes across as flat and uninspiring as Ichabod Crane. Christina Ricci is miscast as the young virgin that she is not.  Even Miranda Richardson's role is terribly undeveloped until the end when she is thrown at us both as a way to neatly end the film and also to explain to us how all the missing pieces fit.  'Sleepy Hollow' is a sad example of how modern day technology can spoil an earlier work of horror.  When there is little to imagine, you can't help but ask when the movie will end.",Null,0,0,22 December 1999
Pitch Black," I am not your *** captain
","The joke goes that in a G rated movie, the good guy gets the girl while in a R rated movie, it's the bad guy.  In a X rated movie, everyone gets the girl.  Which leads us in a quandary about 'Pitch Black' where no one gets the girl.  The film models itself after scary movies from the past, notably the first 'Alien' and the earlier classics, 'The Birds' and 'Day of the Triffids'.  But 'Pitch Black', for all its inventiveness and original ratchet sounds, is no more than a slight thriller because it never intended to aim any higher.  Oh, there is some religious theme if you buy the Muslim father figure who still sees God in a mucked up world and there is the loyalty of a reluctant starship commander named Fry (Radha Mitchell) to her companions.  But basically this is a film to sit back to get frighten by and to figure out who will survive at the end.  It helps that a certain figure named Riddick (Vin Diesel) comes with night vision eyes because the eclipse will render everything unsafe. And that a barren planetary outpost has just the necessary props to fit the plot.  The ending, while unexpected, is in keeping with a film that is, first and foremost, out to scare you.  Anything else is just not in the cards.",Null,0,0,7 March 2000
U-571," I don't know
","Think of World War II submarine movies and the trail always leads to 'The Enemy Below' and 'Das Boot'.  It seems anything else, like 'U-571', would just be imitation. And yet this film throws in lessons about leadership which transcend it from merely a submarine yarn to a moving account of the conduct of Navy men and their commanders.  As commented on by others, it also marks a new beginning for actor Matthew McConaughey, emerging from the throes of the forgettable 'ED-TV' and 'Contact', to a strong film presence that develops before our very eyes, like John Wayne in 'Stagecoach'. 'U-571'  doesn't have a very believable plot (a super-important project with no backup support) but that is more than compensated by the nervy scenes that transpire. You can always thrill an audience by depth charges thrown at a defenseless sub or the seals and bolts popping as the sub dives beyond its limit or the torpedoes that have to be aimed squarely to blow up intended targets.  But 'U-571' also tells the story of a Navy Lieutenant who can't measure up to being a Captain until he is willing to give up not only himself but also his men for a mission.  As skillfully acted by McConaughey with a bevy of credible support - Harvey Keitel as the Chief, Bill Paxton as the Captain, Jon Bon Jovi   as Emmett, and Jake Weber as Hirsch, 'U-571' more than entertains you, it teaches you a lesson about the military sacrifice of men.",Null,0,0,22 April 2000
Being John Malkovich," Metaphysical Can of Worms
","Getting into someone's head' is a cliché that gets visual representation in the film, 'Being John Malkovich', a funny, inventive, original, absurd picture that, unfortunately, falls on its own absurdity.  To explain the reasoning behind why anything happens here would be asking one to think, which would destroy all the enjoyment this movie offers. The movie displays comical spurts and dances around the issue of sexual identity. But, ultimately, 'Being John Malkovich' falls like a row of cards because its weirdness is too much.  It can't escape its own absurdity just like John Malkovich cannot escape seeing everyone looking exactly like him when he enters his own portal. After a certain point, this film runs out of mindless humor and it just plain trite.",Null,0,0,11 November 1999
The Exorcist," Who remembers 'The Sting'?
","It failed to win Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Director, nor Best Supporting Actor and yet 'The Exorcist' stands out as the pacesetter in intelligent horror filmmaking.  Now, 27 years later, this crisp, stunning treasure is back as fresh as Linda Blair's naiveté.  Under William Friedkin's direction, we witness the crescendo fright of human beings rendered powerless by the anti-Christ.   But the screenplay of William Peter Blatty's work is also filled with ironic playfulness, such as the highly inquisitive detective (Lee J. Cobb) who wanders in the middle of the film with Columbo-like mannerisms or the self-assured doctor who proclaims exorcism as the panacea for all the wrong reasons or the comparison of Father Damien Karras' (Jason Miller) facial likeness to John Garfield and Sal Mineo.  Graphic is a word this film etched into our minds from the visual shock of x-raying the brain to seeing the excessive terror of a little girl as she turns her head completely around or spews out green vile or talks with the husky vulgarity of Mercedes McCambridge.  Then there is the brilliant scene of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow) getting out of the taxi and facing the Georgetown house in the haunting evening shadows and streetlight or the unforgettable line of the Father Karras' mother figure acidly asking her guilt ridden son, 'dami, why you do this to me?' The acting is first-rate.  Linda Blair makes the central figure,Regan, a believable damsel in distress and both Ellen Burstyn and Jason Miller give excellent portrayals of tormented figures fighting an uphill battle of survival. 'The Exorcist', unlike many other films about God, treats the Catholic religion under attack with both reverence and accuracy, as suggested by the many credits given to clergy at the end.  This remastered return of a great film makes us ask how in the world it could have lost out to 'The Sting' in 1973?",Null,1,2,29 September 2000
Remember the Titans," One brief shining moment
","'Remember the Titans' starts out with a group of people revisiting the gravesite of an old friend and then whisks us back ten years in time.  This is a film with 'formula' written all over it, from the team that wins against all odds, to the bigger than life Coach Boone (skillfullly played by Denzel Washington) who rules with an iron hand, to the tragic accident before the big game, and finally to the hero who comes off the bench.  Yet, 'Remember the Titans' excels at the very things that 'Coach' would expect - great acting and a memorable story.  At the heart of this film are human beings trying to figure out how to live with each other - be it getting a team together to win, finding the courage to follow one's convictions, or doing what is morally right rather than following the crowd. The only blemish is that the film glorifies the mistaken obsession, as prevalent today as ever, that in high school sports winning is everything and losing is not an option.  There are many poignant scenes, two that are particularly revealing involve the little girl, Sheryl, (well acted by Hayden Panettiere) once when she is sobbing in a lonely grandstand with her father Coach Yoast (in a strong performance by Will Patton) after he has told her he will not be elected to the Hall of Fame because he could not allow the officials to corrupt his game, and the second when she stares down at her father to swallow his pride if he wants to win the game.  'Remember the Titans' spends a lot of  focusing on the moment.  Black and white players forced to interview each other about their families, two white 'outsider' players who blend in so naturally with their black teammates even as the white players are floored by what they see, the stern warning Coach Boone gives to his fellow coach not to cuddle the black player lest they become crippled to deal with real life situations.  Because the film deals with the moment, it is disappointing that few of the participants become bigger stars after their unbelievable triumph including the two coaches who never eclipse their particular glory.  Uplifting, inspiring, healing are all appropriate words for 'Remember the Titans', a film that freezes a golden moment in a Virginia town for all of us to savor.",Null,0,1,4 December 2000
Man on the Moon," The Boy Who Cried Wolf
","As a child, Andy Kaufman would perform make-believe TV shows in front of his bedroom wall because he believed his wall was his audience.  Later in life, he would ask his Mahareshi what the secret was to being funny and the response came back to be silent  not the silence of absent sound but the silence of listening inwardly.  Kaufman's world never became a world we could understand.   Milos Foreman film, 'A Man in The Moon', while well-acted and directed, doesn't try to explain why Kaufman did what he did. Instead it chronicles the several well-publicized events of Kaufman's brief stardom with a near perfect portrayal by Jim Carrey.  So we see his stand-up routines ranging from the juvenile musical numbers to the Elvis impersonations,  we see his infamous relationships with alter-ego Tony Clifton and wrestler Jerry Lawler,  we see his supposed blow-ups' on Merv Griffin, David Letterman, and the Friday' shows, and we see his successful Carnegie Hall one-man engagement ending with the audience bussed to a hall for milk and cookies. But 'A Man in the Moon' does not enlighten us to why a comic would push the envelope of his craft by performing as if he was still a boy, making mischief and not telling anyone about it, suffering and getting humiliated for the inward pleasure it derived.  Why did the film bring back many members of the Taxi' TV series including Marilou Henner, Judd Hirsch, Jeff Conaway (for that matter, Danny Devito) and then merely use them as props instead of integrating their take on Kaufman into the film?  Why did Kaufman's parents appear in largely non-speaking parts, again acting as props, when their dialogue would have been good source for explaining Kaufman's behavior.  Was Andy Kaufman a good prankster, a good showman forever putting on an act, or was he truly a comic genius?  'A Man in the Moon' suggest that he was all three.  But ironically, by recreating Kaufman as well as he did, Jim Carrey, years from now, will be remembered as the Man in the Moon' with Andy Kaufman as an afterthought.",Null,0,0,30 December 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," They only follow their masters
","'Crouching tiger, hidden dragon' holds your attention for two hours by its sheer efficient use of time.  Imagine six fight scenes, some that would make The Flying Nun pay attention, two interwoven love stories, a short discourse on Eastern philosophy and Eastern manners, and an homage to the American Western from the pacifist themes of 'High Noon' and 'Friendly Persuasion' to retribution in 'The Unforgiven' to the omnipresence of 'Shane'.  Director Ang Lee chose native dialogue with English subtitles as a way to showcase classic Chinese cinematic techniques - the understood rather than the spoken, the facial mannerisms that reveal what is in the heart.  The main characters (Chow Un Fat as Li, Michelle Yeoh as Shu Lien, and Zhang Ziyi as Jen) won't smother you with their screen presence - they fade in and fade out without fanfare - but it is probably not coincidental that Lee made Jen to resemble Queen Amidala from 'Star Wars, the Phantom Menace'        and the Jade Fox to look a lot like The Wicked Witch from 'The Wizard of Oz', comforting characters from comforting films.  The well-orchestrated martial arts action scenes are worth the admission -  one on rooftops, one between tall tree branches, one between a woman and another woman, and one shoot-em up involving a whole gang of men and one woman that adds new meaning to the word, 'gang-bang'.  In addition, we are educated to centuries old Eastern thought - loyalty to one's master, search for meditation over confrontation as well as woman's issues - condoning arranged marriages, accepting womanly behavior.  The romance in this film is particularly well done - from the reluctance to touch the hand of one you love to the enticement of a warm bath to win the heart of a rebelled maiden.  The ending is both an enlightening and a fitting resolution to a film that successfully merges all the good elements of both the Western genre and the gung-fu fighting cinema with the heartfelt compassion of Eastern thought and philosophy.",Null,0,0,24 December 2000
Rules of Engagement," From weakness, strength
","The facts are these:  a well-decorated Marine Corps Colonel is charged with murder by ordering his soldiers to fire randomly into a crowd of demonstrators in Yemen to protect his men as they are evacuating civilians from the U.S. Embassy.  'Rules of Engagement' dramatizes this actual incident in which Colonel Terry Childers has to defend himself with only his word while the evidence would seemingly suggest the massacre of innocent people.  The film makes abundantly clear that while the 'rules of engagement' are spelled out in black and white, in actual combat those rules must be weighed in light of specific circumstances.  It does so from talented portrayals (in addition to Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, and  Bruce Greenwood) and straightforward storytelling.  It also does something that we would easily miss if it was not so obvious - that race was never an issue.  How truly refreshing in these days when that could easily have been Childers' trump card.  But that would negate the singular message of this film, that honor to country and to men under one's command is supreme.  This is a film that easily matches the skillfully made film, 'The Verdict', in its 'against all odds' theme - a hopeless court case in which the deck is stacked against a lawyer,      who admitted he was too weak to mount a winning defense and a soldier whose only hope is his Marine Corps devotion.  The overall direction by William Friedkin is blunt and unequivocal although he probably did not need to show the little girl firing a weapon who later loses her leg or the reciprocating salute between Childers and the Vietnamese colonel .  It's too early in the year for Oscar considerations but here's hoping we don't forget Samuel L. Jackson or Tommy Lee Jones when nominations are in order.",Null,0,1,22 April 2000
For Love of the Game," I Went To A Baseball Movie and A Love Story Broke Out
","Ten reasons to avoid this movie (in honor of 9 innings and an extra one the movie made us suffer through):10.  Kelly Preston playing an older' woman with a daughter already in college (she had the child when she was 16) - I can't swallow that but replacing her with Alicia Silverstone, now that would make it believable 9.Pushing FOX Network salaciously throughout this movie - one bit of backfired irony: the movie plot of a family-owned team being sold to a syndicate and having to get rid of its star player - sounds very similar to what a certain Mr. Murdoch did.8.  Picking on poor Detroit - again.  Given that the film was made one to two years ago and the filmmakers had to find a bad baseball team that would still be bad when the film came out, but how about Kansas City, Minnesota, The Cubs?7.  Billy Chapel didn't realize that he had not allowed any baserunners until the 8th inning!! How many years has he been in the big leagues?  19, and going to the Hall of Fame?6.  In this sacred cathedral (i.e. Yankee Stadium) we now have a chapel' and more sappy voice-over from Vince Scully.  Be careful, Vinnie, John Sayles is looking for a make-no-sense announcer for 'Eight Men Out' - the sequel.5.  Does Anybody Care About America's Favorite Pastime?' - good rhetoric but a below-the-belt swipe at Emergency Rooms that ignore people bleeding4.  Calling Prince Billy in Boston - pick up my daughter, bring her home, and I have some passion lovemaking waiting - and other incredibly contrived scenes3.  It can't be a love story because Billy and Jane see each other only during Spring Training and when the team is in town - or am I missing some March to October romance here?2.  It can't be a baseball story - all the players look like cutouts, the 9 innings are the longest any movie fan will have to endure (Harvey Keitel did a lot better job with the 9 innings he had to work with in 'Bad Lieutenant'), and the opening scene with the walking teammates in double-breasted suits is a poor rip-off from 'The Right Stuff'1.  Why can't Kevin Costner clear the mechanism' of all gimmicks and cliches and make a decent movie about an over-the-hill pitcher who still loves the game' enough to pitch his best game?

","A film with not one but two martyrs.  Tack on a storyline that most people have some knowledge of - the whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand and CBS Â‘60 Minutes' bungled effort to withhold his interview.  What you get is Michael Mann's 'The Insider', a powerful film that, in spite of its foibles, is a masterful indictment of corporate America and those people who would compromise their integrity in order to maintain the status quo. The intelligent use of close-ups and focus in/focus out scenes creates a dynamic sense of the nature of the three main characters, Mike Wallace (as played by Christopher Plummer as so sure of his persona and yet so insecure of how others judge him ), Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe as the corporate Judas who is tormented by choices he made), and Lowell Bergman (played by Al Pacino as the Type A in-your-face personality who cared enough not to compromise his sources).

The Hurricane," 45472
","Ironically, Norman Jewison was filming bigotry ('In the Heat of the Night' in 1967 and 'A Soldier's Story in 1984) even as a man named Ruben 'Hurricane' Carter was forced to live it.  Their paths meet in 'The Hurricane', a well-intended story of racism and the price a man paid because of it.  It's a pity that Jewison can't carry this film with the same zeal of his two earlier successes.  Certainly Denzel Washington brings us 'Hurricane' Carter at his gut-level best, well enough to garner an Oscar nomination.  But the tension he brings to his character doesn't seem to rub off on anyone else in this picture and he can't carry this film by himself. The weakest part is, surprisingly, the boy Lesara (played too innocently by Vicellous Reon Shannon) and the white extended family, Sam and Terry and Lisa, that fight to save Carter.  There is no fire nor spirit in what they do, just a matter of fact, going through the motions.  If there is any love between them, it doesn't show in any tangible way on screen. When we finally get to that touching scene in which Lesara says he will bust Ruben out, one way or another, he sobs openly on cue through an emotionless expression. There is the matter of Detective Della Pesca (a menancing Dan Hedaya) who has been a thorn to Ruben Carter since he was eleven.  If this vendetta was indeed racially motivated, the film should have developed this villianous character more rather than merely using him as a straw man whenever the opportunity presented to put Carter 'in his place'.  'The Hurricane' dishes out a story of racism and injustice without much fanfare nor conviction - like a boxing match that finishes the course without a knockout punch.",Null,2,5,31 January 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Faithfully yours
","Nicole Kidman buck naked from the rear and then sitting on a commode to urinate. A last line destined to be famous for being both descriptive and obscene.    What kind of sexploitation is Stanley Kubrick up to.  But this is not any director, this is Kubrick the master and there is method to his madness.  His last film, 'Eyes Wide Shut',  follows the lineage of hyperbole and unconventional presentation that we remember so well from 'Dr. Strangelove' and 'Clockwork Orange' to '2001 - A Space Odyssey' to 'Full Metal Jacket'.  Kubrick has fittingly chosen his finale to be, hold-on-to-your-hat,  positive on the institution of marriage, and he has chosen the hippest, most glamorous married movie couple to do his bidding, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.  How unpredictable but how well thought out. This is a slowly-evolving, long (almost three hours) but truly satisfying story of two people's quest for love and fidelity in today's society.  Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise), wife Alice (Nicole Kidman), and daughter Helena would seem to epitomize the successful family.  He, a medical doctor, with lots of money and patients in New York City; she the beautiful and loving wife and mother.  But as we learn from a Christmas party they attend, Dr. Bill is not above hitting on two lovely models and Alice, intoxicated with champagne, is easily seduced by a scoundrel on the dance floor who believes marriage to be an invention to lose one's virginity so that the woman can carry on affairs with whomever she pleases.  In a long and well-played scene that says a lot about how men feel about women and how women feel about men, Alice is irritated that her husband never gets jealous of her and confides to Bill that she romanticizes in dreams about an affair with a naval officer she briefly met last summer.  Infuriated, Bill proceeds to go out on the prowl late at night in New York City and has as much calamity as Griffin Dunne did in 'After Hours'. Women everywhere seem to have the hots for him and everyone tempts him in their own special way.  Kubrick is not above throwing in a male hotel clerk with much sexual innuendoes.  The most suspenseful and elaborate part of the film is the sexual ceremony in a secluded mansion that Bill innocently stumbles upon through a close friend. Comparisons are in order to the hot water Cruise suffered in 'Risky Business' but more so in a deadly and moralistic way.  Again, Kubrick has paired the two most believable people to play Bill and Alice and both Cruise and Kidman do a superb job of acting.  So what do we learn after sitting through a mind-boggling exercise in trusting one's marriage partner?  I think Kubrick would say that relationships are not forever, but with an open mind and a loving heart, they can be as permanent as one is willing to make it.

A British Prime Minister who goes as he pleases, a boy who just lost his mother but is grieving because he is in love, same boy running around Heathrow Airport like there is no such thing as security, and an ambiguous love triangle between an African man, his white best friend, and his newly wedded white bride.  Then there is that remark by the Prime Minister that he would eliminate the ex-boyfriend of his love interest (a la Tony Blair and his WMD top scientist?). Finally too much of a good thing is not necessarily good.  Exploiting the old Pop star, Billy, for all its worth; the Colin character who goes to Wisconsin to find love; and the couple who find love doing simulated sex. Amidst all this, the sleeper was Claudia Schiffen showing up as someone called Carol.  I think most everyone missed that one.",Null,0,2,9 November 2003
A Hard Day's Night," Try to remember
","When you see Paul, Ringo, John, and George in 'Hard Days Night', you really see yourself thirty-five years ago - brash, egotistical, flighty, and rebellious.  In seeing their rise to stardom amidst the adulation and fanfare, you see also your own rise to being whomever you are now.  This is a joyous return to pure showmanship that didn't need a corporate sponsor and to a dream-like state where wishes do come true.  Sadly, there are truths which reverberate with the familiar tunes they play so well.  When they are not performing, you see the images of lonely young men running away from commitment, from the mundane and stilted lives around them, and running to their elusive girls and their elusive freedom.  On the train, they can't help poking fun at a middle age man who insists on doing everything his way. On an open field, they frolic as children in a playground that the owner regards as closed.  In a police station, they see conformity and they are chased not merely by cops but by their very authority. Yet when they are performing, you see the bright laughter in their faces and the enjoyment of what they do best.  There are no second takes from outsiders because they follow only their own intimate direction.    'Hard Days Night' is not merely a running monologue about young men trying to stay sane even as their admirers surround them with their insanity.  It is a true-to-life look at possibilities, some real and some not real.  When Paul's fictitious grandfather asked Ringo to put down his book and to start 'marching', the film is telegraphing that same message to us - to put down the conventional and look at the unconventional.  The only thing that could have made this film better is if they had sung 'Imagine', the most admired tune of the last half century.  'Hard Days Night' takes us back thirty five years and it too ask us to imagine what life could have been like.",Null,0,0,31 December 2000
The Green Mile," Like the drink, only not spelled the same way
","A black man, sitting on a riverbank, wails loudly that he was too late to save them as he holds two limp, white little girls, one on each of his mighty arms.  Much later in the movie, he calmly says that they were killed because of their love.  In between these scenes we learn much about John Coffey and the Deep South in the brilliant yet faulty film, 'The Green Mile'.  Stephen King's serial novel has been brought to screen with the same searing portrayal of racial bigotry as 'Places in the Heart', with the same realism and critique of capital punishment as 'Dead Man Walking', and with the added supernatural elements that are hallmark to Stephen King's works. Yet 'The Green Mile' is a long film (over three hours) that loses its special significance when it goes off focus.  Why spend an inordinate time dealing with Paul Edgecombe's urinary tract infection, why go overboard with detailing Mr. Jingles, and why does Percy, the sadist guard, seem to have as much screen presence as John Coffey?  The real story should be between Edgecombe and Coffey and yet there are too many distracting things in their way.  To the film's credit, when it does spend time with racial prejudices, it spares no one.  The arresting scene between Edgecombe and the lawyer defending Coffey (played by Gary Sinise), in which black people are compared to dogs that don't know any better, explains much about Southern philosophy. When Coffey is called upon the save the warden's wife, a remarkable change of events occur from the cold, initial reception to the final warm enlightenment.  When Edgecombe confronts his terrible guilt with Coffey, their   commiseration is both tearful and heart wrenching.  'The Green Mile' is blest with veteran actors playing their roles naturally and securely, from Tom Hanks to Michael Clark Duncan to David Morse to Bonnie Hunt to James Cromwell.  'The Green Mile' is a good but not great movie because it, ironically, tried to be too faithful to the novel.  Better if it had focused more on the special relationship between Edgecombe and the man who could save others but not himself.",Null,0,1,21 December 1999
Final Destination," No respect, no respect at all
","A teenage movie about death.  Interesting but how do you get people to see it?  Can't be serious - no one will come and it can't be campy - Hollywood won't finance it.  So the lowest common denominator of teenage movies is loudness and violence. Throw in a little seriousness and make it a little campy.  What you get is 'The Final Destination',  a film without any shred of merit nor decency.  The film playfully bounces off the memory of two recent airplane disasters near New York, TWA 800 and Egypt Air 990 as well as John Denver's untimely air crash as if they were mere props to be used and abused. How ever did it manage to avoid John Kennedy Jr?  Its ingenious setup of death as something no one can cheat is tossed aside in favor of a childish game of who will die next and in what manner of blood and gore - strangulation, bludgeoning, beheading, smacked dead by a bus or train, or worse, a runaway neon sign.   You have a feeling the filmmakers initially wanted this film to take the high ground, especially the scene of the eulogy given by one of the teenage survivors, when he says death to young people shouldn't be thought of at a distance but as real as the next moment.  But just as abruptly, the subdued turns heavy-handed and any semblance of caring turns into mindless pillage.  'The Final Destination' starts out giving comfort to those who mourn but ends up desecrating life as well as death. Is that what teenage movies are all about?",Null,0,0,30 March 2000
Princess Mononoke," With Eyes Unclouded by Hate
","'Princess Mononoke' is pure and simply a morality tale, presented in the finest tradition of Japanese animation with such detail that it almost seems real.  This 1997 film finally made its showing here two years later with the added voiceover of well-known Hollywood stars such as Claire Dane, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, and Gillian Anderson.  So given that pizzazz, can a film with obvious Oriental themes - the dignity of nature and the consequences of its violation by man and the enduring spirituality that makes life timeless, work on an American audience?  Yes, because 'Princess Mononoke' skillfully orchestrates the breathtaking outdoors with its mysticism as well as coordinated battles and other action scenes to tell a story both adult and children can understand.  No, because the simplicity of presentation makes some people think it is hokey.  Additionally, love relationships, whether it is between mother and child or boy and girl, are intentionally restrained by Western standards so we feel cheated when the best romantic scene is one where the Princess chews up jerky beef before transferring it to the mouth of her Prince.  Given that, 'Princess Mononoke' is worth the price of admission just for its well designed animation and its hair-raising suspense, even if we can't appreciate the Spirit of the Forest' and the cataclysmic forces it has on all of us.",Null,1,2,19 November 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Big Rock Candy Mountain
","'Oh Brother Where Art Thou', unlike the Coen brothers' 'Fargo' which was a mean-spirited parody on dumb talking Minnesotans, is rather a celebration of Southern culture, especially the twangy folk music.  Instead of picking on the people of Mississippi, the film glorifies a slower way of life, during the Depression, when the unhappiness and sorrow of poverty and inequality blended as naturally in song as the promise of a resurrection.  Taken loosely from Homer's 'Odyssey',  the film follows three quirky convicts who escape from a chain-gang detail. Delmar (wonderfully played by Tim Blake Nelson) is the blank face, impressionable simpleton who could run to a uninvited baptism as easily as he could believe his friend had turned into a frog. Pete (equally well acted by John Turturro) is the moral compass, a man who sternly believes in right and wrong even if it means changing reality to fit his principles. Everett (George Clooney) is the articulate, agnostic universal man, a champion of expediency.  Together they immerse themselves into a real world they are ill-prepared to face.  The use of white is significant in three places, from the mesmerized people marching to the waters, to the muses by the river banks, to the KKK meeting and anticipated lynching.  Similarly the blind man is used initially as a prophet riding singularly on the rail, warning not the seek worldly treasures and then later on as a radio station owner who just happens to discover the 'soggy bottom boys'.  There are subplots too, involving the escapades of George 'Baby Face' Nelson, the governor's race between an inept incumbent and his sly challenger, and a fight by Everett to win back his wife and five girls. George Cooney's versatility really shines here.  The man who could take on the Iraqi army and a full Northeaster is just as comfortable comically acting out as one of the 'good ole boys'.  The Coen brothers finally got it right in fashioning good taste around satire.  In 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou', life is really a series of serendipity events, in which being slow-witted becomes a virtue rather than a curse.",Null,0,0,14 January 2001
