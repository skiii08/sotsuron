The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash!! Hulk Delivers!!
","Some time ago, Iron Man set a very high bar for Superhero Movies, I'm glad to see that 'The Incredible Hulk' kept it up, it may not surpassed it, but by no means was a letdown The pacing was great, the 'origin' was made in the fastest recap I've ever seen, and it worked, I loved the action sequences, the cameos were there (even one from the great beyond) and there were TONS of Easter eggs for the Fans of the series I know that some will complain about some acting and CGI, but to me the final product was so good, that it made me forget the Ang Lee fiasco, and makes me think that maybe Marvel has found the formula at last It's the second time I had low hopes for a film and I ended surprised.Let's hope they keep it up, the winner in the end is the viewer.",9,4,10,13 June 2008
Kung Fu Panda," A new Classic for both kids and adults...
","I didn't have too much hope for this movie, although I like most of Jack Black's movies,and I'm glad to say I was wrong!!! This movie is great in many levels, it ain't silly-funny and doesn't rely on anacronich humor like Shrek heavily does (you know, modern stuff being used on medieval times)or belch and fart jokes, the only 'modern' thing I found was the fact that Po the main character it's somewhat of a Fan boy of the legendary Kung Fu Warriors (it has their action figures and collects souvenirs), other than that it's a great Kung-fu 'chosen one' type movie done with the best animation I have seen in years, it felt kinda short, but it's a great film to watch ... and collect.",10,4,7,13 June 2008
Juno," An OK tale Without a morale whatsoever
","For starters the cast if made of some of my favorite actors and actresses, and it's cool to see that Jason Bateman it's making a comeback somehow successfully, and to boot, I have been a fan of Ellen Page ever since I saw her on 'Hard Candy'. Because of her acting skills, nothing more (yes, that should be a nice cover up).The movie it's a great blend with comedy, drama and of course the mandatory sentimental moments, something clearly different for a year full of cinema violence and cynical humor, J.K. Simmons showed us that not only can act, he can actually talk with a normal speed and an normal voice The problem I had this movie, it's the morale, so in the end Juno found out that she was actually in love with her best friend, so it wasn't just pity sex what lead her to this whole situation, and when you find one that loves you just like you are, you should never let go that person. That's a cool morale, but I think I'm one of the few that actually remembers one thing: She's a minor who got pregnant and gave away her baby, and in the end both her and her boyfriend go back to their previous lifetime (but as a couple) without ANY regret or consequence of what just happened, or any moral that they actually learned something form said experience..Of course an Abortion themed movie wouldn't have sold that good, or been on my movie list either, but the aforementioned detail makes this movie a guilty pleasure, if you just take the moral out Curse you Diablo Cody!!! (Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a cool writer).Just my two cents.",8,1,4,10 May 2008
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Another great installment, but not for everyone....
","Like most (if not every) Del Toro's films, Hellboy 2 it's a visual masterpiece, the creatures and realms are just great and realistic, although at moments (you'll know when) the film gets a 'Men in Black' feel, with that being said, I got to add that the action sequences are top notch but there is a moment where the plot drags for quite sometime, and the the balance is lost, is still 'a must see film', just don't see it on the midnight showing, or if you are too tired, because you will somehow get bored or lost, specially if you are not a fan boy, the ending was very interesting, although the last minute seemed somehow not the best way to end the film, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did...",9,2,6,11 July 2008
The Dark Knight," From the beginning to the end, this movie delivered all promised and even more...
","Yes, Ledger stole the movie, and his performance reminded us why the Joker IS the Scariest Villain of any comic book, not only in the DC universe, and to think that a Psycho like this one could really exist in the real world is a scary thought indeed... Just the opening Bank robbery it's a creepy example.All the actors were top notch, I had some troubles with the 'new' Rachel (although a better choice than the first one).Harvey Dent, brilliant! but the Irony lies in Two Faces dies, while the actor it's alive for another sequel, while the Joker lives and Heat ... well, you get the idea, and I say that with tons of respect (check my blog on TV.com about Heat),oh well, life goes on...And the Action?? let say that even the 'slow' parts are fast paced, and 2 and 1/2 hours won't be felt... Dark Knight has rise the level on comic book movies one notch again!!!",10,1,3,19 July 2008
Iron Man," Batman Begins.... Iron Man continues;
","Spoiler Alerts: You Have been warned! I didn't expect much from this film, and Boy, was i surprised!!! A TV. spot (namely the Tank vs. Iron Man scene) seemed too fake to my taste, but it was obviously enhanced later on, because on the theaters that scene looks awesome..The cast was great, the effects beyond my expectation, the pace was perfect and the ending was a rule-breaker.I am not very familiar with the comic, but I noticed that this film laid out TONS of roots for future Marvel films, we know that in the upcoming Hulk movie Tony Stark/Downey will make a cameo, trying to start a link between Marvel films, something that has been on Marvel's minds for some years now, let's hope it works... DC, is trying to do it with Bale and Routh reprising their roles as Batman and Superman for a Justice League feature.There's a lot of Marvel references: S.H.I.E.L.D.,War Machine, and the ending I think would a base for the 'Civil War' Marvel's storyline... just to name a few...A few years back 'Batman Begins' reset the rules for a great superhero movie and gave us a great guideline, as previously did the first X-men movie, unfortunately later films failed on some degree to match the formula (Fantastic Four)now Iron man retakes the challenge and actually puts the game on a higher level, let's hope 'Dark Knight' and 'The Incredible Hulk' can keep up...",10,1,5,5 May 2008
