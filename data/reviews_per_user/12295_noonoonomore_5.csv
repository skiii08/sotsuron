10 Cloverfield Lane," A thriller, that thriller fans don't want to miss. At All!!
","I rarely watch a movie without stopping it every 15-20 minutes to do something, and it doesn't mean those movies are bad, it's just that, this is a habit of mine. But this movie kept me staring at my laptop the whole time. I stopped once to get a glass of water. You just can't get your mind off of it until the very end.I don't know what else to add, this is a thriller that thriller fans don't wanna miss. Highly recommended!",8,0,0,10 June 2017
If I Stay," Just Avoid It!!
","I can't believe I wasted my evening on this. An immature story good enough only for girls below twelve years of age. I wonder why Hollywood likes to glorify self-centered annoying little girls who only complain about everything and the only purpose of other people's existence is to comfort them. I guess the industry needs us, girls, as needy as possible and this is its way of brainwashing us. T'was boring, stupid and pointless. I gave it a two because the first 10 minutes, the whole punk rock family with the cello lover daughter looked pretty interesting; could've been an interesting movie as well, but it was a big torturesome bore, hungry for money.",2,2,4,5 June 2017
The Hurt Locker," Racist and disgusting
","As a person living in the middle east I found this movie disgusting.We are not all savages carrying bombs around and Americans aren't the angels shown in this movie. The movie's trying so hard to demonstrate how these saviors endure all the trouble wholeheartedly to save the world but doesn't bother to show the real people whatsoever; any Iraqi, is a bomber somehow, then why bother? Let them blow each other up. The sad fact is before America's invasion there wasn't such a high rate of explosions in that country, the minute that great savior set foot in the country bombs started flying in the air and the director, whom I used to love for 'Point Break' and 'Strange Days' but not sure anymore, tries to make us believe these are heroes? These people who won't say no to the chance of raping an Arab or let an innocent man die with the phrase 'fuck'm' are supposed to be praised? I wonder how she cast Keanu Reeves, as he is Lebanese; wasn't she afraid he might blow everything up? Or she was as brave as her heros in this film accepting all the cost of casting a middle-eastern person?!!! The fact that Academy rewarded this piece of crap just shows how biased Americans are toward the rest of the world.We really are people just like you, why is it so hard for you to accept?",1,5,8,11 April 2017
Silence," Only for the Cinematography
","I strongly dislike religious movies, especially the ones with too many unnecessarily forced POVs, and also this movie is boring af; Had it been less long it might have had a better impact on the audience but 2 hours and 40 minutes of Christian drama is pure torture.The bright, very bright tbh, part of the movie is the cinematography. It's simply marvelous, making the picture a delight to look at and it's s worth it, watching the movie only for that! Even though you might get sick and tired half way the movie of all the talent, time and money being mercilessly wasted.",5,1,2,14 April 2017
La La Land," It coulda been OK if it wasn't for all the hype and expectations, but not now
","I usually don't use the word 'the worst' to describe a movie, but sometimes you have no other choices.The opening reminded me of those stupid teen songs of today's that give me goose bumps outta disgust whenever I accidentally see them on TV, the story is boring and worn out, the music is forgettable and it gave me a headache that I won't be able to study tomorrow, the dancing is an uglified Singin' in the Rain and the performances are mediocre except for Emma's who also didn't deserve to win and a nomination was enough, for Isabelle Huppert was so perfect in Elle the award was hers and hers only. The only thing worth watching in this movie was the cinematography.It could've been an OK average movie if it wasn't for all the hype but after the built up expectations it's one harsh slap in the face when you finally sit through it waiting for something extraordinary.",3,5,8,16 April 2017
