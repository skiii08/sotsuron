Blade Runner 2049," I found it to a be great sequel
","I found the movie to be completely engrossing.Cinema photography was amazing. I'm not the hugest fan of Ryna Gosling (driven being one of the worst movies I've ever sat through). He played his character to perfection and it even seems Harrison Ford gave some effort to his role.I knock it a little for the complete story, however it works and I was never bored. However I was never bored with the original",8,3,8,16 October 2017
Blade Runner 2049," Love this movie
","Pretty simple, really love this movie. Thought the very end was a little weak. However the cinematography is awesome. Great sequel",8,1,7,6 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Another disappointing installment
","You may dress like Star Wars, have sets that are Star Wars. Put Star Wars in the tittle however this is not Star Wars",2,9,15,10 May 2020
X-Men: Apocalypse," talk about screwing up a great comic story line arc
","take what really should have been 2 movie's and squeeze it into one movie. Then take away just about all character development and any true explanation as to the back ground of the main villain and you have the blah movie I just watched.If you just want to see a movie with mutants fighting this it. If you want a story that has any real relation to the comics then your guess is as good as mine as what to watch.Apocalypse has such a huge story arc and they just chewed it up and spit it out.Oh mystique, please send her off somewhere, some remote island...maybe abducted by aliens. There is absolutely no reason for her to have such a large screen presence",5,2,14,6 June 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Littlerly top 10 worst movies ever
",Its embarrassing comparing this movie to any of the previous Star Wars movies. The director and writers would better off working for Starbucks. Didn't think it could get worse after that last piece of crap jj put out. This is laughable,1,5,8,8 July 2018
