The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The worst BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM rip-off I've ever seen
","I'm a fan of Asian extreme political commentary movies, but I was in no way a die hard The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 fan. I saw the original, was impressed, but that was about it. When I heard about this carbon copy I was immediately disgusted with the idea of why the people who make movies at the level of 'Sharknado' would try to remake such an iconic classic in the dytopian world. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and watched it. I have never been more angry with a movie. Imagine Titanic being remade, but the ship doesn't sink and everyone lives happily ever after. That is what they did to this movie. I was blown away by how literally EVERY scene and plot point this movie is known for was neutered entirely. I know remakes tend to change some details for the audience of that country etc, but they basically wrote a whole new Twilight subplot 30 minutes in. This would have been far better off if they took their plot of 'BFF's live happily ever after' and just made an original movie. Worst excuse for a remake, I knew they wouldn't do BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM justice, but this was just pathetic.",1,2,5,11 July 2016
The Hunger Games," Hollywood clones Japan's original BATTLE ROYALE for big profits
","The original BATTLE ROYALE is one of my favorite YA movies of all time. I'd even rank it up there with The Exorcist, another film that pushed the envelope and was ahead of its time. Unfortunately, because of the original's cult status, a remake was inevitable. Does it do the original any justice? I can't say that it does. And I honestly feel bad for the director. He was simply set up for failure. If you are curious about the remake, watch it. I'd read the bad reviews, but I still had to see how it held up to the original. Just too bad it doesn't at all. I will say the acting and score were decent. Again, not as good as the original, but good nonetheless. If you've never seen the original or remake, please watch the original first. Yes, you will have to read subtitles, but I'm gonna assume most of you have a third grade education and can read.",1,5,7,29 June 2016
Suicide Squad," Baddies on a PG-13 Spree.
","I went into the film open minded despite the critical reviews, but this film is a piece of crap. Not one likable character to root for and they are not bad villains as they are in the comic, often rather teary eyed and snuggly with each other. I can't believe that the creators of this movie could be so irresponsible as to mislead people about a subject that still struggles to be heard and understood in our society. Throw in Will Smith being the annoying, unrealistic lead with Harley Quinn's ever changing accent and you have the mess that is Suicide Squad. Despite all this, the vampire looking Joker is not terrible. He is not good either, but if you take away the ghetto look with the grills and tattoos and not imitating Ledgers voice, you might have had a somewhat decent performance. Sadly, the look ruins anything good. A plot that is severely lacking just like any of the characters who you honestly do not care if they live or die. DC failed again which disappoints me to no end.",1,4,8,8 August 2016
Sausage Party," Poopoo Jokes for the Grownup Set
","All evidence points to this animated film being contrived as a money-making scheme. 'Hey, we can create a cheap CGI movie and make companies pay for the celeb voices in advance by inserting their brands in the film!' I'm all for a bit of a bit of tasteless comedy, but it's got to be at least a little bit funny. And, please, not crass Nazism and innuendo in a movie aimed at the Emo generation. I feel extremely sorry for them because from now on, whenever they go to a market they will see their embarrassment in their heads. Sorry guys.The story is the worst part. It is a Food Fight rip-off! When the market closes, the market comes to life and transforms into a city while items and foods come to life and turn into citizens! The new products that look like Pixar freaks take over which turns into a food fight battle.Not aimed for adults OR children. Please, whatever you do, if you haven't seen it, don't try. I regret every second I have watched of it!",1,25,53,14 August 2016
Inception," Whats up with the blatant anime ripoffs?
","And so, the inevitable: Paprika vs. Inception. Really? You didn't see that coming? A lot of people seem to think this movie is wonderful. It has star power, I suppose, and a lot of people like stars. To me, it looked like half a dozen Japanese animes slapped together into an incomprehensible mishmash mess, combined with some thinky dialog that supposedly glues it all together. Crap, in other words. I read the Wikipedia article on this movie, just to make sure I didn't miss some profound thing that would change my mind. Even the article was dull and uninspiring...I read the first and last paragraph, and that was a chore. I'm not picky...if I'm entertained, I'm happy, even if the plot/acting/whatever sucks. I'm sure the acting was great, the special effects were awesome, and the key grip showed others how it's done. I just couldn't get in to this movie. I didn't care if the main characters lived or died, I didn't care if the McGuffin got got, and I didn't care if the stupid top fell over. Despite Hollywood's slobbering over this movie, you might notice nobody bothered to make a sequel or otherwise capitalize on its greatness. Was that because they didn't want to defile its artistic purity? Um, not likely. It's trash, and Tokyo knows it.",1,0,5,26 August 2018
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," BATTLE ROYALE 2 Gets Hacked to s&*t (and not in a good way)
","First off, I'm a big fan of the original Japanese version of BATTLE ROYALE 2 (2003). This is one of those movies that stays with you long after you have watched it. When I heard of a remake for the American audience, I thought it would be great and would love to see what could be done with it. I went into seeing this movie very excited. It starts off similar to the Japanese version, but seemed to lack a bit of the eerie atmosphere the original had. The characters seemed a bit more likable in this version, so I started to get a bit more excited about it the further it went.The story then take a left turn and seems very rushed once all of the action starts. The original version is a lot bloodier and contains a lot more violence. This version hints to the violence taking place but never shows whats going on. The ending, which in the original, is the part of the movie that sticks with you, is hinted to, but again, never shown. I recommend that if you do decide to watch this movie, what the original version first. Hey America, if you're going to do a remake, do it properly and don't hack a film to shite!",1,0,4,4 July 2016
