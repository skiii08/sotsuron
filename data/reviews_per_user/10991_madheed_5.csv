Catch Me If You Can," class act
","A really enjoyable film.  After seeing the trailers i thought it would be good but i never expected it to be so interesting.  And the fact it is based on a true story is fantastic.  Tom Hanks plays a really good part, (i would say that with him being my favorite actor) But the quality of acting by Leonardo DiCaprio is superb....  It's a film well worth going to see.",9,0,1,9 February 2003
Insomnia," Fairly good
",unlike most film of this genre i actually stayed to watch the whole film! Murder cases are not usually my thing but this film i thoroughly enjoyed it.  Robin Williams must have worked really hard to fit into character. It was a hard part to play as i have tried to play the phychopath many of times.  Verdict: Quality mystical film,9,0,0,20 September 2002
Forrest Gump," Brilliant Film
",I have seen this film X amount of times and find it brilliant every time i watch it.  It'a a mixture of all genre's of film rolled into 1. It's One of the many films in which i love!!!!  If i was to give a summary of this film i would just say fantastic!!!,9,1,2,20 September 2002
Spider-Man," Good
","For a film of this type I enjoyed it. I am not a one of thoses comic freaks and am not interested in spiderman, batman or anything of the sort. But with a persistent friend i was dragged along to go and watch it. I was supprised to find that i enjoyed the film and went back to see it another 2 times.  There was no boring parts or anything like that. I would suggest for people that think it's not ur sort of film to go and see it u mite get a pleasant supprise!!!!!!",8,0,0,20 September 2002
Men in Black II," Not as good as the first!!!!!
",Like hundreds of films this one has followed them in that the sequel is not as good as the first one!  Fair enough it was funny and i laughed but it lacked tension.  There were many parts in which i was falling asleep.  I would recommend u go and see it just to say that u have seen it.  this is my view on the film but i do tend to have a specific taste in music!!!!!!!!!!,5,0,0,20 September 2002
