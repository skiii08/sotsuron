The Devil's Advocate," what a movie
","i loved this movie, the script is out of the world, the cast is great, the performance is best.I had seen some of the parts of this movie on TV.I didn't understood where the story was heading or what the story is so i was not interested in this movie but one day while surfing channels i saw some credits rolling i got excited which movie it is and then saw its name the devils advocate.Obviously i thought its not a good movie u know but decided to give it a try the scene where Keanu Reeves prosecutes the girl that scene made me go wow what a scene it was;the best prosecution i have ever heard.Then the movie went on revealing its elements one by one.I loved it so much cant describe it in words.If someone in this world haven't seen it go for it.",9,4,4,3 December 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Ride of emotions
",At one moment you are looking a guy killing someone you feel awful or whatever after few seconds you r laughing out loud holding your stomach. This movie is a masterpiece.HATS OFF to Quentin Tarantino.The direction was awesome.I really loved the concept of breaking the movie into chapters that was cool(like in KILL BILL).The background music was perfect.Best work done by all the actors.Brad Pitt was hilarious.Christoph Waltz has given his best in this movie.I think after The Dark Knight in 2008 this movie is the movie i really loved after a long time.Its on my list of top 100 movies of all time.If anyone in this world haven't seen it go for it and have a roller-coaster ride experience.,10,3,11,9 December 2009
