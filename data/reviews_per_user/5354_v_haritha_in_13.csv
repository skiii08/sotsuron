The Devil's Advocate," I saw the Devil!
","This movie addresses the old question; is a lawyer doing the right thing by defending a criminal. However, it finds a novel way of presenting its idea. Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves)is a young and successful attorney, in fact so successful that, as we are reminded time and again in the movie, he has never lost a case. He takes up the case of a man who is accused of molesting a child, thinking that he is innocent. Midway through the case, Lomax discovers that the man is in fact guilty and though he is a little disturbed, he helps secure the man's acquittal. Thus, he begins selling his soul to the Devil, both figuratively and literally. He is immediately offered a much better opportunity at a mysterious organization owned by John Milton (Al Pacino). His job becomes increasingly stressful and he has to defend some shady people. Determined to maintain his record, he abandons his scruples and neglects his wife (Charlize Theron). Can Lomax ultimately redeem himself?Keanu Reeves does a decent job as the title character but, it is Al Pacino who steals the show. He is a brilliant Devil. His real identity is not kept secret from the audience for long; the movie title and certain incidents give it away. Charlize Theron is spot as a woman descending into madness. Connie Neilson and Tamara Tunie are good supporting villains. The atmosphere for the movie has been carefully created. The sets are rich but seem to symbolize vanity and are somehow depressing. Most of the cast are pleasing to the eye yet the character they portray are either unhappy or evil. And New York is a perfect location for this tale",7,22,24,11 August 2014
Training Day," Good Performances
","An honest rookie cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), on his first day in the narcotics division, is assigned to be trained with a street-smart veteran, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris demonstrates through his actions that in order to deal with hard-boiled criminals, it is necessary for the cops to get their hands dirty at times. They visit gang-infested neighborhoods, chase drug-dealers and conduct house-raids. But as the day progresses, Harris's methods become increasingly questionable and Hoyt starts suspecting his mentor's true intentions.The stories of corrupt cops and naive, good-looking, rookie cops gaining an experience of their lifetime ('character arc' in movie parlance) have been told many times by Hollywood. But the performances of Washington and Hawke set this movie apart. The supporting cast is pretty good too. There is plenty of suspense and good action to keep the viewers engaged for two hours. But none of it stays in the mind after the movie is over.",7,1,2,4 September 2014
Shaun of the Dead," Perfect Blend of Horror and Comedy
","Shaun (Simon Pegg) leads a dull life as a salesman at an electronic store. He is mocked by everyone around him and his girlfriend dumps him. But his life takes turn when a zombie invasion happens; he is spurred into action to protect his loved ones, winning back their affection and respect in the process.It is a spoof of the zombie movies by George A. Romero, but also has an original story of its own. There is plenty for both comedy and horror fans. The atmosphere is tense, the scares are genuine and the movie does not cut back on gore. And yet every moment of it is funny. For example, there is a scene where Shaun and his gang move through a street full of zombies by pretending to be one of them. It is a cheeky idea and it is fun to watch them do that, but the danger of being discovered is kept real.Pegg is the life of the movie. He perfectly brings out both the seriousness and the silliness of the movie at the same time. The Cornetto trilogy is one of the finest British comedies alongside Ealing comedies and the Monty Python films. And this movie is the perfect beginning to the trilogy.",9,0,1,5 September 2014
Batman Returns," Watch Nolah's Trilogy Instead
","I did not watch Burton's Batman films while growing up and hence, I do not have the nostalgic love for them. I saw them recently, after having watched Nolah's trilogy, and I am not impressed.Max Shreck (Christopher Walken), an evil businessman and a deformed Penguin (Danny DeVito) plot to take over the city through democratic means; the Penguin runs for the Mayor, with Shreck managing his PR. As expected, Batman comes to the rescue.I found Batman (1989) to be mediocre in every department (apart from the the score) but this movie is simply a joke. The Penguin looks nothing like the bird except for the flippers. His henchmen look like they are dressed for a cheap mummers party; they are more ridiculous than scary. They live in the city's sewer full of water with green paint in it, which is supposedly the toxic waste released from Shreck's factories and the cause of Penguin's deformity. For some reason, there are many penguins living in there. If the chemicals caused mutations in a man, why are the birds quite healthy; aren't they more susceptible? Don't the sewers also carry domestic waste and the Penguin lives there? Isn't the sewer ever inspected? It is movie license I suppose.Remember all the fuss about winning Vicky Vale's heart in the first movie? Well she is just shoved into a couple of passing references in this movie. But who is complaining; Michelle Pfieffer's Selena Kyle/Catwoman looks far more desirable. Her character is annoying as Kyle and her motivations as Catwoman are unclear. But as I said before, she is so luscious, who cares about her motivations as long as she is on screen.Both Penguin and Shreck have evil written all over their faces, it is hard to see the people of Gotham trusting them, especially since they have seen many a super-villain. You would think they would wise up a bit. Whatever.A totally predictable and forgettable film.",5,4,12,12 September 2014
Predator," Predator in a Jungle
","A group of commandos go into the South America jungle on a mission. There they encounter an alien that hunts the army men for game. It has powers that enable it remain elusive, track people in its vicinity and kill them deftly. As the men are being taken out one after another, it falls on the lead of the team, Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to out-wit the predator at its game. The character of Dutch is tailor-made for Schwarzenegger. It is the tough guy kind of role that does not require a lot of acting chops. He has some memorable lines like, 'If it bleeds, we kill it' and 'Payback time.'This alien is different from most other movie aliens in its personality and characteristics. Its design was unique at the time in was made, but tentacles/mandibles on the face have been used many times since then. The story is simple but gripping nonetheless. The action is good with lots of gun-fire and explosions. The effects still hold up and its good to see a non-CG monster.",7,1,2,24 August 2014
Nightcrawler," Starts Well But Becomes Predictable
","Nightcrawler follows the career-rise of crime journalist, Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man as slimy as the creatures under the rocks, as he moves from being an observer to a participant in the crimes he records. Aiding and abetting him is Nina Romina (Rene Russo),a TV-news veteran at a local station, who shares the same (lack of) values as Bloom.The movie has a lot going for it. A thriller could not have asked for a better setup; there are the crimes being filmed on the one hand and on the other, there are the actions of the protagonist himself as he hunts those crime stories. And there is additional horror for the audience in that the news they watch on a daily basis is the result of such depravity.The movie has a subject matter that has never been dealt with by mainstream cinema and a great cast with the lead actors sharing a particularly good (and foul) chemistry. In spite of all this the film only comes out as mediocre. It has a strong first-half; the characters are introduced well and it easily captures our attention. However the second-half comes across as stale; some of the scenarios feel repetitive, the ending is predictable and the characters too start to feel flat. The film also does some the mistakes other thrillers (I am looking at you Gone Girl) do; give unrealistic liberties to the bad guys and makes all the other characters, particularly cops, way too dumb and/or incompetent.The movie tries to be a thriller-cum-commentary on some of the journalistic practices but ends being a slightly below-average, pop-corn flick.",6,2,4,4 January 2015
Ghostbusters," Ghosts Busted!
","Ghostbusters has all the ingredients that go into the making of a good comedy. Subtlety, wit, good performances and a smart and crisp story. Three out-of-work, oddball scientists found a company that gets rid of ghosts from haunted places. They encounter myriad spirits and are put to test when they have to face the mother-of-all-ghosts in a riveting climax.The movie is just a cascade of one comedic situation after another and at the same time, we are also interested in the big picture. Bill Murray is one of the ghostbusters and his character is unusual for a scientist; he appears bored throughout the movie, when he is chasing ghosts or courting the Sigourney Weaver character. Weaver herself is brilliant as both the cynic and the temptress, before and after she is possessed respectively. All the supporting characters are memorable. They all have their own weird personalities. Heck, even the ghosts, big or small, cute or fierce, have personalities. Top it up with some witty dialog and you have a thoroughly enjoyable film.",7,3,4,24 August 2014
Back to the Future Part III," Perfect Ending to a Perfect Franchise
","The first movie, Back to the Future, had successfully blended Sci-Fi and high school drama to give us a heart-warming little tale. This movie does an equally good job of taking Sci-Fi to the wild west. The previous movie had ended with Doc being accidentally transported to 1985. Marty takes the help of 1955-Doc again, to bring 1985-Doc back to the present day(1985).What follows is a fun-filled adventure. Marty meets his ancestors. Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, an ancestor of Biff's, is a dreaded outlaw. A forefather of Principal Strickland is the town Marshal. There are gunfights, duels, Indians, Fedoras, chasing trains on horses, rescuing of a damsel and romance. The film pays tribute to the great westerns of the past. Marty adopts the name Clint Eastwood when he meets his ancestors. Like in some of the classic westerns, this film too has the plot-line where an outsider (time-traveler in this case) comes to a lawless town and teaches them, by setting a example, that violence is no good.The trilogy on the whole does a great job with time-travelling and alternate time-lines. There are a total of fifteen known time-journeys, three alternate 1885's, four alternate 1955's, four alternate 1985's, one 2015 we see and one which is yet to be made and zero plot-holes, in all the three films combined. What makes it even more special is that none of it is complicated. That is how story-telling ought to be.It is a one-of-a-kind time-travel trilogy. A must watch for film aficionados and casual movie-watchers alike.",10,5,7,26 August 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Nothing New
","In a galaxy far far away, a part human, a green lady, a brute, a talking raccoon and a walking tree set out to save a purple stone, which can cause a purple explosion, from falling into the wrong hands. That is Guardians of the Galaxy. There is nothing more to it.All the characters are one-dimensional with generic interests in the mission; Peter Quill, the part-human outlaw (Chris Pratt), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and the magic tree (Bruce Willis) are only interested in the payoff and of course in the end they change their motive to saving the world, without any apparent reason. Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the obligatory lady in the team, knows how evil the villains are and wants to stop them. The extremely annoying Drax (Dave Bautista) wants to avenge his murdered family. And the villains want the purple stone to take over the world. Why do they want this particular stone, don't they have any other explosives with them? Who knows.There is the overused cliché of circumstances bringing the motley bunch of heroes together, them having an adventure and becoming friends at the end of it. But none of them share any chemistry between them and is it hard to see what made them become friends. Not that we care though; we know they would all end up as friends and so they do.We don't care about anything else in the movie either. We hardly know our heroes and since it is the Marvel Universe, we know none of them would die. The planet, the villains are threatening to destroy is alien, we know nothing about its denizens and again, we know it is going to be saved. The stakes never seem high.The movie, however, is visually pleasing. 3D has been used innovatively. CG is realistic and the worlds created using it are beautiful. The action is good. There are some funny moments and good one-liners. There is nothing new though. It has a run-of-the-mill feel to. Watch it if you like generic action flicks or a die-hard fan of Marvel comics. Give it a skip otherwise.",4,15,33,23 August 2014
The Last Emperor," A Biography and a Character Study
","This movie is the biography of Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi (commonly known as Puyi), the titular last Chinese Emperor. It is a rare Hollywood picture about the Orient. It takes very few liberties with historical facts and covers his entire life, an impressive feat given the many events that had taken place in and during his lifetime. He was coronated at the age of three and sent to live in the Forbidden city. It was the time when China was transitioning from Monarchy to a Republic. The new government allowed him to retain the title and he was not to leave Forbidden City. Thus began his life as a puppet placed on a seemingly high pedestal by different regimes for their own benefit.Puyi grew up in an extremely unhealthy environment. Separated from his mother when he was a toddler he had no friends, apart from his wet nurse, to give him love and no parental figures to teach him disciple or responsibility. The eunuchs residing at the City had no authority over him and he was at liberty to abuse them with impunity. He grows up to be a product of his circumstances. His has well-meaning plans for Forbidden City and later the people of his native Manchu but he has no idea how to implement them. Instead he becomes even more powerless. To top it all he is misogynistic and vain with a misplaced sense of entitlement. He gets no sympathy from us, the viewers even thought we have seen how we became the person that he is. We hold him responsible for his decisions and non-action.The movie opens with the beginning of Puyi's life post-imperialness, when he was held prisoner. After his release, he becomes a commoner. His time as the Emperor are shown in flashbacks. Ostensibly, he had a better life before. But, is it really true? He now has the freedom he never had before. This movie is as much of a character study as a historical account. What makes this aspect of it work is its strong cast. Richard Vuu, as the toddler Puyi (he gets the movie poster all for himself!), is a delight to the eye and has remarkable acting chops for someone so young. John Lone brings the many internal conflicts, flaws, weaknesses, aspirations and virtues of both young and old Puyi to life. Joan Chen is perfect as the Empress who understands the situation better than her husband but is helpless because she is a woman. Vivian Wu, as Puyi's second consort, makes the best of the limited screen time she gets. Peter O'Toole, as teenage Puyi's mentor, is good as ever. Maggie Han deserves a special mention for making the character of Eastern Jewel, a real life Japanese spy whose life story merits a movie of its own, stand out given that she has very few lines. The only weak link in the acting department is Tao Wu (15 year Puyi).This movie does not make the mistake of treating the Orient as something exotic, something which Hollywood is often guilty of doing. The mores, traditions and beliefs of the people, place and time portrayed in the movie have been well researched and it was shot on location in the Forbidden City scenes. Together they add up to give an authentic feel to the movie. It is a movie that richly deserves its Academy Award for Best Picture.",9,3,3,19 July 2014
Back to the Future Part II," As Good As the First Movie
","I was a little apprehensive about this film. How could it possibly stand up to the first Back to the Future movie. But Back to the Future Part II is every bit as good as the first one and takes the franchise further. It begins where the previous film left off, with Marty (Michael J. Fox), Doc (Christopher Lloyd) and Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue) traveling to 2015. There we meet Marty's future family and Old Biff and his grandson (both played by Thomas F. Wilson) and see many futuristic gadgets. However, by a curious turn of events, Marty and Doc have to travel back to 1955, the same year Marty traveled to the previous day, in the first movie.The plot of this film is more complicated than the first one, with multiple time-lines in the past, present and the future. There are multiple Martys, Docs, Jennifers and Biffs at a given time. As you can see, it explores the consequences of time-travel in greater detail. But it is never confusing and as light-hearted as the first movie. It has a lot of good, intelligent comedy. It is nice to see all our favorite characters from the first movie. All the cast, with the exception of Crispin Glover and Claudia Wells, have returned, with some of them playing multiple roles. This is one sequel which I am glad they made.",10,3,4,26 August 2014
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Slasher Films can be Done Well Too
","The most terrifying situations that most people experience are nightmares. They can happen even if you are in the safety of your home and since the rules of reality do not apply to them, they can take any turn. And since they are in your own head, there is no escape. What can be worse than such a nightmare coming true? This movie adopts this premise literally. A group of parents murder a serial child killer, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund). He exerts revenge on them by haunting their children in their dreams. What these kids experience in their dreams is parallely happening to them in reality...Freddy Krueger is an iconic villain today and he has spawned numerous sequels and cross-overs, all for good reason. He has a plausible back- story which is frightening even in real life. His mode of operation in unique. His weapon is a clawed glove, simple yet so scary. He steals the show and possibly even the audience's night-time visions with a mere seven minutes of screen time. The film does not rely much on jump scares though there are a few. It creates a tension-heavy atmosphere and plays more on psychological fear. The narrative is simple and coherent. For those who want to see gore, there is some of that too. The film suffers from two major drawbacks. First, most of the acting is hammy especially by Langenkamp. But, this could be due to the fact that it is a slasher film, a genre not well-respected and it is of low budget. They could probably not afford the right kind of actors, though they roped in the then unknown Johnny Depp. Second, the ending looks like a cheap trick to exact one last scare from us and/or pave way for a sequel. I read that the director, Wes Craven wanted to have a different ending and was persuaded to alter it by the producer, Shaye. Craven's idea sounds much better and he should have stuck to that. A memorable film none-the-less.",8,5,6,24 August 2014
Back to the Future," A Refreshing Take on Time-Travel
","Time travel and the possibilities it offered, of altering the past, knowing the future, meeting people/beings from the future, has always fascinated people. Renowned authors from H.G Wells and Isaac Asimov to Charles Dickens have given their interpretation of time-travel. Hollywood too brought out movies like Terminator and the Star Trek franchise. They had all used it on a grand scale, to explore things like ethics and/or future societies. Nobody thought of placing it in a simple high-school setting and using it to comic effect until Back to the Future came along.A teenager, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally transported to 1955 (which is 30 years ago since the present day for this movie is 1985). There he interferes with the moment his high-school-age parents meet, to fall in love later, thereby endangering his own existence. To prevent that from happening, Marty has to play match-maker to his parents. What we have is a very entertaining comedy full of enjoyable characters like the eccentric scientist, Doc (Christopher Lloyd), the school bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson) and his sidekicks, Marty's parents, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) and George (Crispin Glover) and the school principal Strickland (James Tolkan). It also manages to have a few tense moments towards the end. It's funny, it's intelligent, and it expands the scope of time-travel by focusing on smaller events.",10,5,7,27 August 2014
