Moneyball," Too many dramatic pauses, slow. For die-hard baseball fans only.
","I liked the idea of the film, I like Brad Pitt as an actor, and I love IT and statistics, and I love sport, so this film had all the ingredients for me right? Wrong... This was a much-laboured film, that could and should have progressed at 150% the speed at least. There were far too many self-indulgent shots of Brad Pitt from afar trying to evoke thought and understanding, it just didn't work, at least not for me. For the last hour, I wanted to know the outcome, but I also wanted to put the film on 2X speed, because there was simply no tempo. Even the excellent Seymour-Hoffman was unable to shine with a small part in this forgettable film. Without Pitt, I would have given this film a 2/10..",4,3,5,9 July 2012

","Not wanting to give anything away, I was disappointed with this film, some may find it clever, surreal, compelling etc. I just found it dull and despite great performances, notably from Michael Keaton, it was simply not enjoyable. I get the idea, the camera-work is original and clever, it makes you feel a combination of being next to~ the character, and being the character, but being clever does not mean a film is enjoyable. If that means I have 'missed the point', 'don't understand' etc. then so be it. My advice is, if you want to enjoy great acting, and a plot line, then watch 'There will be blood', now that was enjoyable.",5,3,9,20 January 2015
