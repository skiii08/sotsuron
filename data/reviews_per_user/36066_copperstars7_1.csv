Requiem for a Dream," an amazing performance
","Few movies in my life have I watched and then sat and just thought about it. Not just wheather or not I liked it, but thought about what i have just seen. I don't think this that kind of movie you can say you liked or didn't. There was nothing in it too like. Though it was an amazing film. I thought it might be another glorified movie about the drug world. I myself live in the world of heroin and weed. I watched it with my friends who have exsperienced drugs, and was astonished by each of their reactions. This film is more than for entertainment, and it's not even a anti drug film. It's just so out there, it forces it's self on you with its haunting music and very intresting camera work to feel so...overwhelmed. I like that though. There is never a point when I think ok, this is where everyone should laugh or cry, or turn away. It really let everyone take it thier own way, I cherish when I film can do that. The film literly brought me and the boys around me to tears. My one friend said it was the scarriest movie he had ever seen, and it is scary. I actually have seen many of times, and can say, everytime I watch it it still haunts me. Maybe bacause I have seen people's lives fall apart becaue of drug abuse, loneliness, and just nieve stupidity. I was very intrested by the fact it portrayed addiction in pill form. Few movies really get into how easily and intense pill popping can be. An Ellen was fabulous. She looked like s**t. The fat pack was kind of obvious, but a very well done performance. You really feel for her, and her  stupidity. You want her to be on tv, but scream at her  for being so nieve. Lonliness will bring people to their ends. As seen, Lonnliness is defintly more than an emotion, it is a chemical embalence that will cause you to do things you would never do. Im glad it ended, not with a dramtic death to all the characters but more a much more realist ending. In life the truth is few die, but most never recover. This is defintly something you should see. Not to see a movie to brag about, or to sit and discuse with freinds. But just to see. I can promise weather you like it or not, you will never forget the images, or the wonderful score. As with each film Darren makes, I am left with questions, that I like not being answered.",Null,0,1,6 July 2002
