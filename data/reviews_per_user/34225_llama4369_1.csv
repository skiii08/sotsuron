Hereditary," Yeah, it's nothing special.
","Look, it's not that bad either. You can spend some time with this movie if you have nothing else to do. It's not the best thing you've ever layed your eyes upon. There are worst things in life. However, the ending is as bad as it's with the Ritual movie (or VVitch). As if the ending doesn't have to be as strong as the build up. On the contrary, it has to overshadow all the horror that superceeded it.
This ending is as if someone phoned it in, after beeing asked to wrap up the script, and fast. Collette solely carried this project on her shoulders. 'Paimon' is a joke. He should be in Disney movies. I like Shapiro, curious about where her career goes.",5,1,3,1 October 2018
