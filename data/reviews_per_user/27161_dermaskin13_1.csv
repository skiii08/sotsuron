Iron Man 3," Good popcorn Film, whats the fuss
","May be a spoiler or two*I enjoyed this movie for what it was. i had no expectations. and perhaps thats why i liked this film much more than the other reviewers. Now i want to preface this by saying i love the escapism and distraction movies offer. you name it, i've probably watched it, but COME on guys and gals. lighten up! y'all acting like you don't know the machine that is Hollywood. So it didn't follow the original book. whats new. it was still entertaining. I started to wonder while reading some of these reviews if they were from people who didn't get the part' or disgruntled people somehow attached to the movie as it really wasn't bad. I've seen worse and worse remakes. wanna talk comic book i was not overly interested in health ledgers joker , only getting such raves because he died. Jack Nicholson did it better, but such is the Hollywood machine. Look, the comedy seemed to me in all the right places. nerd turned psycho suave villain believable in his obsessive 'you will see me now' revenge and the one, two one- two with the kid was fun addition it did seem to move the plot forward and appeal to kids and yes, toy manufactures rub their hands with delight but i can see how the leads who all have kiddies prob pushed for this inclusion but i digress. stop looking into things not worth looking into turn your critical eye on the political machine and stop allowing the brain melt of Hollywood to distract you from more important issue. AlsoI cant help but be surprised at how many people got on here to review this movie with such passion of opinion and i cant help wonder if these same people are taking the time to complain about the money they lose on electing people to power who aren't looking out for their best interests and it sickens me that these same type of reviewers petitioned and raised money to get a veronica mars movie made with an actress whose long since retired the role. gross misdirection of people power and money.",9,2,8,3 May 2013
