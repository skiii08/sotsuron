United 93," A Chilling Film
","United 93 was the first movie released that dared tackle the all-too-sensitive subject of September 11th. It went under an immense amount of controversy; some felt that it was too soon to release a film about such a horrific national tragedy. Despite the initial criticism, however, United 93 manages to handle such a delicate subject gracefully and poignantly, creating a unique cinematic experience that is nearly impossible to rival.United 93 tells the powerful and emotional story of the only hijacked flight on September 11th that failed to reach its intended target. The film switches between air traffic controllers and the passengers/crew of the ill-fated flight. The film delves into the human experiences aboard the flight in a tasteful manner: instead of relying on big-budget effects shots as one might expect for such a massive event, director Paul Greengrass effectively uses a documentary-style approach, creating an unparalleled sense of realism that deeply adds to the emotional punch this film offers.This film literally gave me chills. It's suspenseful, heartbreaking, and emotional at the same time. You'll forget you're watching a movie during it: the actors and the crew have collaborated beautifully to created a unique experience that will haunt you for a long time afterwards. This film is certainly not one to be missed by anyone.Rating: 9/10 (Excellent)",9,1,2,30 January 2007
