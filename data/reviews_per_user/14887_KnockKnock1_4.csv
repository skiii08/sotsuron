Blade Runner 2049," Good visuals yet boring story.
","I saw the original long ago while on honeymoon in Europe. I've probably only seen it once since then and maybe I'm missing parts of the story, but this film didn't really make any sense. Here comes the plot.Ryan Gosling plays K a replicant blade runner whose job is to hunt down older generation replicants (nexus 6). I think the movie said he was a nexus 8, a version safer and more compliant. For most of the movie K robotically carries out his orders in a passionless unemotional way. This makes sense since he is a robot, but its really boring to watch.He tracks a nexus 6 replicant down on some out of the way place, 'retires him'. While on site K finds remains that are discovered to be that of a Female replicant. The body has bone damage consistent with a rudimentary attempt at a C Section. It's assumed the attempt killed her. Its also assumed that since she was buried, it was probably friends that did it. Enemies wouldn't bother being so respectful.Central computer records show that she had twins. How they could figure that out just from bones is anyone's guess. Since such a birth happened in a black market part of town you would think such information would be hidden by the surviving nexus 6 that were harboring the deceased Woman. The records show the twin girl died, but the twin boy survived.K then presumes he is that boy. Turns out he is wrong. He suddenly gets emotional about it, which doesn't make sense. I understand this film explores the difference between human and robot, but is just out of place and feels forced. Speaking of feeling forced, the visuals and music also seems similarly contrived. I don't like it when movies try to trick me into feeling a certain way.Eventually K finds Dekkard (Harrison Ford) who confirms that the pregnant Woman was actually a replicant called Rachel. This of course means a miracle happen. A replicant actually gave birth, something hitherto thought impossible. Suddenly for the first time ever in the movie an action scene happens when the bad guys want to capture Dekkard. K suddenly decides to disobey his own programming and saves Dekkard. He introduces Dekkard to a young woman, who he believes is the missing twin girl. She happens to be Dekkard and Rachel's daughter. The End.This movie was quite boring. I think it went for almost three hours. You could probably cut out an hour and the simple slightly confusing plot would still work. Something would be gained though, the film would flow better and be more entertaining. The plot dances around things that happened earlier; hunting down Nexus 6, some sort of rebellion, etc etc but none of that is in this movie. It should have been, it would have made this a better film. Maybe they'll do a reboot later and clear up all the confusion. I voted this movie a 5 out of 10.",Null,4,9,8 October 2017
American Hustle," Mediocre film about nothing.
","This was a self important bore fest. The plot was boring. The music and glitzy camera work tried to make it seem important, but putting a silk hat on a pig still makes it a pig. The standout performance was Michael Pena who is usually great in everything and Amy Adams who is probably the best American actress working today. Jennifer Lawrence looked like she was spending more energy in angling for the soap opera limelight than actually focusing on her character and Bale looked as bored as I felt watching this drivel. All of the characters were irredeemable. I didn't want them to succeed, I wanted to see them fail. It was just so contrived and half-baked. There are far better films worth your time.",Null,1,3,19 October 2017
Identity," Excellent taut who done it with a twist
","This is an excellent film from a solid director at the top of his game. Most attempts at making a 'twist film' fall flat on their face; This is one of the great ones. It's greatness lies in it's simplicity and the way in which it very compellingly weaves thrills, scares and exposition within the film's strong taut structure, leading to a surprising and satisfying conclusion.The actors are all uniformly brilliant. Ray Liotta again is absolutely a standout performer as he was in Goodfellas for which he was rightly lauded for and John Cusack's brilliant turn makes us wish he had put in a similar performance in his more recent outings since.I won't ruin it for you, but if you like thrillers, or just compelling stories in the Thriller genre, just watch it. Watch it now! 8/10",Null,4,5,19 January 2016
Valkyrie," The best Hitler Bomb Plot Movie I've seen.
","There's probably a foreign language (German) film that is far superior, but I think this is probably the best Hollywood attempt at this interesting subject matter. I went and saw this at the cinema, not for Tom Cruise, but because I've seen a few documentaries on the subject. This movie of course stretches credibility in parts, but let's be honest the primary reason for movies is to entertain. You want enlightenment, go read a book or watch a documentary on the subject.I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, but he is excellent in roles where he is being pushed by unseen forces. He's able to create a level of tension that is believable. For proof of this, doubters can go watch The Firm, as well as the first and best Mission Impossible.",Null,2,3,20 January 2016
