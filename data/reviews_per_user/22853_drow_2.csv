The Blair Witch Project," Good college project, but a major movie? somehow it works
","I have never seen a movie make someone puke due to motion sickness,  but this movie did it!As for being 'the most scary movie ever!'  I don't think so,but it certainly has a shot of giving Rocky Horror Picture Show for midnight cult showings if not higher,See it, on video.",7,1,2,22 August 1999
Once Upon a Time in America," It's the DeNiro Mob movie you may not have heard of but must see immediately
","Imagine if no one had heard of the Godfather, then you'll understand this film.  I'm not saying its better than the godfather, it had its problems. The plot was hard for me to fully appreciate or understand the first time I watched it but it came around soon enough.  This film is about a group of kids raised in the gutter.  These friends band to together and form their own crime racket along with an undying bond of loyalty that is too be pushed to its max. The main character, Noodles, unlike many other mob movies, is not the don or the brains, but instead is the heart.  After paying his debt to society Noodles returns to see his friends have gained a nice little slice of the illegal actions of the twenties.  Soon the repeal of prohibition comes knocking along with possible betrayal, which leads to a long going mystery of what really happened. As those who are alive to rehash the happening are also left to figure it out.",10,1,3,11 May 1999
