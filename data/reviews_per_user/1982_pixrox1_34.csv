Despicable Me 2," Not as bad as some cartoon sequels . . .
",". . . such as CARS 2. Of course, any flick featuring the lovable minions has a leg up on the competition to begin with. As a bad guy gone good, the balding Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) visually puts one in mind of Bruce Willis, only funnier. Further, this feature ends with the most memorable cartoon wedding since UP, so it has a lot going for it. With songs that are passable and jokes which occasionally hit the funny bone, there are probably worse ways to spend 98 minutes (such as attending home games of the Miami Marlins, which are liable to run that long and more--you even have to pay for parking!). Also, did I mention the minions? In this second outing, some of them become what is listed in the credits as 'evil minions,' which implies that minions are born good (an arguable point). Having good and bad minions works better here than in the most similar flick out this summer, SMURFS 2, in which the Smurfette character is partially corrupted. Which means we have a lot of fun coming up next year, when the minions headline their own feature. Can't wait!",8,0,0,29 August 2013
Vertigo," 'I don't care any more about me . . . '
",". . . and craven coward John 'Scottie' Ferguson (played here by James Stewart, in perhaps the most reprehensible role during his long film career as the Tom Hanks of his day) sure as heck doesn't give two hoots about the woman he's tossing away like a used facial tissue, either. Nor does Judy-from-Kansas' previous sugar daddy, John's college chum Gavin, who has foisted her off upon John in an overly complicated plot to help himself to an ahead-of-its-time no-fault divorce. John, a completely amoral 'whited sepulcher,' has no qualms about putting it to Judy when she's masquerading as Gavin's troubled wife, Madeleine. But as soon as John realizes that he is NOT having kinky hand-me-down sex with Gavin's actual discarded spouse, he scrapes Judy out of his life like 'Doggie Doo-Doo' on the bottom of his shoe, with the help of the Catholic Church in the guise of a nun who 'thought she heard voices.' The latter woman intones 'God have mercy'--as surely no one on the Corrupt Coast ever had had when poor deluded Judy was still alive--to close out this overwrought 'sex mystery' (to use director Alfred Hitchcock's later genre description of MARNIE). Judy\'Madeleine's' downfall was never realizing she was living among the morally bankrupt, and coming to grips with the fact that she definitely 'was not in Kansas anymore'!",8,1,3,7 September 2013
Skyfall," Oh, Mother! Not Voldemort!
","Not content with doing in beloved Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, Ralph Fiennes decides that everyone's favorite 'M'--Dame Judi Dench--is an anachronism; since there's no one who can watch the watchers safely, the world would be safer without any watchers at all, he concludes. On the one hand, Fiennes' 'Mallory' character is correct. On the other, he weasels his way into M's shoes. However, this James Bond outing literally returns to Agent 007's roots, reintroducing the 'Q' role after a two-film absence, along with another 'Miss Moneypenny' (who fires at Bond first, and flirts later). The 'Bond. James Bond.' line is revived, as well, and the Bond Martini is worked in more effectively than in QUANTUM OF SOLACE. For the first time, Daniel Craig is joking as James VI, with his ejection seat jibe at M particularly funny. SKYFALL spoofs London's version of the 9-11 attacks (when the 'Tube' blew up in 3 1/2 spots (July 7, 2005), proving that the English are less thin-skinned than the Americans (even though Javier Bardem's 'Silva' character shows they're still far behind in dentistry). They also employ less lethal suicide pills than those used by the Third Reich, resulting in about two dozen dead MI6 agents, along with countless random civilians. In SKYFALL, Bond cannot protect his lover (nothing new), but also loses his boss\foster mom, his ancestral home, his town house, and a classic car that Jay Leno would die for. Bottom line: terrorists take the cake here, and eat it, too!",8,4,6,10 November 2014
Iron Man 3," Something the previous 827 reviews haven't said yet . . .
",". . . though after reading 750 or so, I must admit I may have started skimming them a little, is that the zoning board should require Tony Stark to rebuild his cliff-side ocean view mansion on the EAST coast for IRON MAN 4, since that would take the debris from its inevitable destruction by any two-bit terrorist who has a whim to play dirty TO EUROPE, rather than having it bottled up on America's Pacific Ocean coastline, mixing with the expected additional years' worth of Japanese tsunami debris (I saw EMPORER recently, but I still cannot fathom why five or six-star American Gen. Douglas MacArthur did not foresee such a contingency during his tenure as Emporer of Japan, and mandate a RETAINING WALL be built off the U.S.-side edges of those islands so that our National Park Service beaches in Hawaii, Alaska, California, and elsewhere would not be bombarded by millions of tons of trash each time the well-documented fault zones throw another spray of water on Asia's version of Florida). I would have liked IRON MAN 3 even better if it was Gandhi calling the shots against America's hero, since Gandhi's voice sounded so cool in the preview!",8,0,3,2 June 2013
World War Z," The idea here seems to be pretty original, though . . .
",". . . the execution of that idea occasionally comes up short, mainly through action sequences that are totally implausible. However, with American movies since 1960, there is a clause in the fine print regulating movie goers practice of suspending their disbelief. This clause states that for every ten million dollars in a flick's budget that exceeds the $50 million threshold, the movie's producers are allowed to include one ludicrous scene that could be dismissed as jarringly illogical by any viewer older than six. Since the budget for WORLD WAR Z has been estimated by industry experts at around $170 mill, this flick is entitled make you shout 'they did NOT just do that' a dozen times. By staying within that framework (unlike, say, a FAST & FURIOUS film), WORLD WAR Z deserves kudos for artistic restraint, as well as meriting the right to be taken seriously. It is better than THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL remake, and more original than CLOVERFIELD. Though fast zombies, angry zombies, or super-smart zombies always seem illogical, the infected folks here are as much body-snatcher victims as zombies, and if a sequel is made (what's the next letter after 'Z'?), perhaps the origin story will be better explained (oh yeah, a prequel could be called WORLD WAR Y).",9,2,4,8 August 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek junior still in search of . . .
",". . . intelligent life, as the premise behind the carnage done by a HUMAN bad guy--Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison, a.k.a. Khan--is thin and unoriginal. Meanwhile, half the crew of the Starship Whatever look like they're ready to audition for HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 4. Chris Pine as a young Captain Kirk clearly is the pick of the litter, but in this company that might not be saying much. Experienced movie actor Simon Pegg is adequate in holding down the part of Scottie, but why they heck did the folks planning the story arc for the STAR TREK movie franchise 'reset' NOT exercise more imagination, and delay some of the key characters from joining the crew for a few installments, taking the opportunity to establish OTHER key characters NOT in previous Trek incarnations (who would, of course, be more easily expendable than Spock, Scottie, Bones, Uhuru, etc.)? Furthermore, just as in G.I. JOE: RETALIATION, INTO DARKNESS begins with the platoon crying in their beers about the deaths of some extras playing colleagues in sister (Star Fleet, here) units, while totally glossing over continents of dead people left by later assaults on humanity in general. This callous disregard for reality (who's to bury all these dead folks??) seriously flaws many of this summer's so-called blockbusters, from OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN and WHITE HOUSE DOWN to IRON MAN 3 and WORLD WAR Z. So it goes.",7,0,2,3 July 2013
The Book Thief," What if they had a Holocaust, and only Disney reported it?
","THE BOOK THIEF is from Fox 2000 Pictures, part of a conglomerate that is not known for its sensitivity to Jewish Issues. If the Disney people actually HAD adapted THE BOOK THIEF to the film medium, it could not have looked more 'sanitized' than director Brian Percival's vision here. The main characters in THE BOOK THIEF are mostly blonds, under the gun because they have Communist parents (an even bigger anathema to Fox than the Chosen People), they don't want to pay dues to the Nazi Party, or merely because they can run faster than the school bully. Unlike THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK, wherein the hidden Jews must be quiet as church mice and they're not even in Germany, those in THE BOOK THIEF somehow evade the Gestapo's notoriously meticulous record keeping in a major German city for YEARS, having snowball fights, writing novels, playing Jewish musical instruments, and building snowmen in their basements. The fact that post-war surveys indicated upwards of 90% of ordinary German civilian men and women actively collaborated in, knew of, and supported the extermination of six million Jews, apparently ALL the 'good' Germans were concentrated into the one street where most of THE BOOK THIEF takes place. As the uniformed Nazi soldier tenderly carries the wounded main character to safety toward the end of the 131-minute film (only the last 10 minutes of which resembles a war movie at all, in which MILLIONS of so-called Christian German civilians ALSO died), one wonders which movie has the most pristine German Nazi Swastica flags--THE BOOK THIEF or Hitler's old favorite, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL? Unlike the recent Kate Winslet WWII flick, THE READER (another literary-focused look at the Holocaust, like DIARY and THIEF), this movie is more suitable for kids 10 and under. While it may not teach them to appreciate the hardships and horror of War, it could instill more respect for the joys of reading.",8,6,20,25 November 2013
Interstellar," Is this flick really about space exploration . . .
",". . . or is it more of a high-tech remake of 1960's THE TIME MACHINE? That is only one of many questions raised by INTERSTELLAR (beginning with, 'Is it really so easy to drive a rusted-out Dodge Ram pick-up truck on flat tires through green, roof-high corn stalks?'). Conflating galaxy-connecting worm holes with galaxy-destroying black holes is the least of INTERSTELLAR's brazen pseudo-science. Giving the Astronaut Cooper character the ability to travel back decades in time, by-passing all the Eloi-munching Morlocks, and then communicating with his daughter via a wristwatch that doesn't look very dust resistant (and which has been on a shelf all that time, in the Superbowl of Dust) may strain the belief of some viewers. Furthermore, since Astronaut Romilly knew in advance that he'd be alone in the mother-ship while his buddies were gone a decade or two, why didn't he keep the gray out by setting his sleep capsule on the 'hibernate indefinitely' setting used by Matt Damon's 'Dr. Mann'? The characters here state that humans were used for this mission rather than robots exclusively because the former improvise better. But you don't see C3PO wrestling R2D2 at the drop of a space helmet as each new frontier is reached in STAR WARS. (This is NOT the case for the people of INTERSTELLAR.) So give me those old time robots, give me those old time robots, give me those old time robots, they were good enough for Luke!",9,1,4,12 November 2014
Man of Steel," 'Iron Man' and 'Man of Steel' are synonymous . . .
",". . . since virtually everyone uses the words 'iron' and 'steel' as interchangeable terms. The 2013 movie MAN OF STEEL is perfect in every way, EXCEPT that its producers must be docked at least one point on a scale of 10 for trying to confuse the market for America's favorite super hero with that of some johnny-come-lately with an ethnic alter ego (i.e., 'Tony Stark'). Nothing could sound more solidly American than 'Clark Kent.' While it's true that 'man of steel' MAY have been used once or twice during the 1900s as a nickname for Superman, Babe Ruth had nicknames, too, such as 'Sultan of Swat.' But all the movies made about George Herman Ruth were given straight forward titles such as 'THE BABE' or 'THE BABE RUTH STORY,' and nobody tried to steal National League fans by tagging a Ruth Bio-Pic with a title such as 'Hammering Herman!' Yet Warner Brothers apparently called this flick MAN OF STEEL in the lame hope that Marvel Comics fan boys would mistake it for IRON MAN 4! This is so stupid on their part! D.C. Comics fan boys and Marvel Orcs are like the Sharks and the Jets, and no Hollywood tomfoolery will change that fact. Plus, you do NOT want them in the same theater. What is Warner Brothers trying to do--start WWIII??!!",9,1,7,6 August 2013
Ender's Game," This kid's crusade . . .
",". . . may appeal to a slightly older age group than the upcoming Lego flick, but not by much. ENDER'S GAME posits that Han Solo and Ghandi have gone senile, and decided to put the fate of all mankind in the hands of the toughest kid they can find. Furthermore, they do not bother to tell the kid that the lives of 'a thousand' unseen extras--grown men--are at the mercy of whatever rash decision the child makes in what the adults emphasize is only a 'training exercise.' The alien threat is totally stolen from the original STARSHIP TROOPERS (and TROOPERS author Robert Heinlein), but the only acknowledgment of this plagiarism is a scene in which the adults in the room emphasize that the showers are NOT unisex (as was the case with the forward-thinking TROOPERS), presumably because these child actors are so young they required THREE studio teachers, and ripping off that aspect of TROOPERS would be tantamount to 'kiddie porn.' Still, this derivative piece--while nice to look at in spots--will strain the credulity of anyone over the age of 8 (which constitutes a 3-year edge on the Lego Movie).",7,1,6,4 November 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," If 17 minutes of padding lops a rating point off its . . .
",". . . theatrical release, dropping THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN from an '8' down to just a '7,' how many MORE minutes of boring outtakes would be needed to push VIRGIN below '5' territory? Less than half an hour, I'd wager, as the quality of each scrap scraped off the cutting room floor and spliced back into this 'Unrated' Extended Edition is by definition lower than the previous remnant. Soon the flavor of the original humor becomes so diluted by the third- and fourth-string ad libs and other pap that the viewer begins to wonder how they ever were able to stomach this increasingly thin gruel in the first place. Good film editors always have operated on the theory that 'less is more.' If GONE WITH THE WIND had 'Picturized' Margaret Mitchell's entire novel, Scarlett O'Hara would have had a lot more kids underfoot, theater managers would have needed another intermission or two for the sake of maintaining dry seats, and the resulting eight-hour epic would be as forgotten today as Erich Von Stroheim's GREED. As a miniseries, VIRGIN leaves a lot to be desired.",7,0,0,16 November 2014
The Lego Movie," This movie shows what every mom knows:
","Dad's the bad guy. Maybe not every dad is exactly like Will Ferrell toward the end of THE LEGO MOVIE, with a hoard of 7.5 million plastic bricks Krazy glued together into 82 skyscrapers and scores of other objects filling the basement, surrounded by 36 'Do Not Touch' signs meant for Mom and their kids. But very few dads fail to spend huge chunks of their family's budgets on their metaphorical Own Private Lego Lands (whether it's collectible beer cans, trout fishing flies, vinyl records, comic books & action figures in their original shrink-wrapped boxes, etc.). The average dad cordons off large swaths or entire rooms of family living space for their time- and money-consuming 'hobbies,' while tattooing 'Do Not Touch' signs on the hearts of the rest of their family members. Well, it's time for Moms to lead a Rebellion! Take your little ones to see THE LEGO MOVIE; then storm Dad's citadel, touching everything! Touch touch touch touch touch touch touch!!

Now You See Me," Magicians hold grudges . . .
",". . . so if you watch NOW YOU SEE ME, you will know how to view your local magician. Some of the more recent movie magicians I've seen have not treated those around them very well. One flick featured a codger illusionist doing the finger-in-the-guillotine 'trick'--but he had a mental lapse and CUT OFF ANOTHER CODGER'S DIGIT FOR REAL!! Another such show ended with the trickster murdering a mountain of magically cloned guys. Yet another destroyed a library in Ann Arbor, Michigan. NOW YOU SEE ME advances the stereotype of magicians as really dangerous people even further. A bank is robbed which does not even have FDIC insurance! (For the financially illiterate, that means that customers lose some or all of their savings account money!) The FBI is tricked into spending billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer involuntary 'donations' in a futile pursuit of joyriding rogue illusionists. Magicians make mayhem on the freeways, with countless people injured and property-damaged. Unlike the victimized zombies in WORLD WAR Z, these illusionists have no excuse for wreaking havoc. NOW YOU SEE ME makes a great case for OUTLAWING MAGICIANS!",7,0,1,15 July 2013
Gone with the Wind," 'I'm afraid now - - I'm afraid of dying . . . '
","' . . . and going to Hell.' So says Katie Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy soon-to-tack-on Butler, and well she should be. After gunning down one of Abe Lincoln's Black-slave-liberators in his face and using her own visage NOT to launch 1,000 ships (A La Helen of Troy) but rather the Ku Klux Klan, Ms. O'Hara embodies everything Satanic. Starting with the opening title quote from Margaret Mitchell's apartheid source material to Scarlett's constant abuse of every African American who comes within shouting or beating range of her, this movie is the American equivalent to Germany's 1930s propaganda masterpiece, TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. Tragically, THE WIZARD OF OZ--jobbed out by WIND for 1939's 'Best Picture' Oscar--probably would have been an even better movie if WIND producer David O. Selznick had not kidnapped Oz director Victor Fleming from the Emerald City and literally driven him into a mental institution by foisting upon him the impossible task of attempting to bring coherence to this misogynistic marathon melodrama. The best way to experience WIND is simply by listening to a CD of composer Max Steiner's outstanding score.",3,3,13,6 November 2013
Frozen," 'Some people are worth melting for . . . '
",". . . and so are some cartoons. By far the best animated feature of 2013, its preview hardly did FROZEN justice (focussing as it did on a trio of comic relief characters, including the enchanting snowman Olaf, who provided my summary quotation). Most of the songs here are Princess Classics, and though the African Choir-style opening and closing piece or the jazzy mid-movie duet may be a bit jarring in contrast, nothing can detract very much from the stunning visuals of FROZEN. With famed Scandanavian story teller Hans Christian Andersen ('The Snow Queen') providing source material, the plot is gripping enough and the villain emerges so late that even adults should be entranced. The balance between the comic, the clever, and the heart-felt is near-perfect. Coupled with the imaginative Pre-feature short 'GET A HORSE,' Disney has kicked off the holiday season with a hearty 'Ho-ho-ho!'",10,7,17,5 December 2013
22 Jump Street," In this prequel to 535 JUMP STREET:
",". . . ELECTORAL COLLEGE, Schmidt breaks the Ice with Captain Cube's family while Jenko basks in gridiron glory. There might be more to the plot of 22 JUMP STREET than that, but few in my audience would have noticed a plot unless it bit them on their noses. About half of this movie is devoted to making fun of sequels, and most of the other half is a discussion of the latest fashions in political correctness. Since 22 JUMP STREET positions itself as a comedy, cast and crew go out of their way to avoid anything that smacks of reality. There are many crude moments in 22 JUMP STREET, one of which comes AFTER ALL the credits, when the theater workers are squirming around getting antsy to clean up all the crap abandoned many minutes earlier by the departing majority of the audience. However, the two minutes of the DUMB AND DUMBER TO trailer shown before 22 JUMP STREET contained twice as much gross material as the latter feature's entire 112-minute running time. Showing some women's sex toys is about as risqué as 22 JUMP STREET gets.",8,1,5,14 June 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Since everyone else at my showing walked out . . .
",". . . of our theater before PIRATES #5's most important scene, I will try to write a synopsis of it as faithfully as possible. (Those reviewers who've posted elsewhere that this minute-long bit--which follows ALL of the 2,341 names listed in the closing credits--recasts Kermit-the-Frog as Captain Jack Sparrow in a teaser for PIRATES #6, or that Bill Nighy and Johnny Depp are joining forces with IRON- and SPIDERMEN for an upcoming AVENGERS outing, are flat-out LYING, probably because they walked out of PIRATES #5 early, too!) The post-credits scene of DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES--NOT subject to the Ratings Board Censors since it trails the MPAA approval number (50908)--begins with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley getting busy in bed. As things start to heat up between this aging pair, ominous music and sinister shadows telegraph the approach of a Sex Pervert Voyeur to savvy fans of Slasher Flicks. Just as the O - K Duo are reaching a climactic Happy Ending, the camera pulls back to reveal (SPOILER ALERT!!!)--:--silhouetted geriatric Mickey Mouse Ears! If there is anything worse than a Dirty Old Man, surely it must be a Dirty Old Rodent!!",7,0,3,12 June 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," 'Down came the rain . . . '
","' . . . and washed this spider up.' One pretty much expects Bond Girls to die. Every time Agent 007 gets hitched, his bride catches a bullet almost before the wedding bouquet is tossed. But when a movie's heroes are perky high school kids, movie goers expect more longevity than that enjoyed by Bond Gals. It's depressing enough when teens turn out to have their whole lives BEHIND them on Graduation Day in real life. Film escapism demands that trailers or previews must provide at least a kernel of truth-in-advertising. You expect teens to die in CARRIE, because the previews explicitly show that it's a horror flick. (Even Harry Potter's hapless 'Cedric Diggory' character is a pretty minor plot sacrifice, thus no exception to this rule.) Teens are the number one demographic for movie multiplexes, so responsible exhibitors should refrain from biting the hand that feeds them. High schoolers also are the most easily influenced film fans. Ever since the rash of suicides and suicides-by-cop inspired by the 1950s film REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, Hollywood studios have made an implicit pact with parents NOT to blindside them with another wolf in sheep's clothing like REBEL. However, AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 is in clear violation of this understanding. Therefore, it can be rated '8' for college kids, but deserves a cautionary 4-out-of-10 for your impressionable high schoolers.",8,27,45,12 May 2014
Big Hero 6," In a plot that would do any Pokemon flick proud . . .
",". . . kids build robots to save the world. BIG HIRO SIX plays around with time travel, too, much like INTERSTELLAR. If you have little ones, you may wish to know which movie has more death scenes--BIG HIRO SIX or INTERSTELLAR? When you count presumed off-screen demises, it probably comes out pretty close to a tie. But, since the latter feature is about an hour longer, the wee ones may get more nap time bang-for-your-buck with the space fantasy than they would with this cartoon. Another obvious question is which of these two films feature the most realistic science? Here the answer probably is BIG HIRO SIX, and certainly its assumptions are far less controversial. (Polls prove many if not most Americans think 'global warming' is a bogus concept--particularly when New York gets eight feet of snowfall in a couple days--and nothing to worry about; INTERSTELLAR does not have a leg to stand on without this alleged straw Bogie Man.) Though the FEAST short coupled with HIRO's theatrical release is more of a heart-warming and better film on a minute-for-minute basis, HIRO is heroic, too.",9,3,21,22 November 2014
Evil Dead," But where was He Who Must Not Be Named?
","Back in 1981, when the original EVIL DEAD was unearthed in a Tennessee cabin, there was no Tom Riddle, let alone Voldemort. But now that we live in a post-V world, it seemingly is incumbent upon any film director who undertakes a remaking of a horror classic about evil spirits to do so in the contemporary context. Nobody in their right mind would do a shot-for-shot remake of a beloved scream fest such as, say, PSYCHO, without extensive updating to reflect how the world has evolved on the scary front in the decades since the original first saw the light of the silver screen (which often is perforated with holes even nowadays, because the sound had to come THROUGH the screen from two giant loudspeakers mounted directly BEHIND the white space in the late 1920s). Just think what a thrill it could have been if one of the characters in the EVIL DEAD remake was interrupted halfway through the act of cutting her own tongue in half by Voldemort knocking on her door, and she couldn't even call out 'Come in!' because of her tongue trauma.",7,3,15,22 April 2013
Elysium," This shows our near future . . .
",". . . when the top 1% of 'job creators' (propaganda speak for 'slave masters') achieve their goal of stealing 99% of the world's wealth from the rest of us. (No, Virginia, there is NOT a Santa Claus who magically pulls another million dollars out of thin air each time a baby is born: Life is a zero sum game, in which riches are finite; if riches were infinite, stealing them would bring absolutely no joy to rich people!) The world of ELYSIUM may seem decades off to Fox News ditto-heads, but to anyone not drunk on the suicide Kool-Aid, ELYSIUM could come as soon as 2017. As documented here, our future world will increase the boundaries between the 1% and everyone else, with the amoral elite perhaps moving off-planet. Most everyone else will be condemned to third world squalor, unless they are 'fortunate' enough to be hired as short-lived slaves, like Max (Matt Damon), the main character of ELYSIUM. Without union protection, when Max gets caught in a machine, the Rich Man's robot factory foreman (akin to the Overseer in 12 YEARS A SLAVE, except he lacks a whip) couldn't care less--there are plenty more expendable bodies where Max came from. Since there's a 99% chance that this is YOUR near future, PLEASE watch ELYSIUM--before it's too late for nearly ALL of us!!",8,0,2,16 November 2013
Psycho," PSYCHO is nearly a perfect movie . . .
",". . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to 'humor' screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 'Making of' mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a 'necessary evil,' feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the 'Roaring Twenties' would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum 'cooling off period' toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of 'being humored' on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!",10,1,3,6 August 2013
Mudbound," Back in the 1900s, before our grandparents were born . . .
",". . . bad things happened to a particular group of Americans, MUDBOUND reports. If MUDBOUND had played in all of the Confederate State movie theaters in the 1940s, perhaps it would have shown the grandparents of Today's KGB enablers the error of their ways. Such a more timely release of MUDBOUND may have warded off the Birmingham church bombing and Mississippi Burning, while eliminating the need for Woolworth Lunch Counter Sit-Ins, Bus Boycotts, and Bridge Battles. Possibly mandatory MUDBOUND sensitivity training sessions would have made these 1900s Southern Racists too self-conscious and ashamed to reproduce, solving the USA's 'Race Problem' once and for all. (As an added benefit, this would have allowed all of the folks speaking normal American dialects to spread out Down South, giving all of us more 'elbow room.') Unfortunately, releasing MUDBOUND three generations too late could well do more harm than good. Just as a Presidential Commission concluded that the initial version of the TV miniseries ROOTS reached back centuries to ignite dangerous 'blowback' in the late 1900s, perhaps a future White House post-mortem will conclude that MUDBOUND kicked over an even bigger hornet's nest.",8,2,6,3 March 2018
Fifty Shades of Grey," A few years ago every virginal English Lit Major lady in my dorm . . .
",". . . read THE STORY OF O or THE PEARL (NOT the one by Steinbeck!) or both by the end of her freshman year. It's a sad commentary on today's generation of self-imposed Sharia-like Puritanism that the palest plagiarism of what the Victorians read for entertainment 150 years ago raises eyebrows and not hilarious laughter today. FIFTY SHADES OF GREY might be a tad more accurate about First Edition books than the makers of THE BOY NEXT DOOR were, but the character of 'Anastasia Steele'--an alleged Romance Literature graduate so ignorant of the basics in her academic field--does not ring true. Nor do the cheap production values of this flick, which seem better suited to the BARNEY and TELETUBBIES crowd than to any serious movie goer. For instance, Anastasia attends a university in Portland, OR. But this tawdry production was thrown together in the world's knock-off capital, Vancouver, Canada. So when 'Christian Grey' gives the graduation speech to Anastasia's class, his podium is draped with a 'Vancouver' banner. (Given the kinds of consistent flaws found in EVERY let's-pretend-it's-America flick originating in Vancouver, it's doubtful they even have a community college there--none of the film crews ever have anything on the ball!) Most everything about FIFTY SHADES is equally wrong and jarring. The book implies that Christian 'punishes' Anastasia with a taste of what the soap thief got in 12 YEARS A SLAVE. But all her 'abuse' combined is less than one-tenth the trauma of one lash in SLAVE. If Bill Cosby ever needs to stand trial, his lawyers may use a FIFTY SHADES defense to argue the horrible consequences of old billionaires messing with UN-drugged young ladies.",6,2,5,17 February 2015
The Croods," Better than ICE AGE . . .
",". . . and any of those live action movies with Brendan Frazier and animals (prehistoric or modern). THE CROODS is a quite watchable flick for moms and kids, with enough plot twists and turns thrown in to keep moms guessing and enough cute animals (such as the initially scary and eventually domesticated saber toothed tiger) jumbled on-screen to rivet the attention of the littler offspring. While it is true that Nicolas Cage as dad Grug is pretty much a stereotype as an over-protective, over-traditional father, the sense of imminent danger that a similar dad has in say FIDDLER ON THE ROOF is pretty much absent here, as composer Alan Silvestri's upbeat score sort of lets every movie veteran know that nothing REALLY bad is going to occur. There are a few wrinkles the writers have dreamed up, such as the method Grug and Guy manufacture to escape the clutches of the dread tar pit, which seemingly are beyond the limits of imagination for the out-of-ideas ICE AGE screenwriters. Hopefully, we will see a CROODS 2 prior to an ICE AGE 13.",8,0,0,7 May 2013

Helen Mirren is added to the cast as a counterpart for Hogwart's new principal (after Dumbledore was ousted in a Nazi coup), Dolores Umbridge. Apparently, Imelda Staunton--who played Umbridge in HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX--was unavailable to voice her MONSTERS clone, Dean Hardscrabble, so Queen Elizabeth II--I mean, Mirren, took over in her stead. This being aimed at a younger audience than the Potter series, the threat of expulsion is about as serious of a menace as Hardscrabble can pose; there are no monster hands dripping blood from compulsory writing assignments here. The final test of the monster decathlon smacks somewhat as a parallel to the climax of HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE, as an ostensibly academic situation becomes a foray into the threatening adult world. Unlike in the Potter storyline, no students die for real here, however; everyone has a H.E.A.-type outcome.",8,1,2,13 August 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," 'Get on the horse, Pam!'
","People at my showing of SAVING MR. BANKS clapped two different times during the credits. This was unprecedented--it was like being in a theater at the end of a play. First, they clapped for the movie when the credits began; later, they applauded again for Mary Poppins creator P.L. Travers, a.k.a. 'Pam,' a.k.a. Helen Goff, when an extended tape recording from 1961 of her actual voice during the first MARY POPPINS movie planning session\impromptu childhood regression therapy hour concluded. The message of SAVING MR. BANKS is that people who suffer through unhappy childhoods--such as Helen and Walt Disney himself-- produce the best entertainment. Though this film includes extended selections from six hit songs on the MARY POPPINS soundtrack, and portrays Disney with the patience of Job in bringing this character to the big screen, the back-story starring Colin Farrell as Helen's ill-fated alcoholic dad back in Australia all but overshadows the delicate dance between Tom Hanks as Disney and Emma Thompson as Travers more than 50 years later. A spoonful of sugar may make the medicine go down, but making lemonade from lemons is at least as important.",10,7,11,26 December 2013
Moonrise Kingdom," Hatchets, and knives, and clubs--oh my!
","Early on in MOONRISE KINGDOM, as a scouting lynch mob is catching up to resigned orphan 'Sam,' this flick seems to be veering from a Stephen King STAND BY ME coming-of-age story to a LORD OF THE FLIES-type bloodbath. Young lovers are about to be Shish-Kabobbed before the consummation of their dreams by their less precocious peers. But MOONRISE KINGDOM is set in the more innocent days of 1965, when the worst fears of nonconforming kids were confined to the simple pleasures of electro-shock therapy and frontal lobotomy. Typhoons, dam breaks, and lightning strikes served merely to break the monotony of this low-stakes, ultra-safe childhood environment. These were NOT the fast times of today. Twelve-year-old Suzy has to 'sit' for her nude portraits by Sam (whereas in the 21st Century her bare Selfies could be seen from Houston to Hong Kong in a flash). Back then boys enjoyed tame pleasures such as piercing their gal pal's ear lobes with fishhook jewelry. Today's Pre-teen guys are too busy abusing the women within their video games to talk to any real girls outside the classroom. If you're missing LEAVE IT TO BEAVER, why not take a trip to MOONRISE KINGDOM?",10,0,2,4 December 2014
Rear Window," The Case of the Dog Who . . .
",". . . Knew Too Much. Director Alfred Hitchcock was well-known for having a wide heartless streak toward many of his characters, though his actual treatment of cast and crew will remain open to debate forever. While it's easy to tolerate a certain level of Expendability for 'the master of suspense's' many murder-centric plots, I find it a little harder to take when children and animals are involved. Though two years after REAR WINDOW's debut, young Hank McKenna is threatened through almost the entire story of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, is a hair on his head REALLY harmed? On the other hand, to turn the future Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) into a vicious dog killer goes beyond my pale, meriting at least a one point rating deduction for REAR WINDOW. It's bad enough when a guy named Lars offs his spouse; but C'Mon, Fido, too? We're entering Wicked Witch of the West territory here. Hitchcock gave James Stewart--who otherwise lived A WONDERFUL LIFE--three of his most loathsome roles (NOT counting his outing as little Hank's daddy), and there's a coldness to 'Jeff's' opportunistic voyeurism in REAR WINDOW that suggests it's only a matter of time before this character slides a lot further into the wrong side of the law!",8,0,1,5 February 2014
The Hangover Part III," Why are the guys in this series less well-
","-endowed when selected to be shown in the buff than then the men in something such as BOOGIE NIGHTS or FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL? Don't the guys that hang out in the HANGOVER series have any self respect? What kind of message do they think they are sending to the world--which accounts for more than half of the eyes on the screen for any U.S. flick--when they denigrate American manhood in such a fashion? Perhaps it would not be so bad if such a bon mot came out during the first five or ten minutes of a feature. But when it the very last image of the entire film that the audience is left with, it is underlined with an importance that otherwise might not be attached to it. Further, when such a joke from Mother Nature involves one of the five main characters, it carries a lot more weight with the rest of the universe than if it was just some extra's lame inch. With all of the potential threats currently facing America, we cannot afford to let our guard down, as the HANGOVER people do. Who'll have the last laugh now?",7,2,5,16 June 2013
Annihilation," When Paramount Studio is trying to craft a chick flick/horror hybrid . . .
",". . . they should make sure the creators of their source material are not three aces and a couple kings short of a full deck. (America's House of Horror--Universal--would never make such a goof!) ANNIHILATION contains some very early exposition dialog stating that 'The Shimmer' has closed a U.S. National Park for THREE YEARS! Yet, this Shimmer incident is subject to far more secrecy than such Real Life matters as the C-in-C being a Russian Spy. No one outside of a few hundred American Special Forces (an estimate based on the size of their base and the scores of folks kibitzing on 'Lena's' debriefing) seems to have a clue that there's an extraterrestrial cancer gobbling up the U.S. East Coast. Dozens of elite soldiers go missing, but there's not a peep of complaint to the media from their survivors. ANNIHILATION does not take into consideration the Real Life Fact that the U.S. National Park Service sells annual 'all-access' passes, as well as passports which tourists can have stamped at EVERY site, all of which have been listed in guide books and highlighted on maps for many decades. Only Russian Spies would think that they could capture the attention span of U.S. movie audiences with such absolutely senseless plots (unless a film is billed as a spoof of Russian Cinema in the first place!).",7,1,5,28 February 2018
Saboteur," 'They're getting a rope . . . '
","' . . . hang on, Fry!', shouts Robert Cummings' character, Barry Kane, to actor Norman Lloyd, playing the title role, as the latter dangles by his sleeve (which Kane is grasping) from the torch of America's Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. After Fry has turned Kane's best friend at the war plane plant into a crispy critter and transformed Kane into his personal patsy\Public Enemy #1, pursued by multiple police agencies as he himself pursues the real killer in a way O.J. never did, it would be more appropriate if the last words Fry ever hears are 'They're getting a rope; hang him high!' Of course, in real life, U-boats dropped off multiple Nazis on America's East Coast during WWII with instructions to become saboteurs, but G-men tracked them down and our hanging president, FDR, strung them up. Apparently, when SABOTEUR director Alfred Hitchcock moved from London to Hollywood during the Battle of Britain to escape German bombers during WWII, he caught the bleeding heart disease endemic there, then and now. Fortunately for movie audiences, Fry wore cheap suits.",8,2,3,24 August 2013
The Great Gatsby," Gemma Ward really nails the 'Languid Girl' part . . .
",". . . and while his 2013 version of THE GREAT GATSBY falls slightly short of his magical masterpiece, MOULIN ROUGE, director Baz Luhrmann has done himself proud with this adaptation, given that he was handicapped by filming this gritty New York City story entirely in Australia! Perhaps the biggest shame is that Luhrmann did not commence filming before fellow Aussie & MOULIN ROUGE star Nicole Kidman was too ancient to play the part of 'Daisy Buchanan.' My Nineteenth Century American Novels prof proclaimed that the source material for this movie was the 'perfect' novel, and that not one sentence or word could be changed, improved, added, or left out. When I read F. Scott Fitzgerald's book for myself, I noticed a lot of it was random lists, so if my professor even read this novel, I doubt that it was recently. Otherwise, how could he have said what he did? Similarly, there are a tidal wave of details--some no doubt CGI--in Luhmann's movie, and while a few could be changed, added, or deleted with no great consequence, the whole hangs together well, especially in comparison to the Robert Redford as Gatsby version. Though it would have been nice if Luhrmann could have gone on location to Little Girl's Point in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where Capt. Cody inspired James Gatz to change his name to Jay Gatsby, it would have made his movie as expensive as that location-centered flick, THE FALL (too bad Australia has no place as singular or beautiful as Little Girl's Harbor). Hopefully, this director can make up for that glaring shortcoming by making a 3D version of THE HOLY BIBLE.",9,0,1,10 June 2013
The Birds," Many of Stephen King's so-called 'trademarks' . . .
",". . . can be found right here in Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 opus, THE BIRDS. In fact, if you put THE BIRDS side-by-side with ALL of the movies based on King's writings to date, it's hard to believe that there is another classic out there that has so many hallmarks of what today is known as the Stephen King story style. Essentially, THE BIRDS invented Stephen King. Nature run amok. Can you say Cujo? The holy roller tourist mother in the diner going berserk, and blaming visitor Melanie for the rampaging gulls (a delicious irony on Hitchcock's part, since the traveling mom is an outsider herself! The sanctimonious people come up as weak links again and again in King-based works). The Rube Goldberg machine-type scenario leading to one kind of disaster morphing into an even worse apocalyptic horse of a different color, with the exploding gas station and cars. Haven't we seen the exact same thing happen in countless King tales? The quirky egghead (an ornithologist spinster here) and the drunken 'doomsayer'--both in the crab shack scenes--get kidnapped to the East Coast in nearly every King screenplay. If you want to see the earliest Stephen King movie, watch THE BIRDS.",8,2,4,4 September 2013
