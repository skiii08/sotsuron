The Ring," First movie to really scare me in years...
","My experience with 'The Ring' has gone on for quite awhile even though I only just saw it last weekend. I saw the previews before it came out and being a huge scary movie buff, couldn't wait to see it.  For some reason, I never got to do it when it was in theatres and as many of us do nowadays, thought 'Ah hell, I'll just download it and watch it on my computer.' However, the quality was so crappy that it took away from the movie and I only ended up watching/suffering through part one before I gave up. (Part one only got to the part where Rachel is viewing the tape in the audio/video room)I wasn't scared at all and pretty much forgot that I even wanted to see it...which takes us up to this past weekend.While at Blockbuster, I noticed The Ring DVD in the Previously Viewed section for a good price and figured 'Why not?'  And I'm SOOOO glad that I bought it and brought it home.I watched it last Sunday afternoon on my gorgeous tv with wicked sound system and am still haunted by the soundtrack and images a week later. No need to go into plot as so many others have, but I can't remember the last time I was so unnerved...ok, probably the first night that Blair Witch came out before all the hype wrecked it.  I'm still creeped out by the image of the well and Samara's slow crawl out of it towards you....*shudder*.I think the scariest part of the movie though was the fact that JUST as the movie ended and the screen went to static, my telephone rang...I was watching the movie with my dad *another huge scary movie buff* and he answered and then with a stone-face said 'It's for you.'  The movie told the story so well that for a 45 second period, I ACTUALLY believed that it might be true. Nerdy?  Yes.  Best scare of my life?You better believe it.",Null,1,2,23 May 2003
