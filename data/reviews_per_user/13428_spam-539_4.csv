Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," I bought into the hype that this would be hilarious, and I was disappointed
","I'm easily won over, and easily amused. I still laugh at stuff like Van Wilder when it comes on re-runs. I expected this movie to be hilarious, and I went out after work to watch it. I have to honestly say that I laughed maybe 2-3 times in the movie. The parts that could of been the funniest, were all shown on previews on TV. It was a major budget film, which is OK if well done, which this one wasn't. Nothing in the movie was offensive to me, so I'm not writing with that motivation. I was highly disappointed and would recommend a rental on this one.",4,2,10,6 November 2006
Superbad," My Manpinion
","Superbad 7.5 / 10 (Comedy) Saw this today. It's not a bad comedy. Think American Pie minus the nudity but add 500% more vulgar jokes and language. I will proudly say I was laughing a lot in this film, and the only real disappointment I had was the ending, and the fact that 40% of the best jokes can be found in the R rated trailer. Still I felt it was money well spent, if your only goal is to laugh and your not easily offended by language.There are two police officers in this movie who kind of stole the show from the kids, but thats OK, they were hilarious and very over the top.There is also a lot of gay innuendo between the two best friends. They seem to like each other better than the girls who want to bang them.For the category of comedy I would easily rate this 7.5 out of 10. based entirely on how much laughing I actually did.manpinions.comFINIS",8,2,8,17 August 2007
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Great Harry Potter
","Great Harry Potter movie. For those (who are most of us) who have read the books, this movie cuts out about 40%, where part 3 cut out 20% and 1 and 2 cut out less than 2%. This is because the books have gotten bigger, and the directors have changed.The negatives are the same as part 3. Dumbledore. The actor they got to play him is horrible. I understand no one can play the part like Richard Harris, but they could of at least tried to find someone that could at least try to play the role. After part 3 the internet was in an uproar at the awful behavior of Dumbledore and the way he was portryed. The 'new' dumbledore said in an interview that he had never read the books, and that he didn't even watch part 1 on and 2. He simply read the screenplay and decided he would play the character how he felt it was. Of course his performance was horrible. If you go in to this movie hoping he will do a better job, or at least have taken some acting lessons, read a book, or tried to get into the role of Dumbledore, you will be disappointed. He's every bit as horrible, and whats worse, he has more screen time. The word Veela was never used in the film :( and the women who were supposed to have Veela blood did not. Nor were they attractive. The entire plot was stripped from the movie as I suppose it would of cost them too much extra money to put Dooby or Winky in the movie. What does this mean? It means most of the key points of the story through the 7th movie will have to be rewritten to pay for this oversight. Some good things however. The twins have a lot more involvement, lines, and screen time, and most of their scenes were not cut from the movie :) Thats a huge redeeming value right there :) Also Luscious makes an appearance! Sirius Black actually talked to Harry in the fire, but since again I guess it would of cost too much to put his face above the fire, they rewrote how flu communication works, and had the logs talk to Harry instead.The movie was excellent even with the lack of a dumbledore. Mad Eye Moody was a great cast for this film. Voldemort was a great cast and looked fantastic. Diggory and Cho were excellent. I loved the film as it is Goblet of Fire. But I can't get over the biggest disapointments that not only hurt the quality of the movie, but also forshadow ruining movies in the future.",8,0,0,25 November 2005
Click," Surprisingly Unexpected Movie from Adam
","I'll start off saying I love his films. They are hilarious but usually one notch above parity's in seriousness. This one is a shock as it isn't like his other films. (excluding spanglish) It is hilarious, wonderfully casted, and contains the beautiful Kate Beckinsdale. The surprising part is this movie not only contains tear jerking scenes, it also contains underlying messages that you can really reflect on. This movie is a good family movie, but not a great casual date movie. Don't pass on it because you don't normally like his films, this one has a lot of extra somethings :)",8,2,5,3 July 2006
