The Ring," I was scared but not of the film
","This is really one of the most lame movies I have ever seen. Normally I just love horrorflicks like the exorcist and even the bad made ones such as Braindead and Bride of Re-animator because I think they are so over the top that they become a amusing movie. But this movie isn't scary or funny at all. In the first sequence I was thinking: hopefully it gets better (it was sooooooo to obvious) but helas, it only gets worse! The acting is bad and the story is worse. Don't watch it, it's a waste of time...",2,0,0,10 February 2003
