Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Bad Video Game
","I feel like I'm watching someone play a bad video game.  So, therefore, I feel like I'm just watching the action, rather than being a part of it. This movie was so expensive it makes me sick.  Is there really any point? It's so made up that nothing is believable.  That's all I care to say.",5,0,1,25 November 2001
