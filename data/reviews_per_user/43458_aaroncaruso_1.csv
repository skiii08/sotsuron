The Ring," Video Tape and Antagonist just don't fit...
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Honestly, how can anyone be scared watching a movie that's antagonist is a video tape?Now, I will agree, there were a couple of parts that, although they didn't scare me, I was somewhat frightened, but my God!!! This movie was horrible! So many things were wrong in this movie.First, when you make a horror film, or one that is intended to scare the viewer, you need to put something in the movie that will leave the viewer something to think about when they leave the theater; a plot hole needs to be left in. Take Signs, for example. It never says why the little girl was having disturbing dreams, leaving the viewer something to think about when he/she has finished the movie. The Ring did not FAIL to do this, but somewhat abused it: the whole movie was one big plot hole! I agree that it should not be done for all parts of the movie, but nothing in the movie was really explained. Why was she killing people? It never says, or even hints at it. The closest conclusion one can draw is from the fact that her mother murders here (or attempts to) and leaves her in the well, and that her father kept her secluded from society, amongst other things. Plot holes are to be used for minor, minute details, not the bulk of the entire plot line.Second, it's a videotape! My Lord! What significance does this have? It never explains why Samara uses a video tape to KILL people, or even how she made it. That just leaves another plot hole open. In addition, the sequence of screen shots on the actual 'killer' video was too predictable, in a sense that it was going to contribute to the eventual discovery of either the girl, her death, or both.The movie as a whole was too predictable. Everyone had to have known that the video was going to lead to the eventual discovery of something, giving our protagonist a book of clues (so to speak), which in turn led to WAY too much foreshadowing. By half way through the movie, the audience is bored with every scene being mapped out by the video, which lead to a ho-hum film.One thing I did like in the movie was the ever present fly on the video, as well as the screen. This is a good plot hole to leave in. The best conclusion I can come to is that it foreshadows that the video kills its viewer by coming to life.Overall, I think it is safe to say that this movie should be skipped, if one is given the opportunity to watch it. I suppose if you had a whole lot of time on your hands, and absolutely nothing to do, then THAT would be the appropriate time to view this film. But let's be honest: who has that much time on their hands?",Null,0,0,3 November 2002
