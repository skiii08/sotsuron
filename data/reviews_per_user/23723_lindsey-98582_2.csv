Deepwater Horizon," Mark Wahlberg shines again
","I saw this with a good friend and it earned a spot on my top movies list. Living and working in oil field country, it definitely hit home for both of us.",8,0,2,25 December 2018
Lone Survivor," One of my all-time favorite movies
","Mark Wahlberg is phenomenal as Marcus Latrell. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, action packed from the word go! If youre a crier then be sure to have tissues close by.
I also recommend watching the HBO special that documents the making of this film. I watched that first and it made the movie even better.",9,2,4,25 December 2018
