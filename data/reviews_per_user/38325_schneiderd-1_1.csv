The Lobster," Very frustrating piece of cinema.
",Never in my life have I gotten so mad watching a movie. It was the worst experience I've had in front of my screen. I do not recommend this to sane people. The character is built to get the viewer angry. This is a desperate way of trying to make a different kind of movie. Yes it is very atypical but also extremely annoying. I won't give any spoilers but be warned this might not be everyone's movie if you want a relaxing night. Things don't make any sense to the point of being a burden. The only reason I had to bear with it is because of other people wanting to watch it. If one doesn't get satire or react well to it - DON'T WATCH THIS!,1,43,72,7 March 2016
