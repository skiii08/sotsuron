Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the Best Ever
","This is right up at the top of my list for one of the best movies ever. Okay, so maybe I'm shallow compared to some of you but for me this movie has it all! It is one of those films that comes along rarely it is flawless! The casting for each and every character is perfect! Harrison Ford was born to play this character; seldom have I seem such an amazing performance by an actor Alec Guinness and Peter O'Toole included. His every expression and reaction is a joy to watch. He embodies Indiana Jones so well that this character will be what he is remembered for most - even over Han Solo.Steven Spielberg was at his height when he directed this movie. If this movie wasn't so much fun it would have been showered with the awards that it deserved.Though this movie looked back to the films of the past it will be one of the films that embodies the 1980s.For years I just had a VHS fullscreen copy and when I got a widescreen laserdisc copy it was like watching a whole different film! It's so much fun and so well made that if you have never watched this movie - do. the excitement and adventure doesn't let up until the end. It never bogs down and it is really hard not to enjoy this movie... even if you don't think it is your cup of tea.I could go on and on about this movie! Harrison Ford has never equaled his acting as Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark is the best of the trilogy. Enjoy.",10,1,2,8 March 2007
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Upon Reflection
","This was my favorite Monty Python film some years ago. Graham Chapman is the best serious actor in the group and I really liked the sudeo history of ancient Palestine. Like I said, at the time, I found this to be pretty funny and thought that it really wasn't offensive to Christianity.But since I've taken my religion seriously in the past several years I have begun to see that it is offensive and mocking of Christianity.'But it's Brian!!!' I know it's Brian. I do, however the Python boys themselves have stated publicly that their intentions were to parody Jesus and Christianity. They cleverly use the device that we are following Brian and not Jesus and obviously show Jesus seriously delivering a sermon in a quick shot and yet the whole picture is taking shots at Christians and making light of the miracles of Christ.Sure if you don't believe or have a limited faith you might eat these 'harmless' parodies up. After all the Jews are spoofed with their stonings and their revolutionaries and the Romans are poked fun at, so what's so bad about showing Brian? Well, Brian may not be the Messiah, but his followers think he is and the whole moral of the story seems to be that these people are just blindly following. Following Brian as they followed or currently follow Jesus.We see them attributing miracles to Brian as a man falls into a pit, still blind! They are making fun of Christians, they are making fun of me. They are making light of the miracles of Jesus by using Brian as His representation. 'But they showed the real Jesus... This is Brian...' Right! Sure! The catchy tune and the singing on the cross may be funny to some, me at onetime included, but if you truly believe in the sacrifice of Jesus; this torture is not funny. This movie ceases to become funny when one is looking at it from a point of view of faith.The Monty Python gang was a talented group of people who liked to go overboard with the naughty bits. But this time they did go too far. Idle admits that the film is heretical and though they cloak their real motives with the invention of Brian the core message is one of disrespect for Christianity and 'Jesus freaks' like myself.",4,8,82,8 March 2007
The Departed," Departed
","Not much to commend on this movie! The original Hong Kong film was much much better. This movie was rambling, predictable, and at times reminded me of a college student film with its forced irony.Okay, so Dicaprio did do an excellent job, and Sheen and Damon were okay but the acting of Nicholson was atrocious and Marky Mark has been much better in other things. His acting limitations were obvious in this film. What was the corpulent Baldwin even doing in this film, outside of the director giving a handout to a fellow down-on-his-luck lib, who shouldn't even have been living in the United States for the past six years? This film shouldn't have gotten all the good press that it has and it absolutely shouldn't have been nominated or won anything. And no, I am not bitter for wasting any money seeing this film because I was given a free copy of it and I actually looked forward to seeing it. Now that I have seen it, I wish it hadn't departed from the original movie as much as it did.The whole thing of trying to incorporate the Boston bi-sexual crime-lord Whitey Bulger into the storyline with the Nicholson character was stupid and hit a bad note too since this mass murdering former male street hustler is still on the loose!",4,4,7,8 March 2007
