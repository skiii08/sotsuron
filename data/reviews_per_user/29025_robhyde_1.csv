Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For the fans alone.
","I live in England and I traveled 5500 miles to see this film?  After leaving the cinema I thought got fantastic, but the next morning, I thought what a let down, after so many years all Lucus can come up with is that.  On returning to England I have seen the trailer a number of times and thought perhaps I'm being harsh on the film, but initial instinct say, it could have been better, and get rid of Jar Jar Binks, the most annoying character ever on screen.",Null,0,1,17 June 1999
