Skyfall," sky fall.
","Just watched this again today and I loved it as much as the first time I saw it., last time I watched it was in the cinema when it came out. I love Bond films, but had watched very few after Roger Moore's stint, Dalton and pierce just left me cold. then came casino royale, I bought it on DVD after reading positive reviews and I enjoyed it. so when sky fall came out I returned to the cinema to watch it, the first bond film I'd seen at the cinema since octopussy, I was not disappointed. Daniel Craig is just relentless in his pursuit, the quick quips are still there, but it's sarcasm not the jolly one-liners of Moore et al.The opening scene/chase is a thrilling edge of the seat experience, better than the parkour scene in casino royale, Bardem is an excellent baddie, with a misguided sense of the grandiose on a mission of revenge against his former employee. A great theme song and title sequence, some great female companions, the return of the db5, Bond taking matters into his own hands to get the job done, yep all the elements are there for classic bond!",10,1,7,6 February 2014
