The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The awakening of Katniss
","I will not judge the people that dislike the movie, simply because they haven't read the books, and I am sure for that. Mockingjay Part 1 is presented almost perfectly and watching this brought back my feelings, thoughts and all the images I have created in my mind when I had been reading the book. There are no more Games and now we see the aftermath. Katniss is trying to 'recover' from her traumas mostly mental and psychological created by the Games. She has become a symbol of rebellion and hope to the people of Panem. They expect almost everything from her and that is what makes things worse for her. She is struggling to, lets say avoid her predetermined role, but deep inside she knows that she cannot. So this movie, Mockingjay Part 1 is all about her awakening, her personal transition to maturity, and the realization of what she has become. This is what matters in the end...for creating the path of the forthcoming Part 2. Jennifer Lawrence is yet again amazing, and we also see Julianne Moore, Elizabeth Banks, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland giving their true self and high level acting.",8,0,10,31 December 2014
This Is the End," Humor and comedy being violated...
","It is very easy for many writers and directors to think that humor and comedy are an easy subject to work with. They believe in themselves so much, that they interpret this as a natural talent from birth. So they make a movie that we supposed to laugh, or better say 'laugh out loud' with their sense of humor. Well I have news for them. Their sense of humor lacks of humor. Even if someone becomes more moderate in judging them will say that their sense of humor is made for youngsters that do not exceed the age of ten. Imaturity, stupidity, dominate this parody of reality shows and whatever else is out there only made for brain cell damage. The length of the movie was sweltering and tormenting. As for the end? It came as a salvation.",2,6,13,15 January 2015
Oblivion," Impressive
","There is no doubt that such film, in the way it was made, with the attention given to special effects, could leave anyone, buff or not of sci-fi films, untouched. It achieved perfection in that part and yes, the story is really interesting as well. I think that it rewards someone's expectations; who wants to spend a beautiful evening watching a film and escape a bit from reality to a possible reality of to the purest imagination. I liked the contrast between Vika a.k.a. Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) and Jack (Tom Cruise) as 'colleagues' but I felt a bit disappointed by the not so strong as expected Beech (Morgan Freeman).",7,2,5,19 April 2013
The Revenant," Photography and filmography...only!
","An admirer of photography, a keen impassioned heart of the openness and vast emptiness of mountains and forests, and also a lover of the boldness of harsh winters will fall in love with this film.Cold, loneliness, endless winter, wild fauna and flora, breathtaking landscapes and powerful wilderness will certainly captivate your heart and they are the only elements that keep this film going with the filmography of Iñárritu that completes the structural equation.Other than that the film is filled with unbelievable extremes of survival, which these extremes are so extreme, that are not even close to 'impossible to happen', to a point which this becomes ridiculous and hilarious, and why not say, offensive to the viewers intelligence.I cannot say, 'don't watch this film', as it will be unfair and unjust. But I will say watch it, admire the view if this is something that you like to watch, but most certainly, do not expect to find a jewel as many say they have found.",7,2,6,5 February 2016
Ex Machina," A world of human emotions...
","All living beings are defined, bound by feelings. They differ of course, between each individual. No matter their strength, no matter how good or bad, feelings control our decisions, control the choices we take in life. But can we teach feelings? Do we have the power by nature to teach feelings as whole? Not what is good or bad, moral or immoral, if there is such a strict boundary, but feelings as this internal source that exists inside us from birth. Really, do we have this skill from birth? If so, how this evolves in a different way, taking a certain alternative course for each one of us? We humans think that given our place in the world as the...'supreme being', no matter how accidental or not this is, has convinced us that we have divine powers to intervene and become creators. Not only we believe that, but we also think that human nature can be transported to our creation, a machine. We are so deeply convinced that we are experimenting and finally do it. Success! Is it success? Perhaps we are forgetting certain parts of human emotions. The will of surviving, the need of freedom, the power of deceiving and betraying. So if you want feelings given to a machine, be ready and well aware that these elements above will also be included. This house-lab looks futuristic and enchanting, and you are being carried away by the intensity of music investment and claustrophobic environment. It is very easy to imagine that this takes place sometime in the future and not today. The characters look like they are from another time as well. The main character called Ava (Alicia Vikander) looks so sweet and innocent, yet you can feel her powerful aura taking over your mind. She is in total control and wins you from the very beginning...I believe that all the sci-fi buffs at the end will leave with the feeling that something was missing from the whole story. That something could have been said additionally to what has already been said. But no matter what, it was a very interesting creation, a beautiful sci-fi film that plays a bit with morality and issues that the future generations will have to deal and struggle to solve. I enjoyed this film, I liked it and thought that it moved me up to a certain level.",7,2,12,15 March 2015
La La Land," Thumbs La La down
","How can a film be so tiring? Is it its duration, or the immaturity and naiveness that covers all of its existence? I am afraid it is the latter, simply because there have been numerous films throughout the history of cinema, of such duration and longer that have not carried all those negative characteristics like this film does.By trying so much to recreate an era, a romantic era, that existed (only in films) so many decades ago and place it in our era, what they have managed to do is fill a two hour film, with cliché and silly unconnected scenes that even for someone, who goes to the movies for the first time, will be easily seen without much thought or effort. So much dancing and fake sentiment, and so much sunshine, music and singing that allow me to say it is an offence to the real deal: true musicals that will always be remembered and will never be created again. That for a future reference...Overestimated? Unworthy of such plethora of awards and nominations? Absolutely! I simply, an open minded person, wanted to see what was all that fuss, all the enthusiasm, applauding and high ranking. Instead I was rewarded with...a yawn and just a tiny bit of frustration.",4,19,37,25 January 2017
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," No one can escape from their true self
","We are who we are. But every single one of us has a 'hidden side' and an 'apparent side' which is the one that we show in public. But which one of these sides is the true representation of what makes us, or is us, and which one is healthier 'to use' in order to be kept sane?There are many people that they choose the easy way in life, or this is what they think they do. They choose to hide their true self because the fear of being isolated or being rejected is rooted inside them. They are trapped in an endless conflict with their own self. A destructive, demeaning path that can lead to insanity. These people want to show a fake, clay facade, a supposed to be superiority and class. That fake, very popular persona every one may cherish and love. So fake it is, what they represent, that they cannot even look them selves at a mirror...Until of course they realize what is good for them and what the others are eagerly expecting to see from them. Then they feel the strength inside them stored and awaiting... Watching this movie was entertaining. I really enjoyed Michael Keaton and Edward Norton proving their acting experience yet once more, and loved the intensity of the music wonderfully bound to the scenes it was heard. In the end I wasn't truly stunned, I wasn't truly found this a great work of art. But to be honest the awkwardness of the story and that brush stroke of Alejandro González Iñárritu were enough for me.",8,1,5,29 January 2015
Alien: Covenant," Alien...funeral
","How easy is it making a legacy collapse? It seems that it is very easy if we take as an example this film, that this is what has managed to do in the worst way, leaving the spectator with bread crumbs, instead of a whole loaf. Here you have a failed creation, filled with unfinished and poorly worked scenes, unconnected and unstable, and with...a couple of flute courses that do not really tend to humour, but to ridicule and lead to frustration. Really? Flute lessons Mr. Ridley Scott? You want the spectator to do and feel what exactly after that? No laughs there, not even the slightest smile, but simply and plainly, disappointment and rejection.At least we should thank the creators of this film for the beautiful planet they have created, with the super tall trees, the thunderstorms, the waterfalls and wheat prairie, the overall aerie atmosphere, even for the great big alien city filled with statues, columns and monuments.The thing is, I didn't pay a visit to the movies to watch a documentary, like the rest of you I am sure, but a film that is named Alien, and I expected everything! Unfortunately I am left with nothing according to all the promotion and brain washing of the past months and I just took part in a brand name's funeral.",4,6,12,18 May 2017
