Deja Vu," Wow, edge of your seat suspense.
","Truthfully, the best movie of the year for the simple fact that after I was done biting my nails, I began to bite my toenails. She, whoever that woman was, is beautiful and Denzel keeps the action going throughout next to Val and the cool Goldman guy (sweet hair dude). The story begins as believable and we struggle to validate it but soon it becomes so far fetched that we can enjoy ourselves for the pure fiction of it all. I am telling, yes you, reading this, that Deja Vu is the best movie of the year, Borat was sweet also, but different sweet. Also, shout out to J.C. (from the Counte of MC to JC himself and now a terrorist, this guy rocks) -Jones out.",10,2,4,11 December 2006
