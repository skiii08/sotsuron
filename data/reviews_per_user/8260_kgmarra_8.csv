Moneyball," Hats off to Brad Pitt
","Brad Pitt hits it out of the park in the new blockbuster 'Moneyball.' He plays a man named Billy Beane who is a former major league baseball player. He is now the general manager of a low budget team called the Oakland A's. The Yankees beat the A's in the playoffs, causing them to lose their three best players. Billy now has to rebuild the team without the money that the other teams have.When Billy meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill), everything changes. Peter studied economics at Yale and he has a strategy that he believes will give Billy a winning team. Even though everyone around them disagrees, they are headstrong in their theory and refuse to give up.I am not a big fan of baseball or sports movies in general, but 'Moneyball' kept me glued to the screen. It's extremely interesting and it makes you think. There are multiple 'laugh out loud' moments and others that may make you cry. Moreover, it's based on a very touching, true story.I was astonished at Brad Pitt's performance. In my opinion, this is his best movie. He is incredibly believable in this role. In addition, it was great to see Jonah Hill play a more sophisticated role; he was very impressive as well. This film was cast impeccably. My only complaint is that it can get slow at times. It's a very long movie and a couple scenes seem to drag on. But the change of pace does fit with the tone of the storyline.This film is definitely timeless and appropriate for all ages. I give 'Moneyball' a 9 out of 10 for its amazing acting and original story. You don't have to love baseball to love this movie.",Null,1,3,23 September 2011
The Avengers," Didn't live up to its expectations for me
","The Avengers unite to save the day in Marvel's newest action adventure film 'The Avengers'. This superhero group is made up of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) puts all of these super humans together when Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's brother, tries to take over Earth. Loki plans on achieving this goal by using the Tesseract, an energy-filled cube, which was discovered in the ocean in 'Captain America', to bring alien invaders to Earth in order to destroy the planet. Loki even casts a spell on one of the Avengers, making him assist Loki in any way possible.All of the unique superheroes are supposed to work together, however many of their egos clash, leading to several disagreements that hinder their progress with the task at hand. It is especially difficult for Bruce Banner under these circumstances to keep calm and not transform into a giant, green monster.The special affects are quite impressive, but the main plot is non-creative. It was clever to incorporate Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, etc. into one movie, yet why would their job be to protect Manhattan from an alien invasion like in so many other contemporary movies? In addition, even thought the script has classic superhero clich√©s, it gets to be extremely cheesy. I found myself laughing at many of the foolish lines.My initial reaction to this film was not a good one. I actually couldn't wait to get out of the theater. I was so bored and unimpressed after hearing all the hype about this 'epic' movie and being let down. After asking around, I've heard mixed reactions. I've done some research and reevaluating and now I give 'The Avengers' a 7 out of 10.",7,1,9,10 May 2012
Argo," No complaints
","Ben Affleck directs and stars in the newest political thriller, 'Argo'. It is filled with A-list actors such as Alan Arkin, John Goodman, Victor Garber, and Bryan Cranston who each contribute to this incredibly moving film, which is based on a declassified true story.It takes place during the Iranian revolution of 1979 and 1980 in Tehran. More than sixty Americans from the US embassy were held as hostages, but six of them escaped and were hiding out in the home of the Canadian ambassador (Garber). Tony Mendez (Affleck), a CIA extraction specialist, came along to concoct a plan to rescue these six Americans.After speaking to his son while watching a movie one night, Mendez had a creative yet genius idea. He and the escaped hostages would pretend to be the film crew of a new sci-fi movie called 'Argo'. With the help of Hollywood makeup artist John Chambers (Goodman) and producer Lester Siegel (Arkin), this fake crew made their story quite credible.Ben Affleck did a spectacular job directing this film, which pretty faithfully follows such an unbelievable story. Every actor is convincing as his/her character and the cast was impeccably chosen. Make sure you stay in the theater to watch the credits. You'll see some real photographs and clips that mirror Affleck's film and actors.'Argo' is basically only rated R for language, making it appropriate for most teens, in my opinion. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, whether you're an adult who remembers watching this on TV or you're a kid who doesn't know anything about politics. It is extremely dramatic, exciting, and heart wrenching, but also hilarious on many occasions. When the movie ends, the entire audience applauds and cheers. It's an amazing story that deserves to be heard.I give 'Argo' a 10 out of 10. I have no complaints.",10,207,406,13 October 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," Fantastic and still realistic
","Men in tights still draw people in. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone star in the newest Marvel film, 'The Amazing Spider-Man'. Peter Parker (Garfield) is a nerdy, awkward teenager whose parents disappeared when he was ten years old. He now lives with his aunt (Sally Field) and uncle (Martin Sheen). When rummaging through an area of his basement, Peter finds his father's briefcase, which holds a clue that will open the door to unlimited scientific possibilities.This clue leads him to Dr. Curt Connors, a scientist at Oscorp who used to work with Peter's father. Gwen Stacy (Stone), one of Peter's schoolmates, happens to work at Oscorp as well. While snooping through Connors' lab, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider that brings him supernatural powers, which he decides to use for good. He creates a suit for himself and claims the name, Spider-Man.Being that this film is another Marvel superhero film, I was expecting to see aliens or portals to other worlds. However, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' stays on a realistic level by presenting the scientific descriptions of Spider-Man's powers and the creation of The Lizard. Of course, you have to use your imagination for some aspects, but you have to remember that this was originally a comic book.One of the few complaints about this movie is the fact that the first 'Spider-Man' was released just ten years ago. Many believe that remaking the series is unnecessary. To respond to that, I say that most of the people who are watching 'The Amazing Spider-Man' are not the people who watched the first series. I was seven years old in 2002 and I didn't know the Spider-Man series even existed.'The Amazing Spider-Man' greatly impressed me. My eyes were glued to the screen and I didn't want it to end. I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",9,4,8,6 July 2012
Drive," Classic action film
","Fasten your seat belts. Ryan Gosling stars in the new crime drama 'Drive'. Gosling plays a nameless driver who stunt drives in movies during the day, and is a wheel man at night. He is extremely quiet and quite emotionless; he very rarely cracks a smile.The driver becomes close with his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her son, Benicio (Kaden Leos), whose father is in jail. Eventually, the driver becomes a little too caught up in the father's unfinished business.If you saw the trailer for 'Drive' and you're expecting an action film like 'Iron Man' or 'Fast Five', you'll be disappointed. This film is very different from most current action films. It's classic like Clint Eastwood movies. There is action, but in a much more artistic way. The director, Nicolas Winding Refn, used several interesting and unique camera angles that make you feel like you're in the room with the characters.Even though Refn is known for using an immense amount of gore in his films, it was a bit over the top in 'Drive'. I've had my fair share of violent movies, but this is the goriest movie I've ever seen. If hardcore violence bothers you, do not see this movie. It's disturbing.Ryan Gosling is stunning. Most people agree with me that this is his best film to date. We see a completely different side of him. Everyone was cast perfectly, in my opinion. Some might say that the characters weren't developed enough, but I think Refn left a lot for the viewers to find out on their own or to imagine for themselves.'Drive' is a unique, authentic film that is incredibly crafted. I give it an 8 out of 10 for its exceptional cinematography that almost lets you forget about the unsettling scenes.",8,4,8,25 September 2011
In Time," Great idea. Poorly executed.
","Live forever or die trying. Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried star in the new sci-fi action film 'In Time'. Will Salas (Timberlake) and Silvia Weis (Seyfried) live in a futuristic world where time is the currency. In this world, people stop aging at 25. Once they turn 25, they only have one year to live, unless they find a way to get more time.Will lives in the ghetto where people constantly are timing out (running out of time and dying), while Silvia lives in New Greenwich where people have centuries. It's extremely dangerous to have too much time; those with centuries are usually accused of stealing and are immediately killed.When Will is accused of murder, he takes Silvia hostage and they run from the timekeeper (Cillian Murphy). Several times, they find themselves cutting it close with only seconds left on their clocks.The concept is extremely unique and innovative, which made me think it was going to be an 'Inception'-type film. However, it was disappointing to see 'In Time' fall short of my expectations. It pains me to say this, but Justin Timberlake should not have been chosen for the role of Will Salas. He just can't pull off the character of a tough guy from the ghetto. Amanda Seyfried is decent as Silvia, but she and Timberlake don't have much chemistry.I also don't think the script was very well written, which causes Timberlake and Seyfried to be even less believable as their characters. In addition, the characters are not developed enough; it's difficult to get a sense of whom these people, from opposite worlds, really are.I found myself checking my watch multiple times throughout the movie. I was distracted and the movie felt much longer than it actually is. For all of these reasons, I give 'In Time' a 6 out of 10. Great idea. Poorly executed.",6,296,395,1 November 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," You won't be disappointed.
","'When Gotham is ashes, you have my permission to die.'Eight years have passed since Harvey Dent's death and the Dark Knight's disappearance from Gotham. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has since been isolated in his bedroom of the Wayne mansion, only interacting with his loyal butler, Alfred (Michael Caine). Now, there is a new villain, Bane (Tom Hardy), who is determined to finish the city of Gotham once and for all.Wayne realizes that his city needs the Dark Knight to save its people once again. The Dark Knight returns to fight against Bane as well as the Gotham police, while utilizing some brand new toys introduced to him by Fox (Morgan Freeman). Throughout the film, Wayne's true care for his city and its people is extremely evident as always.This film still includes the ridiculous voice of the Dark Knight and adds the also ridiculous voice of Bane. These voices can be quite comical at times, limiting the believability of a scene.Although the movie is two hours and forty-five minutes long, it sure doesn't feel that long. The audience's eyes are constantly moving and their brains are constantly trying to find a way to prevent the destruction of Gotham.As the final film of the Dark Knight Trilogy, this film was expected to be bigger, battier, and better. The stunts are insane, the villains are stronger, and the story is richer. This was definitely a big step up from the previous two films.Most people who have seen 'The Dark Knight Rises' insist that it is the best film of the Christopher Nolan series. However, I beg to differ solely because I enjoyed the character of the Joker (Heath Ledger) as a villain more so than the character of Bane. But see it for yourself.I give 'The Dark Knight Rises' a 9 out of 10. You won't be disappointed.",9,2,6,24 July 2012
Pitch Perfect," Musical done right
","This new comedic musical is right on pitch. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a student at Barden University whose dream is to move to LA and become a DJ. Beca is uninterested in college, to say the least. Her father is a professor at her school and he advises her to join clubs to get more involved. Beca starts to work at the school radio station along with her admirer, Jesse (Skylar Astin).When Beca's voice is heard by Chloe (Brittany Snow), one of the main girls of The Barden Bellas a capella group, Beca is recruited into this singing group. Jesse ends up joining the rival all-boys a capella group called The Treble Makers.Beca soon realizes that The Bellas need some new music in order to improve their reputation and make it to the finals. However, the leader of the group, Aubrey (Anna Camp), is quite headstrong and refuses to change their music. The tension between these girls and The Treble Makers continues to grow and everything begins to unfold.Walking into this movie with very low expectations, I definitely was pleasantly surprised. It is a musical done right. There is no breaking out into song; the only time people sing is during competitions. In fact, the music is terrific and I can't wait to download the entire soundtrack.I was expecting slapstick comedy, especially with Rebel Wilson in the cast, but 'Pitch Perfect' rests at the borderline. Speaking of Rebel, this movie would be nothing without her. Hilarious lines mixed with her perfect comedic timing equals a workout for your abs. It comes very close to stupidity but it doesn't quite cross the line.'Pitch Perfect' is cute, silly, and fun. If you're looking for some laughs, take a watch. I give it a 7 out of 10.",7,55,96,14 October 2012
