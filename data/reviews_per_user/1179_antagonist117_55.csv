Saturday Night Fever," A decent, if overly-serious, character study, burdened by side stories that lead nowhere
","This is a self-serious movie about the foibles of pathetic little people engaged in a pastime that is objectively trivial but which to them is a matter of life and death. Namely, disco dancing—disco dancing in the seediest, most peripheral of clubs on the wrong side of the Brooklyn Bridge, no less. For a while the lack of any whiff of sarcasm or judgment on the part of the filmmakers, of the sort you might see in a Coen brothers movie about the dregs of society and their quixotic refusal to acknowledge the futility of their existence, raises questions with direct ramifications for the movie's quality: Does the film not understand how sad and silly its characters are? Are we really supposed to think that disco dancers were the new rebels without causes, or that Travolta's strutting and preening made him the next great underdog like Rocky or the next tragic antihero like one of Al Pacino's roles? And then a conversation happens between John Travolta's character and his dancing partner (Karen Gorney) after which there is no doubt that the seriousness of the film stems from its real understanding and concern for these pitiable, fragile individuals. Here they lay their cards on the table for the first time, and suddenly their personalities are present and clear. The introspective Travolta is indeed smart in his way and is beginning to realize how limited his options in life are, and the guarded Gorney wisely can't bring herself to trust anyone in her sphere of society, and therefore acts as if she doesn't really belong to it. For the first time it is possible to feel sympathy for them both, and that remains the case even as they continue down a destructive path amid the rotting infrastructure of late-70s greater New York. There are some side characters, potentially just as interesting but who don't ever come into focus quite as neatly, on whom the movie's seriousness and good intentions are misspent: Travolta's priest brother, who is a loose end, a woman who seeks Travolta's affections but who is used by the movie in increasingly unsatisfactory and unjustified ways, and a group of Travolta's lowlife buddies whose predictable B-plots involving racial violence and teen pregnancy come to nothing. It is therefore understandable, if slightly unfair, that 'Saturday Night Fever' seems to be remembered primarily for its soundtrack.",6,0,1,30 December 2013
Skyfall," Yet another revisionist Bond, but this one appreciates the value of the past as well
","Despite its innovations, 'Skyfall' is, in some ways, a welcome return to normalcy for the Bond franchise after an uneven period of experimentation. Daniel Craig's earlier films, understandably, sought to break away from the aspects of the Bond character that had grown stale, but at the same time they sacrificed some of the characteristics that make Bond stand out from other action spy heroes. In 'Skyfall' Craig still broods and mopes a bit, but he is not so humorless as in his first two outings as 007; he has at last acquired Bond's requisite wit. 'Skyfall' re-embraces essential elements of the franchise as much as it carries the quasi-serialized Bond universe into new territory. It offers a culmination of themes that the Bond films have been dealing with in one way or another since Judi Dench took over the role of M in 'GoldenEye': Bond's vulnerability, his relationship with M, and the decline of British power in world affairs. A new and intriguing aspect of Bond that may prove to be Craig's most significant contribution to the character is his compassion. This Bond seems to want to help people and to heal them, and what is more noble than this in a government servant? 'Skyfall' is not a perfect movie, dealing hamfistedly with the issue of sexual slavery in Asia for example, but it is the best Bond film in at least a generation.",8,2,6,17 June 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the first 'modern' action blockbusters, but with the enduring aura of a classic
","One of the things that makes 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' stand out among 'modern' action movies, i.e. action movies in the era of summer blockbusters that Lucas helped to create, is the way that it seems to have been transported to us from an earlier time. It is well-known that George Lucas was interested in recreating the feel of 1930s and 1940s adventure and sci-fi serials, not only for Indiana Jones but for Star Wars as well. The Indiana Jones movies, and 'Raiders' most of all, therefore does not look like a big-budget production. It makes very little obvious use of special effects technology, even less so than Star Wars which had mostly used practical effects such as scale models and puppets. The distinctive Indiana Jones color palette is drab, from the tweedy earth-tones of an archaelogy professor's office to the olives and grays of WWII-era military vehicles to the unadorned off-whites of a desert tent village. The movie's image quality is, by design, ever so slightly dusty and murky. It feels nostalgic and vintage, and I recall it feeling that way even when I first encountered it as a child in the early 1990s. It feels small and unprepossessing, like a secret that very few have uncovered. It is like nothing so much as an old classic newly rediscovered. Perhaps that is also what helps keep it fresh so many years later. To rediscover it now, or ten years ago, or ten years from now, is to be transported not to 1981 but to a mythical version of the 1930s, reimagined here as the last age of globe- trotting adventurers, with a layover travel map a la 'Casablanca,' and Arabian bazaars and snakes and pith helmets and, of course, those ever- scheming Nazis. It doesn't hurt that the story is rock-solid and moves along at a perfect clip, that the script hits every note it aims for from humorous to mystical to 'epic,' and that Harrison Ford and Karen Allen have great chemistry together (she should have been his partner throughout the trilogy; she radiates confidence and power even when the script tries to limit her to the pot-smashing damsel-in-distress role.) It may seem strange that such a purely entertaining movie, with no whiff of a message and no grand artistic pretensions, would occupy such a prominent place in the history of film, comfortably making both AFI lists of the 100 best American movies and enjoying almost universal critical and popular acclaim. But since you have seen it, as almost everyone of all ages has, you know why it does.",9,0,1,20 February 2014
Spartacus," A disappointingly conventional effort from an all-star production team and cast
","Probably Stanley Kubrick's most conventional film, 'Spartacus' lacks the intensity and creativity that usually characterize his work. His and star Kirk Douglas's earlier collaboration, 'Paths of Glory' (1957), has these elements in abundance, so the fact that they are absent from 'Spartacus' feels like a regression. Co-star Tony Curtis's accent is not quite as bad as reputation would have it, but his character is largely extraneous. Douglas gives an almost too understated performance as the reluctant rebel leader, while Charles Laughton and Laurence Olivier are compelling as classical patricians in their classical, patrician way. As if to mirror the reserved acting, Dalton Trumbo's script is thin, with little of the deep character analysis, historical insight, or contemporary commentary that writers like Gore Vidal brought to 1959's 'Ben-Hur.' The production is effective enough, but its visuals and pacing are staid, conservative, and unchallenging. Most of the movie may as well have been made by an old-school sword-and-sandal auteur like Cecil B. DeMille rather than a New Hollywood experimentalist like Kubrick. The film's battlefield sequences, so stunningly executed in 'Paths of Glory,' suffer the most from a failure to cut loose or try fresh approaches. They are ponderous, more so even than the rather obvious dialogue that takes place in the Senate chambers and baths.",5,2,5,19 June 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," It didn't work for me as a kid, and as an adult I think I know why
","As a young kid in the early 1990s, I could not get enough 'Indiana Jones.' I'm fortunate that my parents let me watch 'Jaws,' and I loved it. Seeing 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' at a friend's house left lasting images and ideas in my mind. But 'E.T.' did nothing for me, despite the fact that it was in theory Spielberg's most child-oriented blockbuster. When I saw it for the first and (until now) only time, I was the same demographic as the child star, but the experience was, frankly, boring. I remember feeling, if not putting into words, that the movie with the boy and the inarticulate, Yoda- like puppet was slow and cold. It was far less engaging to me than the other Spielberg titles to which I had been exposed. I don't remember if I knew that they were products of the same director, but the art of movies, which Ebert compared to 'a machine that generates empathy,' a tool for looking at the world through different eyes, was working on me: I was already accustomed to relating to adults on screen instead of just kids. Whatever holes 'E.T.' might have filled for me as a nascent movie buff were already occupied by more 'grown-up,' and therefore more exciting, material. If I was in the mood for pure fun with a sci-fi flavor, the 'Star Wars' VHS tapes with their more attention-grabbing special effects and attention-keeping pace were right there. It was no contest.Revisiting 'E.T.' now, I don't see much cause to regret my early rejection of it. In fact, it's probably worse now, because it's hard to find an original cut; I had to watch the ill-advised digital remaster, in which certain camera positions no longer make sense, and the actors are often looking just behind E.T. instead of at him as they presumably did when he was a puppet instead of pixels. Even ignoring the awkwardness of the digital content, which really does great damage to the feel and persona of the title character, there's little in 'E.T.' that feels real or fresh. The first part of the film takes place mainly in the home of the boy Elliott. The house always seems dim on the inside, lit by late afternoon sun even when it's midday outside. Elliott makes an emotional connection with the alien almost too easily, aided by an unexplained psychic connection between the two, and he causes some chaos with frogs in a heavy-handed scene that Spielberg seems determined to cram with ideas never to be unpacked.Elliott and his older brother are bland, generic kids, and they gang up on their young sister, who is a breath of fresh air and a splash of color around the edges of the increasingly disturbing main story. It's not just that Drew Barrymore is cute in the role; she's also a natural actor, stealing scenes from all her older costars plus the alien. Having a real live Barrymore on their hands, you'd think the filmmakers would have rethought the whole thing and cast her as E.T.'s main companion. It's her, after all, who teaches E.T. his most important vocabulary words and figures out what he wants to do: 'phone home.'The final act takes an unsatisfying route to this conclusion with a messily-edited, illogical home invasion by astronauts that segues into a dark riff on the massive government operation from 'Close Encounters.' It's a nightmarish cycle of silly and sad and shrill right up to the final scene, but there are two particular moments that do work. These are the iconic bicycle flights, one eclipsing the moon and the other the sun, and they are made magical and memorable with the help of John Williams's accompanying score. I might appreciate these moments more now than I did as a kid, having seen them depicted in Spielberg's production logo over the years and developed a fondness for the idea of them. But all things considered, I still think I made the right decision years ago to watch 'Star Wars' a fifteenth time instead of 'E.T.' a second.",4,5,12,9 September 2014
Casablanca," A simple formula never done better
","It's almost axiomatic that a 'prestige drama,' the kind that contends for awards and aims to join the canon, must combine a love story with a weighty historical plot line. Best Picture winners 'The Deer Hunter,' 'Out of Africa,' 'The English Patient,' 'Titanic,' as well as countless films that didn't take the Academy's top prize, all fit neatly into this category. It is probably too simplistic to say that all these movies are on some level attempts to remake 'Casablanca,' and certainly movies, not to mention plays and books, had discovered long before 'Casablanca' that mixing romantic drama and historical drama makes for good entertainment. But 'Casablanca' became a template and a benchmark. These facts are attested to by the number of its one-liners that became part of the cultural lexicon, and by its apparently permanent residence near the top of critical and popular lists of great films. One important element that sets it apart from run-of-the-mill, wanna-be historical romances is its humor, an ingredient many 'serious' movies neglect to utilize. One moment the French national anthem brings us to our feet and tears to our eyes, and the next we are laughing at one of the funniest lines and most imitable comic deliveries in movies, Claude Rains's 'I am shocked, shocked...' Every scene belongs almost to a different genre: the script rotates jokes, intrigue and espionage, a dreamy romance in flashback form, a will-they-or-won't-they soap opera in the present, musical numbers, and high-minded talk of war and freedom. But for all that, it doesn't feel like the movie is overstuffed or that there's even particularly a lot going on beneath the surface. It is tempting to read the studiously-neutral but soft-hearted American Rick (Humphrey Bogart) as a metaphor for the U.S.'s reluctance to intervene in European conflicts, and it is interesting to observe the ways this wartime Hollywood movie depicts European refugees of various ages, nationalities, and genders, but in this case it is more fun to simply be swept along by the movie as a great piece of entertainment. 'Casablanca' is 'just' a simple story well-told, set in an exotic and dangerous and alluring locale, and it might be that better than anything else has ever been that.",10,2,3,25 March 2014
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," The voices and art are top-shelf Disney, compensating for a few thin characterizations
","Voice acting and visual style, two of the most important components of animated films, are particularly well-done in this Disney outing. A wide range of urban and rural British accents is featured, and not for nothing: the story begins in a posh part of London and then moves into the English countryside. As the voices change, so does the art. The spotted motif of the title sequence feels appropriately modern (in the 1960s sense of the word), while London's parks and art deco flats are reminiscent of the interwar period, and scenes of foggy downs and farms are pleasantly rustic. The story itself, hinging as it does on a plot to murder and skin puppies, is rather sick, but that sort of darkness was once typical of great children's stories. The lead canine roles here are weak, especially the overly-demure wife and mother Perdita, but this allows the supporting players in the underground military organization known as the 'Twilight Bark' to steal the show. Members of the Twilight Bark seem somehow familiar, as if we have seen or heard them in half- remembered war films. For example, the movie's lone cat, Sergeant Tibbs, is reminiscent of many screen portrayals of stoic, sensible middle- echelon British soldiers. It is an indication of the film's intelligence that Tibbs is not villainized just because he happens to belong to a different species than the chief protagonists.",8,2,4,19 June 2013
Chinatown," When in Chinatown, do as little as possible and forget everything
","The Los Angeles District Attorney tells cops in Chinatown to do 'as little as possible.' When detective Jake Gittes was on that beat, the DA used to tell him 'you may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.' There isn't much doubt about what happened to Jake in Chinatown back then. Trying to prevent it from happening, he explains, had only assured that it would. It would have been better to have done nothing at all. He gives that advice to at least one prospective patron of his private eye business when she comes to him with a concern about her cheating husband. 'Go home and forget everything,' he says, and for once this sarcastic, confident, inquisitive detective seems sincere and tired and sad. This line of work is how he makes his living, but he isn't out to see anyone get hurt. He takes the case, of course, and follows it where it leads, which is to a place where he can do nothing to prevent those who know too little from doing too much. Maybe he should have just gone home and forgotten everything, but then we wouldn't have Robert Towne's deft, classic screenplay.",9,0,1,20 August 2013
Gravity," A great lead and a beautiful production that deserved a better story
","Gravity opens with some of the best-looking space vistas in recent movie history. It makes much use of 3D, with astronauts flying past and objects floating toward the camera, which has a dizzying effect similar to what Sandra Bullock's character, Dr. Ryan Stone, reports feeling while making upgrades to the Hubble. The movie quickly jolts into an intense scene that leaves Dr. Stone breathless and probably has a similar effect on most viewers. In the long, unbroken moment when Stone is recovering from the shock, the film seems on the cusp of a lot of exciting and terrifying possibilities. One of the least interesting of these is that it could turn into a routine thriller, with an endless series of last-second escapes leading into endless new disasters as improbable as they are predictable. This is the route Cuaron chooses. At one point, it got so overbearing that I made myself chuckle at the thought of Bullock having to escape something as absurd as sharks and dinosaurs. It nearly gets there. Dr. Stone's personal arc is, unfortunately, not strong enough to compensate for the plot's failings, though Bullock is a compelling protagonist and it's easy to like and root for her. Probably not since Ripley has there been a female character who so singlehandedly carries a space movie on her shoulders, and for that reason if none other 'Gravity' is a welcome addition to the sci-fi canon.",6,1,3,13 December 2013
Monty Python's Life of Brian," It lacks the mad surrealism of 'Holy Grail' and 'Flying Circus,' but it has its moments
","The Pythons' 1979 movie has its moments but doesn't replicate the mix of intellectualism and absurdity that defined 'Flying Circus' and 'Holy Grail.' 'Brian' is altogether too linear and grounded for the Pythons. One notable exception, an alien abduction, feels a bit strained, like a conscious attempt to do something random. It would have been one of the most pedestrian segues on an episode of 'Flying Circus.'Moreover, religious fundamentalism seems far too easy a target for the Pythons. Satire was always an important part of their act, and there are some very funny instances of it here at the expense of the People's Front of Judea (PFJ) and its similarly-named but much-despised splinter groups, but nothing quite as sharply-written as the exchange with the anarcho-syndicalist peasant in 'Holy Grail.' Moreover, the scenes never seem to end quickly enough after the points have been scored. The same wells, whether PFJ infighting or crowds slavishly following (and misunderstanding) prophets, are visited so often that the movie becomes predictable and stale, adjectives not often heard in reference to the most influential sketch comedy troupe of all time.The best bits here are more low-brow: Romans with sophomoric names that send the centurions into uncontrollable giggling fits, and straight- faced full-frontal nudity. Even in these cases, though, incredibly slow pacing saps some of the humor. A gag about speech impediments, for example, takes ages to play out to its conclusion. The film ends well, though, with a perfectly earnest Eric Idle singing the hilarious earworm 'Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.'Some religious groups and even entire nations (Ireland and Norway) took the Pythons' bait and reacted with great offense to the release of 'Brian,' a fact that says a lot more about the time period than it does about the movie, which hardly justifies such a response. From a contemporary perspective 'Flying Circus' seems far more subversive than 'Brian' in the sense that it forged new comedic ground and tested the limits of the television format. 'Brian' doesn't reach beyond what the Pythons had already achieved, and, in failing to succeed at anything different, compares unfavorably.",4,11,33,19 January 2014
Au Revoir les Enfants," Malle draws on unvarnished childhood memories to tell a WWII story from a fresh angle
","This French WWII film confines Nazis and freedom fighters to the background in deference to a segment of the population that is typically relegated to one-dimensional supporting roles: children. It is a fresh point of view, and one with many potential pitfalls, but Louis Malle's careful execution and commitment to truth carry it through. Basing the story on his own experiences at a Catholic boarding school in Nazi-occupied France, he draws on detailed memories of the cruelty and naivety of children. The students in 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' are not precocious, like so many movie youths, but they do have individual talents and interests, and they enjoy pretending to be sophisticates. They try to talk dirty, they exaggerate their experiences, and they pretend not to miss their parents when all they think about privately is how they long to be with them. They all have problems and insecurities, as well, that expose them to the insensitive taunts of their peers. One boy has night terrors, one is anemic and faints during mass, and the protagonist is a bed-wetter.But these are nothing compared to the dangerous secret that some boys are hiding. The lead boy, Julien, whom a teacher describes as intelligent and a bit pretentious, reluctantly befriends a new student, Jean. They share a love of reading, but Julien resents the fact that Jean is a smarter than he and more of a teacher's favorite. Jean is sensitive, and therefore an easy target, so Julien quickly discovers his weak point. But he withholds the valuable information, recognizing its importance without fully understanding its meaning: Jean is Jewish, taking refuge in the school under a false name.It is hard to find your way to this movie without knowing that key plot point, so even before it comes to the forefront Malle begins exploring it through artful verbal and visual cues. Early on, two students in the schoolyard pretend to be knights engaged in combat. One of them, secretly Jewish, chooses to play the part of a Saracen knight. The other students call him an infidel, and only Jean cheers for him. But such moments of agency in which Jean can express his identity without outing himself are few. More often, he is at risk of appearing different because of things he cannot do: he cannot recite the Hail Mary and other prayers with the rest of the students, cannot eat pork when it is offered, and cannot receive communion.The communion scene is particularly interesting because it shows the limitations of the school headmaster's charity. After delivering a ringing sermon to wealthy parents about the need to give generously to those in need, Jean comes to the front to receive communion. The headmaster passes him over since he knows Jean is not a Catholic. The moment might have been too-on-the-nose but for the interesting questions it raises. Does Jean intend only to strengthen his disguise by joining in this ritual? Does he do it to better fit in with his peers, and to get closer to his friend Julien? Or, as I tend to think, does he do it because the headmaster's sermon has deeply moved him? In any case, this is one of several moments that make us wonder whether the headmaster could have done more to keep his Jewish charges safe.Another is the decision that brings about the end of the ruse. The students and teachers gather to watch Charlie Chaplin's 'The Immigrant' (a 27 year-old film, but there is a war on and it is a religious school). Images of The Tramp and a woman sliding around a rolling ship give way to Malle's shots of a brawl on icy pavement between the school's cook and crippled kitchen boy. The boy, perhaps 18 years old, has been running a black market in preservatives, so the headmaster fires him. In retaliation, the boy notifies the local Gestapo that the school is harboring Jews. The headmaster is a hero who shelters Jews at the risk of his own safety, yet his incomplete committal to his espoused principles creates an opportunity for his work to be undone. Still, he falls gracefully. He courageously delivers the titular farewell when he is marched off to share the Jewish students' inevitable fate—a fate Malle has foreshadowed in a tense but beautiful forest sequence midway through the film.The movie's Nazis are one-note, but this is not a problem so long as they are kept in the background. When they show up in force at the end, they indulge in a bit too much leering and mustache-twirling for a film that is primarily interested in the hypocrisy and indifference of the French rather than the blatant barbarism of the Germans. But nothing diminishes the impact of the film's final lines, which are delivered almost without emotion in a voice-over by an adult Julien. The window on the atrocities of WWII that he had as a child was a narrow and privileged one, and his understanding of them was imperfect, but the sudden and permanent loss of a friend became a searing and defining memory for him. By looking at the period and place through a child's eyes, Malle demonstrates that no amount of insularity or innocence could keep one blind as to what was happening to Europe's Jewish population.",9,1,1,24 January 2015
Argo," Simple, straightforward historical dramedy
","Argo is a refreshing movie for people who enjoy smart, good-hearted historical dramas, and who are not too picky about historical accuracy. It's got the right mix of thrills and comic relief, with snappy dialogue and plenty of memorable set pieces. By virtue of telling its story in a straightforward, familiar way, it lacks any unique or superlative qualities that might make it an all-time great film. A broken marriage storyline regarding Ben Affleck's character feels shoehorned, and is reminiscent of the equally-extraneous marriage storyline in 'Moneyball' (2011), a similar film in more ways than one. Quibbles aside, 'Argo' is a fun ride.",7,0,1,18 June 2013
L.A. Confidential," One of the best films of the 90s, a shining noir with spot-on casting
","'L.A. Confidential' is so glossy it gleams. Director Curtis Hanson knows how to shoot the stuff that great crime movies are made of, and with style: bloodstained diners, ritzy villas, grody slumhouses, paper- strewn police departments—this movie makes them all look good. The soul of noir is in these places, but they are flooded with brightness instead of cloaked in shadows, and there always seems to be a magic hour glow around the actors. The casting is almost absurdly spot-on: Kevin Spacey as a smarmy egoist, Danny DeVito as a fast-talking sleaze merchant, Russell Crowe as a brooding bruiser. These are big stars of the best sort, ones who make their names and their money on serious projects that please both crowds and critics. Everything about 'L.A. Confidential' fits that bill, and it all works just as well here as it does in the best action thrillers, from the corrupt cops and the green rookies to the gangland executions and the epic shootouts. It's a genre piece, but an impeccable one. In a different year, one when 'Titanic' wasn't sweeping up practically every award in sight, it could have netted half a dozen Oscars instead of just two from nine nominations.",9,0,1,21 August 2013
A Bridge Too Far," A great production marred by a weak script and lazy characterizations
","As this script tells it, Operation Market Garden was a guaranteed failure from the beginning. Virtually everyone from the top of the command chain to the bottom knows it, Americans and Brits and Poles know it, the Germans know it, and they all say it in no uncertain terms. Had this been the case in reality, it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that Montgomery and Eisenhower and their civilian superiors would have approved it. Similarly, the script's characterizations are too plainly communicated. The whole needless arc of a gruff non-com (James Caan) and a scared young officer who looks to him for protection is predictable from their first exchange. The movie's casting is hit and miss. It's packed with A-listers, and while some are excellent in their roles and bring much-needed subtlety to the proceedings (see Sean Connery and Anthony Hopkins and their long-awaited radio exchange), some are just distracting (see Robert Redford's shameless mugging and Gene Hackman's embarrassing attempt at a Polish accent). Yet despite its many problems, 'A Bridge Too Far' is an impressive production and a fun one. The quality of the action set pieces matches or exceeds those in classic WWII films like 'The Longest Day' and 'The Battle of the Bulge.' A paratrooping scene in which the sky becomes choked with planes and people is shot from every possible angle, including the point of view of the nervous jumpers as they slowly fall to earth. The combat sequences show with humanity and intensity the various components of the operation and the disasters that befall them.",6,0,4,7 December 2013
The Terminator," An icon of its time and for all time
","'The Terminator' is two things that are very good to be: a movie that is of its time, and a movie for all time. From the opening minutes it is almost fetishistically contemporary. A superimposed text says the events of the film take place 'tonight,' a rather hokey tactic, most often seen in the horror genre, that may create a sense of immediacy for some first-run viewers but that becomes increasingly ironic as time takes its toll on the fashion, the music, the hair, and so on. 'Terminator''s first act is an onslaught of such tell-tale signs of the time, and the time in question is peak 1980s. This is not a bad thing. The movie so successfully captures the spirit of its era that later movies set in its milieu often appear to be, and in many cases undoubtedly are, copying it. It wasn't the first movie to take place in fume- and trash-filled urban alleys and neon-lit dance clubs, or to feature independent women who do things like have sex and ride motorcycles without prompting censure or even comment, but it was arguably the best and best-looking and most influential movie to do these things at this time. In other words, it is an icon of 1980s film.It is also an icon of film generally. It accomplished that even grander feat through a combination of brilliant achievements. First, the casting, particularly of Arnold Schwarzenegger. His early acting career benefited enormously from the existence of roles that nobody else could have played quite as well. Conan the Barbarian was a near-Neanderthal: strong, serious, a mythic figure of great stature and few words. The Terminator is the same, though he kills for different reasons. Arnold is menacing, darkly funny, and extremely cool in the role, all at once. Second, the script. It serves timeless lines on a silver platter for Schwarzenegger and the other two leads, and they all three seem to know exactly what to do with them. They take soundbytes and throw them at us like sticks of dynamite, and when they land we feel them: 'Come with me if you want to live,' 'I'll be back,' and 'You're terminated, f*cker.' (The last one is another reminder that we're in the 1980s, a long-ago time when action and sci-fi movies were sometimes made for adults, not just teens. The language here is strong, the violence is not all bloodless, and the sex is very much on- screen.) Third, a time-travel plot that is unusually well thought out, capable of being communicated without too much belabored exposition, and that leaves plenty of room for further exploration without raising too many unanswered questions. It is strong conceptual ground on which to build a media empire.Like 1983's 'WarGames' (which also featured a motorcycle-riding female lead), the central idea in 'Terminator' is that computers might one day destroy humanity. Unlike 'WarGames,' which approached the subject from a software angle and took its cues from real programming concepts, 'Terminator' casts a tangible piece of hardware in the role of unstoppable stalker killer. This leads to perhaps its only real weakness as a movie. Toward the end, as plot recedes and special effects (mostly stop motion) come to the fore, it begins to feel too much like the horror movies that it echoes in its opening text. The false endings that typify that genre are as predictable as ever, and the Terminator becomes just another riff on Michael Myers. But if the penultimate scenes are derivative, they are nevertheless satisfying, and the film ends on a note that provides closure and leaves you eager for more.",9,3,3,30 September 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," Fairy tale violence and fascist violence are placed side-by-side, but one is far more interesting than the other
","Many of the world's most ancient myths and fairy tales are notoriously bloody affairs, perhaps because they date from times when death seemed to strike so capriciously. The 20th century, too, was at times brutally and indiscriminately violent, thanks in no small part to the fascist regimes of 1930s and 1940s Europe. Guillermo del Toro sets these two legacies of violence side by side at a Franco-era Spanish military compound built atop a stone ruin and surrounded by woods. This is the killing ground of a fascist officer, but it is also the home (really the prison) of his stepdaughter Ofelia, a book-loving girl who sees monstrous creatures in the trees and walls. Ofelia's encounters with a faun, insectoid fairies, and a faceless, child-killing thing with blood-stained claws are the most creative and interesting parts of the movie. It is unfortunate that so much time is spent away from her and these CG creations and spent instead on her stepfather, who feels like a villain imported from a slasher horror. His persecution of a band of clichéd guerrillas is predictable, and more gruesome than seems necessary for a fantasy period piece. At last, though, del Toro provides an ending that feels true to both the fairytale world and the real one, without compromising the dark tone he sets for both.",7,0,1,18 August 2013
Barry Lyndon," The closest thing to Kubrick's unmade 'Napoleon'
","In 'Barry Lyndon' we have echoes of how Stanley Kubrick's great un- made project, a biopic of Napoleon, may have looked and felt. It would have been stately, as 'Barry Lyndon' is throughout, with perfectly still shots that linger on faces, or very slow pans and zooms of impeccable, symmetrical sets. It would have been steeped in period details, as 'Barry Lyndon' is with its Georgian turns of phrase (a high-society woman is 'a woman of great fortune and condition'; to sympathize with another's circumstances is to be 'sensible' of them) and its impressive mounds of powdered hair and layers of makeup on both men and women. Classical music would have abounded, as it does in most Kubrick films and no less so here. There would have been warfare on the continent in which soldiers marched against each other in tight, colorful ranks, and intriguing marital relations. The latter might have demanded more sustained attention in the hypothetical Napoleon film than it receives in 'Barry Lyndon,' where the wife seems forever on the cusp of transmitting some insightful commentary but remains unsatisfactorily cipherous. Had 'Napoleon' been made, its lead character would have had a rise-and-fall arc quite similar to Barry's in spite of their very different historical significances (incalculable in Napoleon's case, non-existent in the case of the fictional Lyndon). As it happened, 'Barry Lyndon' is the movie we have, and it is a very good one. No other Kubrick work received as many Oscars (four), all of these in recognition of the film's technical accomplishments. Yet among the director's many masterpieces it has had a relatively low public profile. Could calling it 'Napoleon' have elevated it into the top tier of his oeuvre in the minds of many fans? The added aura of historical import would have helped, but probably not enough: though the film is very finely-wrought, it lacks the more obvious eye-popping abstractions of a '2001' or the overt improprieties of a 'Dr. Strangelove' or 'A Clockwork Orange' with which the name Kubrick is and was associated.",9,2,3,7 November 2013
American Hustle," Unapologetically a capital-M Movie, but there's a real script and real acting inside the shiny package
","'American Hustle' is an unapologetically glamorous, indulgent riff on classic Hollywood ensemble romps, set in the lately-resurgent so-uncool- they're-cool-again 1970s. Nearly every role, from the headliners to the bit parts to the cameos, are filled by some of the hottest, most critically-beloved actors of their generation, and they clearly relish rocking their ironically unhip (and therefore hip) comb-overs and ginormous glasses and outrageous blazers and tawdry-sexy dresses. There's no denying that the cinematography and the casting and the 70s- hits soundtrack are tailored to a tee. It screams, 'Yes, I am a Big Hollywood Movie,' and it knows it can pull that look off and we won't roll our eyes or look away. Very well, some of us will; there are those, in the run-up to the Oscars, who are calling it Oscar bait, suggesting that it's cynically ticking off the boxes the Academy wants to see ticked: Jennifer Lawrence, check; stars 'selflessly' obfuscating themselves behind faux-ugly makeup, check; a throwback to a time today's Oscar voters are nostalgic for, check. The movie is all the more fun to watch because it has these things. But it has more than that, plenty enough to justify the awards it's gotten and the awards it will get. It's not the main plot, which is Capers 101 with some predictable twists. It's also not the gray areas or the subtexts, which by the end are surprisingly black and white and cut and dry. The extra mile is the characterizations, huge and clear-cut personalities that are also finely-detailed and reveal new layers with each scene. Everyone is flawed, but everyone is well-intentioned, and it's hard not to like all of them even as they cultivate sleazy, selfish dislikability. The characters' tangled relationships and personal battles reduce the 200 million dollar stakes of the principle con to a secondary concern, or perhaps it is more accurate to say that they give the con meaning beyond the merely monetary. In this, screenwriters David O. Russell (who also directed) and Eric Warren Singer hit the same notes that define the Coen brothers' films, except that Russell and Singer have a softer, more sentimental touch. It's 'American Hustle''s above-average writing, and the well-above-average acting required to sell such a script, that the Academy has recognized, and not just the movie's in-vogue surface qualities and shiny package.",8,0,3,14 February 2014
Fargo," On Marge's pregnancy
","Marge Gunderson's pregnancy is seldom acknowledged in 'Fargo,' but a critical review almost has to mention it. It's a notable fact because, in moviedom, pregnancies are usually used symbolically or to raise the stakes. Audiences may react more strongly to things that happen to a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman, and screenwriters can generate quick, cheap pathos with a childbirth scene. But that's not what Joel and Ethan Coen do in 'Fargo', and viewers may be forgiven for occasionally forgetting that the heroine is pregnant at all. It is only referenced lightly and in passing: a sight gag about how much buffet food she's eating, for example, or a tossed-off pretense for her to take a seat across from a potential suspect. The pregnancy doesn't limit her ability to do police work, and it doesn't mark her as undesirable to a man who wants to rekindle an old relationship. It may as well not be there, but it is there, and that makes it an interesting decision by the brothers Coen, who have too keen eyes for details to have done it absentmindedly. By rejecting the typical purposes of pregnancy in film, they show, perhaps, that it need have no special meaning; Marge is a cop investigating a triple homicide in a small Midwestern town, and that's all we really need to know. Whether she's pregnant or drinks coffee or eats eggs are just details.",10,0,0,22 August 2013
Grease," The best bit of musical nostalgia for the hot-rod generation
","With more hummable songs than 'West Side Story,' and a lot more humor, 'Grease' is probably the most fun musical tribute to '50s teen culture. It studiously avoids falling into the buzz-killing sinkholes of melodrama and social commentary. When a main character has a pregnancy scare, she responds not with self-pity but with defiant independence. That arc leaves her a little deeper, a little wiser than before, but no less lighthearted. The principle romantic pair, played by John Travolta (good actor, lousy singer) and Olivia Newton-John (the inverse) are often kept apart by the artificial social barriers of high school, and they each do the silliest things to try to change for each other, but at no point does anyone act as if any valuable lessons have been learned. In another movie about pseudo-rebellious greasers, like 'Rebel Without a Cause,' the car race scene in the final third would have resulted in a shocking death that changes everything; not here, because 'Grease' is smart enough to know what kind of movie it is. It's just fun-loving, winking nostalgia. The final number has all of the characters, even the ones who never got along, declare that they will be together forever. The audience knows that they won't, because life doesn't work like that, and the movie knows that we know, so spelling it out would be pointless. In addition to the pop songs and fun plot, 'Grease' is kept fresh by well-drawn, instantly-iconic supporting characters like Rizzo and Frenchy.",9,2,3,9 January 2014
North by Northwest," More like a Bond movie than a Hitchcock movie, but much better
","Though I may have to turn in my 007 fan card for saying so, 'North by Northwest' is more riveting, classy, and funny than any Bond movie, and predates the earliest 'official' Bond film by three years. Cary Grant's protagonist may be an unwilling spy, but he is a natural one, bantering confidently with baddies in posh hotels and doggedly courting a mysterious femme fatale (Eva Marie Saint). The crop duster scene is perhaps the best and most iconic action sequence that Hitchcock ever filmed. James Mason makes an ideal antagonist, dwelling in a Bond-villain-style lodge atop a famous U.S. landmark. Twists and triple-crosses make for an exciting, complex tale.",10,2,4,19 June 2013
Judgment at Nuremberg," A responsible, quietly superlative film
","'Judgment at Nuremberg' belongs at or near the top of two prestigious lists: that of the greatest World War II movies and that of the greatest courtroom dramas. High praise, but well-deserved on the basis of its emotional and intellectual strengths. Few film depictions of the home front can even boast an awareness, much less so sensitive and character-driven a presentation, of the class dynamics that along with racial prejudices shaped Nazi Germany's rise and fall. Few depictions of the war depict the atrocities of the Nazi regime so unflinchingly: several minutes of real-life concentration camp footage, appropriately contextualized, do more to move the audience than all the red-dress girls and misfiring guns that a Spielberg can invent for the purpose of manipulation. Few court procedurals so effectively consider the culpability of the 'good guys' and humanize the 'bad guys' without ducking the responsibility to take a side.The central issue is whether Nazi judges were responsible for Nazi war crimes. The movie answers the question, as must the war crimes tribunal headed by Spencer Tracy's character, but it does so in a way that gives a full and fair hearing to opposing viewpoints and to the seemingly endless complexities inherent in the case. Two reasonable viewers can watch the film and come to different conclusions. Even one viewer can fail to arrive at a completely comfortable answer, as I have discovered.The runaway star of the movie is Maximilian Schell as the German defense attorney. He commands the courtroom physically and verbally, punctuating his monologues with perfectly-placed pauses and stresses. His ability to generate and sustain dramatic momentum is no small achievement in light of the movie's approach to translation. Instead of subtitling the Germans or pretending that only English was spoken in the Nuremberg court, the actors all speak in English but act as if they are speaking in their characters' native languages and hearing translations through their headsets. It sounds potentially silly, but in practice it works magnificently. In addition to Schell's Oscar-winning turn, Judy Garland gives what may be her best performance, emotionally and even vocally, as a thickly-accented witness to Germany's anti-miscegenation laws. Marlene Dietrich is perfect in a role that only she could have played: an aristocratic widow reduced to drinking ersatz coffee with pointed stoicism. Her relationship with Tracy's judge is a vehicle for the film to explore the physical wreckage of the defeated nation as well as its upended social structure. Her speeches are gripping, as nearly all of them are and must be for a talk-heavy movie to be successful.What can be criticized in 'Judgment' it the rather gauche performance of Richard Widmark as the lead prosecutor, a few jarring musical cues, and one too many dramatic close-ups. The latter presentational decisions may be vestiges of the made-for-TV version that preceded the film. In any case, these are quibbles when weighed against the film's overall quality and sophistication.",10,0,1,19 June 2013
Apocalypse Now," A remarkable visualization of Conrad, by way of Herzog's 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God'
","The opening scene depicts Martin Sheen's Captain Willard having a breakdown, drunk and covered in his own blood, wrecking his hotel room in frustration. His voice-over hints strongly at what we now recognize as PTSD, which for him manifests as an inability to readjust to civilian life. He knows he's unwell, unfit for duty even, so when the army sends a couple of fresh-faced soldiers to his room with a summons, he assumes they're there to arrest him. But no, it's an assignment. Because, as it turns out, he's the most level-headed person in the movie, and as it unfolds he seems to be the most well-adjusted Westerner in all of Vietnam. That comparison says less about him than the people he encounters as he heads upriver: Robert Duvall as a hilariously (a better adjective would be 'sickeningly' if the tone wasn't so hyperbolic) amoral colonel, young soldiers turned feral by the loss of their commanders, and finally Colonel Kurtz, a man perhaps so unmoored by the horrors of war that he's come full circle and achieved a kind of clarity. In much the same vein as Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' (1972), which follows a conquistador's journey down the Amazon and into madness, Coppola's cameras and the atmosphere of the river work to make Willard's boat journey a disorienting, mind-altering experience. 'Apocalypse Now' is not a critique of a futile war, at least not any more than Herzog's movie is a critique of conquistadors: it doesn't try to provide answers or even to depict reality, but to convey the feeling of becoming lost in a primeval place that makes civilized notions of identity and morality seem like quaint inventions. In other words, it is much more a 'Heart of Darkness' adaptation than it is a Vietnam War movie, and is best enjoyed with that in mind. Visually, Coppola nails it. Misty jungles loom around the boat, grinding away at the sanity of those aboard. The camera spins and rolls, faces come in and out of view as the light waxes to spotlight brightness and fades to pitch black, and bodies are strewn everywhere like a house of horrors. The soundtrack and script are more debatable. The music of The Doors fits the atmosphere perfectly, but it's so well-known outside of the movie that it takes me out of it. At times, Sheen's voice-over narration seems overwritten, like something from Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe. 'I hardly said a word to my wife, until I said yes to a divorce,' he deadpans at the beginning. But if 'Apocalypse Now' is not perfect, and if the runtime of the director's cut is a bit too long, it is easily a substantial and artful enough work to reward repeat viewings.",9,0,1,14 January 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," A deeply empathetic movie about the messy early responses to the AIDS crisis
","At the start of the AIDS crisis people knew little about the disease except that it was a virtual death sentence and that it seemed to be selectively affecting homosexuals and drug users. Doctors didn't know how to treat it, governments were slow to react, and large parts of society reacted by blaming the victims, and shunning them, instead of showing empathy. 'Dallas Buyers Club' is a movie about empathy, set at this uncertain, pivotal moment in American history. Most movies are exercises in empathy, even when they don't mean to be, because they ask us to view stories from perspectives other than our own; this is one of the great strengths of the cinematic art form and one of the best proofs of its value. In 'Dallas Buyers Club' the main character, a homophobic coke-head electrician and bullrider who lives in a trailer park (Matthew McConaughey), is the person we accompany through the early part of the AIDS saga. It is hard to imagine anyone coming to the end of the movie without respecting him, feeling for him, and liking him, even though few of the people who seek out a movie about the AIDS crisis are likely to be in sympathy with the hateful slurs or the self-destructive lifestyle that define him at the story's beginning. The movie is about his own journey toward empathy as well, and it is fascinating to notice how his unique perspective colors that journey and defines its limits.One of the most remarkable consequences of the early AIDS era, and a recurring theme in the memoirs and narratives that have come out of that experience, was that many HIV-positive individuals took it upon themselves to become self-taught experts on the medicinal, scientific, financial, and legal issues surrounding their diagnosis. When hospitals and the FDA and the general public seemed helpless at best and apathetic at worse, communities emerged among those most affected that provided conduits for information and support, and in some cases used other-than- legal means to give desperate members access to untested, unapproved treatments. In this film, the titular Dallas Buyers Club is one such community. Its singleminded, brash, charismatic, lying, stealing, drinking, politically-incorrect leader is the Robin Hood of a ragtag band of individuals whose perspectives he does not share and cannot quite understand, but to whom he is intimately tied by a shared medical fate. The other person we, and he, know best is a transgendered and usually-stoned free spirit from the club scene named Rayon (Jared Leto), but there are glimpses of people from other walks of life as well, from the young and broke to an older, white collar couple in a committed relationship. The perspectives of medical professionals runs a similar gamut, from an unlicensed homeopathic type south of the border to a tool of Big Pharma to a concerned but cautious doctor played by Jennifer Garner. What is sobering is the realization that although all of these people want a cure, they come to the table with such different backgrounds and ideals that fighting each other is easier than fighting AIDS. McConaughey's character, on the phone with a doctor, pleads, 'I see where you're coming from, can you see where I'm coming from?' 'Dallas Buyers Club' is a movie about seeing where people are coming from, and a damn good one.",10,3,4,15 February 2014
Dirty Dancing," A modern dance movie that stacks up well with the classics, in spite of cheesiness and overreach
","When did dance movies get so serious? When Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers made them they were essentially comedies, with just a touch of melodrama to move the romantic plot lines forward. But by the time of 1977's 'Saturday Night Fever' and 1987's 'Dirty Dancing,' dance had become a framework for commentary about heavy topics like rape and abortion. It is arguable whether audiences really noticed; decades afterward 'Saturday Night Fever' is famous primarily for its time capsule soundtrack and John Travolta's white-suited disco pose, while 'Dirty Dancing' remains alive in the collective memory for one famous line of dialogue and for the slick moves that Patrick Swayze showed off and later parodied on Saturday Night Live.Yet to understand the non-dance bits of these movies, it helps to be familiar with the periods in which they were made. In the case of 'Dirty Dancing,' it is helpful also to know something about the time in which it is set: the early 1960s, the brink of a major generational divide. Despite Jennifer Grey's clothes and hair, a few of the song choices, and the fact that the font and color of the title look like they come straight off a Prince album, this movie is consciously and by necessity a period piece. It is set in a family-focused lakeside resort, a kind of place with a kind of ethos that no longer existed by the time of the movie's release in 1987. Much is made of the emergence of new forms of popular entertainment, new interpretations of old words like 'baby,' and the new social frontiers that would turn old- fashioned liberals like Jerry Orbach's character into conservatives without their knowledge. This is fertile ground for a drama, but a movie about dance—and this is, to its credit, a movie about dance—doesn't have time to do these ideas justice. The dangers of unsafe abortions in the pre-Roe era are highlighted, but in a way that is unfeasibly convenient. It is structured so that the romantic leads come out squeaky-clean heroes and their antagonists more villainous. The feelings of the woman 'in trouble' are explored only in passing and only at moments calculated to serve the needs of the central story. Similarly, the prejudices of the upper middle-class are touched upon, but in the vaguest way. One oily sort speaks of sexual liaisons with the help as 'slumming,' and Swayze's itinerant dancer is obscurely identified as coming from 'the streets.' What streets, exactly, remain unknown, as does his ethnic identity, which he seems to hint at through a very tenuous, arguably Italian, inflection.Though Eleanor Bergstein's script takes itself very seriously, and though its desire to 'say' something meaningful is laudable albeit misplaced, its real power is, quite rightly, in the dance sequences. Unlike 'Saturday Night Fever,' which spends far too much time away from the dance floor and among dislikable people, 'Dirty Dancing' is a worthy successor to the classics because it spends the bulk of its time on music and movement. Grey and Swayze look genuinely happy when they dance, and when the world shrinks to them they generate a feeling of goodwill that overshadows the movie's missteps and instances of overreach. There is an unshakable cheesiness to the film that the great dance movies of the past were too self-aware and witty to fall into. The way Grey's character falls for Swayze's is so pat, the way he expresses himself is so hammy, and the way Orbach's comes around at the end is so cutesy and orchestrated. But the important scenes, the dance montages, all look and sound great, and it's easy to feel good while watching them.Happily, the film avoids the clichés of its genre. Nobody gives Grey a makeover, and nobody tells her to come out of her shell or to change who she is. In an early scene, she sheds an awkward sweater in favor of a sleeveless shirt without comment or even a visual acknowledgment of the wardrobe change. It's unclear whether that's a smart decision or just an oversight from director Emile Ardolino, but if it's the latter, it works in spite of itself. That's true of the movie generally.",7,0,0,12 December 2014
The Dirty Dozen," A dress rehearsal for 'M*A*S*H'
","'The Dirty Dozen' moves ensemble war movies a few giants strides in the direction of 'M*A*S*H' (1970). Zany march music plays as the anti-heroes gallivant around causing an almost uncomfortable amount of chaos. The movie is darkly comedic, irreverent, and strangely gruesome. The characterizations are cliché and the plot is predictable from the outset, but it is fun to see actors like Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas in full madcap mode. Still, 'The Dirty Dozen' doesn't do enough to distinguish itself among 1960s war films. We'd had World War II romps before that were richer in emotion and loftier in tone, like 'The Great Escape' (1963), and 'M*A*S*H' would soon go to in the opposite direction to illustrate the insanity of war. 'The Dirty Dozen' is caught in between and is perhaps chiefly interesting as a stepping stone.",6,0,1,17 June 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," With slightly more plot this is a small improvement over the first, but it still has little of the fine character work that made LOTR great
","The second Hobbit movie is an improvement over the first simply because it stops for plot. There are two very long, insensibly edited, stupefyingly predictable action sequences, one toward the beginning and one at the end, but in between them there are a couple of hours of dialogue. That dialogue is mostly a string of clichés, and it has only a tangential relationship to anything J.R.R. Tolkien wrote, but at least the characters are talking instead of flinging themselves around in a glaringly artificial whirl of debris and Orc body parts. So that's the good news, if you can call it that. The bad news is that despite the opportunity to correct it, one of the main problems of the first movie is still unresolved: the Hobbit himself, Bilbo Baggins, a literary hero beloved the world over, is effectively absent from the movie that is ostensibly about him and his adventure. Tell me, what does Bilbo think about Lake Town politics, about which so many instantly-forgettable words are bandied? Who knows? We don't see or hear from him during our entire time there. Nor do we hear what he thinks about the intriguing history between the Elves of the woodland realm and Thorin's ancestors, because we are too busy watching the beardless Dwarf Kili (or, who knows, maybe it's Fili! They're all interchangeable and most don't talk!) flirt with a character that Peter Jackson invented! Bilbo, and this is a statistical fact (don't research it, just take my word for it), has less screen time than any title character since Godot. The movie is better when Bilbo is in it, which he is at the very beginning and again towards the end just before a Scooby Doo chase scene starts between Smaug and the Dwarvеs. But as appealing as the intrepid Hobbit is in his fleeting cameos, before you can say 'second breakfast' Jackson's rickety roller coaster is off again and Bilbo's out of sight. Maybe in the three-hour final movie Jackson will somehow find time to squeeze Bilbo in, either during the action of the Battle of Five Armies or, if the film can accommodate such luxuries in such a short runtime, during moments of dialogue. For a refresher on how to achieve this sort of thing, Jackson should refer to his own beautiful and character-rich adaptations of the Lord of the Rings.",4,8,12,28 February 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," In comparison with LOTR, this must be considered one of the most disappointing films of the early millennium
","In 'The Hobbit,' the excessive and already-aged parts of Peter Jackson's successful 'Lord of the Rings' adaptations are ballooned to proportions more suitable for a parody, and they crowd out the elements that made the first trilogy an instant classic. Jackson preferences artificial beasts over dialogue, and comically bad action over character development. There is so much hectic running from one poorly-animated danger to the next that there is no time to revel in the beautiful landscapes of New Zealand that stole the show in the 'Lord of the Rings.' Even in Rivendell, a natural resting point for the characters and the story, the script remains so thin that Bilbo, the title character and ostensible hero, is given nothing to do or say. Yet two scenes later we are asked to believe that he would abandon his adventure to return there. This is sloppy storytelling.Even the return of Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee's beloved characters fall flat, their words wasted on a poor decision to retcon the Witch King's backstory. Permit me an esoteric digression on this important point: if, in Jackson's version, the Witch King has been thought entombed lo these many years, why do Denethor and Boromir exist in Jackson's LOTR, and what is the significance of the title 'Return of the King' to Jackson's version of the Tolkien universe? People who know Tolkien's lore well will understand what I mean. Moreover, who defeated and entombed him? No man could have; we know that much from Jackson's movies. There is of course no acceptable answer, and 'The Hobbit''s treatment of the Witch King is one of Jackson's many senseless and wrongheaded deviations from the texts and from his own previous films.It's OK for movie adaptations to modify their source material, but in this case the changes make the content and tone of 'The Hobbit' difficult to reconcile with the trilogy that it supposedly sets up. In LOTR, Jackson and his co-writers went out of their way to insert minor elements of lore into the films, right down to the the trees flanking the Hollin Gate into Moria. They leaned heavily on the texts, adding and subtracting from them judiciously rather than with giddy abandon. As a result, Jackson's LOTR films reflected a great deal of the richness and resonance of the novels. By comparison, 'The Hobbit' must rank as one of the most disappointing film experiences of the early 21st century.",3,7,11,22 March 2014
Zulu," Shamelessly romanticized, but entertaining and influential
","By 1964 the British empire had collapsed and the crown's former possessions had gained political independence. That year, 'Zulu' offered film-goers a vision of British hardiness in the face of fierce native resistance. The film does not acknowledge the irony of its own existence or offer political commentary or even stick to the facts of the events it depicts; is a shameless exercise in romanticism and war-movie heroics. Yet it is a rich and rewarding film nevertheless. The look and sound of the encircling Zulu army create an atmosphere that filmmakers have often sought to replicate, as Peter Jackson did with his orc hordes in 'The Lord of the Rings' in the early 2000s.",7,0,6,17 June 2013
Lawrence of Arabia," An unambiguously glorious film about an ambiguous, vainglorious life
","The people who come to T.E. Lawrence's funeral at the beginning of David Lean's biopic to end all biopics set forth two interpretations of the man that this film grapples with over its almost 4-hour runtime. Some are there to mourn a hero, a man who seemed to embody British hardiness and courage in an age of empire and global war. These true believers had followed his exploits as a leader in the Arab uprising against Ottoman rule, and for them he was an exotic, dashing figure out of Oriental legend, but with blue eyes and blond hair. Others in the crowd at Lawrence's massive public funeral are there not to mourn him, but to mark the passing of a rude, irresponsible braggart. Many present claim to have known him, but the ones who knew him best seem to be the ones who like him least. With this dichotomy of opinion in mind, the film takes us through the key events in Lawrence's campaigns. It does not insist upon a particular interpretation, but neither does it try to remain merely (and impossibly) objective.The depictions of Lawrence's treks across the desert have a majesty rarely equaled. Lean holds long shots of endless sand and blinding blue skies until they become sublime. Other directors known for their landscapes, like John Ford and Peter Jackson, usually have the advantage of filming soaring mountain ranges or colorful canyons, but Lean and his 3-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Freddie Young take vistas and palettes that are almost minimalist and turn them into visions of raw beauty. The score by Maurice Jarre, also a 3-time Academy Award recipient (all of Jarre's and Young's Oscars were for their collaborations with Lean) does its part and more, bringing a weighty romanticism to each scene and mirroring Lawrence's own unbounded emotionality.But of course the greatest and most indispensable element of the film is Peter O'Toole's performance as Lawrence. The young actor manages to present both Lawrences, the compelling and the off-putting, as a complete person with an inner universe of ambition and fear and assuredness and madness that he wears on his sleeve but that remains tantalizingly unknowable, the way historical figures' essential natures almost always are. O'Toole draws attention to himself seemingly without trying, even while sharing scenes with actors of such skill and presence as Omar Sharif, Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, and Claude Raines, to whom are given most of the script's juiciest one-liners.I used to quibble with the sequence in which which Lawrence is taken captive by a Turkish commander during a nighttime sabotage mission and subjected to an implied threat of sexual abuse. I had always felt that it didn't quite fit; it suggested ideas that did not return for exploration later and that did not seem to have a lasting effect on Lawrence in spite of O'Toole's particularly tormented performance in the scene. I changed my mind about it when I learned, as many fans of the movie probably know well, that it is based on Lawrence's own public account of the incident. His private account, uncovered much later in a letter he wrote to a confidant, suggests that more happened than he was willing to admit, and O'Toole's heightened acting in this moment now seems perfectly consistent with the real Lawrence feelings about the event. I now think that to go further with this scene or to call it back later would be to enter the realm of speculation, while to omit it would be to excise one of the most remarkable episodes in Lawrence's own writings.The real Lawrence was an unreliable but fascinating narrator of his adventures, and the film adaptation of his life is exceptionally effective at creating a well-rounded portrait of the man. By the end, we cannot agree with the people at his funeral who see only the courageous and noble Lawrence. We have seen him at his most unstable, and have learned to question his motives and his sanity. In a moment of obvious but delicious irony, we have seen him, his identity concealed, earn the enmity of one of the very men who would later speak highly of him. All the same, we cannot dismiss him as easily as his detractors. His achievements are too spectacular, the life he lived too remarkable not to elicit some degree of admiration. As for the movie itself, the degree of admiration warranted is unambiguously very, very high.",10,0,1,19 February 2014
Frozen," A revision of the Disney Princess mold, from the absence of a villain (mostly) to the messages of empowerment and acceptance
","Word is that in its original conception 'Frozen' was to feature a traditional Disney villain, namely the magically-empowered older of the two starring sisters. Wiser counsel prevailed, and in the movie that came into existence the sisters are given the freedom to be real. While they fill the narrative spaces that are usually occupied by hero and villain, they are not constrained by the usual limitations of those categories. The principle character, Anna (Kristen Bell), is naive and sympathetic, while the exiled Elsa (Idina Menzel) is uncommunicative and sympathetic. Disney movies have pitted two women against each other before, as in the case of Aurora and Maleficent or Ariel and Ursula, but in those cases the lines between them were black and white and the characterizations were rooted in traditional dichotomies of appearance and mannerism. In 'Frozen' the sisters are instead cut from the same mold, and as the movie progresses they become more alike rather than less so. For most of the movie there really is no 'bad guy' (when one is suddenly revealed towards the end it feels too convenient, more in service of plot than character), and this creative decision puts the focus on internal conflicts that are more nuanced than the external ones that usually drive Disney stories.The girls are, rather than enemies, profoundly different in their essential natures without either being held up as an ideal or a monster. They differ in a way that is gloriously open to all sorts of interpretation; I, as an introvert and an older sibling, take the story to be an illustration of introversion versus extroversion, but it may just as well be about sexual orientation or other ways in which people are what they are regardless of social pressure to the contrary. Those layers of meaning, like the revisionism of the romantic storyline (the main love interest is a typical Han Solo type, but his role in Anna's life is that of sidekick rather than savior), is something that children who grow up with the movie may consciously appreciate only when they revisit it as teenagers and young adults. They will surely find that it holds up well over the years, and they should count themselves lucky that such an intelligent and affirming film is the iconic Disney product of their generation. It is probably better and better for you—and I say this as a fan of the entire Disney canon— than 'The Little Mermaid's of my generation or the 'Sleeping Beauty's of generations past.Contemporary, plasticky 3D animation of which I am usually not a fan is put to use in 'Frozen' a way that makes it almost artistically necessity instead of merely economically efficient (though the girls' eyes surely did not need to be so anime-like in scale). An early scene in which the 3D Anna poses in front of 2D oil paintings would be hard to replicate in traditional, hand-drawn animation. As for the songs, Disney films have never lacked for good ones, and at least two from 'Frozen' ('Do You Want to Build a Snowman?' and 'Let it Go') have already rightly become classics. The songs do a lot of the narrative work, particularly in the early set-dressing stages, and as good as they are it would have been nice if the script had devoted one or two additional spoken scenes to Elsa in her ice palace. To ask for a movie to be longer than it is is of course not a criticism but a compliment.",9,6,16,26 April 2014
The Man Who Would Be King," A fun morality adventure tale with superb acting and directing
","The credits of 'The Man Who Would Be King' say it all: John Huston, film's equivalent of a great landscape painter, directed; Sean Connery, Michael Caine, and Christopher Plummer, a triumvirate of actors more British (and maybe more famous) than the Queen, starred; the script was adapted from a story by Rudyard Kipling, the scribe laureate of the Pax Brittanica. Not since 'Lawrence of Arabia' (1962) had an entry in the de facto genre of British Empire Adventure been so well-shot, well- acted, and well-written. The story is straightforward, at times even predictable, but this is not the same as being simplistic or unedifying. It is a morality tale, nearly identical in plot and tone to Huston's classic 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,' but the morals here are more intricately expressed. There are perhaps different morals to glean from it, depending on which point of view you take. There is the viewpoint of Michael Caine's Peachy, a con man with a seemingly nihilistic view of life who would, however, never abandon a friend or break a contract. There is Sean Connery's Danny, brave and fair-minded but with perhaps more ambition than sense. And there is Rudyard Kipling himself, played by Plummer behind mustache and makeup that make him a near dead-ringer for the writer, who is envisioned here as a level- headed observer of spectacular people, events, and places who knows how not to go too far. The joy of the tale is in seeing these personalities play out the inevitable outcome of a mad trek into the Asian hinterland, and then pondering the political, religious, cultural, and historical messages that have been artfully and entertainingly conveyed.",10,1,4,2 November 2013
Ghostbusters," 'Ghostbusters' is as silly and as flawed as its creators, but it is as iconic as them, too
","'Ghostbusters' is a Three Stooges short by way of National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live. Nearly every Stooges routine saw the bumbling trio dressed in the garb of some profession, exterminators one day, delivery men the next, in order to get them through the client's door and into the room with the fine china, which they would promptly dismantle in slapstick fashion. The Stooges as 'paranormal investigators' could only have been a matter of time. In 'Ghostbusters' Bill Murray's Dr. Venkman is the Moe of the operation. To him it's all a scam, a way to meet and impress women. He thinks he's savvier than the others, but we know that the alpha Stooge is still a Stooge. The other two, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, are both straight-faced Larrys, because Curly is a one-of-a-kind. Aykroyd and Ramis are easily cowed but earnest, and could almost pass as intellectuals. Then a third Larry is added, Ernie Hudson, or maybe he's a Shemp. Or maybe the analogy breaks down. In any case, much of 'Ghostbusters''s humor is as old-fashioned and corny as that of the Stooges. 'We should split up.' 'Good idea, we'll do more damage that way.' This tried-and-true joke is followed by the Ghostbusters' destruction of a ritzy dining room in front of a gaggle of horrified blue-bloods, just like the Stooges used to do.At the same time, a great deal of 'Ghostbusters''s humor is rooted in its characters. The script's very dry lines are not brilliantly funny in their own right. The famous ones, like 'Don't cross the streams' and 'Are you the key-master?' make little sense out of context. But they become funny and quotable because they issue from the mouths of well-drawn characters like the professorial Ramis, the dweebish Rick Moranis, and the comically-sultry Sigourney Weaver. Coauthors Aykroyd and Ramis exhibit a knack for writing these distinctive voices, and the film is perfectly cast even though Murray and Moranis were originally meant to be John Belushi and John Candy.Yet two of the most celebrated of this group of 80s entertainers are double-edged swords. Murray's comedic persona and Ramis's work for Lampoon are characterized by condescension as much as self- deprecation, and they have down-punching impulses that color the comedy of 'Ghostbusters.' The Stooges never displayed anything like a 'frat boy' mentality. Venkman's gender-specific mockery of a female-bodied demon toward the end of the film may be in character, but it feels as if we're expected to laugh with him rather than at him as we've mostly done up to this point. To do that would require us to find slurs against women humorous for their own sake, and only the grossest and most simple-minded opponents of political correctness laugh just because a woman is called a bitch and a minx. The dialogue here is tonally wrong and mars an otherwise glorious climax.Aykroyd is a different matter. Though he gained fame alongside the infamously misogynistic Belushi, he was perhaps the least smarmy of the early SNL cast. He plays his 'Ghostbusters' role with an almost touching naivety that is perhaps to be expected in light of his real-life passion for the paranormal. Perhaps it is his influence on the screenplay that accounts for Venkman's cynicism dropping away unremarked after two scenes. And perhaps it is his belief in the otherworldly that informs the casting of a government agent as the chief obstacle to the truth. Such plotting is extraordinarily silly, albeit in a different way from the characters' Stooge-like silliness. But when it works, it is equally charming.",7,0,0,7 October 2014
The Longest Day," A movie so huge it needs repeat viewings
","An hour and a half into the movie we're still meeting new characters, most of whom are played by major celebrities of the day. Though many of these characters appear in only a couple of scenes, they are introduced with text at the bottom of the screen giving their name and rank. This technique is not necessarily helpful in keeping track of the action, as there are simply too many characters to memorize during a single sitting, but on repeat viewings the pieces should fall more perfectly into place. And fans of classic war pictures will want to see this one more than once, as the story is enormously entertaining. The storming of the beaches is a monumental action sequence that gives the impression of a full-scale recreation. The Nazi characters' use of actual German rather than German- accented English lends a sense of realism that sets the movie apart from many other war epics of the period. Toward the end of this largely triumphant narrative, Richard Burton's world-weary RAF pilot offers a touch of cynicism that also rings true.",9,1,2,19 June 2013
Lincoln," An unsatisfying hagiography rife with creaky one-liners
","Historical accuracy is not a necessity in movies, but one would have thought we had advanced beyond hagiography in our biopics. When Lincoln speaks, the slow zoom and the swelling music give the obnoxious impression that God himself is speaking through the 16th president, a man whose racial views were, though arguably progressive for their time, far from egalitarian or inclusive. Daniel Day-Lewis looks and by all accounts sounds the part, but the cheesy script leaves much to be desired. The historically-fascinating character of Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) is mostly wasted on laugh lines, as are side characters like James Spader's Bilbo. On the plus side, it is always nice to see Hal Holbrook, and David Strathairn shines as a grave-faced William Seward of 'Seward's Folly' fame.",3,1,4,17 June 2013
Annie Hall," Self-aware? Yes. Hilarious? Incredibly. Self-deprecating? The jury is out.
","Woody Allen is famously self-aware, but is he also self-deprecating? Some of 'Annie Hall''s funniest scenes feature him being deprecating to others: a film professor who has no capacity to understand how pretentious he sounds, an alternative theater actor of the kind that cultivates artiness but would never admit to any affectation, and innumerable shallow everymen and women who populate the earth but fail to appreciate life's existential dilemmas. There is a hilarious moment ('hilarious moment' is a redundancy in this film, as is 'cringe-worthy moment') in which Allen's character tries to navigate a car out of a parking lot, and his inability to do so almost seems self-mocking until you remember that it's a way of making a point about the superiority of New York's public transportation and sidewalks. Allen (his character is not named Woody Allen, but the veil is barely there) also makes an issue out of having gone to therapy sessions for 15 years, but it's up for debate whether his lack of progress there is meant to be taken as a statement on how much is wrong with him or on the inability of professionals to help those whose eyes have so keenly pierced the void. In either case, Allen shows himself in 'Annie Hall' to be not merely self-aware, but very good at recognizing the nature of others. His story and Diane Keaton's acting make Annie an incredibly vivid personality, fully sympathetic, whose arc must take her through Woody and on to other, if not necessarily better, things.",10,1,1,12 December 2013
This Is Spinal Tap," 'Spinal Tap''s great feat is to mock music with music
","Ironically, although the 'mock' in this mockumentary is directed at various shades of rock between the British Invasion and the hair band era, the music of 'Spinal Tap' is actually quite good. At the very least, it's good at being bad, and that's sometimes more than enough to get a song to the top of the charts. It's not exactly the quality, but the believability of the music being lampooned that makes 'Spinal Tap' a great piece of satire. Like any good band documentary, the story of Spinal Tap is told through their music: they had more artistic phases than The Beatles, more previous members than Black Sabbath, and fell from grace like Guns 'N Roses, and at every stage their material is brilliantly, unmistakably derivative of those legends and their ilk. It's one thing to know exactly what's pretentious and corny and laughable about those acts, great as they all were, but it's another and deeply impressive thing to be able to showcase their excesses through music. Spinal Tap's early, Ed Sullivan-esque days sees them in mop tops and suits, singing jangly, catchy, teeny-bopper pop that really feels imported from the mid 1960s. Same for their flower- power days, the absurd put-ons of their goth rock era, the wanna-be virtuoso indulgence of their progressive experimentalism, and most of all, their preening, testosterone-driven glam rock of the late 1970s and early 80s. This last subgenre is the one the movie skewers most ruthlessly: the ridiculous songs 'Heavy Duty' and 'Big Bottom' are two of the wittiest and most scatological in the film, and at the same time are only slight exaggerations of real-life analogues.Much of the non-musical material in 'Spinal Tap' works just as brilliantly. The script is quotable in the extreme. It is concise and cutting with its observations on the music industry, as in hilarious dispute over a sexist album cover between a label executive (Fran Drescher) and Christopher Guests's oblivious lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (one of many delightfully English names in the film).At times, the movie is as earnest and emotional as real band documentaries can be. The Lennon/McCartney-inspired arc between best friends Nigel and David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) could almost have been the focus of a straight drama. Near the end, that storyline strains the mockumentary format as the proportion of sentiment to snark shifts in favor of the former, but by this time the points have been scored. Spinal Tap has all the foibles of history's great rock bands, so it would be unfair, and inaccurate, if they didn't take on their essential likability, too.",9,0,3,25 October 2014
Rocky," Back when Rocky was a real guy, not just a symbol
","Everyone knows that Rocky represents underdogs, the American dream, the spirit of the Italian immigrant community, and Philadelphia. He represents those things so effectively that at some point in the history of the Rocky franchise the tail starts to wag the dog, and he starts to do things that might make sense for America itself to do—like waging the Cold War—instead of things that make sense for a soft-hearted, unprepossessing guy from the neighborhood to do. But watch the Rocky film that won the Academy Award and it's clear that the character as originally conceived by Sylvester Stallone is more than just a simple shorthand for the USA. For example, he's a little vain. He doesn't have much to show for himself after ten years in the lower echelons of the boxing circuit, but he does have an unbroken nose, and he's clearly 'proud o' dat.' He also notices when a poster of him has the wrong color scheme for his boxing shorts. The promoter replies, 'It doesn't really matter, does it?' but to Rocky it does. He's obviously not as flashy as heavyweight champ Apollo Creed (and Apollo, it must be noticed, embodies in his own way American pomp-and-circumstance and American mythmaking), but he doesn't think Creed's a clown for the way he shows off. On the contrary, he admires Creed, and when he says that Creed 'looks like a big flag' it's just a statement of fact, with no hint of censure. Rocky's love of animals is another interesting quirk. In a meat freezer his pressing question is who killed all the cows, and when someone sees his beloved pet turtles as potential meals he's not amused. As a boxer he probably feels more like meat or a bird in a cage than a human sometimes. These hints of depth in Rocky's character aren't there to be belabored and overanalyzed, though. They're there to help make him seem real, like people we know or can easily imagine to exist. After all, he's not just some one-dimensional cartoon in star- spangled shorts; that's supposed to be Creed. Until, perhaps inevitably, it is Rocky, in Rocky IV. But it wasn't always that way.",8,0,0,16 November 2013
Some Like It Hot," Billy Wilder shows his range, and proves again his writing chops
","A comedy about cross-dressing is a surprising choice of subject matter for Billy Wilder, who is best known for his film noir morality tales. But his knack for multi-layered dialogue and sardonic humor work just as well here as in his more serious films. The premise of 'Some Like it Hot' is absurd, and if there were no genuine laughs then the behavior of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon's characters might easily come across as obnoxious and offensive. But there are laughs, and they come so rapidly and so often at the expense of the lead characters that these pitfalls are averted. Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe are so well cast that they are effectively playing themselves.",10,8,9,18 June 2013
The Untouchables," The movie's many flaws are more fun than infuriating
","The first few scenes of 'The Untouchables' show off director Brian de Palma's skill at creating expectations, subverting them, and manipulating the audience, three modes that he uses to good effect and bad over the course of the film. It is important that we like Treasury Department investigator Elliott Ness, the man who brings down Al Capone, because this is his story. But as the stiff, humorless enforcer of two deeply unpopular laws, Prohibition and the U.S. tax code, sympathy for him is hardly automatic. De Palma creates that sympathy in short order through a series of carefully crafted moments. First, he makes Ness's foe a larger-than-life villain. Robert de Niro's Capone is a grotesque monster, cocky and immature as a school bully, but incalculably more frightening. His first on-screen victim is a 10-year-old girl, and just like that the audience is out of his corner. The camera is always markedly above or below de Niro so that his face and body, swollen by decadence, bulge out in unnatural and off- putting ways. By contrast, Kevin Costner's Ness is quiet, steady, unassuming, and life-size. The camera looks straight at him as he keeps his composure in the face of a news crew's cynical heckling. Their faceless taunting, and his defenselessness, puts the audience on Ness's side even though Costner has far less natural charismatic than de Niro. But de Palma is not through crafting his protagonist: instead of being truly untouchable, a flawless Superman, the first major set piece sees Ness engage in farcical vainglory. He shouts 'Let's do some good!' as he drives a truck through a warehouse wall, only to find that his first big bust is a big bust. Seeing Ness humbled is the final piece of de Palma's masterful opening arc. By humanizing him, by refusing to make him simply pure in counterpoise to Capone's simple evil, de Palma makes a killjoy Fed into a hero worth rooting for.Unfortunately, de Palma's deftness at audience manipulation and his penchant for highly-manufactured staging have their downsides. The plot unfolds in a series of violent vignettes, and while these are exciting and memorable entries in the long tradition of shoot-em-up cinema, de Palma does not always know how much is too much and where to draw the line. The first big showdown takes place on a bridge, and the visuals are great. We see the plan unfold clearly. But the music is all wrong for the moment. It sounds almost comical, and is the kind of music that can only be played after the fact because its tension-killing jauntiness indicates that none of the principles are going to die. The film is scored by universally-acknowledged genius Ennio Morricone, so the fault must lie with de Palma for putting the music in the wrong place. In the next major bloodbath, which involves Sean Connery's quotable Irish cop Malone and a pair of assassins, de Palma switches to first-person view for an extended shot that moves seamlessly through a window and up and down a hallway. This technique is often used in schlock horror, but it works just as well to build tension in a period piece drama. As a bonus, it showcases the movie's excellent set dressing; the 1930-ish furniture and fixtures are museum-display perfect, yet feel authentic and lived-in. The end of this sequence has enough bullets that it really must result in an immediate death, but for the sake of melodrama de Palma stretches out the victim's life in a way that is unforgivably unbelievable. The loss of believability is only compounded in the movie's final act, in which de Palma detaches the film from the realm of physical probability in order to indulge in a slow-motion massacre on a staircase. It is an obvious homage to the famous Odessa Staircase scene in Sergei Eisenstein's 'The Battleship Potemkin' (1925), which popularized the telescoping of time as a way to tell several small stories that occur in the same place at the same moment. It looks great, and it's gripping, but when it ends we can feel that we've been played.The conclusion of the film is too easy, even corny, completing de Palma's drift away from stylized reality and into pure fantasy. Stray elements of the movie—the wife, the determined photographer, the corrupt police chief—never reach their full potential. 'The Untouchables' can't be considered a flawless film by a long shot, but as a playground for big, bold personalities like de Niro, Connery, and de Palma, it's absolutely a fun one.",8,1,4,30 November 2014
Die Hard," Heart and the ability to surprise make 'Die Hard' a gem among action movies
","The very best action movies are the ones in which the heroes are like us. As fun as a good James Bond movie can be, his been-there, done- that demeanor can't help but put a low ceiling on the stakes. But when the star is more or less an average person swept into a crisis unwilling and unprepared, there is a sense, however artificial, that anything might happen. There is also the possibility that the character will exhibit real emotional range. Deep into 'Die Hard,' after Bruce Willis's John McClane has wasted over half a dozen terrorists and proved himself a master of gunplay, explosives, and witty repartee many times over, his voice still cracks with fear and heartache. That humanity, buried only shallowly below the swagger and the caked blood (lots of blood), is no small part of the movie's successful formula.Another is its ability to create surprises between the inevitable moments that define the genre. The fact that bad guys waste their advantage over McClane by toying with him instead of shooting him outright, and that he uses each such reprieve to regain the upper hand, is a given. But there are several situations that seem entirely fresh. Alan Rickman's criminal mastermind, a man of ambiguous motivations, mercurial identity, and palpable confidence, finds himself unexpectedly in McClane's hands. Because the movie has been so carefully plotted and has kept McClane largely isolated from friends and foes alike, this is the first time the two stars have come face to face. We know the bad guy recognizes McClane, but we do not know what McClane knows. The movie seems to move in slow motion for several moments as this inventive situation plays out.The supporting cast is a veritable parade of cynical expectations and pleasant subversions thereof. Two seemingly expendable black characters, a chauffeur and a cop, show up early in the movie. The cop, Al (Reginald VelJohnson), even mentions a pregnant wife. We've heard this kind of thing before; in a more typical movie, one or both of them would bite the bullet as a way to create quick pathos. But just when they seem to be on the cusp of ignoble sacrifice or of missing the chance to call for backup, leaving McClane alone and outnumbered for maximum heroism, things get interesting instead. The chauffeur hunkers down in the garage for a long while before coming back into play in a modest way, but Al dodges certain death to become McClane's partner-at-large. 'Die Hard' is not normally remembered as a buddy cop movie, but in large measure it is. The dynamic that 'Lethal Weapon' defined plays out almost to a tee as the Al and McClane bond over their wives and their careers. The homoerotic dimension of the genre is present, too; McClane and Al's hug at the end is even more emotionally charged than McClane and his wife's. After that, the trope of the bad guy coming back for one last shot happens exactly as it does in Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's earlier film, which like 'Die Hard' takes place during Christmas. But 'Die Hard,' not to be outdone, finds yet a third emotional beat to finish on. McClane's wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) is a strong and central figure throughout the movie, which makes a socially-conscious statement about women in the workplace and never places her in sexualized peril. Appropriately but still surprisingly, it is Holly who gets the final word. Also appropriately, she delivers it with her fist.Not everything about the film is as brilliantly-conceived as McClane's explosive romp through the Nakatomi Plaza or his vulnerable, equitable relationships with his wife and his colleague. The movie continues an action movie legacy of paranoia established at least as long ago as 'Dirty Harry.' The press and law enforcement bureaucracy are cast as self-interested bumblers, as dangerous in their way as the murderous criminals. It's not an unreasonable position to take, but it's unreasonable to think that a hostage negotiator would be as distracted and preening as Paul Gleason's character, or that an FBI big-shot would be as evidently unstable as Robert Davi's. The casting is right, and these skilled actors' shifty faces could have spoken for themselves without so much on-the-nose dialogue.This, though, is a quibble. Too much about the movie works, too much is surprising, too many characters are likable and reasonably real, to conclude that 'Die Hard' is anything less than one of the best action films ever made. I want to watch it again the minute the classical credit music ends, and that's a rare impulse for me irrespective of genre.",9,3,3,31 January 2015
The Bridge on the River Kwai," 'Kwai' is a thing that hardly exists anymore: a big-budget war film that is observational and cerebral, not triumphalist
","'Bridge on the River Kwai' is two big movies in one, and they're both fantastic. Both tell fantastic tales of duty and self-sacrifice through big personalities brought to life by incomparable actors. But there are no idealized heroes here; everyone is as much wrong as they are right, and they are as motivated by pride and stubbornness as much as principles. While a power-tripping General Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) tests Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness)'s commitment to the international rules of war, a crack saboteur (Jack Hawkins) dragoons a deserter (William Holden) into doing a soldier's duty. These stories are ingeniously structured and interwoven so that all threads come to unexpected and compromised conclusions. A character may appear to win his battle, but if so, we may be certain that he will lose his war, and vice versa. Nicholson manfully (as the British might say) makes his point about the treatment of prisoners, and it is stirring to see him submit to severe mistreatment for the sake of an idea. But his real objective is not to uphold the rule of law, but to wound the pride of his foe, Saito, and to establish himself as the most influential— albeit imprisoned—figure in the camp. Once done, he zealously carries out the task Saito always intended for him, and in the fullness of his pride he does it better than he otherwise might have. Meanwhile, the would-be deserter Shears escapes from the prison camp and nearly escapes from the army as well, but the saboteur Warden traps him with the rule book. Nicholson and Shears are each prisoners, and each is used as a means to an end, but their arcs are also inversions of one another. Nicholson faces down his captor, but the determination that brought him that victory is also what leads him to undermine the army he loves. Shears submits to Warden and to the inescapable logic of the army he longs to leave, but in the end his personal sacrifice is a net gain for the cause. Lest the army come out smelling like a rose, victorious and free of compromise, Hawkins plays Warden as a cold man who in a second would sacrifice not only the charming audience surrogate Shears, but a group of female Thai porters as well. His Pyrrhic destruction of Nicholson's magnificent if misguided bridge is the occasion of the film's final word: 'Madness!' There is a great deal of madness on display, but it is conveyed through wide-awake plotting and characterization.David Lean's direction and Jack Hildyard's cinematography convey sweltering heat: the heat of the jungle, of Saito's tent and Nicholson's box, of Shears's beach and Warden's bungalow. But there is also a conscious distance separating audience from action. Whether framing a huge, explosive set piece with dozens of extras or a tense huddle over a table, the cameras are detached observers rather than participants. We see the big picture and think about why people act the way they do in their particular settings. We know them better than they know themselves, and understand each truth before it dawns on them. 'Kwai,' then, is a thing that hardly exists now: a big-budget war film that is observational and cerebral, not just gritty and melodramatic. Nor is it a simple matter of good versus evil. Though not at all a complicated movie to follow, its moral complexity is such that British audiences (and even some of the British actors) could feel it was anti-British, while Japanese audiences found it anti-Japanese. The movie is critical of all blind zealotry, and no wonder: screenwriters Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson had to go uncredited as a result of a Hollywood blacklist. Despite being an an uncomfortable watch for partisans and flag-wavers of all stripes, 'Kwai' was a huge hit with audiences and critics, winning the 1958 box office and heaps of awards. Not everything has held up in the nearly 60 years since. The day-for-night shots, standard at the time, are particularly unconvincing. But the challenging messages and the flawed characters still hit hard and loom large, and the dramatic finale remains one of the great benchmarks of cinema.",10,3,4,22 January 2015
Jaws," An impeccably-made summer popcorn thriller where the characters are as important as the creature
","Making a movie monster that is genuinely, viscerally scary is not easy. Making it scary in broad daylight, when artificiality cannot be hidden away in shadow, is even harder. Hardest of all is creating movie characters that archetypal enough to become iconic yet human enough to connect with each other and with the audience on more than a surface level. 'Jaws' makes all of these things look ridiculously easy. It's such an engrossing, enjoyable (even when startling) experience that its quality is something you feel on an instinctive, subconscious level rather than something you can think about and convince yourself of. Only during an umpteenth watching might you be able to pry yourself out of the moment long enough to consider why it works so well. I think the crucial ingredient in the alchemy, more than the life-like and glassy-eyed shark robots that famously never worked during shooting, more than the heart-pounding zoom on the beach as Chief Brody realizes that the shark and his child are both in the pond, more than the brilliant and artful editing in the next scene as he runs faster and faster through the crowd of beachgoers while the camera jumps closer and closer to him, and even more than the John Williams score that is surely the most imitated among his oeuvre of unlikely hits... more than these, I think it is the characters and the casting that seal 'Jaws''s place as one of the best movies of all time.Roy Scheider is Chief Brody, a serious cop type with the rather obvious quirk of hating the water, but he plays the role with a method-esque realism that allows us to imagine ourselves in his shoes. Scheider plays Brody on the edge, well shy of neurotic but definitely bottling a lot in, and it doesn't take much to tip him over into anger, fear or, finally, joy. He's up against two much less method-y, much less bottled-up actors and characters: Richard Dreyfuss's nerdy, cocky scientist and Robert Shaw's... well, adjectives fall short of what Shaw creates for Quint, the captain of the Orca. Quint is the broadest, most familiar archetype in the film, a salty sea dog who reckons experience over book-learning, but Shaw fills the character to overflowing with history and personality. His monologue about the real-life 1945 sinking of the USS Indianapolis, filmed in a long unbroken take that feels eerily still and breathless, is the highlight of the movie. Slow, quiet monologues are NEVER the highlights of thrillers, horrors, and summer popcorn fare. But 'Jaws' is unique. These three characters bounce off each other and at any moment can and do explode into conflict, but they also have enough depth that each one can lock in with the others in interesting and unexpected ways. Sometimes it's Scheider and Dreyfuss's grounded characters against the unstable Quint. At other times it's the landlubbing Brody who's out of the loop while the two experts trade fish tales. We probably wouldn't want to join them on the boat, but they're always great fun to watch on screen. Spielberg's cameras are arranged so that three men can almost always fit in the same frame at the same time.It's impossible to imagine 'Jaws' without its supporting cast, too, especially Lorraine Gary as Ellen Brody and Murray Hamilton as Mayor Larry Vaughn, but it's the three principles who are indispensable and irreplaceable. Their absence is a big reason why none of the three Jaws sequels work or really even count. If 'Jaws 2' is tolerable, it is only the presence of Scheider that makes it so. On the other hand, even a reunion of all three main characters from the first movie couldn't have saved the stupefyingly stupid script of 'Jaws 4: The Revenge' of 'This Time It's Personal' infamy. Perhaps it is the highest testament to the quality of 'Jaws' that people went to see those later movies, in the ever-vanishing hopes that they would recapture even a glimmer of the glory of the original.",10,2,6,5 March 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The saddest casualty of 'Battle' is what remained of Peter Jackson's reputation
","In his final chance to get it right, Peter Jackson doubles down on all the problems that marred his first two 'Hobbit' palimpsests. Although he changed this installment's name from the gentle and reflective 'There and Back Again' to the 'The Battle of the Five Armies' to better reflect the overstuffed, bludgeoning nature of its content, the title is still a misnomer. The courageous, sympathetic, lovable, surprising Mr. Bilbo Baggins, played by an uninspired Martin Freeman, is too absent and inconsequential to justify being named in the title of Jackson's adaptation. 'Thorin: The Battle of the Pixel Armies' would have been closer to the mark. The reliance on animation, always a weak point in Jackson's movies, is more smothering than ever before. An entire character voiced by Billy Connolly, not a dragon or a troll but a human-ish good guy like all the other good guys, is not acted but generated with the putty-skinned, dead-eyed falsity of a video game sprite. Although Weta's computer experts no doubt do the best possible work with existing technology, the digital characters and action and backdrops look as wretched as they always do. When New Zealand's famed landscapes, so expertly employed for 'Lord of the Rings,' finally appear for a few brief seconds at the end of the film, it is as if they have been imported not only from another movie but from another art form altogether.So the story is even more non-germane, the characters even more underwritten, and the visuals even further removed from recognizable cinema in the third film than in the first and second. Those are disappointments, but they are not surprises. What is a surprise is the number of inexplicable errors about basic Middle Earth facts. It is one thing to depart from Tolkien's texts; that's a filmmaker's prerogative. Jackson, though, also departs from facts established in his own movies. That's simply bad filmmaking. The first 'Hobbit' movie made a major chronological blunder regarding the Witch King, one with profound and irreconcilable implications for the history of Gondor and its rulers, but this could be shrugged off because the relevant events are buried fairly deep in the lore. By contrast, the geographical and chronological mistakes in 'Battle of the Five Armies' pertain to the topmost layer of the tale. A citizen of Lake Town says of their Master that he is 'halfway down the Anduin by now.' The Anduin is the locus of a rather dramatic sequence in Jackson's first Tolkien movie. Because the progress of the questing party is so clearly conveyed in the 'Lord of the Rings' movies, the river's position just past the Misty Mountains is obvious even without a map. Lake Town lies on an entirely different river on the opposite side of an enormous forest. This is clear even in Jackson's muddy 'Hobbit' films not only because the passing of the Misty Mountains and the forest is a core fact of the narrative but because the map from the published text is shown on screen. Thus the line of dialogue, uttered in passing but so specific in content that it stands out from the bulk of the bland script, is contradicted by story as well as visual.But if an error of geography seems too obscure to warrant heavy censure, consider a chronological error. This comes near the end, when Legolas is told to seek out a Ranger named Strider. During the events of the Hobbit, Strider was not yet so-called; he was a child not yet 10, and he lived in Rivendell. This is known from the books, of course, but even if we allow that Jackson's films exist in an alternate reality, the problem remains intractable. Strider (Aragorn) specifies his age in Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' script, and Bilbo specifies his as well. Unless we assume that Aragorn became Strider at a much, much younger age, the simple math applies equally to the movies as to the books. Jackson's team knows the lore well—for 'Five Armies' they dig up a minor Orc stronghold from the bowels of Tolkien's appendices in order to give Legolas an unnecessary side plot and an even more unnecessary backstory—so how did it come to pass that 'The Hobbit' movies make such egregious mistakes that undermine the shared universe of Jackson's acclaimed 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy?Clearly there was an unsteady hand at the tiller. The goodwill that Jackson won with his stellar Tolkien adaptation in the early 2000s is the saddest casualty of his 'Battle of the Five Armies.'",2,17,33,30 December 2014
Carrie," Carrie makes up for its excesses with a smart script
","Teen horror is a minefield of a genre, and all too often strays into exploitation, silly casting, and heavyhandedness. 'Carrie' isn't above such criticism, but at least it compensates for its missteps. After getting off on the wrong foot with an egregious locker room scene, director Brian de Palma reins it in and puts together one of the best Stephen King film adaptations. The fact that some of the male actors look like they're in their 30s, or that John Travolta's accent is not of this world, hardly matters because the script is so intelligent and the story so easy to get wrapped up in. The mother's religious ramblings don't sound like run-of-the-mill gibberish, but rather seem to hint at specific personal demons and to spring from the head of a real character who contains multitudes and contradictions. This is true also of the film's other adult lead, Carrie's gym teacher and mentor. She has a good read on the alpha girl bullies, the hangers-on, and the outcasts in her class, but this savviness doesn't make her immune to the occasional and serious miscalculation. In a great scene in which she interrogates a girlfriend and boyfriend she suspects of pulling a prank, her zeal to protect Carrie blinds her to the little clues that we pick up on: the girl is trying to do the right thing but doesn't know how to express this clearly to the adult, and the boy is vain and flip but clearly not the type to plan a complicated revenge. The film's many plot threads and idiosyncratic characters pay off in a big way with the famous climax, but the movie has a hard time settling on an ending after that and tosses in some needless 'I see what you did there' shots that, if nothing else, provide a bookend to the excessive opening.",8,3,4,11 November 2013
Raging Bull," Style is the servant of story, so Scorcese's talents cannot compensate for derivative and dull plotting
","Martin Scorcese's adaptation of a boxer's autobiography also contains content adapted (or, less generously, plagiarized) from previous films. The elements of the story that Scorcese emphasizes are the same that were at the core of 'Rocky,' and it is therefore fair to draw comparisons between the two: an Italian-American boxer who fights an African-American boxer and loses, an overshadowed wife figure, and a short, pudgy brother figure who doubles as a manager. What Scorcese's film does not have is any of the heart and sweetness that made 'Rocky' enjoyable. Perhaps he hoped to replace the sweetness and light with a more realistic, hardcore sentiment, but he got only as far as the blood and gore and cursing, and forgot to add any meaning. There are no stakes to Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro)'s fights, as there were for Rocky's: Jake's life winds up the same regardless of their outcome. It's difficult to find a reason to care whether he wins or loses, unless you're content to root for him because he's the main character. 'Rocky' knew that wasn't a good enough reason, and fleshed out its characters and world. If there were no elements of LaMotta's book that could have given some originality and depth to the story, Scorcese should have invented some.Instead of filling in the story's sizable gaps with original content, Scorcese rips off 'The Godfather' in completely needless, bizarrely particular ways. There are grainy pictures at a wedding party where everyone is wearing the exact clothes from the beginning of Coppola's movie, and one character even reaches over to bring a woman in a red dress and wide-brimmed hat into the shot. Why import this familiar scene, stripping it of the layers of meaning it enjoyed in its original context? It adds nothing to 'Raging Bull,' not even the reflected luster of the superior film being copied. Later, during one of many interminable and repetitive domestic abuse scenes, a man chases his wife into a bathroom through a narrow, mirrored side-door. The door swings mostly shut, but he throws it open again. Some of the angles are the same as in that famous, far more important and meaningful scene from 'The Godfather.' Why such meticulous thievery? Again, it adds nothing to 'Raging Bull,' but it does serve to remind me of a movie I'd rather be watching, and it causes me to marvel again at the delicate plotting and characterizations that made it work in its native setting.Near the end, LaMotta deadpans a scene from 'On the Waterfront.' The audacity. The conceit. Clearly, we're being asked to marvel at how true the words are of LaMotta's life (well, of course they are, the movie has been written that way), but I'm not sure what we're supposed to feel during this scene. Are we supposed to feel sad for this wretched stereotype we've spent over two hours with? Are we supposed to take pleasure in the pathetic turn his life has taken? Never having been given a reason to care about anyone or anything on screen, I feel nothing either way. It's simply a bore to watch. There is one thing to be sad about, and that's that DeNiro's career has become uncomfortably like LaMotta's: he, too, has lately been reduced to lazily reading scripts for cash.Scorcese fans, and there are many of them who know far more about movies than I do, will say what they will about Sorcese's technical chops as a filmmaker and his fluency in the history and language of cinema. It seems inexplicable to me that so few critics saw the same 'Raging Bull' that Pauline Kael saw, about which she wrote, 'Scorsese's excesses verge on self-parody. You can feel the director sweating for greatness, but there's nothing under the scenes... De Niro's portrayal of La Motta is a swollen puppet with only bits and pieces of a character inside.' That describes the 'Raging Bull' I watched. Without a story to put Scorcese's talents in service of, they're wasted. 'Raging Bull' is preening and shallow, and every element in it was done better before and since by filmmakers who understand the primacy of narrative.",3,3,15,16 March 2014
The Producers," Wilder and Mostel are perfectly bizarre, but there isn't enough Hitler!
","In some ways, Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel are a conventional comedic duo in the vaudevillian tradition. One is skinny and awkward, the other fat and self-assured. In a typical duo, one would play the straight man caught up in the other's foolish foibles. Mel Brooks' twist is to make both characters fools in their own ways. The crazy schemes mostly come from the bombastic producer (Mostel), but the twitchy and vaguely creepy accountant (Wilder) soon becomes a willing participant. As strange as these lead characters are, both seem almost normal next to the other lunatics in the film: a raving ex-Nazi playwright, a hippie singer nicknamed 'LSD,' and caricatures of New York theater people. Brooks' brand of comedy (plenty of simple, corny, but funny ideas mixed with risquÃ© and taboo-defying humor) works well for the most part, but as with other Brooks movies a few weak jokes are stretched out too long. As a whole, though, the film actually feels too short, and more catchy tunes from its so-bad-it's-good musical 'Springtime for Hitler' would have been welcome.",7,0,1,17 June 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars felt big even before it was
","In the early 1990s when I was about 8 or 10, I had a VHS copy of 'Star Wars: A New Hope' that I watched repeatedly. It was a recording from a television broadcast and was missing the first few minutes, so the opening shots were of C-3PO and R2-D2 walking over the dunes of Tatooine. That planet is not, of course, named in the movie; strange as it is to think, there must have been a brief span of time when I knew the movie pretty well but didn't know the colossal amount of trivial information that I permanently internalized during my teen years. For a while I had no idea there were sequels. But the details and backstories that books and games and movies and TV shows have filled in over the decades were in a way already present, at least implicitly, at the outset. It is well-known that George Lucas was inspired by old sci- fi/adventure serials, and that he tried to give this 'episode' of Star Wars the feel of belonging to a far grander saga whose beginning and end were far off. It was an audacious, brilliant move, and it worked on my younger self exactly as intended. I was able to conjure images of Luke's heroic father, supposedly killed in the off-handedly mentioned Clone Wars, and I was able to get a sense of what those conflicts were like from the way that Alec Guinness looked and sounded when he talked about the past. I could feel the long history of Obi-Wan and Vader's relationship in the way they appraised each other during their showdown. I could imagine, vaguely, the previous ups and downs of the rebel alliance and the off-screen machinations of Imperial Senate. That these things were planted in my imagination made the movie feel big and epic, though it is probably the 'smallest' installment in the Star Wars franchise in terms of the size and number of sets, the number of characters with speaking roles, and other metrics. The series has not always benefited from trying to depict on-screen the people and events that were at first only evocative allusions. I sometimes wish I could forget everything I've learned from the ever-expanding Star Wars universe (and that, believe me, is a lot) in order to feel again the way I felt when all I had to go on was 'A New Hope,' and it was more than enough.",9,7,10,28 November 2013
The Great Escape," A likable ensemble in a desperate gamble
","One of many fine ensemble war epics that appeared in the 1960s, 'The Great Escape' stands apart for its exhilarating final act. After painstaking preparations in which each major character puts his particular escape- oriented skills to use, the prisoners encounter a hitch in their plan. The great escape then becomes a great race as the Germans pursue the former captives on trains, on city streets, in the air, and (in the case of Steve McQueen's character) on motorcycles. Charles Bronson, Richard Attenborough, and the rest of the ensemble are innately likable and sympathetic actors, and their relatability elevates the stakes and invites emotional investment from the viewer. The escape sequence is nail-biting but great fun to watch, as the characters we like so well confront their final, impossible barriers to freedom.",10,0,1,17 June 2013
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Pythons', and particularly Gilliam's, successful jump from short-form to long-form comedy
","Before Holy Grail, the Pythons had not shown that long-form comedy was within their range. The longest sketches on their Flying Circus TV show, like 'Scott of the Antarctic' or 'The Piranha Brothers,' ran at most ten or fifteen minutes. Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work. Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch- weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.",10,5,8,2 September 2013
The Breakfast Club," 'The Breakfast Club' should have won an armful of Oscars, but the Academy failed to see it for the triumph it was
","The brilliance of 'The Breakfast Club' is largely lost on those who think of it as a teen movie about high school archetypes. It's not a movie about a rebel, a princess, a jock, a freak, and a nerd; there are no such people. It is, apologetically, a high-concept play about people trapped in a room until they realize that their similarities are greater than their differences. It rips up Moliere—literally—and adorns itself with the clothes and music and fresh faces of the era's key movie-going demographic, but preserves the close character work, human insight, and polished bon mots of a 'serious' work for stuffy theater-goers. Among the people who didn't notice the script's incredible energy and sophistication were the voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who failed to nominate the script for Best Original Screenplay though it is worthy of favorable comparison with the likes of '12 Angry Men' and Jean-Paul Sartre's 'No Exit.' Similarly, the Academy failed to recognize the accomplishment of Ally Sheedy, who completely transformed herself from the sunny girlfriend of 'WarGames' (1983) into the impish, shocking, hilarious Allison of 'The Breakfast Club.' Audiences focused more on Molly Ringwold's girl-next-door appeal, but she is slightly miscast as an alpha female and her screen presence pales next to Sheedy's show-stealing talent. Perhaps most damning of the Academy's ability to recognize quality when it comes in the guise of a popcorn movie is the lack of an acting nomination for Judd Nelson, who shows incredible range and depth as Bender. Nelson underplays and overplays in exactly the right places as Bender's determination to speak painful truths drives the film and sets off chain reactions within the ensemble. More snubs at Oscar time included the film's tense, cerebral score, and the songs that make up its now-iconic soundtrack of 80s pop picked to play during the beginning, end, and the choreographed montages that break what could be a one-act play into a traditional three-part structure. Some might criticize the montages for being silly, dated, and disconnected from the plot, and they would be right, but the segments are fun and they let each character reveal his or her nature in a non-verbal context by the particular way that they dance on banisters and slide down hallways. The only really indefensible missteps in 'The Breakfast Club' come near the end, and the timing sours the experience. The makeover scene is hokey and regressive, a too-easy climax that was perhaps meant to suggest the mutability of image and the multiplicity of the individual, but that comes across as a defense of conformity. A related impulse to pair the characters off is unearned in at least one case and arguably both. The Anthony Michael Hall character's arc is too derivative of Billy Bibbit's in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,' though the stakes are already high enough without being raised to life and death. After all, the really interesting question presented by the film is not whether these kids will live, but how they will live. That said, 'The Breakfast Club' is not the only work of genius to botch an ending. Oscar voters, like Assistant Principle Vernon, saw only what they wanted to see and missed the chance to enshrine it in the canon. Popular opinion and critical consensus have been less blind.",8,0,0,18 November 2014
Back to the Future," '80s in every way, and still very engaging
","Back to the Future's script, almost as much as its look, mark it as a product of the 1980s. Consider the Doc Brown of 1955, who, upon learning that his future self wears a radiation suit, concludes that the reason is 'all the fallout from the atomic wars.' By 1985, nuclear war was considered unlikely enough to be funny, but the memory of the fear of it was still near enough for audiences to get the joke. The characterizations in Back to the Future are also shaped by '80s sensibilities, not only in Marty McFly's slang-slinging, rock-loving, denim-clad teen, but in the different 'present day' versions of his parents, George and Lorraine. In one timeline, the distinctly old- fashioned McFlys are at the mercy of a stylish, macho go-getter, while in a 'better' timeline they are sporty and flaunt their economic status. Their success may well have been presented differently had the film been made 10 years earlier or later when the middle class ideal was something other than a track suit and a ranch house. The time capsule that is 'Back to the Future' remains engaging and entertaining today partly despite and partly because of its clear position on our reality's timeline.",9,1,1,5 July 2013
Jurassic Park," A generation's touchstone experience
","Some alchemy makes everything about 'Jurassic Park' gold. So many elements shouldn't work, but do: the dinosaurs should age with the technology that created them, but they don't; the acting and writing should register as corny, but instead they come across as charming. I am an admirer of the movie, but more than that, I am one of many people for whom it has become something of a touchstone experience. Like lots of others, many of whom are in my age range (I was about 10 when the film came out), I have seen it countless times and still watch it every couple of years. Every character has become a familiar, friendly face. At this point it is the people more than the dinosaurs that seem to drive the film, and I can't resist speaking their dialogue along with them. I use some lines even when I'm not watching the film; 'I can afford more glasses,' I've often said in Wayne Knight's voice when my wife has been unable to find her glasses, and 'That's, that's chaos theory' in Jeff Goldblum's stutter is another favorite of mine. But as well as I know the movie, I still see new things on each viewing. When I saw the 3D re-release in theaters in May 2013 I noticed details I had never noticed before, like the mermaid on the restaurant facade where Dennis Nedry meets the 'secret agent' from InGen's rival corporation, and the 'Moet & Chandon' label on the bottle that John Hammond opens at the dig site in Montana. The enduring freshness of the film will keep me coming back, as if I could ever stay away from such a fun, nostalgic trip.",10,4,5,17 June 2013
Beetlejuice," So much fun, and over too soon, 'Beetlejuice' provides a character, a scene, and a world for the ages
","'Beetlejuice' is a fantastically creative movie featuring some of the best-looking sets and most interesting worldbuilding in Tim Burton's filmography. Maybe in anyone's. And yet it also has a charmingly offhanded feel, like something jotted down after a strange dream as it was fading. Nobody seems to have been trying too hard, a common problem in later Burton projects. It builds slowly, one of those movies where the central figure doesn't really appear until deep into the runtime. Like the shark in 'Jaws' or E.T. in 'E.T.,' we want to see Beetlejuice, but the movie smartly holds him back, showing only teasers before the big show.There's plenty to focus on in the meantime. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are likable guides to the world of the dead, a wry bureaucracy that's also playground for Burton's creature creation and makeup departments. The movie could work as satire if it wanted to, something like Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' set in H.P. Lovecraft's New England. There are waiting rooms and labyrinthine corridors of the dead civil service and a manual for the newly deceased. To go between worlds, Baldwin's character must take a shovel to the foam grass and plywood ground of his scale model of his town, and it's tempting to search this for parallels to the tacky redevelopment going on in the dead couple's home. But really, the whole conceit is too intriguing and lighthearted to serve as earnest commentary or sharp-edged ridicule. The movie speculates that, really, being dead isn't so bad if you can just learn to work the system and get along with people. Being alive isn't so bad either, as long as you don't trample heedlessly over the dead. Having seen the fun that Baldwin and Davis's characters are having after death, it's easy to relate to Winona Ryder's goth girl character, who can see them and decides she prefers them to her snobbish and striving parental units.A fair amount of plot is squeezed into the movie's 90 minutes, but it all boils down to the question of when somebody is going to say 'Beetlejuice' three times and bring Michael Keaton's fast-talking con man out of the scale model and into the real world. Even if you can't catch everything he says—he speaks in clipped grunts with a highly variable cadence—you'll walk away impersonating him. This character, from his clothes to his growl to his lurching and reeling body movements, is a touchstone of movies not unlike the the Tramp in the 1910s and Jack Sparrow in the 2000s. Beetlejuice is a villain, but that's just a slight tweak. There's a line of evolution (not to say improvement, since they're all great) through these male, clownish, unlucky, gregarious, vagabond immortals (it is not to be thought that the Tramp aged between 1914 and 1936.) Keaton is so in tune with his creation that he doesn't need a lot of screen time to make a lasting mark on the culture, but the movie is smart enough not to cheat him out of a grand sequence in the final act anyway.Oddly though, by the time the finale comes around, the high point has already been reached. And it doesn't involve Beetlejuice at all. It's the scene where the living characters become possessed and dance around a dinner table lip-syncing Harry Belafonte's calypso song 'Day-O.' Catherine O'Hara shines here, acting with every face muscle and every body muscle but keeping them totally separate. The glamorous costume clothes, the blue lighting in the room, the bizarre sculptures in the background—this scene is an ingenious fusion of styles held together by Burton's pop-art sensibility. If this were all the movie had, it would be worth watching. But 'Beetlejuice' is a series of original moments like this. It is so much fun, and over too soon.",9,2,3,7 February 2015
The Godfather," Endless new details and interpretations keep this near-perfect film fresh
","Because it opens with a wedding, each new viewing of 'The Godfather' feels like a happy reunion with familiar characters. And each time it is bittersweet because we know what will happen to all of them in the end. But there are seemingly endless new details to uncover, and film writers have provided a steady stream of new interpretations to consider. Count the times that doors close on women, shutting them out of the macho world of the cosa nostra—a phone booth door, a bathroom door, a study door. Notice, as writer Pablo Villaça does, how the color of Kay's clothes change from bright red to dull beige as she gets pulled further into Michael's toxic orbit. Look at the way Vito Corleone and Tom Hagen reflexively touch their faces, cuffs, and collars after difficult conversations, a nervous tic that Michael, in his coldness, does not seem to share, and which seems significant only because everything in this dense production seems purposeful and meaningful. Consider, like historian Bruce Schulman, whether Michael—an American war hero with an American girlfriend who ultimately cannot escape his Sicilian roots—is a metaphor for failed cultural assimilation. Maybe some of these observations are stretches, the products of our obsessive love for a movie that director Francis Ford Coppola reportedly considers a studio film and that Orson Welles called 'the glorification of a bunch of bums who never existed.' There's some truth in those criticisms, just as there is truth in the paeans and the deep analyses. Maybe there's no such thing as a perfect movie. But 'The Godfather' looks, sounds, and feels very, very close, even the Nth time around.",10,1,3,15 August 2013
