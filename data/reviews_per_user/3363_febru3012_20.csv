The Equalizer," You liked Man On Fire? You'll love Equalizer. Its Boston and the Russian Mob......
","Not Mexico and the cartel but its one of Denzel's best acting performances and shows why he can and does command a minimum of $10m per picture. With 'The Equalizer' he's a Producer so may have settled for less salary. Regardless, this film spends time introducing and defining the characters which I think is a plus and it establishes a trust the viewer has in Robert (Denzels character) that allows us to feel comfortable with some very uncomfortable violence he bestows on the Russian Mob in Boston and the crooked cops working with the Mob. BTW, I feel certain many people were turned off by the violence and thus gave this film a low rating. All I can say about that is, the picture reflects reality so if you want to continue to live in a fantasy world go and see Disney's Frozen. Also, if you want to see another Bronson (remember The Death Wish days?) type movie starring Denzel by all means rent or purchase 'Man On Fire' its Denzel Vs The Mexican Drug Cartels over a kidnapped little girl. Its a very good movie. See The Equalizer and Man On Fire for a terrific double feature evening.",9,0,4,7 January 2015
Gravity," Please Disney,use this technology to make the next Star Wars - WOW !
","Incredible visuals. It's a clich√©, but IT IS almost like being there. This technology has to be more than just a green screen and CGI. I've been to all the Sci-Fi, car chase/crash flicks and have never seen anything like this in them. The CGI, for lack of a better term, is well worth the price of admission. I've read a few sour grapes Gravity reviews on IMDb and if those people need a comparison of a really over hyped, incredibly God Awful movie go and see The Wolf of Wall Street. While Gravity is the best movie of the year Wolf is without the slightest doubt the absolute worse. Getting back to Gravity, if there is a small negative its the small chit chat between Clooneys character and Houston/Bullock. Its so small I didn't let it effect my 10 rating. SEE THIS MOVIE, ITS TERRIFIC!",10,2,5,1 April 2014
Lone Survivor," THE best 'War Movie' using todays updated technology in.....
","movie making and the sheer high performance of today's military weapons. A gut wrenching, harrowing experience to witness in a movie theater, let alone to live through or not live through. Lone Survivor's directing, writing, acting and production are first rate and show the others of Hollywood that movies of this savagery can be entertaining, yes entertaining and informational. I rarely vote a movie a 10 unless it has truly moved me to write a review of it giving it terrific accolades. Mark Walberg has long been a favorite of mine in these type of action movies but I believe I would have given this movie a 10 even if he hadn't been in the lead. See this movie to get a genuine feel for what was and is going on over there. Yes, I know there was the Green Zone and others but I have never given any of those a 10. See this movie - its an experience.",10,0,2,20 July 2014
Fury," Like Das Boot (1981) only American & on land - see it !
","Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boot is one of THE best war movies of all time and it's German. If you haven't seen Das Boot its great. The comparison with Fury may not at first seem obvious but the tight quarters these 5 Americans have in the Sherman tank commanded by Sgt Wardaddy (Pitt) is remarkable in its sheer grit, gore and terror. By the way, Pitt should have received an Academy Award for Best Actor for Wardaddy but won't because he wasn't nominated for 2014. Moving on, the battle sequences are many and you won't see but one brief romantic interlude in the whole picture, which most guys will appreciate. The scenes of fighting and background are gut wrenching and realistic as war should be portrayed. This movie spares no one in demonstrating the brutality of both sides during the fighting in WW2 Europe. If your non squeamish I highly recommend seeing this movie. The blood and violence no doubt turned off enough movie goers here on IMDb to rate this excellent flick a mere 7 - it's easily a 9 or a 10. All I can say about that to those low raters is this, go to Disney's Frozen if you want to live in a fantasy world. SEE THIS EXCELLENT MOVIE.",9,2,9,16 February 2015
Life of Pi," Oscar GOT IT WRONG ! This was the best movie of 2012.......
","Taking big risks with big payoffs in directing, writing, production and casting were reasons enough for this movie to have won the Oscar for best movie. The story is tight and keeps you focused as no other movie I've seen in years. This movie breaks ground as it doesn't reprocess any story lines like there were in other movies that were in Oscar contention. Because this movie is unique I have to admit it took me a good half hour to get into the swing of what was going on. That is good since this movie takes you places you've never been and completely entertains you while doing so. This is what original movie making is all about. This is a must see movie.",10,4,9,2 May 2013
Pacific Rim," If you paid for a ticket to see this - You got a Pacific Rim Job!
",Good God where to start? This waste of good film stock should have been called Godzilla (Kaiju) VS the boxing Transformers (Jaegers). So that adults would know what age group this movie targeted. Anyone over age 10 SHOULD NOT pay to see this movie. Here's another: Chinese in Hong Kong with Australian accents? Why not? Everyone else in this movie has an Aussie twang. Ahhh moving on. How about shots in this movie that seem to appear from nowhere leaving you ask yourself WTF is this sh*t doing here? Case in point (only one of many): those 5 hanging chrome balls click when hundreds of building around it are completely destroyed. I was overly generous in giving this movie a 6. I did so because I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi no matter how bad it is. Wait to see this movie when you can't sleep and click to Pacific Rim on TV you will soon be snoring soundly.,6,1,5,17 November 2013
Nightcrawler," Terrific film ! - a gen y guy with no money, friends or home trying to get by...
","Its a jungle out there and this guy uses his wits, sharpened by 1000's of hours on the internet (taking classes and learning life's lessons) to scratch out a living. He finds his niche in shooting news video's and succeeds. Fortunately for the viewers of this picture we get to go along for the exciting ride and witness the many fascinating incidents he has in getting there. This movie is sorta like a primer on giving society what it craves without seriously breaking laws and getting tossed in the slammer. Yeah OK this guys an anti-hero but they make the best movies don't they. Its a solid 10 out of 10 for me. Definitely see this movie, especially if your a Millennial.",10,6,9,24 March 2015
Oblivion," Visually - a stunning work of SciFi. So realistic its scary. See It !
","The trailers don't do this film justice. You have to be immersed in the full splendor and beauty this motion picture produces. Every scene is memorable. The story and acting are above average and take place on a defeated earth populated by advanced technology and scabs, the left over humans. I really liked the living quarters of Jack and Vicky the techs to service the drones and the cool conveyances Jack uses to get around his territory. The story rolls a bit slow at times but you can lose yourself in the cool scifi. Science Fiction devotees will love the cool machines, the two fight scenes in scab Hq and the chase scenes with the drones. The drone chase reminded me of the Star Wars chase in the redwoods. I rate this movie very worthy of the money spent to see it.",9,1,2,10 September 2013
The Revenant," Jeremiah Johnson on steroids - astounding & beautiful picture
","Yes, The Revenant was nominated for Oscars 'Best Picture' of 2015 and by all means should have won the Oscar hands down. While there are similarities with one of my personal film favorites of all time, Robert Redfords, Jeremiah Johnson (JJ), The Revenant is no JJ knockoff. Its totally original and mind grabbing. After Wolf of Wall Street came out, I swore I would never attend another DiCaprio movie. Well I had heard so many positive comments about Revenant I decided I would see it and DiCaprio did an admirable job as lead actor and deserved his Oscar for this performance. To sum up The Revenant is to say it pits a white man against nature, Indians, enemies, other white men, bears, starvation, cold, wind, rain, snow, dirt, and grime in the most realistic 2 hours of movie making ever produced. Thanks to the directors, actors, producers, writers and hundreds of others in this films crew for making whats sure to be a long lasting classic. IMDb fans, you must see this movie.",10,2,5,23 May 2016
Non-Stop," Suspend your disbelief and hang on - no airline will show this flick....
","Many airliner hijack stories have been put on film, some good, some not worth the bother. Non-stop is a good hijack movie because it keeps you guessing like a mystery while it shakes the crap out of you. I liked Liam Neeson in Schindler's List (1993), Taken (2008), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) and Batman Begins (2005). He delivers another very credible lead role in Non-stop and makes it work. It might seem he's getting on in age for these roles but he's the consummate actor and well toned for the action. He can certainly hold his own in an intellectual parry as well, as his 60 Minutes Interview showed. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, a murder every 20 minutes on the Auqa Atlantic not unlike A Murder On The Orient Express. Non-stop is a movie well worth the price to see. You will not be wasting your money.",9,0,2,22 July 2014
Lincoln," If you like Ken Burns you'll love Lincoln - Belongs on PBS......
","A factoid crammed documentary disguised as a movie for getting votes on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. No excitement here pure TV stuff. This looks like a blatant attempt to secure another Oscar for Spielberg (How many to date? 768?)and/or Lewis. Also, Spielberg and company missed a great opportunity to show how the civil war was made to go on for years grinding up the lives of 600,000 youth so the Unions Military Industrial Complex could make billions of dollars off the dead and wounded. Whenever this country has an economic turn down - thats the time to watch to see that we don't go to war to solve it. Argo is a much better movie on all fronts and it deserved the Oscar for Best Movie.",Null,1,3,4 April 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun - Hip - Entertaining - Own This DVD For Your Library.....
",When a film comes to the ending credits and you feel remorse because its over - you've just seen a great movie. That's exactly how I felt last night having watched Guardians of the Galaxy for the first time. I couldn't wait to get home and order a DVD online so I could watch it again and again. This movie packs so much fun and action into it you feel somewhat exhausted by all the excitement. The nostalgia of a 70's sound track is novel and shows how original the writers were in conceiving this script. The CGI is perfect and I've never seen so many moving objects in a CGI screen before and I'm told this is a tell for the size and power of the super computer used to make the incredible fighter ship scenes - it was in a word awesome and not to be missed. The acting and directing are flawless and again using live and animated characters side by side were executed perfectly. I highly recommend seeing this movie for the sheer adrenaline and over powering thrills it generates in an audience. See it at least once in a big screen movie house to get the full impact of the screen and the audience.,10,3,9,28 December 2014
Les Mis√©rables," Leave it to Hollywood to destroy a 28 year old institution
","Les Miserables first went on stage in 1985 and has played to millions nonstop in London and other locations. I watched the stage Anniversary DVD of the latest Les Miserables cast and enjoyed it very much. This Les Miserables movie version is full of Hollywood 'A' listers who couldn't carry a tune in a sack. Horribly miscast the cast directors should have picked singers who could pass as actors rather than actors who tried and failed miserably to pass as singers. For those who haven't seen the play it is a very powerful and moving epic. Please don't judge the stage production by this unmitigated disaster. What went on here is taking a well known brand and slapping it on claptrap that Hollywood investors do from time to time to squeeze profits out of. The failure here is too much investor money chasing a well known brand with a movie vehicle that should have never left the editing room. I still can't believe I actually sat through this torture. Would I rather see this film again or have a combination spinal tap/root canal? You got it, the spinal tap root canal is my preference.",1,6,13,23 April 2013
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Ho hum - the story (?) is lost in Terabytes of CGI that are OK
","Guardians of the Galaxy - 2014 (I rated 10 out of 10) does a wonderful job of matching a great storyline to incredible CGI. Perhaps its the longevity of the Hobbit story or its just seeing the same shop worn characters over and over and over again. Whatever it is, the Hobbit really wore out its welcome about two or three movies back. Who's counting? How do they keep refreshing a story after so many episodes? The short answer is you don't you move on after three at the max. There does appear to be an exception to this rule and its the Fast & Furious franchise 8 (I rated 10 here) going on 9. What keeps F&F going of course are the cars, the T&A (c'mon you noticed), bringing in fresh A list actors to the scripts, the exotic locations and the incredible fast pace. Could this have been done with the Hobbit, I don't think the cutesy tameness of the little dwarfs lends itself to the F&F formula.",5,2,4,9 May 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," 50 shades of cat-o'-nine-tails S&M with a smattering of soft porn .....
","Huh? Is this where the American film industry wants to take this genre? This movie is a twisted, incomprehensible load of borderline XXX scripts rescued from some valley dumpster. The plot is moronic to be flip and out and out trash to be honest. Here's the plot in three sentences. A college student steps in to do an interview with some Billionaire who has nothing else apparently to do than pursue hot girls for his 'playroom', a Marquis de Sade designed gem with every imaginable type of torture and humiliation device ever conceived. This girl takes most of the movie to sign the contract the billionaire has dreamed up to keep him out of court and prison. Needless to say there would be no 3rd act without her signing the contract so she does and we get to watch the aforementioned devices at work on her. The end. There, I just saved you $100 for the sitter, tickets, drinks, parking etc etc. Please DO NOT see this abomination. Thanks.",3,2,7,26 June 2015
Lucy," Lucy explore's a sci fi subject untouched to date - interesting plot
",This movie does an above average job of exploring this subject with Morgan Freemans character doing the background description for the capacity of the human brain and doing a good job doing so. Ms Johansen is very energetic in her portrayal of Lucy and does a very good job of conveying an empathy for her character. Lucy isn't the best sci fi movie made but than again most movies are not the best in there category. So I rate this movie an 8 above average since it does a good job of holding your attention without boring you to death. Many times thats all you want from a movie and Lucy does deliver - especially if you like to think about what humans could evolve into someday.,8,1,5,25 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," I'm a victim of the hyped up media machine Disney unleashed
","Same old faces, Harrison Ford et al (more wrinkles), same old space fighters & space ships, same old death star (oh! but its bigger), same old plot and story lines i.e. light sword fight on a bridge in the final reel and many, many more too numerous to mention. As others have pointed out on IMDb this wasn't so much a new story as it was a copy of the old story and pasting the same actors, machines, bad guys in white armor, fat guy flying in a rebellion fighter down a narrow corridor of the death star to destroy, etc. etc. Millennial's would have accepted a subtle reference to the former story but to be beat over the head repeatedly in every scene was overbearing and outright boring trash. Disney better re-think the other committed pictures in this series. The next one will be a disaster if this continues. I saw this mess from a DVD Redbox so I wasn't hit as hard as those paying premium prices. I didn't give this a 1 because the new R2D2 was innovative and different. It was the only thing new about this movie. However they had, you guessed it, the same old R2D2 and C3PO taking up space in this movie. See this Star Wars - NO! Forget it!",3,34,40,28 April 2016
Unbroken," More than a POW story. Its a Sports and Survival story as well. See it !
","Yes, this movie glues your eyes and mind to the screen and won't let go. 'Unbroken' is a terrific movie with an amazing cast that delivers on all cylinders. The very best part about 'Unbroken' is that its a true story. I won't go into detail about the story because you must witness this picture from opening scene to closing epilogue. Jolie as a director is beyond reproach and shares company with the best directors in Hollywood. She should have won an Oscar for Best Director by doing such an outstanding job with this movie. 'Unbroken' is a Cohen Brothers screen play and script so one shouldn't be at all surprised at the superb quality of this film. Once again Ethan and Joel have set the bar for quality movie making beyond the reach of the great majority of today's film makers and have surpassed or equaled many of those in Hollywood's past as well i.e Spielberg, Ford, Coppola, Hitchcock, et al.",9,0,2,25 April 2015
Cloud Atlas," Divine Intervention Needed Here - What The Heck Is This?
","Cloud Atlas is like one of those 'know it all's' we all put up with, who beats you over the head with the most intimate knowledge of the most arcane subjects. Roughly 5 or 6 story lines are running in this movie that appear in different times, different characters (but the same actors in different makeup, etc) and different unrelated plots. I got a headache trying to figure out how to tie this mess together. If they would have just did an entire movie about the Tech Seoul story plot the movie would have been a great science fiction movie. I've come to appreciate the fact that strange titles make for ugly movies. The producers, writers, directors etc seem to delight in making idiots out of the viewers of this film. In fact, what the writers, producers etc have accomplished is to put together an incoherent, pretentious two hour long piece of claptrap. I do not recommend seeing this movie. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I'm a big believer in movie makers taking thought out risks in producing films for the sake of advancing the art. This movie apparently was produced to shame the critics into calling Cloud Atlas a masterpiece because deep down the critics, like everyone else, don't have a clue what this movie is about, if indeed it was about anything.",2,5,11,16 June 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," The very best of the Mad Max series - BRAVO! must see
","As Greda Garbo says in one of the Academy Awards out takes 'Fasten your seat belts its gonna be a bumpy ride'. Oh yeah and what a ride Mad Max - Fury Road is. Every minute of this George Miller movie is stuffed with incredible mobile machines of a dark art kind of origin. That's just the machines. The people populating this movie are even more dark and even more fantastic. There is not a minute to take a breath before the next sequence of hell fire action takes place. Action movie junkies seeing this movie for the first time will literally exhaust themselves from the excitement. This is the best action picture ever made and I'm including Fast and Furious 7 when saying this. Miller has out done himself and made an absolute classic. An 8 is a very high rating on the IMDb but it doesn't do this movie justice, its a clear 10 all the way. My thanks to the actors, directors, writers, crew and producers for making this unique entertainment. See this movie - you will not regret it.",10,1,10,22 September 2015
