Angels & Demons," Book>Movie (Reply)
","I agree with the reading of the book making me disappointed in the movie. Two of the scenes of I was looking for forward to were the Langdon fight scene in the fountain (pretending to drown) and surviving the helicopter on a 'window covering' I think it was called.So many scenes were taken out. It just changes the whole story even though the plot line start and ends essentially where it's supposed to.A Man Apart is a good example of expecting something that never happens. Preview has Vin Diesel saying 'Baby don't watch me now,' when he is at grave of wife but scene was deleted in movie. I waited the entire movie for that line and it was a let down that it wasn't there.It also annoyed me that the movie (Angels & Demons) is taken on as if it happens after The Da Vinci Code. The extreme amount of goofs, mistakes, and whatever else you want to call them was annoying as well. Sports movies are great for this. I mean, is it really that hard to get someone that catches with same hand on long shot of diving catch?",7,0,1,17 April 2010
