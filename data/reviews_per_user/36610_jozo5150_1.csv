Walk the Line," Excellent Movie!! Would Definitely pay to see again!!
","As just an average, everyday 'joe' taking the wife to see a movie, I'd like to think I could give the average movie-goer a fair review. First off, I'm not a real big fan of country music, though I have been listening to some classic country lately. This movie definitely lives up to all the good things reviewers have wrote. I'll admit I didn't quite know what to expect with Phoenix and Witherspoon as the main characters but, WOW!!!, they were superb in their portrayal of Cash and Carter and the fact they did all of the singing without any overdubs only confirms this.Once again, as an ordinary, man-on-the-street movie-goer I want to recommend this movie highly. My wife and I paid the better part of $50 to see this movie, what with popcorn and sodas, and I would definitely pay the money to see Walk The Line again.",10,5,10,20 November 2005
