The Avengers," An amazing movie, sure to please everyone (but especially us nerds)
","This movie is in my opinion one of the best ever made. There were doubts that Marvel Studios could pulls this movie together, the sheer scope was mind-boggling. With 3 actors ( and 4 characters) who each carried their own movies it didn't seem likely, but the ensemble cast was amazing and each character is given their due focus. The story is excellent, the villain is likable and suitably evil, and the action and special effects are top notch. What may surprise many is the fact that amongst all of this spectacle, there is heart and humor.Comic book fans will enjoy being able to see their favorites o the big screen together, And for those non-nerds out there you'll find an excellent afternoon's entertainment.",10,1,4,16 May 2012
