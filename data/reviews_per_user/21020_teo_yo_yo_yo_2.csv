Hereditary," Disappointed
","I really enjoyed the overall feeling and tension that the movie creates. I am more into this type of fear than the obvious jump scares so this is a plus. However, as the ending unraveled, I felt disappointed that it was ancient demons instead of mental illness. While this is a horror film and supernatural occurences were expected, I would have appreciated more a 'scientific' explanation of the events. It was a good film, but in my view it would have been more terrifying if Ellen and Annie and Peter would have suffered from schizophrenia rather than being possessed by evil spirits. Disturbing and enjoyable nonetheless.",7,1,2,3 May 2019
This Is the End," Not what I expected...
","This movie was not at all what I have been expecting; it surprised me, but in a very good way! First of all, the acting is amazing. In my opinion, half of the film is pure improvisation. The actors do a wonderful job, dragging us into their perfect universe until it breaks down.The story is not original, however the manner of telling it is new, fresh, entertaining, unique, and extremely funny.Moreover, I believe that besides the comedic facade of the movie, there's a pretty important message there. Throughout the film there's a constant friction going on between atheists and believers and in the ends, as it turns out, the second group was right all along..there is a God, and a heaven, and the saints.'This is the End' makes you laugh like crazy but at the end, it makes you wonder and it gives you hope. I think that behind the amusement, the jokes, the cursing and the fighting there's a very important message: Guys, be nice, you will really go to Heaven. Heaven which in this movie is portrayed as a gigantic all-white party, with girls wearing bikinis and everyone smoking pot.I believe also it's a movie about faith too. Faith that if you do good, the universe will reward you. If you are nice, you have a chance at redemption.I enjoyed it very much but it also made me think about the 'afterlife'. If people knew for sure that Heaven exists and it's a full-blown party, where all your wishes come true, would they be good Christians every day? Would they sacrifice this life in order to get a VIP invitation the biggest, coolest party, the one that goes on forever? We can never know, but what's for sure, this movie rocks! I highly recommend it!",8,1,4,28 September 2013
