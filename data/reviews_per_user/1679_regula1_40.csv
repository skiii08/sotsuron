Blade Runner 2049," What A Sequel Should Be
","If you take a look at the best sequels out there, you'll find that they don't spend an inordinate amount of time retreading old ground at the expense of the story. Rather, a good sequel builds off of the previous film and, if done correctly, not only reinforces the previous film's themes and message, but adds upon them in a meaningful way.Blade Runner 2049 does this correctly, and you don't even have to have seen the original to enjoy this film.Set thirty years after the events of the original film, Blade Runner 2049 focuses on Agent K (Ryan Gosling), a replicant blade runner tasked with hunting down old models that aren't programmed like he is, namely to obey.He stumbles upon a mystery that threatens to unravel the status quo between humans and replicants for good, and through much detective work, he finds himself in the company of Deckard (Harrison Ford), a man living alone with the demons of his past.What the original film did was brilliant in that it explored the human condition without preaching the right answer to our faces, rather it let us ponder the questions it posed so we could come to the conclusions ourselves.This film also poses important questions about humanity, about what qualifies as true feeling, and what the basis for a soul is, but also explores the prospects of science and human ambition, and what happens if it is left unchecked.These themes are explored beautifully by characters on opposite sides of the spectrum, from Jared Leto as Wallace, the man who picks up the mantle of the Tyrell Corporation, to Ana de Ames as Joi, a holographic woman who is K's companion and who longs to be more than an incorporeal image.It cannot be denied that this film is a visual masterpiece, every bit on par with Ridley Scott's original.What faults there are lie with the length of the film (2 hours 43 minutes, and it feels it, especially towards the end) and with the music. While powerful and evocative of the original soundtrack, for every time it conveys an emotional gut punch, there's another time where it's really only there to be a loud noise, and it can get annoying at times. A little more restraint on the horns would have been appreciated.Nevertheless, this film has everything a film buff would want, and even if that's not you, it's definitely worth a watch as an intellectual think-piece to discuss over dinner with friends.",8,7,16,5 October 2017
Darkest Hour," A Great Film, Similar to Lincoln in Many Ways
","If you found Lincoln to be a moving film about a great historical figure played by a respected actor doing some of his best work, with great emotional resonance at its core, then you will find the same things in Darkest Hour.This film centers around Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, and focuses on his first three weeks as British Prime Minister in May of 1940, when nearly the whole of Europe has been conquered by Nazi Germany, the British Army is being forced to the sea at Dunkirk, and there is the very real possibility that Britain will be left defenseless.Oldman shines in this role, and the makeup team did great work transforming him into Churchill. Truly, he is a chameleon in any role he lands. There are great emotional stakes at work in this film, as it is made clear that Churchill is an older man who has a very particular style, and often struggles to get certain thoughts out in a coherent and convincing manner.While props must be given to Kristen Scott Thomas who portrays Clementine Churchill, the truly standout supporting role is Lily James as Elizabeth Layton, Churchill's secretary, who often conveys great emotional weight using only her eyes and her posture. Her scenes alongside Churchill are the best in the film.Where the film falters is in the pacing, which does tend to drag in the middle a bit. Also, if you go into this film knowing nothing about the historical context of the players involved, then certain character motivations will be left either unexplained, explained in passing, hard to hear, or explained very clunkily in an obvious manner, such as Churchill's involvement in the Gallipoli campaign in World War I.That aside, though, you should see this film simply for Oldman's performance, which is stunning, and he is most deserving of at the very least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.",8,1,6,22 December 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Between story and technology, a perfect bridge between trilogies
","WOW!Going into this, I expected this to be good, but not THIS good. Deep down, we know overall how the film is supposed to end, with the Death Star plans in the hands of Leia with Darth Vader in pursuit. You know that going in.What you want to see, though, is the character drama between the band of rebels together through a mix of plan, accident, and fate. Felicity Jones shines as Jyn Erso, but arguably she gets pushed to a supporting role on numerous occasions. On the rebel side, the reprogrammed Imperial droid voiced by Alan Tudyk is the wit and personality of the band, almost to a fault with the number of quips throughout the film.And on the Imperial side, while his screen time is limited, Darth Vader is the undeniable star, back with more punch. However, on both sides it is also the characters brought back to youthfulness and from the dead through CGI: mainly Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia. Both look great, though CGI Peter Cushing is just fake enough to be distracting in every scene he's in with real actors.Still, aesthetically this film looks great, with just the right blend of elements of Episodes 1-3 and the visual feel of A New Hope. This is especially telling in the look of the X-Wings. In Episode 7, it's clear the X-Wings have a new feel to them for a new trilogy. In this film, though, the filmmakers did a fantastic job keeping the look of the fighters true to the original physical models forty years ago.In short: while you may get sidetracked gawking at every single homage to A New Hope they crammed into it, Rogue One truly is a Star Wars story, perfectly setting up THE Star Wars story. You do not want to miss this.",9,1,6,15 December 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Good Sci-fi movie, Okay Star Trek movie...from a purist.
","When I say that I am a purist, I mean that I am a bigger fan of Star Trek before JJ Abrams, aka the 5 series and 10 movies that came before. When Star Trek (2009) came out, I saw potential to re-imagine the series while still continuing the legacy built by its predecessors.With Into Darkness, though, it seemed like they have gone a bit too far away from Star Trek's roots. True, there are several instances where true Trekkers like myself can see a connection to previous series and movies and get the context behind it. For example, there is a line of models that show the line of Enterprises up to the re-imagined NCC-1701.However, the main reason why I feel that this movie falls too far from its roots is its fairly dark themes that tend to contradict the base premise of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek. If anyone has seen the documentary 'How William Shatner Changed the World', they argue that Star Trek started to 'die' in the early 2000s because it had gone too far away from the Utopian image that was presented in The Original Series that gave so many people hope for the future. In my opinion, this is what has happened with Into Darkness.That being said, as a sci-fi action film it does stellar. JJ Abrams and his team have successfully translated the futuristic feel of Star Trek into somewhat plausibility with respect to the technology shown, and the action sequences are epic. I recommend anyone seeing this watch Star Trek II, III, VI, and Insurrection before or after. It will enhance the experience.",8,3,8,24 May 2013
Deadpool 2," Not Better, But Definitely As Good As The Original
","They definitely put maximum effort into this second outing of the Merc With A Mouth.This time around, we find Wade Wilson/Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) in the position of having to save a teenager from being killed by Cable (Josh Brolin) who has come from the future,. With the help of other mutants, Wade must form the X-Force in order to save this kid's life.Invariably with sequels, especially comedy sequels, there are bound to be repeated riffs from the first film, and there are. However, the humor of Deadpool 2 is very unique from the first film. While both are very tongue-in-cheek, this film has many elements that work better. Whereas the first film had Deadpool for the most part on his own, this film depends on Deadpool bouncing off the supporting cast, and the results are nothing short of hilarious.While the supporting cast suffers from a lack of any real character development, especially Domino who really would have benefited from some more backstory and increased chances at chemistry with Deadpool, this film is basically non-stop laughs. Whereas movies like Infinity War use humor to break up a serious story, Deadpool 2 uses a serious story to break up the humor, and it is a very important distinction that pays off in the long run.I would very much recommend you see this film with an audience, as it is in the group laughter (or cringing) that a large part of the enjoyment comes with this film.",8,2,4,18 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," By Far the Best Solo Thor Film
","X-Men Apocalypse was wrong: the third film in the franchise isn't always the worst.Thor (2010) was a perfectly doable, if average, origin film and served the purpose of introducing the character in time for The Avengers. Thor: The Dark World (2014) wasn't terrible, but it was very disappointing and bland.Thor: Ragnarok, on the other hand, is just the kind of film to get audiences to like an Avenger other than Tony Stark or Steve Rogers.Directed by Taika Waititi, this film gets an injection of the cosmic vibe from James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy films and uses it to go crazy and have some fun showing how bizarre the universe can be.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has had his hammer shattered by Hela, Goddess of Death (Cate Blanchett) and been banished to a world where he is enslaved and forced to fight for his survival. Now, he must assemble a team to save the people of Asgard from Hella's evil reign and the oncoming apocalypse, Ragnarok, with a little help from Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, with extra Hulk voice time for Lou Ferrigno).As a comic book film, this checks all the correct buttons for a conflict that has serious stakes yet with enough levity to balance out the deadly threats the characters face. It genuinely feels like anything can happen, and often unexpected things do happen.This is obviously a tonally different film from the first two Thor films, looking and feeling more like a Guardians of the Galaxy film. The fact that this is much more of a success than the first two films may mean that more levity may be in store for future Marvel films.However, with a film with this much humor, while the majority of the jokes land on their feet, it does sometimes tend to inject a funny moment when more seriousness is required, and this can be emotionally confusing and ultimately undermining the stakes set earlier in the film.Also, there are some major family conflicts that get introduced quickly, brushed aside for large stretches, and then barely brought up again before being forgotten an instant later. Some shattering revelations are not given the proper impact that they are due. Out of the film's weaknesses, this feels like the most disappointing, as these themes could and should have done more to balance out the film's serious-funny dynamic.Overall, though, this film does a lot for the franchise in that for the length of a film, much like the Guardians films, the audience can largely forget about the overarching MCU timeline and events and focus on the story at hand, and while it has its deficiencies, this is still a fun film and one that will probably be the fun crescendo before the probably overly serious Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War films.",8,1,7,2 November 2017
Ready Player One," A Return To Big-Screen Spectacle, But Not Spielberg's Best
","At the heart of this adaptation of Ernest Cline's 2011 novel is a fairly simple premise: the real world sucks, but a virtual reality world called the Oasis allows people to forget about reality for a little while. For Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), that concept is enough. But there are others who want the Oasis for themselves, and still others fighting to stop them, with virtual consequences spilling out into the real world.The mainstream appeal to this film, at least based on the advertising alone, is the nostalgia vibe that permeates this film, like so many other films and TV shows these days. And this is certainly a reference-laden film, what with the main character's vehicle of choice being a certain time machine.However, aside from all the references is a story of a struggle between the little guy trying to keep a good thing going and maybe improve on it for the benefit of the people and an evil corporation who sees only profit in their world, and will do anything to claim the throne.The key lies in the storytelling, and for the most part this film actually manages to tell a well-paced story that gives just enough technical details to keep you going but doesn't bog itself down in minutia. Though the film does sometimes go out of its way to indulge in a reference, most of the time sticking the landing, the fact is it comes dangerously close to going overboard in its treatment of pop culture references, especially if the same fact is repeated several times in the span of a few minutes.The main disadvantage of this film is when it leaves the virtual world and enters reality. We as the audience bond to the virtual avatars of our main characters, and beside the villain, who we see more in the real world than the virtual, we see relatively little of our protagonists in the real world, which is a good thing sine the actors and actresses, though competent, really don't engender any lasting connection between character and viewer.Overall, I would say this film is best appreciated on the big screen, but probably not at full price. Be prepared to do some Googling if you didn't live through the 80s.",7,1,4,30 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," After rocky years and a brilliant tease, a return to form for our favorite web-slinger
","We live in a golden age of superhero films, where we can have not only cinematic universes and iconic renditions of favorite characters, but also multiple iconic performances of the same hero.Of course, as we well know, Spider-Man has had his up years and down years, so how does this latest visit from our friendly neighborhood web-head stack up?Well, first off, Sam Raimi's trilogy of Spidey films defined a generation of fans, and after Tobey Maguire's brilliant performances (emo dancing not-withstanding) any actor can only succeed him, never replace. Andrew Garfield's two films, while they had their moments and he did an adequate job, just couldn't stand up to Maguire's legacy.Now, in Tom Holland's first solo venture, we have a worthy successor.We all wanted to see more after his brilliant introduction in Captain America: Civil War, and we got it. Set two months after the events of that film, Spider-Man: Homecoming finds Peter struggling to find his place in a world where he is considered a superhero but he's still a high school sophomore, with all the social awkwardness that comes with it.Juggling between his high school friend Ned's incessant fanboying after he discovers Peter's secret identity (it was in the trailers), his neighborhood crime fighting turned serious with the appearance of Michael Keaton as Vulture, and his quest to gain approval in the eyes of Tony Stark, Peter Parker has his hands full, and he barely holds it together for most of it until finally things come to a head and we get what we all want from a Marvel film with the added bonus of it being a good Spider-Man movie. It's only been twelve years since the last really good one!In short, this film delivers on the patented MCU formula well, with a few twists. Mainly, that this is sort of an origin story without it being an origin story, and it doesn't rely heavily on any characters that were established in previous films other than Parker. Indeed, Tony Stark only appears in three scenes that lasted no more than ten minutes total.While this film does have issues, mainly the fact that twists are fairly clearly telegraphed and some of the dialogue that is supposed to be purposefully on the nose for comedic value falls flat, they are minor compared to the overall product.Spider-Man is back, and he is here to stay for a good while longer!",8,1,8,6 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Good action movie, but doesn't fully live up to its past
","I am a a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise, I own them all. Typically I rank them according to my beliefs as to how well they were done. In my mind, from best to worst: 5,4,1,3, and 2. When I look at Fast 6, I would have to put it somewhere between 4 and 1.Here's why I think this: the Fast and Furious franchise was based on the premise of fast, gorgeous cars and the shades of gray between good and bad, mostly marketed towards the gear head segment of the population. With Fast 5, we see that they are now trying to re-brand the franchise as a heist series with cars as the central method for pulling off these heists. Fast 5 did this spectacularly in my opinion, but Fast 6 was a step down. First of all, the cars were not given as much emphasis as even Fast 5 did. The fact that many of the driving sequences in this movie happen at night and the cars are mainly painted dark colors shows a distinct movement away from the car culture that made the series so popular.Secondly, this movie seems to try too hard to be funny at times. In the previous movie, there was a definite light-heartedness about the characters and their banter, but in Fast 6 the humor is not that funny and tends to be forced into inappropriate times and places.Bottom line: if you go to this movie expecting it to be a perfect continuation of the excellence of the previous movie you will be disappointed. However, if you go to see beautiful cars crash, things blow up, and epic fistfights this is the summer movie for you.",7,0,1,24 May 2013
Suicide Squad," Guardians of the Galaxy-like fun hits all the right keys, just not in the right order to gain access to greatness
","It's now two days until my birthday, and I really wanted Suicide Squad to be my early birthday dream come true. What I got was not as bad as all the critics have been saying, but at the same time it just feels like it misses the mark somehow.First of all, let's deal with the obvious: this film is basically DC's answer to Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. Both have criminals band together to face a powerful enemy (both with a combination of swords and guns), both use classic pop and rock songs, and both end up establishing the direction of their respective universes.So the music, in the trailers for this movie, the editing acumen to meld action with music was nothing short of genius, but in the finished product, while all the songs are good, they come up so often,so unnecessarily, and sometimes as a very odd choice. Literally, Bohemian Rhapsody plays at the very end for no reason at all over the exact footage of the second trailer.Moving on, though, this film is not necessarily about the action, of which there is plenty of but you doesn't really engage you. It's about the chemistry between the cast, and they fall in three categories.The breakout stars of this film, Will Smith's Deadshot, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn, and Jared Leto's Joker, all steal the show in every scene they appear (of which, Joker appears much less than you might think). In short, Suicide Squad is basically all about these three, the rest of the cast just supports them.Then there are the perfectly competent characters who are there and make for great action sequences. Chief among these are Diablo, played by Jay Hernandez, and Katana, played by Karen Fukuhara. Viola Davis' Amanda Waller is meant to be a chief player in this film, and in all honesty she pulls off her performance wonderfully, but her lack of screen-time in much of the film's action leaves her just shy of making the first tier.Finally, there's the characters who were either supposed to be important but really aren't and those who are incredibly forgettable. Case in point: the relationship between Special Forces officer Rick Flag, played by Joel Kinnaman, and June Moone/Enchantress, played by Cara Delevingne, is supposed to be one of torn emotions between saving their love or saving the world, but when it all plays out the resolution does not feel satisfying. Also, Jai Courtney's Captain Boomerang's only cool moment is him sipping a beer during an intense firefight.In summary, let me say that this film is NOT as bad as the critics say it is. They lambaste the poor editing, shallow characters, and rushed pace, and while there is ground for criticism in these ares, Suicide Squad delivers more than enough thrills and laughs to make the price of admission worth it. If I were to change one thing, though: I would go back in time and tell the marketing department to not give away so much of the film in the trailers, because really a TON of stuff in the trailers basically sums up the movie and there's not as much left to find out in the theater.",7,6,13,5 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," A solid thrill-a-minute that keeps your attention focused at all times.
","'SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we would like it to be,' says SHIELD director Nick Fury to our hero, Steve Rodgers aka Captain America.But the world that is is not what it seems to be.It's been 30 minutes since I came out of the theater, having sat through the entire film, the post main end credits teaser and the post secondary credits teaser.I'm still trying to wrap my head around the implications of this film on the Marvel universe.In this film, we see Captain America struggling to find a place in a new time, a time that is still at war, but this time with almost everybody. Natasha Romanov, aka Black Widow, has become the Captain's de facto partner within SHIELD, and she does her best to help him find a place in the 21st century.However, SHIELD begins taking a path that Captain America is uncomfortable in following. In this, conflict arises, and the Captain must ultimately the find the truth of what's really going on.But the truth is not what he expected.This film is a solid addition to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has all of the elements that made The First Avenger a great film, adapts them and then adds upon them to make a film that's unique and yet fits the Marvel style perfectly.While the run time may seem a tad excessive, it is necessary to cram in all of the action of this film. Make any cut to this film as it stands, and it would diminish it irreparably.Be warned: your friends will want to give you spoilers.Don't let them. This is one movie that you absolutely have to see. Second hand won't cut it.",10,5,10,4 April 2014
Doctor Strange," If Inception, Star Trek, and Dragonball had a child, this is probably what it would look like
","If it weren't already a comic, I would be scratching my head as to where this was coming from.There are familiar elements in every Marvel film, and this one checks them off one by one. Doctor Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a Sherlock meets Tony Stark arrogant genius neurosurgeon who is forced to seek out alternative treatment for his damaged hands after starring in this year's feature-film distracted-driving PSA.He meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), who while teaching Strange how to tap into the energies of the multiverse is facing a crisis brought on by her former pupil Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) attempting to bring about Earth's demise.It is by no means a secret that this film, like all Marvel solo films, ends with the hero facing the villain in a big showdown. The real surprise, though, is that the very nature of Strange's powers means that you don't really know what he's going to pull out of the hat next to solve a given problem.This makes it an enjoyable narrative to follow, even if the witty anecdotes sometimes go too far and break you out of the moment, where you realize there was just five witty comments in a row, and this is supposed to be a drama (ish).With all that being said, see this film. Just don't come drunk. Or high. The visual effects will be trippy enough.",7,2,5,4 November 2016
Ant-Man," Phase 3 of the MCU goes off with a bang!
","I would not say this lightly: this film easily rivals Captain America: The Winter Soldier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in terms of quality and fun.I can't, however, say that they are equal because they are opposite ends of the spectrum. The Winter Soldier is a very serious action film with a little bit of wit and humor thrown in to break things up. Ant-Man is a very witty and fun film with a little action thrown in to justify it being called a superhero film.The story revolves around Scott Lang, an expert cat burglar just released from prison struggling to regain his place in his daughter's life. Dire circumstances and a little unseen intervention forces Lang into meeting Dr. Hank Pym, who in the late 1960s discovered the Pym particle, a particle that decreased the distance between atoms, and was the original Ant-Man. Now older and unable to use the suit, Dr. Pym prepares Lang to step into his suit at the cusp of a dire situation.This film has just enough Avengers tie-ins to firmly establish it as a piece of the MCU, but it also stands apart. We as an audience has gotten used to the same three (or four) characters interacting in the same universe after having their own origin films. We've forgotten how to react when a new character of equal stature is introduced.This film is carried by the stellar performance of Paul Rudd as Lang as well as a great supporting cast, especially Michael Douglas's Hank Pym. However, the main villain, Darren Cross, seems a bit shallow in his performance and even the climactic battle lacks a sense of large stakes. Rather, the entire last part of the film seems to just happen with no real emotional investment. It just, is.Nevertheless, Rudd's Ant-Man is a great summer blockbuster sure to rake in millions for Marvel and Disney and it cements itself as a firm anchor for Phase 3 of the MCU to expand. Can't wait for Captain America: Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok!",9,0,7,17 July 2015
Justice League," Justice Has Dawned, But It's A Mixed Bag
","While there's no cringe-worthy dialogue akin to Will Smith saying 'So are we some kind of Suicide Squad?' but this film as a whole toes that line between awesome and passable.This film fulfills the promise made by Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne/Batman at the end of Batman v. Superman: to bring together the other meta humans of Earth to fight a threat greater than any one of them could face alone. However, if you thought the character development of the three other heroes besides Wonder Woman was lacking in BvS' email attachments, it doesn't get much better in this film.Yes, we see Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, and he definitely rejects the lame stereotype his character has been weighed down by for decades. Yes, we get to meet Barry Allen/The Flash, and Ezra Miller does a fun take on the character to complement the job Grant Gustin has been doing on the CW show. Yes, we get to finally have a proper look at Victor Stone/Cyborg, and for Ray Fisher's first major film, he does a pretty good job.The problem lies with the fact that this film can't shake the feeling that it's just an inferior version of The Avengers. Unlike The Avengers, though, where each main team member had its own film to flesh out their character and motivations and build towards a villain the whole while, this film came before that stage. Wonder Woman had her fantastic origin story, and Heny Cavill's Superman had his film as well, but all the other heroes have yet to be fleshed out properly, and it shows.The action is by far the best aspect of this film. It's what I expected going in to this film, mainly great action and just enough plot for the change in scenery between fight scenes to make some sort of sense. We get that, and it's great.The problem then comes from the plot itself, specifically the villain Steppenwolf, who is the main catalyst for the formation of the Justice League. Never mind his name alone brings to mind magic carpet rides being born to be wild, the full CGI character looks terrible for a big budget film. Plus, while his motivations are explained, barely, and full of clichés, his minions the Parademons fall into the same category as Enchantress' minions from Suicide Squad, a disposable CGI army to distract the heroes before facing the main enemy. Their creation, from the bodies of fallen enemies, holds fantastic promise but is never utilized.In short, this film is good in that it is fan wish fulfillment done properly, and has some great character moments between action sequences. I for one can't wait to see the solo Aquaman film. How much of the witty banter throughout is due to Joss Whedon taking over for Zach Snyder we may never know, but it is a welcome addition and blends in seamlessly.If you were let down by BvS and Suicide Squad but Wonder Woman had you crying for joy, this film will land somewhere in between. Check it out and see for yourself, but just know it's a dent in the DCEU's seemingly upward trajectory.",7,3,9,16 November 2017
Bridge of Spies," With subtle messaging and outstanding acting, Spielberg's 'Bridge of Spies' knocks it out of the park
","In my mind, there are only two kinds of movie: good and bad. What makes a good movie good depends on a variety of factors that boil down to one thing: does it satisfy the needs of the audience? If you go to an action movie, chances are you go into it expecting many things to blow up and not a bunch of romantic interludes. If you get a lot of booms, then you are satisfied, or if you get a lot of romance, you will probably be dissatisfied.'Bridge of Spies' is a very satisfying movie.This is not an action film by any stretch of the imagination, mind you. Only three or four booms occur and only a handful of gunshots are seen. This is not a spy film, either. True, the main points of the film centers around two 'spies.' For those not well versed in history, here's the set-up:In 1957, Rudolph Abel, played very simply yet effectively by Mark Rylance, is arrested in New York by the FBI on charges of espionage. Appointed to his defense is Tom Hanks playing James Donovan, an insurance lawyer with a good family struggling to raise his children in the midst of the Cold War atmosphere of paranoia.In 1960, Francis Gary Powers is shot down flying a U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union and is captured alive. In 1961, the Berlin Wall is erected, completely separating East Berlin from West. Finally, in 1962, a prisoner exchange is arranged for Powers and Abel in Berlin, on the Glienicke Bridge, known as 'the bridge of spies.'Donovan is given the unenviable task of defending a self-admitted spy, putting him in a position much like that of John Adams who took the case of the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. Hated by his own people for defending values that everyone in America should value, Hanks' Donovan must wrestle with his morals in the face of people who have bought into their own propaganda and forgotten what is truly at stake.Spielberg puts the values of America at the heart of this movie, but doesn't rub it in your face. On the contrary, through the simple but powerful character interactions and very simple background music, Spielberg lets the audience come to the conclusion for themselves the results of sticking to your values, even when you don't want to, with implications that easily apply today (think Guantanamo.)For those interested in history, the set directors did a wonderful job showing Cold War-era America and Berlin, Berlin especially. It's amazing to think that even 17 years after the end of World War II, East Berlin still had large sections of the city in ruins.Don't look for anything fancy, but don't look at anything at face value. Appreciate the simple yet smart repartee that Hanks shares with characters such as Abel, FBI agents, and Soviet and East German bureaucrats. Reflect on the messages that this film sends in parallel images seen throughout the film. Hopefully, you will come out of the theater feeling ... satisfied.",10,3,11,16 October 2015
Dunkirk," An experience, with an important history lesson
","After seeing it, I understand completely the campaign to see this in IMAX.For one thing, there's actually very little dialogue, so the meat of the film consists of the sights and the sounds. And they paint a pretty grim picture with some traumatizing sounds.And that's exactly the point.What Christopher Nolan has done is essentially recreate the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan, remove most of the dialogue (as well as the gore, after all it is PG-13) crank up the soundtrack, and reverse the film so the men go into the water instead of coming out.As a student of World War II history, I understand the situation of the men stranded on the beaches from an intellectual standpoint. What this film has done is what Saving Private Ryan did for D-Day: give the event real emotional stakes, which is what it needs.The British have basked in the victory of the rescue of their army for decades, but here on the other side of the pond we know very little as a society, probably because no-one has made a movie about it until now.This film has succeeded in making the disaster and the miracle come to life.As with any film, there are things that aren't quite right. For instance, it's a good thing there's so little dialogue because almost all of it is bereft of emotion in its delivery (perhaps a commentary on the rattled nerves of the men?).Perhaps the main oddity of this film is how it portrays events. There are three different story lines interwoven 1. The men on the beach, 2. The men on the boats (really one boat, captained by Mark Rylance's character) coming to save the men on the beach, and 3. Two British pilots, one of whom is played by Tom Hardy, protecting both the men on the beach and the men in the boat. Their stories are not shown in chronological order, and if you don't catch on to this in short order, you may be left confused for much of the film. Did it need this gimmick? You be the judge, but I'm going to say probably not.All told, this film's take on an event that Americans know little about may be imperfect, but it is sorely needed to show the desperate situation these men faced, and we should think about the possible consequences if those 338,000 men hadn't made it off the beach.",8,2,7,20 July 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Harry Potter's Universe Without Potter is Just as Good
","The magical community in Britain has been fleshed out rather well through the seven Harry Potter books and the eight films that followed, but America's magic users have been pretty much overlooked.Until now.The year is 1926. In the midst of the dark wizard Grindelwald wreaking havoc in Europe, an unassuming man travels to New York City with a case full of, well, fantastic beasts ( a case which goes full TARDIS, as well). There's also an unknown magical threat tearing up streets and striking fear in the hearts of the nomaj (non-magical, US term for muggle) community. The Magical Congress of the United States is searching for the culprit, and who do they blame? The unassuming man, Newt Scamander, a role that Eddie Redmayne fits into perfectly.With the help of Tina Goldstein, a disgraced Auror, and Jacob Kowalski, a nomaj who gets caught up in Scamander's creature exploits, they must clear Scamander's name and find out who is behind the attacks in New York and stop them.This film has a lot going for it, but it really holds up as an installment of the Harry Potter franchise in the way that it showcases the allure of the universe without the old story of The Boy Who Lived. It is also buoyed by great visual effects and witty banter throughout.This will prove to be just the first of possibly many films in the Harry Potter universe (and yes, Johnny Depp does show up as Grindelwald), and if this film is any indicator of the wonder this universe instills, I can't wait for more.",8,162,294,17 November 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A movie trying to forge ahead and stay true to its roots at the same time.
","When I went into this movie, I couldn't help comparing it to its predecessors. I'm not only talking about the Lord of the Rings trilogy and how well it would tie in to those movies. I am, of course, referring to the 1977 Rankin-Bass animated version. This is what I grew up with, and while these two movies are very distinct, they complement each other quite nicely.As for the title of this review, I believe that this movie was the second attempt by Hollywood in recent years to make an adventure story into an action film, succeeding in some areas and failing in others. The first attempt was The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. As with The Hobbit, this movie was good overall but the fact that layers of action had to be heaped on to make it more marketable diminished its impact.In this respect, I can see times when The Hobbit stays true to its LOTR roots and can be slotted in nicely among the franchise, as well as times when there seems to be no point besides slashing and running. However, on the whole, as with the LOTR trilogy, I look forward to the next movie to see how faithfully they stick to the book and how these events are portrayed.",8,3,10,14 December 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," A Fun Thrill Ride That Repeats Some of Marvel's Mistakes
","This is it, this is what everything has been building to since Iron Man first graced the screen in 2008. Thanos has come for the Infinity Stones, and it looks like not even the Avengers can stand in his way.This film had a massive burden to carry: how to juggle the characters from the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and Black Panther all in one movie without them stepping on each other's toes for their time in the spotlight. Despite all the odds, the Russo Brothers actually managed to pull this feat off, with every character actually fulfilling a useful role without feeling superfluous.Where this film shines is in the interactions between characters who have been isolated up until now, much like the first Avengers: Iron Man and Star-Lord, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man, Thor and Groot. The chemistry between these people is what binds this film together into something that even fans of only one character can enjoy among the ensemble.What really drives the film, though, is Thanos, the man who we have only seen glimpses of in three films up until this moment. This film really strives to frame Thanos in such a way that while you can't justify his actions, you can sympathize, or at least understand, why he does what he does. Plus, it explores the relationship that was only discussed in passing in both Guardians films, namely his status as father to Gamora and Nebula. Their dynamic is among the stronger reasons why Thanoscan be considered one of the best villains of the MCU.Where this film falters, however, is when it repeats the mistakes previous Marvel films have made. Two films come to mind when discussing this film's issues: Avengers Age of Ultron and Thor Ragnarok.Firstly, this film is really funny. The jokes are hysterical, especially the deep callbacks to previous films and the natural way they come about. There's nothing wrong with being funny. The problem comes in, much like it did in Thor Ragnarok, when the humor ends up coming at inopportune moments and it kills the dramatic tension. This is especially bad when characters discuss immensely serious matters, and a joke come in and lingers for so long, as if to reassure the audience 'hey, we're still having fun, right guys?'Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, is the problem with stakes. Coming into this film, one of the big questions on everyone's minds was would one of the main characters die in this film. After all, a couple of the main actors, especially Chris Evans, have stated their run as their Marvel characters were coming to an end. And without getting into details, this is the same problem as with Age of Ultron. When the script calls for the main threat as something that will potentially destroy all of the Avengers, you know it won't happen for one basic reason: Disney wants to continue to take your money from these immensely popular films. So, they know they can't do anything too serious otherwise they risk cutting off their cash flow.Nevertheless, despite these problems, it is worth seeing this latest Avengers film, especially for its setup of things to come. It's not the best Marvel film by a long shot, but maybe it didn't need to be.",8,0,3,27 April 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A Return to Form, But You Can Never Truly Go Home
","It can be said that there hasn't been a truly good Pirates of the Caribbean film since the first one, The Curse of the Black Pearl.Dead Men Tell No Tales is probably the next good Pirates film, but much like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it probably owes many of its good elements from the first film of its franchise.Indeed, in this fifth adventure of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, both current and a surprisingly effective de-aged version) we once again return to the well of an undead sea crew and a captain with a personal grudge against Sparrow (played by Javier Bardem, but not quite as menacingly as Geoffrey Rush's first time as Barbossa).Much like the first film, Jack Sparrow is found rather down on his luck, and he must be rescued from the executioner by a Turner (this time the grown son of Orlando Bloom's William Turner) and seek a mystical artifact which will solve everyone's problems.Let's set one thing in stone: this is definitely not the worst film in the Pirates franchise.There are many great aspects of this film, mainly stemming from the fact that this is more or less an adventure film with not too much emphasis put on the made-up rules of the mystical elements of the story.While Depp's Jack Sparrow is still the main man of the film, his role is significantly curtailed with the elements of Javier Bardem's Captain Salazar's motivations and the budding romance of Turner and Carina Smith, played by Kaya Scodelario.The problems with this film, however, stems from the fact that these two elements take too much of the film away from Depp. He tends to fade into the background while we learn about Salazar's backstory, which has a few cool Easter eggs, but not much substance, and the romance with Turner and Carina feels very, very forced.All told, even some well-placed innuendo isn't enough to take away from the fact that while this film is a return to form, almost as satisfying when the credits roll (don't forget the tantalizing post- credit sequence) as the first film, but 14 years later, the Curse of the Black Pearl is still king, and this film does not displace it.Still, this film will definitely leave you with enough of a smile on your face to make the price of admission worth it.",7,2,11,25 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," See this movie in context and it's epic. See it as a stand-alone film, and you miss the point
","'Promise me you'll find us...the X-Men...guide us.'This was Logan/Wolverine's plea to a young Charles Xavier/Professor X in the previous installment of the X-Men franchise, Days of Future Past. That film essentially gave the franchise a fresh start, free of it's past mistakes (ahem,The Last Stand, ahem). Now, we get to see what director Bryan Singer can do with his second chance.It's 1983, exactly ten years after the future-changing events of Days of Future Past. Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is full of students, Eric Lensherr/Magneto is living low in Poland with a new family, and mutants, while not openly persecuted, still feel like outsiders.Along comes En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac (Poe Damaran, is that you under all that makeup?). He's the world's first mutant, buried in stasis in Egypt after his subjects betrayed him 5000 years ago. Now he awakens to a world that doesn't worship any one god (read this as 'him'), and he sets about to fulfill his name, with the help of his Four Horsemen (Magneto, a young Ororo Monroe/Storm, Psylocke, and Angel).Faced against the end of the world, Xavier and his students must band together and fight, as Charles states: 'Those of you who have the greatest power, protect those who don't.'This film is basically the X-Men version of The Avengers. Most people familiar with the X-Men films know who the major players will be, and here we see them as separate people with their own problems who will come together to protect the people of the earth (at least X-Men aren't squeamish about saying their team catch phrases on screen, unlike some.)Now, for those who are seeing this as their first foray into the X-Men universe: don't see this film yet. The plot will seem incredibly shallow without the character backstories that have been established, and in some cases rewritten, over the past 15 years.The reviewers who saw this early clearly did not have this mindset. However, I have to concede some of their points that, yes, the dialogue seems somewhat repetitive and dull at times, elements that are repeated from previous films seem cheaper and less fulfilling the second time around, and there was really no feeling of suspense. But honestly, this is a superhero movie, are there really any true shockers in those?In short, you won't regret seeing this film if you are a fan of the X-Men franchise. The last film erased their mistakes. This new one is not a new mistake, but they now have no room for error going forward.",9,8,15,28 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A film comic book fans will love but tries too hard
","Consider Christ in the Garden of Gethsemene. He didn't want what was to come to happen, but He knew it had to happen.The same sentiment is echoed in 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2', as we find ourselves knowing deep down exactly what has to happen, but we don't want it to.For comic book aficionados, or at least people who know anything about the comics, we know exactly what we're referring to, but you still have to see it for it to sink in. Which is what makes this film, in one sense, a very powerful story and a strong addition to the franchise.On the other hand, this film is suffering from the same affliction that 'Spiderman 3' did: sub-plot-itis.We have Max Dillon, an electrical engineer with serious social issues who becomes Electro, Harry Osborn, Peter Parker's friend who eventually becomes the Green Goblin, and then we have the whole Peter-Gwen Stacy- Spider-Man trio going on all at the same time.There's one more villain that gets thrown in at the very end, but let's not beat a dead horse. It seemed that the people at Sony and Columbia Tristar have forgotten the lessons that forced them to reboot the Spider-Man franchise in the first place.Make it, and fans will come. Don't try too hard, or you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot. Again.While this film hardly does that, it does sound a word of caution to the creators. There is certainly sequel material, but look what happened with 'third time's a charm' last time.In short: fans of the comics will love this film. Serious film buffs may not like it for its fairly shallow and predictable character development. However, by the time you leave the theater, you will be filled with conflicting emotions over what you just saw.And that's a good thing, in this case.",7,1,5,2 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Solid film, but won't knock anyone's socks off
","At the end of the previous Star Wars film, we were given the ultimate tease and pseudo-promise: Luke Skywalker would train Rey to become a Jedi and she would eventually lead the Resistance against the First Order.The Last Jedi does not take us down that path, at least not the way J.J Abrams set it up, and whether that's a good thing or a bad thing is hard to figure out.This film starts out within a day or so of the ending of The Force Awakens, and if you didn't watch that film within a day or so of seeing The Last Jedi, some things will seem a bit jarring and abrupt.Nevertheless, the film perseveres with three main storylines: Rey, on the island with Luke, Leia and the Resistance in pursuit by the First Order, and Finn trying to find help for the Resistance.These three storylines do tie into each other by film's end, but none really give any satisfaction or closure. Things just seem to happen, twists occur whenever the plot needs them to, and for a film that was supposed to be much darker than The Force Awakens, akin to The Empire Strikes Back, there is an awful lot of 'comic' relief, and what dark subject matter there is isn't particularly dark.I can't say that this film is bad, far from it. There are definitely some excellent plot twists in the film, great character development on the parts of Rey and Ben Solo/Kylo Ren, and it's a pleasure to hear Luke actually speak this time!However, I can't say this film is the best in the Star Wars saga either. Somehow, it seems to just be harping the same notes as previous Star Wars films, not to the same degree as The Force Awakens, but enough to make you ask how much is actually original.All in all, I would say that in the 'definitive' ranking of the Star Wars films, this slots somewhere between Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith. Definitely check it out, but don't set your expectation so sky-high.",7,0,2,15 December 2017
Jurassic World," Solid summer blockbuster, solid reboot of franchise, but essentially a repeat.
","For those of us born at a certain time in the early 1990s, 'Jurassic Park' was THE coolest movie of that era for kids who loved dinosaurs. Its groundbreaking visual effects and life-sized animatronics made it a very believable scare fest.Fast forward 22 years, and you've got yourself something that's good, but not quite 'Jurassic Park' good.Our story begins at essentially the same part of the first movie about half and hour in; everyone who works at the newly built, polished, and open to the public for several years now Jurassic World park believes their system to be foolproof, the eccentric head investor wants what will wow the kids regardless of wisdom, and only one man recognizes the powder keg they are on: Star Lord.That is, Owen Grady, played by Chris Pratt. An ex-Navy officer who now trains Velociraptors to respond to commands, is brought in to inspect the holding pen of a newly created genetic hybrid predator. The park staff, including the park operations manager Claire Dearing, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, believes that the new Indominus Rex to be the next big thing.However, like Ian Malcolm in the first film predicted, 'Life will find a way.' Soon enough, mayhem ensues in a not-so-surprising manner and evolves into a perfectly reasonable 'Jurassic Park' movie.The problem is, this movie was not supposed to be just another 'Jurassic Park' movie. After waiting over a decade for the fourth installment of the franchise, we were hoping for something truly groundbreaking, something to rival that of the first movie.Three words: not gonna happen.Don't get me wrong. This film is filled with great dialogue and well-timed humor to break up the action. Nevertheless, you can't help but be distracted by all of the none-too-subtle references to the first film, as well as the massive amounts of way-too-obvious product placement (I'm looking at you, Mercedes!)Big picture, though. If all you're expecting is a well-paced thriller with cool dinosaurs facing off against a Guardian of the Galaxy, this has it all and more. If you were hoping for the shining herald of the next generation of 'Jurassic Park', all I can say is keep looking.",7,6,21,11 June 2015
Logan," A last hurrah for a battered hero worthy of praise
","This is the second R-rated comic book movie to come out in recent years, the first of which was Deadpool. As Deadpool said in that film 'This guy's got the right idea. He wore the brown pants' right before killing him.There are many faceless henchman who should have worn their brown pants in Logan.Logan is the ninth time Hugh Jackman has appeared in the role of Logan/Wolverine, and it shows in his performance. The film is set in the late 2040s, mutant-kind is all but extinct, and Logan is not the hero he once was. He is shown to be a tired warrior whose spirit is wounded just as much as his weakening body. He tends to a fading Charles Xavier, who in his 90s is losing control of his powerful and dangerous mind.Then along comes Laura, a young girl with familiar gifts, and Logan must saddle up for one last ride. There was much buzz around this film as it was reportedly Hugh Jackman's final film as Wolverine. In interviews, Jackman has said he poured his heart into this performance, and it shows.Boy, does he knock it out of the park.The theme of Logan's character throughout the X-Men films has been that he is a man struggling with both his identity and his guilt. We got a taste of his road down the hole of depression and remorse in 2013's The Wolverine, but here we see Logan hit absolute rock bottom. Nearly everyone he ever cared about is gone, his last remaining friend is slipping away, and to top it all off, his own powers are fading. We can only imagine the feelings that the character would be feeling, but Jackman's performance brings us as close as we can come.Aside from Jackman, the other absolutely stellar performance was Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23. Her character starts out fairly simple, but becomes the basis for a deep bond to form between her and Logan. Her performance gave the film some of its biggest laughs, its most intense action scenes, and one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in the film.What faults there are in this film are surprisingly small. The main villains of the film are very one-dimensional; at times, the film almost goes deep into their motivations, but abruptly interrupts itself in lieu of more awesome fight scenes. There are certain characters that the film wants you as the audience to care about, but in reality you just don't, and the film moves on to bigger and better things. All things being considered, these are things the audience can accept as they take in the film's many other positives.Logan may well be Hugh Jackman's last time baring the claws, and if it were I would say that this film is a very fitting way for Wolverine to say good-bye.",9,2,6,2 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A whirlwind of action that ties in all of the separate franchises, but a bit hectic
","It began with a simple premise, conjured up in the mind of our favorite genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, Tony Stark: artificial intelligence. 'Peace in our time', Tony says is the stated goal.The end result is anything but.Ultron is born out of good intentions, and so begins the Avengers' greatest challenge since, well, since the last movie. It is undeniable that this film is the best overall Marvel movie yet, as it successfully and not in an in- your-face manner, ties together all of the separate franchises and their characters (notably, Idris Ebla shows up as Heimdall and Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter makes an appearance as well).However, before the tempest over throwing down the 'undeniable' word grows too strong, let's point out some of this films more prominent weaknesses. Some of the best action is in the very beginning, but you end up missing some of the best parts because the film dives into it from the very first frame and you have to play catch-up to figure out what's happening (however, regular Agents of SHIELD viewers will be able to transition much easier).Also, for those who are not fluent, or even slightly versed in Marvel lore, there will be many segments where characters are introduced where you just say 'who?' Finally, for those who are fans of the other films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film will bring in some of your favorite supporting characters and then relegate them to bit parts (Falcon gets it the worst, he's in one scene in the beginning and a virtual flash frame in the end. Really?)However, if you go into this movie with the strengths and weaknesses in mind, you will be hard pressed to argue with the assertion that this is Summer 2015's can't-miss movie.",8,2,7,1 May 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A Formula Only As Good As Its Variables
","In my estimation, every Marvel movie has to have its own formula, which only really becomes evident in its sequels. Iron Man has Tony's creations turning against him. Thor has his brother issues to deal with. Captain America gets drawn into philosophical battles.For Guardians of the Galaxy, their formula seems to be: 80s references, cool soundtracks, and trying to work together. In the first film, these all worked together to make an incredibly fun movie.The second time around, well, the formulas the same, but somehow it just doesn't add up to a greater product, or even an equal one.don't get me wrong, there is still a lot to love about this second outing of the space Avengers. This time, we find the Guardians in the midst of what they said they would do at the end of the first one: hero work and crime.Once the hero work is done, and the crime comes back to bite them, the Guardians are stranded on a planet where out of the blue Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is reunited with his long-lost father, Ego (Kurt Russell). It seems to be a happy reunion, but of course not all is what it seems.This movie does what all good sequels should: continue where the previous film left off but expand on what's come before. This expansion (those who see it will get the pun there) is most seen in the development of the characters of Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Nebula (Karen Gillam), mere supporting characters before, now with extra depth and both do a superb job of complementing the main heroes.Where Volume 2 falters is in the usual pitfalls of both sequels and Marvel. The soundtrack in particular, while adequate most places, had only one scene where the song perfectly complemented the scene and will be remembered as being the Come A Little Bit Closer scene. It's a shame, since the first one had the Come And Get Your Love opening rat- mic scene, the Hooked on a Feeling and Pina Colada Song prison scenes, and the Ooh Child dance-off finale.Plus, without spoiling everything, once the true villain is revealed, this film proves that Marvel has yet to make a second compelling villain to match Loki.With all that being said, there is plenty, PLENTY, of things to enjoy in this film, and while it may prove not to have the timeless quality the first one has, it is still a damn good ride that I would gladly ride again, and so will you.",8,0,1,5 May 2017
American Made," Truth is Often Stranger Than Fiction
","I will admit, I don't know as much about this time in history as I feel like I should. Plus, with many 'Based on a True Story' movies, it can be hard to tell sometimes what actually happened or what was compressed or exaggerated for a movie moment.But if even half of what happened in American Made is true, then it would still be a fantastic story, and Doug Liman did an excellent job bringing it to life.Tom Cruise plays Barry Seal, a pilot for TWA who is recruited by the CIA to take reconnaissance photos of Central American militants during the late 1970s to early 1980s. However, his life gets more interesting/dangerous/lucrative when he gets roped into working for Pablo Escobar smuggling drugs, and eventually transporting weapons to the Contras of Iran-Contra infamy.These events play mainly as a stage setting for the story of Seal as he juggles all of these things while trying to provide a good life for his wife Lucy, played by Sarah Wright, and their children. It presents an interesting dilemma: does Lucy trust Barry, even if it means building a fantastical rich life only to have it potentially crumble away?Indeed, Doug Liman does a great job showing the chemistry between Cruise and Wright, and in that is the film's strength.It also has fun with the narrative structure, with Seal essentially narrating his exploits through recorded tapes after the fact.Where the film sometimes slides is when it has to stop dead and explain just who all the players are and what the significance of these events is. Sure, at first they can be funny in their presentation, and as someone who doesn't know a lot about these events it can be helpful, but it tends to interrupt a fun scene at a critical time, killing the mood a bit, and it breezes on to the the next scene without a chance to bring that mood back.Overall, I would say that this film is a fun historical drama with plenty of good-natured humor to keep it afloat, and even if some things may not have actually happened, you don't care because everyone involved is having fun as well.",8,2,5,28 September 2017
12 Strong," An adequate interpretation of events, but lacks depth
","The story of the Horse Soldiers, a group of twelve Special Forces soldiers who were sent into Afghanistan in the weeks following the 9/11 attacks to lay the groundwork for the Taliban's downfall, forced to ride horses against tanks and rockets, is an extraordinary tale of heroism against inconceivable odds and a proud moment in the history of our armed forces.While this film tries, and mostly succeeds in retelling these events, there's just something off in the way the whole thing is packaged.First off, there's the characters, mainly the three big names: Chris Hemsworth as Captain Mitch Nelson, Michael Shannon as Chief Warrant Officer Cal Spenser, and Michael Peña as Sergeant First Class Sam Diller. Their motivations and development is done only to the bare minimum, with Hemsworth being the only one with a true character arc. Of the other nine soldiers in the team, only three or four actually get their names spoken more than a couple of times throughout the film. The main supporting character is Navid Negahban as Afghan General Dostum, who provides most of the character drive for Hemsworth's Nelson to change. He has a couple of powerful moments, but he is sopposed to be portraying one of three Afghan commanders who are fighting the Taliban, but also would fight each other if the chance arose. This conflict is only brought up in passing, though it is built up multiple times.Then there's the main reason the story of the Horse Soldiers is so extraordinary: the fact that these twelve soldiers and a few hundred Afghan tribal warriors had to face fifty thousand Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters, facing off tanks and artillery on horseback.The battle scenes are well shot, with only a handful of scenes with excessive cuts. The final horse charge is especially well done and feels earned. However, they don't seem to convey these overwhelming odds as well as they could. With all of this being said, this film leaves me with the same feeling that World Trade Center (2006) did. Both of these films portray events and people under extraordinary circumstances accurately, more or less, but it just feels like those involved in both films were just going through the motions, trying to replicate feelings around events that may never be able to be truly replicated.All in all, 12 Strong is a thoroughly average depiction of extraordinary events, not bad but not great. You're probably better off reading the book on which this film is based.",6,17,45,19 January 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Great monster fights, very dull humans. The (almost) perfect monster movie.
","A 15-story ape throws a palm tree like a dart through the windshield of a Vietnam-era Huey with Creedence Clearwater Revival playing in the background.And that's just the first thing Kong does.If all you want is more stuff like that, plus some amazing monster on monster battles, then this is the movie for you. If you're looking for compelling human characters to go with those fights, then you walked into the wrong auditorium.Kong:Skull Island is the second film in the still-forming Monsterverse, the first being 2014's Godzilla. As such, there are several threads to tie these two films together. Don't worry, there are no real spoilers here.Of course, the main point of this film is to see King Kong fight some monsters, but the story before that involves John Goodman's character, an agent of Monarch, the monster organization from Godzilla, lead an expedition to Skull Island. Ostensibly, they are there to survey an uncharted island that's been inaccessible for centuries, but as the humans soon discover there's more to the mission than first thought.To qualify the opening statement, this film is really not about any of the people shown. As such, no character is given any real development or subtext except for John C. Reilly's character, a stranded World War II fighter pilot named Marlow (read as reference to Apocalypse Now, which this film clearly emulates, down to its Vietnam-era setting and themes.) At times, the human characters get their brief hints at deep moments, dragging the scenes out too long, until some are inevitably killed by one creature or another.However, by far the best parts of this film are the creatures. Obviously Kong is the main creature, and the CGI work on him is incredibly detailed. But the other creatures as well, such as a giant water buffalo, giant spiders, and especially the lizard-like Skullcrawlers, are all entertaining to look at whether the humans are (trying) to kill them or Kong is bashing them apart.This film is really about the monsters, as well it should be. All of the great monster movies of old followed the same basic set-up. Some human story that gets characters to go on some vaguely-defined mission that quickly falls out of importance in favor of epic battle scenes between two or more monsters, broken up every so often by more human scenes which serve only as a rest break for the audience between battle scenes.This film follows that model to a tee, and in a sense is a response to criticism of 2014's Godzilla which had hardly any great battle scenes between Godzilla and the MUTOs, and too much human interaction with characters we didn't necessarily care about.The humans do indeed take more of a back seat in Kong, and there are way more creature battles and action scenes. However, the humans still have slightly too much screen time, and at these times the movie plods.Nevertheless, this film is worth it for the creature battles alone, and the end credit scene which reveals so much tantalizing promise for the future.",7,3,6,11 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A fitting capstone to an epic franchise.
","On December 17, 2003, The Return of the King ended perhaps the greatest film trilogy of modern times, culminating in a practical Oscar sweep, tying only two other films for the record number of awards. Almost 11 years later, The Battle of the Five Armies closes another film trilogy.However, don't expect The Return of the King when going to see this.The tag line for this film, One Last Time, is fitting, and sets the mood for the whole film, as it serves as a big good-bye from Middle Earth. As the title suggests, Thorin, having reclaimed the Lonely Mountain, has to face many different armies in order to protect the dwarfs' home.Bilbo Baggins, on the other hand, sees through Thorin's mask of righteousness to another battle raging inside Thorin: whether to keep his word or protect his gold.At 144 minutes, it will feel like this film is not as long as the other films in the franchise, which may disappoint people who come to see three hours plus of Middle Earth action. Others may be let down by the seemingly disappointing ending, which ends where An Unexpected Journey began.Nevertheless, with all of its warts, this movie is worth seeing if only to experience a Lord of the Rings movie one last time.",7,3,8,16 December 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," If You Already Know The Ending, It Isn't As Good
","As with any film centered around a mystery, there's a thrill in following the evidence, trying to figure out the whodunit and the how. If you go back to it afterward, you may find a new tidbit here or there, but the original thrill is gone.Such is the case with the latest adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel.This is a beautiful film to look at, as are many modern films, and it is fun to immerse into the period of the 1930s, especially the details of the crime (which revolve around a case that is based on the real- life murder of Charles Lindbergh's baby in 1932), and the mystique of the Orient Express, for as one character muses, how fascinating it is to see a group of people with nothing in common but the shared need to go from one place to another, forced together, never to see each other again.The characters, too, are interesting portraits of the many types of personas familiar to the era, with the most stereotyped personified in director Kenneth Branagh's portrayal of detective Hercules Poirot. Like the critically acclaimed 1974 adaptation of Christie's novel, this film assembles an all-star cast to fill the roles of murder suspects, including Johnny Depp, Daisy Ridley, Judy Dench, Josh Gad, Willem Dafoe, and more.The film expertly weaves the tapestry of the crime and the many, many red herrings that are left by the murderer, as well as Poirot's attempts to establish a motive to explain the crime. At each turn he finds links, but something eludes him until the grand reveal at the end.However, it's that grand reveal where the film can feel a bit lackluster, especially if one already knows how the story ends, for as best as I can tell, this film does not add an new twists or surprises to the original Christie story, and when the reveal finally happens, not only does it feel somewhat underwhelming because it seemed perfectly obvious all along, but the motivations is played without a sufficient amount of weight.That's not to say that the reveal wouldn't be powerful to someone unfamiliar with the particulars of the story, but for someone who is, this film's replay value is essentially nil.However, this film's brilliant performances and dry wit throughout makes this film enjoyable for anyone with a taste for mystery and wonderful theater, for this film feels more like a traditional play than a film, and it's the better for it.",7,2,7,9 November 2017
Wonder Woman," Best superhero movie ever? No. But third place is not bad at all...
","If we were to rank all of the modern superhero movies, and by that I mean starting with 2000's X-Men, which was the first true modern superhero movie after the glory days of Tim Burton's Batman and Christopher Reeve's Superman, number one would probably have to be The Dark Knight, followed closely by Captain America: The Winter Soldier.Wonder Woman would be third on that list, and since we live in an age overflowing with superhero films, third place is nothing to be ashamed of.This film is, in a word, epic. Not in the same way as a film like Lord of the Rings is epic, with large scope and breathtaking battle scenes. Rather, its epic feel comes from the great performances and sheer raw emotion Gal Gadot conveys as the titular heroine Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman.The film takes place as a flashback, beginning with Diana being sent a photo sometime after the events of Batman v. Superman from Bruce Wayne, a photo teased in that previous film, and brings us to Diana's childhood on the island of the Amazons, guardians of the world tasked with one day defeating Ares, the god of war, should he ever return.One day, Diana sees a plane crash off the shores of her island. The pilot, Steve Trevor, played excellently by Chris Pine, informs Diana of the war going on in Europe, the War to End All Wars aka World War I.She then embarks on her quest to fulfill her people's mission, for she believes Ares has returned and is at the heart of this war, and if she defeats him, the war will end. Thus begins her transformation into the heroine that would be known as Wonder Woman.This film had a lot riding on it, mainly because the DC Extended Universe has had to play catch-up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the past four years, with Marvel having a five year head start (Iron Man came out in 2008, whereas Man of Steel, the DCEU's first film, came out in 2013).Therefore, it's all the more impressive that a cinematic universe still in its infancy, and after the relative disappointments of Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad, can produce such a strong origin story of a superhero that many may not know too much about.Where this movie shines is the chemistry between Gadot and Pine, and the levity that comes from misunderstandings, a common comedic trope but it feels so genuine between these two that it feels fresh.Also, props to Hans Zimmer, who, while not composing the score for this film, made the unofficial Wonder Woman theme (refer to 'Is She With You?' from the Batman v. Superman soundtrack). Whenever it plays in this film, it sends chills down my spine because that means something bad-ass is going to go down. Way to go!Where this movie may falter is in the inevitable comparisons. There's no getting around the fact that this film, for all of its great qualities, bears much resemblance to Captain America: The First Avenger, due to its period setting origin story, among other things.Nevertheless, this film is a testament to what the DCEU can be, and I can only hope that Justice League lives up the the very, VERY high standard Wonder Woman has now set.",9,6,17,1 June 2017
Black Panther," A culturally important film, but a fairly paint-by-numbers MCU film
","We finally get a peek behind the curtain at the mythical Wakanda, a nation and its protector the Black Panther, that have been hinted at and built up since Age of Ultron (or even earlier, if you count the Easter egg in Iron Man 2), and while this film does not fail to provide us with great action scenes and vibrant culture scenes, as well as probably the most interesting Marvel villain since Loki in Killmonger, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed.Don't get me wrong: every scene with Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa is near perfect, both inside the Black Panther suit and out.His story in this film picks up a short time after the events of Captain America: Civil War, where his father King T'Chaka was killed in Vienna, and T'Challa must ascend to the throne of Wakanda. But, other forces are pushing him in a darker direction, and he must choose what kind of a king he must be.The film shines whenever we get to see T'Challa interact with his fellow cast members. Whether it be with Forrest Whittaker's character, Zuri, an elder statesman and friend of T'Chaka, or T'Challa's sister Shuri, played beautifully by Letitia Wright, Chadwick Boseman seems to have good chemistry with just about everyone.The film also boasts a great villain in Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger. While his performance may feel only a hair more than one-note, his character development and motivations are some of the most compelling in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Much like Loki, the conflict derives from a family connection. Unlike Loki, his cause is something you can actually see yourself supporting to some degree.Where this film falters, at least in my view, is in the seeming lack of character development in almost anyone else in the film. Aside from T'Challa, his friend and ex-lover Nakia, played by Lupita Nyong'o, is the only one who has an easily identifiable character arc. Everyone else seems to stay in their own little bubbles, which is fine for some, but those who probably should have developed but didn't is a little frustrating.Also lacking is the seeming paint-by-numbers of the whole thing. The action scenes are impressive and there are the occasional jokes that land almost always, but it just feels a little too self-serious in its delivery, and when it tries to be light-hearted or semi-silly (mainly the scenes with Andy Serkis's Ulysses Klaue) it's jarring to say the least, mostly because it feels very forced.Nevertheless, this film is without a doubt a culturally important film, and true to form the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to produce a truly bad film. However, I still rank Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the first Iron Man ahead of this one.",7,1,17,16 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Good news: the negative reviews are overly harsh. The bad news? It's not by much...
","It's perhaps fitting that this review be written on Easter, the most important Christian holiday there is, in the context of a superhero film whose core message boils down to a line Ben Affleck's Batman utters in the trailer: 'Tell me (Superman) do you bleed?', echoing a similar philosophical question asked of God. This is essentially the kind of superhero film we were given when everyone else was expecting an all-out brawl between the title heroes and the eventual setup for the Justice League.Set about two years after the events of Man of Steel (2013), the world is still wrestling with the reality that they are not alone in the universe. Many people turn to Superman (Henry Cavill) as a savior figure (heavily hinting at a Jesus parallel, although the film never out and says it.)Opinions are divided as to whether Superman's actions are for good or evil, and out of this chaos a new vigilante emerges in Gotham, one who brands his criminal victims with the sign of the bat.Before the eventual promise of the film's title is fulfilled, however, we are also introduced to Jessie Eisenberg's Lex Luthor; a cunning yet unstable man who seems to get whatever he wants and is always two steps ahead of Superman and Batman.Without revealing any key plot points, here's the rundown. Batman and Superman do fight, but only after you sit through two hours of solid back story and deep moral debate bantered back and forth, but mostly forth by Lex Luthor. Wonder Woman does show up, but again, only at the end. Finally, except for small teases, none of the other Justice League members show up. Sorry, we'll just have to wait for the full Justice League movie in a couple of years.If you were expecting a full-on Batman vs. Superman experience on par with the major superhero fights in The Avengers movies, prepare to be disappointed. If you didn't want to sit through two hours of debate about the morality of heroes being above the law before any real action starts, you too will be disappointed.However, all hope is not lost. As a continuation of the events of Man of Steel it serves as a solid film. It also serves as a wonderful teaser for Wonder Woman out next year. Moral of the story: if you market a film as an action film, less preaching more punching. Honestly, this film could have really used more Wonder Woman...As for the religious overtones: to be offended by this is a bit of a stretch, then again it's a stretch to think Superman would be practically worshiped. Either way, whatever moral questions you may have had going into this film, don't expect to walk out with answers.",6,1,8,27 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A great action/ sci-fi film, an adequate Star Wars film
","There was always an inherent danger in hyping this movie so much that people were (metaphorically) punching each other out over opening night tickets and threatening to murder anyone who breathes a spoiler.Such was the case with Episode I sixteen years ago, only that film everyone realized after the fact that it really wasn't as good as they thought (ahem hmm) Jar Jar (ahem hmm).Luckily for J.J Abrams, this film will not fall flat on its face.However, like the Force there's a light side and a dark side of looking at The Force Awakens. Let's consider the good first.Technically speaking, I would have to call this film nearly flawless. With Abrams' use of real film and models over CGI whenever possible, this film has the look and feel of a classic Star Wars movie in that regard.Breathtaking scenery, more nostalgic set nods to the original trilogy than I could count, and excellently choreographed X-Wing/TIE Fighter battles make this a very entertaining movie to watch.The actors: also near flawless. Daisy Ridley's Rey, John Boyega's Finn, and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren all shine in their respective performances and prove that they belong in the next generation of Star Wars. The old hands, Harrison Ford's Han Solo, Carrie Fisher's Leia, and Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker all make their appearances (though don't expect the world out of Luke in this outing) in decent performances that show their characters with the same determination as in the original trilogy but tempered by age and wisdom. Good acting by Ford especially, but boy do those three look old now.Now for the bad.I won't give away plot details, but I recommend you limit yourself to watching A New Hope in your pre-screening binge-fest, as its general movements will seem very familiar upon viewing this film.Which brings up the main complaint against this movie: it has all the elements of a Star Wars movie, but it just feels like it's missing that certain... something... that binds it all together and makes it great.Now, does that mean that just because this film does not live up to the hype of being the best film of all time it automatically is a dud? NO. No no no no no no.Enjoy the hell out of this movie for what it is: Star Wars: The Next Generation. If Star Trek is any indicator, then I predict a vibrant future for the franchise after this film.",7,1,10,18 December 2015
Life," The so-so love-child of Alien, The Andromeda Strain, and Gravity
","In general, horror films tend to follow the same formula: introduce main characters and their friendship, introduce monster, monster kills them off one by one, and there's some kind of twist at the end.Life follows this formula as well, and there are absolutely no surprises.The story centers around a group of scientists aboard the International Space Station, who analyze soil samples brought back from Mars and discover a form of life from Mars. They work on it in space so as not to risk Earth, which proves to be a wise precaution as the Mars life form (which is named Calvin by schoolchildren planet- side) grows rapidly and decides it doesn't want to be a lab specimen anymore.There are many obvious parallels to Alien/Aliens as it is set in space, revolves around a small crew aboard a space vessel getting picked off one by one by a creature, and they can't risk it getting to Earth.However, at least with Alien we know it's predominantly a horror film with a sci-fi setting. Life, on the other hand, can't seem to decide if it's a sci-fi film that happens to have horror elements, or a horror film that is trying to be a sci-fi film. In the end, it's trying to be both and kinda failing at both.To be fair, there are some good character moments. Ryan Reynolds is a bright spot in a cast of otherwise one-dimensional characters, and even though Reynolds' space mechanic character is also one- dimensional, at least he's enjoyable to watch. The rest of the cast gets fairly cursory character set-up, and by the end you just don't really feel a sense of loss when someone inevitably dies. Finally, the creature itself, while intriguing when starting out small, turns into a pretty generic space monster by the end, which is fine but breaks no new ground and leaves you feeling kinda blah about the whole thing.All in all, this film is not terrible, it does not make for painful viewing, nor does it make for edge of the seat thrills. It's a very average film with some big star power attached to draw you in, and if you go into this film knowing this, then you'll be fine.",6,23,46,23 March 2017
Incredibles 2," An Enjoyable Reunion, But Lacks Some (Super) Secret Ingredient
","SPOILER: Let me get this out of the way: Incredibles 2 is a very enjoyable and fun film that will entertain both young and old, and you should go see it.Having said that, I can't help but dwell on the fact that this film somehow doesn't feel as special as the original.Perhaps it's because when I saw the first Incredibles film, I was 11 years old, and the superhero phenomenon was just beginning to gain steam (Spider-Man 2 came out in the same year, 2004). But now, I'm 25, have seen way, way more superhero films, and Incredibles 2 just feels like one more good superhero film. It's good, but the original was special, and this doesn't feel very special anymore.Perhaps this film has been overhyped in my mind. It's been 14 years between films, a long time to wait. They even did an intro video with Brad Bird, Craig T. Nelson, Helen Hunt, and Samuel L. Jackson, saying 'We get it, 14 years is a long time, but trust us, it was worth the wait.' Was it, though?Don't get me wrong: it was very fun to see Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack together on the big screen again. Plus, we got to see what happened with the Underminer!But, this film's marketing was heavily based on Jack Jack, and the discovery of his new powers. In that, they did a good job, and Jack Jack was pretty much the best thing in the film (in a good way). However, we say this 14 years ago in the short film 'Jack-Jack Attack' with babysitter Karli, and to be honest I would much rather watch that than Incredibles 2, if given the choice.Overall, I liked this film, from its heroes to its villain, whom you see coming a mile away but it's fun to guess just how and when our heroes will figure it out and how they'll stop said villain. Nevertheless, I think this film will be more special to those who can see these films back to back with a young eye. There's plenty for parents to enjoy here too, but for those of us who were kids when the first one was released and had to wait those 14 long years, I think we should temper our expectations and just enjoy the ride (speaking of awesome rides...)",8,3,11,15 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," A few too many cheap jump scares plus too little suspense makes an average Alien film
","Following the disappointing Prometheus with an attempt at a re-invigoration of the Alien franchise was always going to be a tough task.While this film didn't fail at that, I can't say it entirely succeeded either.Alien Covenant takes place about ten years after the events of 2012's Prometheus and follows the colony ship Covenant, on its way with 2000 colonists to a new world when it intercepts a rogue transmission from a nearby system.Upon exploration, it turns out it is the planet where Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and David (Michael Fassbender) ended up, with the seeds of the Xenomorphs in tow. Things go predictably downhill for the crew of the Covenant from there.This film has a couple of interesting twists on the classic Alien formula, most notably the rapport between Fassbender's stranded David, and the updated model Walter, also played by Fassbender, and the interesting dynamic that develops between them. Also, this film, since it takes place before the events of Alien (1979), explores the evolution of the Xenomorphs from how they appear in Prometheus to the familiar figures we've known.Unfortunately, the rest of the film is fairly shallow in its delivery. The characters are pretty common horror film tropes, down to Katherine Waterson's adequate but barely compelling portrayal of Dany Branson. Thee are plenty of jump scares, as well as scenes of Xenomorphs killing people in pretty brutal ways. Too bad the first Xenomorph bursting out of the back was spoiled in the trailer, since that was probably the only cool innovation in this film.Alien: Covenant is no Prometheus in terms of absurdity, and will be a worthy addition to the Alien franchise (I guess it's now a Sextillogy since this is the sixth film?) I would recommend seeing it, but as with many franchises that last six films and nearly 40 years, the first film or two are always the best and the rest try to recapture the magic and never quite succeed.",7,6,14,18 May 2017
Furious 7," A defining moment in a series marred by tragedy
","Tyrese Gibson says it best near the film's end, 'things aren't going to be the same again.' This is true in every sense of the word, as the characters and the audience gear up for a film that has all the feel of being a last ride.It's hard going into this movie to not think in terms of how Paul Walker's character Brian O'Connor will turn out after the actor's sudden and tragic death last November.Fortunately for fans, thanks to some clever editing, digital facemasks that are nigh indistinguishable from the real thing and help from Walker's two brothers Cody and Caleb Brian O'Connor is able to join the crew for another mission to protect family against the sins of the previous film.Deckard Shaw, the brother of Fast 6's villain who is in a hospital crippled and on life support, vows revenge on those who hurt his brother. This leads him to Tokyo, finally tying the continuity gap between Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift and the three sequels after it, which were in-movie-timeline before Tokyo Drift.The crew is being systematically targeted, and it is up to Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto to protect his family, but most importantly his new extended family of his nephew, while O'Connor struggles with the settled down life of being a family man.The movie's ending, due to events, had to be rewritten to give Walker's character a proper send-off. Any details would rob viewers of its potency and heartfelt emotions. However, the tribute, and this film, show that the franchise can survive in the face of tragedy, and this film's theme can be felt in two simple words:For Paul.",7,1,14,4 April 2015
