Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Shopping for A sword now!
","Watched this when it first came out, but for some reason I wasn't a big fan of Uma at the time. I remember thinking she was kind of annoying and funny looking. Watching now I loved the way Thurman played her role as 'The Black Mamba' the deadliest woman on Earth. I'm the same age now as Uma was when she filmed these 2 movies and I have so much appreciation for her unique features now. There was nobody better to play this part and the dialogue between her and Bill(David Carradine) had chemistry that you just don't see very often. Every scene they're together captured all my attention so I could just focus in on their acting. The classic Tarantino style is like nothing else. Anyone else get that urge to go shopping for a Hattori Hanzo sword right after watching??",9,0,0,5 June 2020
Captain Marvel," Worst Marvel movie since Fantastic 4
","I left the theatre saying to my friend 'That was pretty good hey?' but as the 2 hours of my life I lost replayed itself I quickly corrected myself to 'Actually that was the worst Marvel movie I've seen in a very long time wasn't it?' My friend agreed Marvel was probably due to have a flub after many great hits in a row. There's just nothing original about this 'Hero' movie. Brie Larson is becoming the type of actor Marvel is leaning towards. Pretty face, but absolutely no life experience and for a super-hero with god like powers she really seemed uncoordinated to the blind eye. I was looking in the credits for how many stunt doubles were required to carry Brie's lack of athletic ability through this movie to try and give some credibility to 'the most powerful hero in the Marvel Universe!' Personally I think Caitlyn Jenner would have been a better option to play Captain Marvel and get across the points that Disney and Marvel seem to be attempting to get across in this movie. The whole character is so boring because she's like Superman, but without the weakness to kryptonite. She has no weakness whatsoever and crushes her enemies like flies. I was unimpressed by this film, and I think it will be an insult to all the other great characters in the Marvel Universe if she really is the hero of hero's that rescues the Marvel Universe from Thanos.",3,38,69,13 March 2019
Us," I can't think of a more awful film
","Acting is just pure garbage.
Annoying Caucasian vs African American references that are even less subtle than 'Get Out!' This movie is just a complete insult to our intelligence. There is no logic to anything here.",1,2,3,27 July 2019
Creed," One of the best of the Rocky series
","It took a little bit for the story to develop, and even Stallone's first scene had me doubting thinking Stallone had lost it. As the movie went on and Stallone became more and more engulfed in his relationship with Adonis the movie grabbed a hold of me.Sly absolutely steals the show in Creed and I will be rooting for him to win the Oscar for best supporting actor. His speeches are so real and heartfelt to me I couldn't help but tear up by watching his performance through the movie. Rocky really portraits the type of person I hope to be in my old age coaching and training the young and talented youth.I give the movie a 9 out of 10 because although Slys performance is a 99 out of 10 the rest of the cast is really just average and pales in comparison to what Stallone left on the table. I do think that Michael B Jordan has a bright future but it is evident he didn't entirely have the life experience to fully take on this role and own it. When Stallone goes full depth into his role the actors in the movie can not go there with him unfortunately. The movie would be even better if Michael could keep up with Stallone on the emotional moments of the movie.",9,7,11,7 January 2016
Aquaman," Aquaman was far better than I thought it would be
","Aquaman exceeded my expectations in every way. This is the type of superhero story that I've seen directors in the past get over confident in, and simply tell the story. It appears the director James Wan has seen that far too often and really got creative on how to keep the viewer engaged beyond just the CGI.
The story within the story is how a man who was raised on land, but the powers to live under the sea adapts to living in the abyss for longer than he has before. Some of my favourite moments are when Mera/Amber Heard is adapting to life on the surface, and her acting indicates that she's enjoying her experience on land more than she thought she would.
James Wan has all sorts of little plot twists that helped keep me engaged throughout the whole movie. I would like to see more of that style in the upcoming DC films.
The acting is just OK for me in this film and that's why I didn't score it a 9 or a 10. No one really steals the show, and Jason Momoa has a tough rugged image, but I haven't seen anything from him that would suggests there is an Oscar in his future.
This is a movie you can just sit back and let it entertain you for 2 hours+. I highly recommend the film and I believe this is a cut above the rest of the DC movies I have seen to date other than the Nolan movies.",8,2,3,26 January 2019
Interstellar," Interstellar: A thought provoking gem! 10/10
","I can't put my finger on why, but I shed tears during this movie at more points than any other movie I've watched. The moral of the story is that life is a process of constantly making decisions. You can make intellectual decisions, decisions out of love, or decisions just for survival. Most of the time when you play it smart and try to do the intelligent thing you'll still miscalculate something and make a mistake. As hard as it is it's always better in the end if you follow your heart, and chase the feeling of love. Decisions for survival is by any means necessary. You can lie or cheat for survival and do whatever you have to do. It's ironic that McCaughnahey doesn't want any of the important people in his life to ever feel like they're alone, yet he's willing to travel deep into space all alone as a sacrifice for others.",10,0,1,30 March 2020
Pacific Rim," Finally caved in and watched Pacific Rim and I'm happy I did!
","When Pacific Rim first came out I felt like I was so bombarded by the likes of Transformers, GI Joe, Godzilla and all the Marvel and DC movies that I just couldn't wrap my head around the idea of another Sci-Fi; 'world in jeopardy' style film, but now having watched Pacific Rim I've got to admit that it's a pretty cool story. Giant monsters called 'Kaiju' start randomly coming out of the Pacific Ocean to wreak havoc on the most densely populated cities on the planet so Earth comes up with this idea of building these giant mech-warriors called 'Jaggers' that are about the same size as the monsters in order to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the monsters: Awesome!To me the battles are really high end CGI, but at the same time sort of lack creativity in some ways and are a little slow. I grew up on 90s style action-cartoons with fight scenes that were right on par with my imagination so I thought there could have been more creativity with how to beat these monsters and look better, and faster doing it.For the most part I was pretty impressed by the acting. Hunnam and Elba lead the story really well playing off of each others grittiness and remaining calm despite the fact that they know mankind may not be able to survive the next attack from the Kaiju since the relentless assault of the past 10 years has really taken its toll. The only character that seemed out of sorts and unbelievable was Rinko Kikuchi. I don't know what B-level soap opera they found her in, but everything she did seemed unauthentic for the situation of the movie. Charlie Day somehow seemed less annoying than he usually is and dare I say his comic relief was much appreciated? Ron Pearlman's cameo was a great bonus as well!I give this one an 8/10 and if you liked Godzilla I think you'll like this movie even better!",8,0,0,23 May 2020
Baby Driver," Baby Driver is a Masterpiece!
","I don't think you can ask for anymore then what Baby Driver delivers!! I was on the edge of my seat and more entertained by this film than most films with a budget of $200 million or more! I don't need to put any spoilers on this review, but I just think this is perfection in the world of entertainment. There is just so many surprises and things that caught me off guard. The acting was fantastic from everyone. Sure there's been thousands of heist movies before and this is certainly in the same genre as Oceans11 and movies like that but it just really seems different and original in a time where it feels like every movie being made is a remake. I could bring up certain plot points, but I think I'd be doing this movie a disservice. This writer and director deserves all the credit for taking us on the emotional rollercoaster!",10,0,1,20 June 2019
Warrior," UFC fans will be disappointed. More for marines!
","If they could have gotten the fighting right this easily could have been the best sports movie ever. The director had an idea of the emotion he wanted from the MMA scenes and it was just so wrong. No strategy at all just going straight for the jugular, and then these huge flamboyant throws with no takedown defence whatsoever.....I think the director had more of an idea of the life of a marine and he wanted to tie that into this movie. MMA fighters are so much more loose in real life than what this film shows. In reality most former marines that have tried their luck at MMA get a rude awakening because they are so tight, and aggressive like Tommy's fighting style in this movie that they're predictable and get caught with counter-strikes by professional fighters. For Tommy to go into this tournament and just knock 3 world class fighters out in a row within seconds is along the lines of Neo dodging bullets for the first time in the matrix for realness. Fighting is more of an art form than just raw aggression the way this movie portrays it. The acting in Warrior is absolutely incredible and drew me in better than any other sports movie maybe besides Rocky. Nick Nolte so deserved to be nominated for an oscar for what he did. Shout out to Bryan Callen impersonating Joe Rogan for what he does ringside at UFC. I loved that part too especially since Joe and Bryan are buddies in real life. Great acting. Bad fighting. 8/10",8,0,0,4 May 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Infinity War is Cinematic Perfection!
","There is no film, or series that is comparable to the Avengers entire series and Infinity War completely blew Age of Ultron away. I think the directors, and writers for this movie deserve a ton of credit for how they wove all the MCU movies to this point together without skipping a beat. What they did was so complex, yet it came out very easy to follow as I watched the movie. One mistake anywhere throughout the film easily could have blown everything, but I thought it was flawless. The last 2 Transformers movies are a good example of a high budget movie where a couple mistakes early on just take all the credibility out of the viewing experience and then the viewer can't help but roll their eyes throughout. I double down: Infinity Wars maintained credibility throughout and there were absolutely no character hiccups. I'd like to point out that in the most star studded cast ever Josh Brolin stood out and completely stole the show, in his portrayal of Thanos. They did a really cool job with the CGI to sort of make Thanos resemble Brolin and also follow his movement. I assume they would have had Brolin in some sort of a suit so they could easily mimic his movements for the character, but his voice acting was on another level. The way he inflected the tone just sent chills down my spine, and sent the message across to me of exactly what Thanos is all about. Like you can tell from the tone in his voice that he's been wiping out planets and civilizations for so long that he feels no remorse, and he's actually doing a good deed to the Universe every time. The scariest part of Thanos is that he truly believes he's the good-guy even though we've all established that he is the most evil dude in the Universe. I couldn't have imagined anyone else coming anywhere near how well Josh Brolin portrayed this megalomaniac! They did such a great job of casting every character I think. So far there is only 2 actors that I didn't like cast for the role they're in: 1. I don't like the way Danai Gurira plays Okoye who is T'Challa's right hand lady in Wakanda. She just always seems like she's trying too hard to be tough. The other person I don't like the casting of and has me sort of dreading End Game is Brie Larson who plays Captain Marvel who is supposed to save everyone in the next movie as we got the little Egg in the final scene after the credits of Infinity War. Other than that the cast is great. The balance of all this different colourful personalities of super-hero's seems to be spot on here. I highly recommend watching this 10/10 high-octane, super-smash, block-buster hit!!",10,0,0,25 April 2019
Get Out," How to address race. The elephant in the room!
","This is pure genius film making to me. Movies like this crush the entertainment value of a lot of high-budget blockbuster style movies, because the acting is on point throughout the movie, and it addresses thought provoking social issues that a lot of people deal with on a day to day basis.
I have seen anything from Jordan Peele that I haven't like in the past. In fact I always get a sense of originality and executed timing with his comedy and this movie certainly follows suit in a horror aspect. The quality of the acting and chemistry amongst the characters clearly stems from the directors passion on the subject of racism. For Jordan you can see the racism he deals with in life isn't white people chasing after him with pitch forks, looking to do physical harm to him, but it's the complete opposite. Peele appears to draw from his real life experiences where people of non-black races try to be overly nice to him and overstep certain boundaries trying to recognize him as an African American and that makes him feel socially awkward. The film addresses many social stereotypes on the social awkwardness of different coloured skin people fitting in together. Watching this movie it is quite evident to me that we just haven't figured it out as a society how everyone can be satisfied with our interactions amongst each other. We certainly know that it's unacceptable for different coloured people to be violent and hateful towards each other. This film addresses that it's not appropriate for non-African-American people to address any black-stereotypes, and we hear so often 'treat everyone equally,' but that's sort of an oxymoron as well because people of the same colour don't treat everyone inside of that one colour equally as it is and combine that with the fact that people are encouraged to be proud of their culture and personal colour, and the result is that in North American culture their really is no 'Right way' for different coloured people to appropriately interact amongst each other.
To wrap it up the directing, acting, chemistry amongst the cast, shots and set is all great. Really original movie and well worth watching.",9,1,3,30 January 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," This movie kicked ass!
","The script for this movie should be hung next to the Mona Lisa, because it is a piece of art! Never in a million years thought this would be the best Marvel movie yet, but it is!! Get used to the name Chris Pratt because you're going to be seeing a whole lot more of him! The only thing I was upset about was that I did not coin the nickname 'Star Lord' for myself! He's everything Hollywood was hoping that Dane Cook, and Ryan Reynolds could be when they took a shot on those guys! Pratt is the future #NoHomo. So often in these movies you get a really good lead actor, and then the supporting cast isn't believable. Or maybe the lead actor is to much of a try hard, and then the supporting cast has to pick up the slack, but leaves you wishing the lead actor was better. I've seen a lot of these movies and I can say that the cast and script was picked perfectly. I was skeptical at first of what changes Disney would make to the Marvel movies when they took over, but so far they're killing it! I think if Siskel and Ebert were both alive to witness the Disney take over of Marvel they would give it 2-thumbs up even if they aren't all that into Sci-Fi films! I'm excited for the next one",10,1,5,5 August 2014
Jurassic World," Visually stunning!
","This film is so visually stunning I feel obligated to score it 8/10 despite the worst script for a high budget movie I have ever witnessed. By ratio of budget to script quality it has to be the most atrocious. It goes without say the fine folks down at Universal Studios have a keen eye for breath taking visuals, but still have a lot to learn in human psychology and what constitutes realistic dialogue and dare I say 'They don't even understand basic small talk??' Chris Pratt was phenomenal as usual, but after him the acting quality takes a massive nosedive. The only way I can possibly justify how this is possible is that Pratt had to be given some looser boundaries with how he was able to
Perform his lines vs the other actors in the movie and thank heavens the director allowed this. There is no other way you can explain how Pratt seemed so much more authentic and genuine than any of the actors in the film. Without Pratt's personality and improvisations which brought this movie to life it may have been just another generic robotic movie! If they can maintain the visual effects and improve the script for the future I think we have some great Jurassic Park movies coming down the pipe for the future!",8,0,0,1 July 2020
Black Snake Moan," It's a miracle!
","A movie made to capture the lifestyle and essence of 'The South' as in Southern USA and they didn't have that moment where a white man blatantly gets racist with an African-American. That alone was just so refreshing to see. With the main characters of the movie you get a great look at 3 levels of acting with Samuel L Jackson being an upper echelon elite actor who can just make anything work and make it authentic and natural without even trying. Then there's Christina Ricci who has a pretty incredible actor in her own right. She really nails this role and I just worry after not hearing much about her after this movie if she got so deep into this role of a woman struggling with sexual promiscuity that it sort of tainted her image and limited her ability to continue getting roles in big movies?! Her acting is really great and while it's not as natural and easy as Samuel's compared to JT you would think she was related to Marlon Brando! Timberlake has the 3rd dynamic part in this movie and it just seems like he's trying to hard to act, but at the same time it gives a great gauge on just how great Ricci and Jackson really are. The Blues music inspiration and base of this movie gives it such warm personal character. What a great job the director did if keeping that constant 'blues' energy from start to finish. I give it an 8/10",8,0,0,19 June 2020
Man on Fire," Grabs hold emotionally then takes you for a ride!!
","The acting in this film is so unique in a way that only Tony Scott and Tarantino can pull off. It's phenomal! It's just a gift to everyone!! You've got a great cast of high-caliber actors, and the director did everything he could to not restrict anyone, and seemed to really let everyone be loose to see what kind of improvisational things they could do in the moment. I would bet $1000 that Tony Scott did not ever yell 'Just read the lines off the script' during the filming of this movie. That's the part that puts this film in greatest of all time territory. Like Christopher Walken licking his fingers before uttering 'Creasy's art is death,' is just something that no one else could really pull off, and I'll never forget.
The bond that builds throughout the film between Denzel and Dakota Fanning that starts with Denzel trying to push her away and then he just can't fight it anymore so he almost takes her under his wing like his own daughter creates this emotional bond to the film that I don't think has ever been done as powerfully in any other movie. What it does is set such a heavy anchor down that when the film takes are sharp left turn with Dakota being kidnapped I wanted so badly for Creasy to get his revenge on the kidnappers and any and all torture was totally justified! Denzel makes one promise to Dakota Fannings mom and that's that he's going to kill everyone involved with the kidnapping.
One crazy thing that I would have liked to have seen more detail about was how the lawyer(who is played by Mickey Rourke) is killed. It's like a 'WTF' moment because Creasy goes to kill him, but by the time he gets there he's already dead floating in his pool with his throat slit and there's a bloody Japanese katana laying on his desk. Like It's Mexico City! When did the Akuza get involved in this and decide to kill the lawyer?? You can't just put a bloody katana at the scene of his death with no explanation!!
Anyways Despite the confusing lawyer death I still give it 10/10 and the best action movie I have ever seen.",10,0,0,8 April 2020
Parasite," Not Oscar worthy. Not even close
",With all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the Oscar for best Picture I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me. There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film. I'm very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture. Surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this? I give it 5/10,5,7,9,18 March 2020
The Dark Knight Rises," The one Batman movie that has it all
","I don't hand out 10's very easily, but this movie earns it on so many levels. First off, it's no secret that there are a ton of Batman movies and I can see why! As Christian Bale says in this movie 'He's the hero anybody can be!' The very thought of batman is thought provoking and gets my imagination stirring just thinking about what I would do as Batman. So this movie has to compete with all the other Batman movies before and I really believe it sets the standard for the Batman movies to come. It also is competing with all the other trilogies that have ever been made. My opinion is this is the best Batman movie made and it's also the best trilogy ever made.
For the trilogy aspect Nolan could sleep easy throughout the making of these movies knowing he had a talent like Christian Bale in the lead. The entire trilogy has an easy to watch aspect around every character in the movie for the most part remaining constant emotionally, and personality wise while the one character constantly evolving throughout the 3 films is Bruce Wayne(Bale). His transition from an old crippled man in this film to a physical specimen in order to overcome the greatest challenge of his life was very entertaining to experience vicariously through Bale, and he is such a great method actor that I literally felt the transition as I watched him perform. In all forms that Bruce Wayne takes on in this movie though, Bale holds a calm humble demeanour about it that I want to relate with, but is really amazing to me how he holds that tone throughout. I can describe Bale's acting as 'Chameleon-like' or a 'Shape-shifter' and his talent is on display as he evolves through this film.
The glue that holds everyone together around Christian's talent is the master-communication ability of the brilliant director Christopher Nolan. I think he did a great job of simplifying the right areas so the twists really have an impact. He makes it very clear and easy to understand what he wants everyone to do, and then the result is the movie sends the message that he wants, and in this movie it's the feeling of 'Pain!' Everyone experiences some level of inevitable pain in this movie and Nolan does such a great job of making this crystal clear so the viewer can experience it. This movie tells me that Nolan just gets communication on every level from subtle little shoulder shrugs, to public speaking on a podium and he helps each of the cast members communicate the emotions they are trying to get across, but he allows them to do it in the cast-members unique way, so nothing feels forced about the acting in this movie.
The shots of the city in different angles and the score just added to the overall effect in the movie and I could really feel the chemistry and passion of the entire crew and cast alike. There is an aura about this film like everyone working on it knew they had a chance to be one of the greatest movies of all time and it very well could be. Without a doubt this is the most realistic super-hero movie ever made. It is also the best 3rd part to a trilogy which isn't hard because most 3rd movies in a series disappoint in general. The evolution of Bruce Wayne alone from start to finish makes this the most interesting trilogy. I highly recommend this film!",10,0,0,24 January 2019
Alien: Covenant," I thought it was better than AVP!
","Michael Fassbender steals the show. I came in expecting a real people vs aliens type of a plot, but was very entertained by how Michael plays the cyborg in this movie and brings about thought-provoking points about the evolution of artificial intelligence in general. Aside from that the acting is just ok, but there is some beautiful cinematography. Lots of jump scenes and I give the suspensefulness throughout an A+",8,2,3,25 March 2019
