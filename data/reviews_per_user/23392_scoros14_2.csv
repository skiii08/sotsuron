Hereditary," 10 for the marketing team
","You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. Perfect marketing job but the problem is that at the end you will see the film. Not even scary, bad acting, stupid ending.",7,0,2,1 October 2018
Sicario," Don't!!!
","How on earth such a movie took so good ratting? 8? 8? 8 for what? For watching Chevrolet cars going around? For watching in one film all we hate in the American cinema? Which was the role of Emily Blunt in the movie, why she had to be there? Why Joss Brolin had to give that terrible act? Why all had to go to the plan?. Don't watch it people its a serious waste of time. Better watch a documentary about Sonora desert and not spend time with such a movie a 12 year kid could write. Without even seeing it you know how thing will end up and even when the movie has the chance for something different is wasting it with typical heroic acts. Del Toro is good but only that.",5,2,5,22 December 2015
