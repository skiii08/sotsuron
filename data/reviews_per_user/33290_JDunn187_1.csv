The Blair Witch Project," I spent $7.50 for this?
","I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' the second day of its release anticipating to be scared senseless.  A long and often dull hour and a half later I knew that I had wasted my $7.50.  What was hyped to be one of the scariest movies of all time turned out, to me, to be one of the most uninteresting and boring movies I've ever seen.  Literally the only thing that kept me from leaving early was to find out how the film ends.  And once I learned that I wished that I'd have left when I wanted to originally.  All in all the film was not scary, suspenseful, or even interesting in the slightest degree. The only thing I will give for this 'horror' is that it is, indeed, horrible.",2,0,1,2 August 1999
