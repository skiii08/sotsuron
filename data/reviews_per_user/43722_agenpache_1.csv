Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Better than the third
","The fourth installment has definitely made up for the third one which was so so so bad. Captain Jack is back. Not as good as the first and best of the series but a great turnaround from the last. I would say that this is better than the second and I love the casting of Penelope. She's great and a good replacement for Kiera Knightley. I'm glad ORlando is gone too!!!!!!!Great actors like G. Rush......I loved him in The King's Speech. Great actors, great storyline and fun plot. Cool Cool flick Most importantly, Jack Sparrow is back and better than we last saw him!!!",6,1,2,22 May 2011
