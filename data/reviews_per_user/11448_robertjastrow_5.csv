Iron Man 3," Don't bother
","Um, er.....Iron Man the wimp (he keeps having poorly scripted panic attacks) and his suits (quite a few of them) don't need him to beat up bad guys. Damn automation kills yet another job.Robert D does an OK job, but the plot is rather limiting. He spends most of the movie out of his suit as it is broken. The villain was poorly depicted. Close calls are way too overused. The kid side plot was OK, but was not used in an appreciable way to make the story any more valuable. Ultimately Iron Man is more of another RED suited superhero to the kid in the end by way of gift saturation. Overall it was very poorly done. I really liked the Iron Man story and the other movies, but this one was just stupid.I thought it was better than ST ITD that was just released though, but that is not saying much.",3,1,3,19 May 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Garbage
","JJ, you really are destroying a large piece of scifi history.Star Trek was never an action based show/movie. It was always a story that had supporting action elements. This movie is completely devoid of any cohesive story and is an action junkies dream come true.Kirk in the original series was confident, capable, intelligent, suave, etc.... The new and improved JJ version of the character is a moron. Don't get me wrong, I really like the choice of actor, but the character portrayal which is dictated by the writers and directors is everything the original Kirk was not.Space ships crush under pressure....its physics dumba**es...the Enterprise is not a submarine. I could go on and on, but I find it all a bit depressing. Star Trek is after all just a piece of fiction. ...now lost to time to only be remembered by a new generation as bad fiction.",1,188,272,18 May 2013
Cloverfield," Blair Witch Project sequel
","I would have walked out if it were not for the $40 in tickets, popcorn, and drinks we already invested in this complete waist of time.1. If I am constantly reminded that I am watching a movie, I cannot get absorbed in the action, and thus cannot enjoy the experience.2. Making scary monster movies that follow the standard formula of characters doing what they know they should not do when facing a scary monster(s), is not scary.3. If someone is stupid enough to carry a camcorder around a city while being chased by monsters, he deserves to die, and he deserves to die a horrible death with no one grieving over him.4. If someone is stupid enough to carry a camcorder around a city while your friend is try to carry a severely wounded friend around debris, rubble, etc... by himself, he deserves to die a horrible death with no one grieving over him.5. If someone is stupid enough to carry a camcorder around a city while large dog size bugs are literally trying to carry you away to eat you, he deserves to be carried away and eaten.The list goes on and on.I found the movie insulting. I suspect they realized they royally botched this and thus ran the lack luster ad campaign to not let anyone know this was a Blair Witch Project sequel.If I knew who to send a bill to, I would send them a bill for my time and the $40 I invested in the movie.",1,3,7,26 January 2008
Oblivion," Simple and Fun to Watch
","I left the theater pleased. I find Tom C to be hit or miss for the movies I like. This one was good.The story was presented in a n easy and simple manner. The plot contained a couple of well managed twists without spending the entire movie playing the 'can you guess the plot twist' game with over used hints. For the world the story presents, the plot lines did not seem to have and horrible contradictions and the flow was simple enough to follow. The characters were presented and developed well. You felt comfortable with them and felt for them during their challenges in the story. I did find an element of confusion rectifying the elements surrounding Tom C's interactions with the 'aliens' when they tried to capture him and what you find out about them later in the story. Most of those elements are explained away later in the story but there are elements I thought did not fit.I recommend the movie. It was simple and fun.",7,0,1,19 May 2013
The Dark Knight," Above Expectations
","Very enjoyable, although a bit long. The Joker was played brilliantly by Heath Ledger. Two Face was a nice addition and fit well in the story as well. I found it a shame that the Two Face character wasn't explored further. It seems that is may have been a better choice to introduce the Two Face character in this movie as they did and then leave him for the villain for the next movie, instead of killing him off so quickly.Special Effects were excellent (although the car turning into a motorcycle was a bit of a stretch for my taste). Acting was very good, especially for Heath Ledger (what a loss of talent). Plot was excellent for a superhero story line.Overall I was very pleased.",8,0,7,4 August 2008
