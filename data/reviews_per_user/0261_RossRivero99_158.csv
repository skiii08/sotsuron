The King's Speech," Colin Firth at his Oscar winning finest
","Tom Hooper's The King's Speech tells the true story of King George VI (played by Colin Firth) who as we see in the movie has a speech problem and can't deliver speeches without stammering. And so his wife Elizabeth (played by Helena Bonham Carter) takes him to speech therapy in which his therapist is a failed actor named Lionel Logue (played by Geoffrey Rush) who realizes that they need to make friends in order to have good times together during therapy even though they are exact opposites. Hooper uses a very good cast (besides Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter.) which includes Guy Pearce as George's brother Edward, Michael Gambon who is unrecognizable as King George V, Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop, 1'and many mire. The movie is dramatic throughout most of the film but is also humorous in some scenes as well. The movie itself is well done because of how it was written and thanks to the wonderful acting and the masterful direction by Tom Hooper.",10,0,1,9 October 2014
The Mask," A hilarious superhero comedy
","Jim Carrey is one of the most gifted comedic actors of all time with some really funny performances in movies like 'Liar Liar' and 'Bruce Almighty' and this movie is no exception and is a perfect vehicle for his wild and manic screen persona. Carrey plays a bank clerk named Stanley Ipkiss who lives alone in his apartment with his little Jack Russell Terrier Milo who is probably one of the smartest and most clever dogs we'll ever see in the movies. One day on the job he is talking with his best friend Charlie (Richard Jeni) who also happens to be his co-worker when suddenly a blonde bombshell by the name of Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz in her debut movie role) who wants to make an account while flirting with Stanley at the same time but is really using the flirtation as a distraction because she's really there to retrieve information from the bank with a hidden camera in her purse and relay it to her boss/boyfriend Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) who is planning a robbery of the bank. Later that night Ipkiss is standing on the edge of a bridge and suddenly sees an odd looking mask with a bunch of garbage around it which makes it look like a person has risen from the water, and being the good samaritan that he is thinks someone is in trouble and tries to help only to realize that it's a bunch of garbage and takes the mask with him back to his apartment. He then tries on the mask and it makes him swirl like a tornado in the midwest around his apartment and the mask makes him do all sorts of crazy things throughout the movie, and Ipkiss is always questioned about the mask character by a reporter named Peggy (Amy Yasbeck) and a police Lieutenant named Kellaway (Peter Riegert) who is always on Ipkiss's tail. The movie is very funny and the special effects make the movie a whole lot funnier while aslo having very good action sequences, but the movie's real focus is the relationship between Carrey's and Diaz's characters with their excellent chemistry together. This movie makes me even more eager to see Jim Carrey in more dramatic parts after watching a movie that sometimes loses its footing a little but is injected with life everytime Carrey is in any scene in this movie.",7,1,1,12 June 2019
The Avengers," Best of the MARVEL film series
","Joss Whedon's The Avengers is truly one of the best action moves along with a perfect cast for an action picture of which that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Scarlet Johannson. With great action sequences, costumes, and special effects, this movie was one of the most groundbreaking visual achievements of 2012. The movie also goes on a par with great MARVEL films such as the Iron Man trilogy, Spider Man's 1 & 2, X-Men, The Incredible Hulk, Ghost Rider, Captain America's 1 & 2 and more. Not only this was a great movie it was also one of the best movies of 2012 because of how well this movie was done.",10,1,4,14 June 2014
Vertigo," The Best movie of 1958
","Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is a true suspense movie masterpiece with James Stewart giving a towering performance as a retired San Francisco detective who is suffering from acrophobia investigates the strange activities of an old friend's wife, and while becoming dangerously obsessed with her. The girl who Ferguson gets obsessed with is played by a young Kim Novak. What Hitchcock tries to do with all of his movies is try to put all of the suspenseful moments where they absolutely need to be including with this movie as well. Also Stewart was absolutely perfect for this part in this great movie. But it was the love story that made the movie even more suspenseful, just like his 1955 film To Catch a Thief. Also this film entertained me from start to finish, I would recommend this movie because I thought it was a movie worth watching from my perspective.",10,2,3,18 May 2014
Scarface," One of the greatest gangster movies ever made
","Brian De Palma is arguably one of the greatest filmmakers of the last 50 years with classic films such as 'Carrie' (1976) and 'The Untouchables' (1987) to his name with this movie he has made his masterpiece and one of the finest movies about the mob ever put on film along with 'The Godfather' (1972), 'The Godfather Part II' (1974), and 'Goodfellas' (1990), but unlike those movies it doesn't touch on the Italian mafia. Al Pacino stars in perhaps the finest and most manic performance as Tony Montana a Cuban exile who ends up in Miami and is desperate to find a way to make a living in America by any means necessary with his best friends Manny (Steven Bauer), Chi Chi (Angel Salazar), and Angel (Pepe Serna) in a refugee camp and as a result becomes a part of the mob. in order to make money and survive. Montana then meets a drug dealer named Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) who gave them green cards and a pardon for a murder they committed in Cuba. Then Montana becomes friends with another drug dealer named Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham), and falls in love with Frank's wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). This movie focuses so much more than Montana's life of drugs and crime it also focuses on his family relationships with his mother and his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) disgusted at the fact that he lives a life of crime, and is really a study on Montana's character but mostly doesn't portray him in the best way throughout the movie. The performances in the movie are rock solid with Pacino and Pfeiffer being the biggest standouts, and De Palma's direction is top notch with a very masterfully written screenplay by Oliver Stone. The movie is a remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster film of the same name with Paul Muni in the lead role which I still have yet to see. This is a must see film for anyone that calls themselves a film buff and is a masterpiece of the crime genre.",10,0,0,11 May 2019
Captain Phillips," One of the best movies of 2013
","Paul Greengrass's Captain Phillips is the riveting true story of the 2009 hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama by the pirates of Somalia. The movie stars Tom Hanks who brings the real life character of Captain Richard Phillips to life on the screen, and also in one of his best performances which too bad for him he did not get an Oscar nomination for his Oscar level work in the film. Director Paul Greengrass has crafted a film that goes on a par with JFK, Munich, Thirteen Days, Mississippi Burning, and The French Connection. Though historically accurate throughout, this movie made my list of the top 10 films of last year because of how well this movie was done. What a wonderful piece of work!",10,1,4,6 June 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of Spielberg's best films, and one of Ford's best performances
","Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark was one of the most entertaining, riveting, and exhilarating action/adventure movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The movie stars Harrison Ford as Dr. Indiana Jones an archaeologist who is trying to look for the Ark of the covenant and try to protect it from Nazi capture, the film is filled with perfect action sequences, and the music for the film is what makes the movie even more entertaining. Spielberg and George Lucas makes very interesting plots whenever he decides to make a movie which is why most of the movies he's directed i along with audiences and critics alike consider them to be classics. Harrison Ford gives his best performance since the original Star Wars movie (along with Karen Allen.). This is one of the best movies ever as well as being the best movie of 1981.",10,2,5,19 July 2014
Spartacus," one of the best movies of 1960
","The best of the gladiatorial epics Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus had one of the best ensemble casts I have ever seen on screen, Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Jean Simmons, Woody Strode, Peter Ustinov, Charles Laughton, John Gavin, and last but not least Tony Curtis. Based on a true story Spartacus resembles really what being a slave and turning into a gladiator was really like for the Romans and the pain they went through as a slave. Director Stanley Kubrick really worn this movie to perfection with his absolute masterful direction. Kirk Douglas gives the best performance of his career and tells us why he became a movie star in the first place, and the same with Olivier, Laughton, Ustinov,Gavin, Simmons, Curtis, and Strode.",10,2,5,13 June 2014
Deepwater Horizon," Peter Berg's most thrilling and emotional movie yet
","Peter Berg's 'Deepwater Horizon' is a not only a movie on a great suspense level but it is also a movie of deep emotion and sadness with some aspects of the movie in which Berg uses to his advantage in order to make this into a very effective movie which is his best movie that I have seen since his 2003 film 'The Rundown'. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg in one of his very best performances as Mike Williams who is the chief electrical technician on an offshore oil rig called none other than the 'Deepwater Horizon'. The opening scenes of the movie are probably the most emotional that I have seen where he is talking with his wife Felicia (Kate Hudson) and his daughter (Stella Allen) when he knows after he says goodbye to them it could be the last time he may ever see them. Once they get to the rig the person in charge of operations on the rig is a man named Jimmy Harrell (Kurt Russell) whose job is to make sure that things are going smoothly at all times. Then Mike ends up meeting a man by the name of Vidrine (John Malkovich). As the film progresses things end up getting more suspenseful and the person who is watching the film ends up being on the edge of their seat because the oil pipe tests aren't indicating anything good and then all hell breaks loose and the rig is engulfed in flames. The movie was based on true events which makes me feel like while watching the movie that I was actually with the characters during the explosion. The most effective scenes are in the end of the movie where no words are spoken just shocked and saddened facial expressions and music which to me personally makes it one of the most emotional endings in a movie that I have ever seen along with 'Schindler's List' (1993), 'The Green Mile' (1999), and 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004). This was a very good movie and I am hoping to see more from Peter Berg in the coming days and years, this is one of the best movies of 2016.",10,0,1,27 February 2017
Chinatown," Classic police movie
","Roman Polanski's Chinatown is a true example of a classic police movie. The movie tells the story of a private detective named J.J Gittes (played by Jack Nicholson) who is hired to expose an adulterer named Evelyn Mulwray (played by Faye Dunaway) who ends up finding himself in a web of deceit, corruption, and murder. The movie stars Jack Nicholson as Gittes who also specializes in matrimonial cases then gets hired by Mulwray to suspect that her husband i having an affair with another woman. Director Roman Polanski made this film turn out to be a success at the box office, this movie compares to police movie classics such as Dirty Harry, The French Connection, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, The Departed and many more. This film also has a kind of similar plot line just like John Huston's The Maltese Falcon but with Humphrey Bogart in the title role. The movie also stars John Huston as Dunaway's father, Burt Young, Perry Lopez, and John Hillerman. This movie is one of the v very best police movies ever made in the history of cinema.",10,1,2,30 April 2014
Gravity," One of last year's greatest films
","While I was watching Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, it reminded me of another movie which was Ron Howard's Apollo 13 (1995) because both movies had to do with astronauts in space (in which Apollo 13 was based on true events.)The movie stars Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone a medical engineer who teams up with an astronaut named Matt Kowalski (played by George Clooney) to survive a catastrophic event which was their shuttle getting destroyed while drifting in space. It is very strange that Bullock and Clooney are the only two cast members in this movie as well as the voice of Ed Harris as the mission control director back in Houston, one thing that this movie tries to teach us is that being stranded in space is much worse than it seems. Clooney and Bullock are nothing short of brilliant and I really do think that Sandra Bullock should have taken home an Oscar for her career defining work as well as giving her best performance since her Oscar winning turn in The Blind Side (2009).Cuaron's directorship for this movie is just perfect, and the score by Steven Price is what makes this movie even more suspenseful, but while we are watching this movie we don't even know if Clooney's or Bullock's character dies within the course of the movie.",10,3,6,6 October 2014
As Good as It Gets," One of the all time greatest romantic comedies
","When I first saw this movie about five or so years ago I couldn't get past the opening scene just because at my age I didn't like the concept of main characters who are insensitive and totally lack a filter when talking to other people, but watching this movie in its entirety last night made me realize that it had so much more heart that I didn't get to see or notice when I first saw the beginning of this movie. The movie is a character study of Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) a novelist who has written over 60 romance novels that are very popular, but during the course of the film we discover that he is a man who suffers from obsessive compulsive disorder and refuses to take his pills to improve his condition. Udall is also a germaphob, and always stays true to his habits such as not being able to walk on lines and other stuff of that nature. Udall also goes to the same restaurant every morning, has the same breakfast and asks for the same waitress whose name is Carol (Helen Hunt) who hates him due to his personality and because he made an insulting remark about her son who has been suffering from asthma, and takes care of him with the help of her mother (Shirley Knight). Udall also has a gay neighbor named Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) who is an artist that has a dog named Verdell whom Udall develops an affection for, and also has a person who happens to be a good friend of his named Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding Jr.). Also during the course of the movie we see Udall's transition from a grumpy curmudgeon to a nicer person, as well as the relationship between Melvin and Carol improving drastically. The movie was directed and co-written by James L. Brooks who previously directed popular films like 'Broadcast News' (1987), and 'Terms of Endearment' (1983) unseen by me. One thing that I have noticed in some reviews that I've read about this movie that there was a lot of comparisons to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol' as to how Melvin Udall is this movie's version of Ebenezer Scrooge. The screenplay is expertly by both Brooks and Mark Andrus and they both deliver the proper comic timing at just the right moments, as well as with standout performances by Nicholson, Hunt (who both won Oscars for their respective performances). Kinnear (who received a Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor), Gooding Jr., and well as Knight (who gives her best performance since her Oscar nominated work in 'Sweet Bird of Youth'). Though this movie is very well made there is some fairly minor problems that I have with it as to some of the dialogue that Helen Hunt's character spoke in the movie with her mother about going out to dinner, and how she spoke to the doctor who is trying to help her son with his asthma (Harold Ramis), which I will not spoil. This is a very heartwarming and hilarious movie that proves that sometimes the meanest people can have a soft heart inside, and that people can change for the better during any situation even towards a gay neighbor who got robbed and beaten and in need of financial assistance. What a beautiful movie to watch, and a near masterpiece.",9,1,1,13 July 2017
Citizen Kane," A masterpiece
","'Rosebud' marked the last words of Orson Welles' character in his debut motion picture Citizen Kane one of the best movies ever made. The movie stars Orson Welles as Charles Foster Kane a newspaper tycoon who recently passed away and a whole lot of reporters scramble to find out what the last words 'Rosebud' really meant, not only that it also tells the major events that happened in his life. The movie stars Orson Welles in a superb performance as Kane a man who not only wanted to become a newspaper tycoon but also wanted to become the governor of New York state but unfortunately for him lost the election. The movie combines a lot of genres such as drama, romance, comedy, mystery and suspense. Writers Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles made a screenplay that was very suspenseful and interesting and the most important part was what Kane's last utterance 'Rosebud' really meant. There was a lot of other good performances throughout Joseph Cotten (in his film debut), Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, and especially the director, producer and star Orson Welles. the movie may seem a little confusing at times but it still is a great movie.",10,7,9,16 June 2014
Inglourious Basterds," A Tarantino masterpiece
","Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds is a masterful WWII fantasy about a man who creates a team to kill every Nazi that comes in their way, that man is Lt. Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt). Even though this was a very entertaining movie, before I watched it I thought it was unlike Quentin Tarantino to make a WWII period piece. Brad Pitt gives one of his best performances of his career, and including Christoph Waltz who won an Oscar for his brilliant performance in this film as Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. The dialogue in this movie looks so realistic as did in his 1992 directorial debut Reservoir Dogs. Sometimes I think that Tarantino's movies are more violent than some Scorsese movies. Not only I think that it is one of 2009's best films, I also think it goes on a par with some of the best military movies ever made.",10,1,2,25 June 2014
Amistad," Great movie about fighting for freedom
","Steven Spielberg without question is the world's greatest director thanks to masterpieces like Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Jaws, E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Lincoln, Munich, and of course this film. The movie tells the true story of an 1839 mutiny of a slave ship named La Amistad that is traveling towards America's northeastern coast. The movie stars Djimon Honsou as one of the slaves on the ship whose name is Cinque. The movie also stars Matthew McConaughey, Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Hawthorne, and Anna Paquin as Queen Isabella II of Spain. What Spielberg tries to teach us with his film is that how badly treated the slaves were while on that ship of torture and abuse and how they fought for their freedom in real life. Director Steven Spielberg really knows where to put the facts in his historical epics. This movie in my critical opinion is the best movie of 1997 is because of it's inspirational details of why racism was wrong in the first place.",10,0,3,30 April 2014
42," One of the best baseball movies ever made
","Brian Helgeland's 42 is not only about a black man who overcame racism just so he can make it to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, it is the true life story of Jackie Robinson (played by Chadwick Boseman)and Branch Rickey (played by Harrison Ford) who supported him the whole way through. I was disappointed to find out that this film didn't garner any Oscar nominations when it had all of the ingredients to an Oscar fora baseball movie. Director Brian Helgeland has crafted the best baseball movie since Sam Wood's 1942 baseball biopic about the life of Lou Gehrig The Pride of the Yankees. I really think that this is one of the best movies of 2013 because of the inspiration and the message that the film tries to send to us and that no matter what skin color you have all men will always be equal no matter what the difference.",10,1,3,24 June 2014
Argo," Ben Affleck's greatest film yet
","Argo was another great for director, producer, and star Ben Affleck but this time he is playing a real life person of which that is Tony Mendez the CIA operative who wanted to make a fake science fiction movie just so he can get the American hostages out of Iran of which Jimmy Carter did nothing about and what Ronald Reagan took care of on his first day in office as president of the united states. The movie also has other great performances throughout the film not only form Ben Affleck but from, Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, and Philip Baker Hall. Director, producer and star Ben Affleck has crafted a landmark that for me counts as one of 2012's greatest films.",10,0,4,13 June 2014
12 Angry Men," Henry Fonda's greatest performance
","Perhaps Sidney Lumet's most widely acclaimed film 12 Angry Men was a true masterpiece for a directorial debut. The movie tells the interesting story of a dissenting juror in a murder trial who slowly manages to convince others that the case isn't as obviously clear as it seemed in court. In which the Juror that tries to convince the others is played by Henry Fonda who gives the best performance of his career under Lumet's masterful direction. The other jurors are played wonderfully played by Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley Sr., Jack Klugman, and Lee J. Cobb (in his best performance since On the Waterfront.). In my cinematic opinion I consider this film as not only a great from Sidney Lumet but I also consider it as his best movie that he ever directed. But there was other masterpieces that he directed in his career for example The Verdict, and Network.This was a great movie that is worth watching over and over and over again.",10,1,2,17 May 2014
The English Patient," Depressing but still good at the same time
","Anthony Minghella's The English Patient tells the story of when at the close of World War II a horribly burned plane crash victim who has a nurse to care for him and hi memory is shown in flashbacks. The movie stars Ralph Fiennes as Count Laszlo de Almasy the man who got 3rd degree burns all over his body after the crash, the movie co- stars Kristin Scott Thomas, Juliette Binoche, Colin Firth, and Willem Dafoe. This movie compares to drama films such as Kramer vs. Kramer, Mystic River, and many more. Also the sceneries for the locations were just beautiful to see. Director Anthony Minghella really knows how to execute a depressing but great drama film. The English Patient is not a great film it is just a good film that isn't really that memorable to watch over and over again. But the thing is that i would still recommend this for teenagers and adults who haven't watched this movie yet, in which it is one of cinemas greatest drama pictures ever made.A Definite -A",8,0,1,29 April 2014
Public Enemies," Michael Mann at his best
","Michael Mann's great gangster flick Public Enemies told the amazing story of John Dillinger's crime career and Melvin Purvis the FBI agent that was hired to catch him for all of the crimes that he had done. In this movie Dillinger is played brilliantly by Johnny Depp who I think gives one of the best performances of his career in this well done masterpiece, which goes on a par with Goodfellas, American Gangster, Bugsy, and The Departed. As well as Melvin Purvis being portrayed with excellence by Christian Bale. Director Michael Mann has made a great movie out of this well done movie that was unfortunately snubbed by the Oscars when it should not have been when it was one of 2009's best films.",10,0,3,14 June 2014
Ted," Downright hysterical
","Seth MacFarlane's 'Ted' is without a doubt one of the weirdest movies that I've ever seen, as well as one o fthe funniest R rated comedies I've seen so far that has a lot of laughs and with it a lot of heart to it as well. Mark Wahlberg stars as John Bennett a seemingly ordinary guy who as a child didn't really have any friends and made a wish that his stuffed teddy bear could talk which came true and ever since that moment have done everything together and have been the best of friends which is shown in the beginning of this movie. Then in the present day John is now 35 years old, still lives with Ted(voiced by Seth MacFarlane), acts like a child, lives a hedonistic lifestyle, and on top of that has been dating his girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) for the last four years and lately has been in a complicated relationship because she feels like Ted is preventing them from moving forward in their relationship and gives him an ultimatum which is that either Ted leaves the house or she leaves him which he doesn't take very well. Then after that Ted has a party at his house with a bunch of women which convinces John to tell Ted that he should move into his own apartment and find a job somewhere, then after Ted moves into his apartment John gets so bored without him in his daily life like a child gets nightmares without sleeping with his/her favorite stuffed animal. Then one night John and Lori are invited to her boss's party when right smack in the middle of it all Ted tells John to come over for just a few minutes just to see a childhood hero of theirs which happens to be the guy who played Flash Gordon in the '80s which leads to all sorts of craziness which has to be seen in order to be believed. Then after John comes back to the party Lori knows that he went over to Ted's and is convinced that he loves Ted more than he loves her which leads to their breakup. John then blames Ted for the destruction of their relationship and end up hating each other and not talking to each other for quite some time. Then after all of that Ted finds himself in a creepy obsession with a little boy who wants him and his father (Giovanni Ribisi) who claims to be a # 1 fan. That is all I'm going to explain at length in terms of the story because everything that happens is too importantto mention and should be left to be seen for itself without being spoiled. Seth MacFarlane is arguably one of the best comedy writers of the last two decades and not only demonstrates those talents here but also brings in a sympathetic lens to the characters in the story. The movie of course some moments with huge laughs and some emotional moments. This was MacFarlane's first movie as a director and is very accomplished in terms of a modern comed, it's not one of the greatest films ever made but if you love shows like 'Family Guy' you'll love this movie.",9,0,2,6 May 2019
The Natural," The best baseball movie I have ever seen since The Pride of the Yankees
","Barry Levinson's The Natural is by far one of the best baseball movies of all time (second to Pride of the Yankees (1942)) not only because the story is so extraordinary but it also feels like you are an actual character which is in fact how great this movie really is. The movie stars Robert Redford as Roy Hobbs a man who loved baseball all his life and played when he was a kid until high-school and tries to play for the Chicago Cubs at the age of 22 but before that he meets a journalist named Max Mercy (played by Robert Duvall) and a man who is called 'The Whammer' (played by Joe Don Baker) and practices pitching with them. After he is done with pitching he meets a woman named Harriet Bird (played by Barbara Hershey) who at first seem like friends but after a few days she almost kills Hobbs in her apartment with one gunshot but luckily Hobbs survives and has to wait until he is 38 years old and doesn't get signed on to the Chicago Cubs but instead gets signed on to the New York Knights where he meets two managers one who's name is Pop Fisher (played by Wilford Brimley) who isn't sure at first that Hobbs would do well at his age, and another man named Red Blow (played by Richard Farnsworth) who believes that Hobbs would succeed. The screenplay to this movie is just awe-inspiring, because not only does it tell a story of a great player it also tells an evil back-story because Hobbs is being betrayed and he knows it by three people, the Judge (played by Robert Prosky), Gus Sands (played by Darren McGavin), and a girl that Hobbs was flirting with for a short time named Memo (played by Kim Basinger).The actual best supporting performance in the film didn't only come from Brimley and Farnsworth but the most inspired performance came from Glenn Close as Iris Gaines who was Roy's true love and made Roy a true natural at baseball.Though I didn't read the novel I felt as if I did while watching the movie, which I felt like I was an actual audience member at one of Hobbs' baseball games which to me pretty much explains why i think that all movie lovers should see this wonderful movie that will stay with you for a long time.",10,1,3,21 May 2015
The Hustler," One of the best movies of 1961
","It was Paul Newman himself that said just a few month before he died that 'he would have changed in Cool Hand Luke, as well as this film' that I consider to be a near masterpiece. The movie stars Newman as Fast Eddie Felson a pool hustler that at first thinks he in unbeatable until Minnesota Fats (played by Jackie Gleason) beats him in a 36 hour match. Director Robert Rossen made a film that I think has Paul Newman in one of his absolute best performances. Then Felson takes a break from hustling pool for a while with a girl named Sarah Packard (played by Piper Laurie), then he meets a man named Bert Gordon (played by George C. Scott) who tries to teach him how to beat Fats in a rematch. But even though there were good performances throughout there was only one that I found to be a bit over and that was from Piper Laurie. When Newman made that statement I totally disagree because I thought that his performance was top notch.",9,1,2,25 June 2014
Insomnia," A first rate thriller
","This movie is arguably one of the best murder mystery movies I have seen since 'Laura' (1944), 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991), and many of Alfred Hitchcock's movies, as well as being one of the best movies that Christopher Nolan ever directed, along with being one of the police movies that I have ever seen. The movie stars Al Pacino as William Dormer a Los Angeles a detective on the force for 30 years (and couldn't sleep) whose partner is a young detective named Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) who are sent up to Alaska to help a local police department in a small town called Nightmute in order to solve the case of the murder of a teenage girl. As soon as Dormer and his partner arrive they meet a young police detective who happens to be a big fan of Detective Dormer's work named Ellie Burns (Hilary Swank). Dormer also happens to be a good friend of the police chief there whose last name is Nyback (Paul Dooley). As soon as they get there things start kicking up to speed, the policemen/women find the supposed killer in the fog but weren't able to get him and as a result Dormer's partner dies under strange circumstances. During that case Dormer meets a crime novelist named Walter Finch (Robin Williams) who claims that he killed the girl and that Dormer killed his partner. Pacino, Williams, and Swank really deserved Oscar nominations for their excellent work in this movie, and it is also worth noting that Pacino played an LA cop in 1995's 'Heat' that was another great performance but he had to deal with another acting titan in Robert De Niro.The movie isn't the best movie that Christopher Nolan directed but it is movies like this that are the reason why I consider him to be the modern version of Alfred Hitchcock, Nolan would eventually direct great films like 'Batman Begins' (2005), 'The Dark Knight' (2008), 'Inception' (2010), 'The Dark Knight Rises' (2012), and 'Interstellar' (2014) all of those films were masterpieces and this one is right up there with them. I was very impressed with this movie, especially with Hillary Seitz's screenplay that wasn't adapted from anything but man did it work. The movie was brilliantly executed, and is one of 2002's very best films.",10,2,3,20 March 2017
Midnight in Paris," One of the best movies of 2011
","Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is a fantasy/comedy shot in a beautifully and descriptive way. The movie tells the story of a nostalgic screenwriter named Gil (played by Owen Wilson) who goes to Paris on a business vacation with his fiancée Inez (played by Rachel McAdams)and her parents (played by Kurt Fuller, and Mimi Kennedy) and every day at midnight Gil goes back to 1920's Paris where he meets his literary idols such as F. Scott Fitzgerald (played by Tom Hiddleston), Ernest Hemingway (played by Corey Stoll), Gertrude Stien (played by Kathy Bates),Salvador Dali (played by Adrien Brody who is hilarious because he keeps on talking about rhinos), and his possible favorite artist Pablo Picasso (played by Marcial Di Fonzo Bo). With this movie I think that Allen's direction for this film was much better than his direction for Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) (I hope that all you other Woody Allen fans don't get offended because I still liked Hannah and Her Sisters.)-But in the end the end I think Allen's works are bizarre and interesting at the same time.",10,0,0,17 October 2014
Hotel Rwanda," A towering masterpiece
","Terry George's Hotel Rwanda is not only a movie about the Rwandan genocide in 1994 that lasted 100 days but it is a movie where hotel manager Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) (even though he is a Hutu) is defending Tutsi refugees including his wife Tatiana Rusesabagina (played by Sophie Okonedo) (while being protected by the United Nations) from the Hutu militia known as the Interhamwe. While watching this movie another movie entered my mind over an dover again and that was Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) because both movies were powerful stories told in an extraordinary way. The writing, casting and story was very intelligent , as well as the supporting cast which includes Nick Nolte as the commanding U.N. officer, Joaquin Phoenix as a press cameraman, and many more well done performances. Out of all the best Actor nominees at the 77th Academy Awards i think that any single one could have won instead of Jamie Foxx for his performance in Ray (2004) but really Cheadle deserved it the most because his performance was moving, and inspirational because he proved that a man must make tough decisions in his life, and that you have to do the right thing even if you don't feel so sure about it.",10,0,0,29 October 2014
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," One of my all time favorite westerns
","George Roy Hill's magnificent Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is ironic in two ways, it is very funny, and it is based on true events. Besides the movie being a story it is more of a character study that tells us more about Butch and Sundance. The movie stars Paul Newman As Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid two outlaw teammates who rob lots of trains together in their careers as criminals, and then run to Bolivia while on the run from the law and both get shot to death (sorry to spoil it for you if you haven't seen the movie, or don't know the history behind it.) Hill directs this movie with great effort as much as he did with his next film starring Newman and Redford which was The Sting (1973. I also forgot to mention the very good casting for this movie (besides Newman and Redford) which also includes Katharine Ross, and Sam Elliot ( who is uncredited for this movie). This movie was a total great in my opinion and one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.",10,0,1,14 October 2014
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Hysterical!
","Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is his best comedy movie yet with Peter Sellers giving the best performances of his career, and with George C. Scott in his most hilarious performance. This movie was one of the best comedy movies that goes on a par with comedy classics such as Tootsie, Bruce Almighty, Mrs. Doubtfire, A Christmas Story, and Home Alone. Director Stanley Kubrick has crafted a comedy movie masterpiece that goes along with some of his very best films that he ever made. It was not only Scott's performance that made the film hilarious it was also the scene where the officer in the cowboy hat goes down from the bomb doors and gets killed (spoiler alert!). I truly loved this movie and I consider it as the best movie of 1964 because of the humor of this well done film.",10,2,5,2 June 2014
The Expendables," A very entertaining movie with an all-star cast
","Sylvester Stallone's 'The Expendables' is a good action movie with probably the best ensemble cast for an action movie, and is one of the best action films this decade. The movie focuses on Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team of mercenaries called 'The Expendables' whose members include Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture), Paine (Steve Austin), and Tool (Mickey Rourke). The team is hired by a man named Mr.Church (Bruce Willis) to kill a dictator who is a fugitive from federal hands and rescue a CIA agent who has been kidnapped. Stallone really knows how to direct a very effective action movie and this is very effective, the action sequences in this movie are expertly choreographed so well that if we were to be one of the bad guys in the movie we would and should be very afraid of a team of action stars like that or as Liam Neeson put it two years earlier in 'Taken' (2008) 'a special set of skills'. As Roger Ebert once said 'When a movie character is really working we become that character.' Which is exactly how I felt while watching this really fun movie that is one hell of a thrill ride. The one minor problem I had was with Stallone's and Dave Callaham's screenplay because it doesn't really explain the characters very well. But I was also very impressed in this movie with then California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo in this movie in a church talking to Ross and Church about the mission in a foreign country. But in the end this an action movie that totally worked in my opinion.",9,0,0,1 March 2017
Alien," Best horror flick since Jaws
","Ridley Scott's Alien really kept me on the edge of my seat with it's Hitchcock level suspense and especially the excellent performances throughout, and the haunting score by Jerry Goldsmith. Director Ridley Scott can make make a science fiction movie into a horror masterpiece. The movie also compares to sci-fi classics like Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Avatar, Inception, Planet of the Apes, E.T. The Extra Errestrial, Transformers, Iron Man, Men in Black, Jurassic Park, and Minority Report. But there was an outstanding cast to this horror classic such as, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, Ian Holm, and John Hurt. Also of which is one of the best movies of 1979 because of the wonderful acting, the haunting score, and the masterful direction by the legendary Ridley Scott.",10,1,3,12 June 2014
The Book Thief," the best masterpiece set during the Holocaust since Spielberg's Schindler's List
","Brian Percival's The Book Thief is truly one of the best movies from last year about a girl named Liesel (played by Sophie Nelisse) who is on her way along with her brother to see her new parents but however while on their way to the car that takes them to their new home tragedy strikes Liesel's brother id dead and they had to bury him near the tracks. Then when Liesel gets to see her new parents (played by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson). One thing that I forgot to mention is that this movie is based on a best-selling novel by Markus Zusak, Percival directs this movie version of the book with masterful brilliance. This movie has one thing in common besides Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993), it is also kind of similar to Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds (2009) in which they all have one thing in common they are all set during the Holocaust. John Williams also gives one of the best music scores that he has ever written in a long time, but in the end the movies message is that how idiotic the Germans were at the time when it came to supporting Adolf Hitler and his idea in extinguishing the Jewish race once and for all and thank god that never happened during that time period.",10,0,2,18 October 2014
The Town," One of Ben Affleck's best movies
","'The Town' isn't the very best heist movie that I have ever seen but it is one of them and is also a very interesting movie to watch, and it has a plot line that can be pretty hard to follow at times but despite that it still works as a whole movie. This is the second movie directed by Ben Affleck before he directed 'Argo' (2012) which is the best of the two movies that I saw that were directed by him. Not only does Affleck direct but he also stars as a man named Doug MacRay a native of Boston, Massachusetts who is a criminal who specializes in robbing banks and other places. MacRay's best friend since childhood and trusted cohort is James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) of which they get along very well and treat each other like the brothers they never were. As the film opens we see a bank robbery in progress in a Charlestown bank where the robbers dress up in creepy costumes and they force the bank manager who is a young woman named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) who is then abducted and then released. After the first robbery MacRay starts to fall in love with Keesey after seeing James's sister Krista (Blake Lively) who also happens to be a drug addict. After the first robbery the case is sent to the local FBI and the investigation is headed by Special Agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) and then a whole lot of other robberies happen probably in order to screw up the investigation which is my personal interpretation. The man in charge of the robberies is a flower shop owner named Fergus Colm (Pete Postlethwaite)who may have Irish mob connections. The backstory to this movie the relationship between Doug and Claire which is really nice to watch despite knowing the fact that violence will eventually happen. The most effective scene in the movie is where Doug talks to his father Stephen (Chris Cooper) in prison and is wondering about his mom and then that gets his dad really mad. I congratulate Affleck for making this movie and succeeding because in my opinion he has entered an elite class of directors who know how to make a really good heist movie (the other two being Spike Lee and Sidney Lumet), there are many good things about the movie which is the story which was adapted from Chuck Hogan's novel 'Prince of Thieves' which I didn't read before seeing this movie, the performances are very good throughout, and the heist scenes and the love story keep this movie on the high ground. The one major problem that I had with this movie and prevented this movie from getting a 10th star was the feeling I had that Affleck and his writers rushed into things while making this movie without explanation of what was going on throughout the movie, otherwise there was nothing else wrong with the movie. Ben Affleck is a very skilled director, writer , and a good actor, and I hope that someday he does another really good heist movie but one that is even better than this one.",9,2,3,14 April 2017
Capote," One of the great directorial debuts I've seen in a long time
","Bennett Miller's 'Capote' was his first movie as a director and it is one of the best movies that I have seen that were directed by him (my favorite being 'Moneyball' (2011)), and the movie ranks with 'Reservoir Dogs' (1992), '12 Angry Men' (1957), and 'Heaven Can Wait' (1978) as one of the best directorial debuts I have ever seen. The movie focuses on Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) while he was working on his most famous book called 'In Cold Blood' about a mass murder in a small town called Holcomb, Kansas on November 14, 1959. After Capote hears about the crime in a 'New York Times' article he decides he wants to write an article about it and very early into his research process he decides that there is too much information for an article and it is right to write about it as a book which is what he tells his editor in chief of 'The New Yorker' William Shawn (Bob Balaban). Capote's partner in the research is another author who would write her first novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' which is Harper Lee (Catherine Keener). Then we see Capote and Lee take a trip by train from New York to Kansas to meet with a policeman named Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) in order to get more information about the crime such as crime scene photographs as well as who committed it in order to put that into his book. During the course of the movie Capote and Lee also meet Alvin's wife Marie (Amy Ryan) and they have a good couple of visits together. Then Capote meets the two men who committed the murders Dick Hickock (Mark Pellegrino), and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and then he starts to befriend them both and fight hard to get them off of death row. While I was watching this movie during the scenes where Capote was trying to get these two men off of death row because he wanted to get more information from them for his book reminded me a little bit of Michael Clarke Duncan's performance in 'The Green Mile' (1999) in the ending scene where he was crying before his electrocution. Hoffman's Oscar winning performance in this movie was so good that I felt as if Truman Capote was actually resurrected into Hoffman's very body and Dan Futterman's screenplay did a very good job on focusing on the characters of the movie instead of making the criminals look like morons. The most effective scenes of the movie are the scenes where Capote is talking to the two convicts on death row and all of those scenes are filled with so much emotion that you actually feel empathy for Hickock and Smith. Bennett Miller's direction for this movie as well as 'Moneyball' (2011) made me even more excited to see his latest film from a few years ago called 'Foxcatcher' (2014). This was a great movie and is one of the best movies of 2005.",10,3,4,3 March 2017
Doctor Strange," One of the best Marvel movies ever made
","A few years ago when I found out that Benedict Cumberbatch was being cast as the title character in this movie I was totally against that choice because I felt that he didn't really look like Dr. Strange, but when I first saw the theatrical posters for this movie I immediately changed my mind. As the movie opens we see Strange and his girlfriend Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) who also happens to be a nurse at the same hospital where Strange works, and not to much later we see Strange get into a very dangerous car accident and suffers from severe nerve damage as a result of the accident. After Strange recovers he goes to a basketball court and talks to a man named Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who was paralyzed and tells Strange about this place in Turkey that allowed him to walk again. So Strange goes there and seeks help to heal his nerves meeting a man named Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and a monk called 'The Ancient One' (Tilda Swinton) who teach him about the mystic arts. Strange is also required to read books on specific topics of sorcery and meets the librarian there named Wong (Benedict Wong).Then trouble arises and Strange has to fight a sorcerer who was taught by 'The Ancient One' named Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his minions in order to save the world from 'The Dark Dimension'. The film was directed by Scott Derrickson who also co-wrote the screenplay with C. Robert Cargill and Jon Spaihts which all three of them did an effective job of focusing on the characters rather than on the fight scenes and special effects, and also at times the dialogue is completely hilarious. The performances are very good especially from Cumberbatch, McAdams, Ejiofor, Swinton, and Mikkelsen. The special effects are reminiscent of Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' (2010), and Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968), but the only difference is that this movie didn't win its well deserved Oscar in the visual effects category even though Jon Favreau's 'The Jungle Book' was a good choice but the special effects weren't as good as this movie. Though this isn't in my top ten movies of last year it is pretty close to making that list but this movie won't evade my memory anytime soon thanks to its greatness.",10,0,3,10 June 2017
Interstellar," Nolan's best film since The Dark Knight and Inception
","Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is by far 2014's best science fiction as well as being one of the best science fiction movies of all time along with 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Planet of the Apes (1968), Star Wars (1977) (along with The empire strikes back (1980)), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. (1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Avatar (2009), Minority Report (2002), Gravity (2013), The Avengers (2012), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and all three of the Iron Man movies (2008-2013). Out of all the movies that I just listed it reminds me of Grvity when it comes to the emotions of the characters but this movie telling more of a story, and as well as 2001 when it comes to the visuals.The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper a farmer whose daughter Murph (played by Mackenzie Foy)notice that there is drought and famine that leads to dust storms and then they are led to NASA where they will meet a man named Professor Brand (played by Michael Caine) who convinces Cooper to go on the mission to save earth and he then agrees to it but hates the feeling of leaving his children behind without seeing them grow up for many years but luckily they have their grandfather (played by John Lithgow) who watches them for the rest of his life. Christopher Nolan's direction and his script (co-written by his brother Jonathan Nolan) are just perfect for the movie to have, and not only that but even Hans Zimmer's suspenseful score is amazing. At this past Oscars ceremony this movie got 5 well deserved Oscar nominations but the only Oscar that it went off with was for visual effects when I think it deserved a whole lot more in my personal opinion. Even the cast delivers great and top notch performances not only from McConaughey, Caine, and Lithgow, but also from Anne Hathaway, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, David Oyelowo as the principal that his kids went to school to, William Devane (who appears on the Rosland Capital commercials) and one of the people who work at NASA, Matt Damon, Topher Grace, and David Gyasi as one of the crew members on the mission. The final scene in this movie was complicated but harrowing at the same time where Murph (this time played by the legendary Ellen Burstyn) is in the hospital when Cooper is 124 years old but is still young. This is one of 2014's very best films.",10,4,8,25 May 2015
Full Metal Jacket," One of Stanley Kubrick's finest films
","During his career Stanley Kubrick had repeatedly denied claims that he was a perfectionist when it came to filmmaking, but with classic movies such as 'Spartacus' (1960), 'Dr. Strangelove' (1964), '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968), and 'The Shining' (1980), it is hard for people who have seen Kubrick's films to claim otherwise, but with this movie it isn't only one of Kubrick's best films, it is also one of the best war movies ever made. This movie is also the only war movie besides 'American Sniper' (2014) to be a character study, the main character being a Marine Corps Private nicknamed 'Joker' (Matthew Modine) who after his first day of basic training he and his fellow recruits 'Cowboy' (Arliss Howard), 'Gomer Pyle' (Vincent D'Onofrio) and many others are under the command of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). The first half of the movie are the basic training scenes, while the last half are the expertly shot, and extremely realistic war scenes. Though this isn't the best movie that Stanley Kubrick ever directed, it does have the trademarks of a Kubrick movie such as the character focus shots, and everything else. The movie is just perfect, the screenplay co-written by Kubrick and, the author of the book 'The Short Timers' of which the movie is based, the cinematography is top notch, and the performances are very good. The movie also features an excellent supporting cast including Adam Baldwin as a soldier nicknamed 'Animal Mother', my personal favorite performance in the movie was from Ermey because he literally embodies his character because of the fact that prior to this movie he was an actual drill sergeant in real life. The movie is a very good mix of totally hilarious and really dramatic, and Ermey gives the best performance of a drill sergeant in motion picture history here. This is one of the best movies of 1987.",10,0,1,13 May 2017
American Sniper," The best movie of 2014
","Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is arguably Eastwood's best film I have seen since Million Dollar Baby (2004) as well as his most heartbreaking movie since then that I have seen. Not only is it a heartbreaking story it is also more of an inspirational story about an American hero named Chris Kyle (played by Bradley Cooper in an Oscar nominated performance) an All-American man who lived an unfinished life who was dedicated to the protection of his country and his family and served four tours of duty in Iraq. I have heard a few criticisms of this movie of which I will only talk about one of them which he happens to be a movie critic that I highly respect whose name is Chris Stuckmann and he criticized that movie for not telling enough about Kyle's tours of duty, and for me that is a criticism that I highly disagree with because to me the scenes in the movie in which Kyle goes through his tours of duty is pretty self-explanatory. This is Clint Eastwood's 34th film as a director and one of his awe-inspired best. Even though I didn't finish Kyle's best-selling book of the same name watching this movie made me feel like I did which is one of the reasons why this movie is so good. Also Sienna Miller gave a strong performance in the movie as Chris Kyle's wife Taya, this film should have definitely won a lot more Oscars that it ended up receiving in other words it only won one Oscar which was for best sound editing and for me it also should have won best adapted screenplay, best actor for Bradley Cooper and best picture. Because this movie is a solid reminder that serving your country is always good with bad consequences and as Richard Roeper put it 'This movie is a brutal reminder that saying thank you for your service is not enough' and that helping wounded veterans is a great thing to do to bring up a person's spirit of patriotism and a sense of humility.",10,5,10,16 June 2015
Glory," One of the best war movies ever made
","Edward Zwick's 'Glory' is the best war movie that he directed and one that to me that is even better than his 'The Last Samurai' that he ended up directing 14 years after this movie in 2003. The movie stars Matthew Broderick as Colonel Robert Gould Shaw the man who was responsible for leading the first all black regiment in American military history, and Broderick happens to give the best performance of his career in this movie and this is the best movie he starred in since John Hughes's 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' (1986) but only this movie is better than that one. This movie also ranks with some of the best war movies ever made such as 'Platoon' (1986), 'Patton' (1970), 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), 'The Deer Hunter' (1978),'The Hurt Locker' (2009), and 'American Sniper' (2014). This movie also has an exceptional cast of characters that are part of this regiment such as Shaw's right hand man Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), Private Trip (Denzel Washington), Sergeant Major John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman), Corporal Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), and many more. During the course of this movie we see that Colonel Shaw and Major Forbes often have frustrations with their regiment not only because when they start training for the war (in this case the Civil War) and they don't know how to do anything that a soldier does even after they are taught how to do it, the screenplay for this movie was written by Kevin Jarre who totally nailed it on the head with his script from the book by Lincoln Kirstein and Peter Burchard, as well as Colonel Shaw's letters. The movie ended up winning 3 Oscars 27 years ago including best supporting actor for Denzel Washington, best cinematography and best sound which the movie totally deserved. Director Edward Zwick does a fantastic job of showing how and why war is hell, and that the bond between soldiers in times of war is unbreakable which is what the Dire Straits song 'Brothers in Arms' from 4 years earlier is all about and it has been proved throughout not just our history but throughout the history of the world. the movie is also the first movie that Denzel Washington did for Edward Zwick and the movies that they would do in the future would be 'Courage Under Fire ' (1996), and 'The Siege' (1998). This is one of 1989's greatest films.",10,1,2,23 February 2017
Forrest Gump," One of 1994's best movies
","Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump is an inspirational motion picture that all people in the world would continue to like for many years. The movie stars Tom Hanks in his 2nd Oscar winning portrayal as Gump a simple man with a low I.Q. but with good intentions. He is running his childhood with his best and only friend Jenny (played by young Hanna Hall). His mom (played by Sally Field) teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his own destiny. Then he goes to college and makes the football team while in college, and then goes to the army for the Vietnam War finding new friends Lt. Dan Taylor (played by Gary Sinise) and Bubba (played by Mykleti Williamson). He wins medals and creates a shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, create a ping-pong craze, create the smiley, with bumper stickers and songs, donating to the people, and meeting the president several times. However it's all irrelevant to him when he can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright). This was an inspiring masterpiece for the whole family to watch and also one of Tom Hanks' best performances of his entire career and Robert Zemeckis' boldest feature film he had ever made.",10,1,1,10 May 2014

Russell can make a period piece like this into a good movie, and I forgot to mention Robert De Niro's great cameo appearance in the film. With great 70's music from Danny Elfman, including cinematography, costumes, art direction, and set decoration. Christian Bale gives his best performance since his portrayal as Batman in Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy, and Amy Adams since her portrayal in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can.",9,0,3,7 June 2014
The Godfather: Part II," A masterful crime movie
","Even though 'The Godfather: Part II' isn't as good as the first 'Godfather movie it is still one of the best mo movies ever made and is probably one of the best movie sequels ever done in all of movie history. The movie shifts back between the present day in the past but in the present the movie picks up where the first movie left off with Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in charge of the Corleone crime family while still having his family members along with him, his step brother Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his older brother Fredo (John Cazale), as well as his younger sister Connie (Talia Shire). Also a new change was that he is married to his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) and had two children. Unlike most directors who have directed mob movies in the past Coppola shows a different side to the people in the mob than others like Michael Curtiz or Martin Scorsese who have also directed masterful mob movies, but the only difference is that Coppola shows a more dramatic side as well as Curtiz, but Scorsese shows a much grittier and evil side. The flashbacks in the movie talk about the early life and the immigration to America of none other than Michael's father Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, whose dialogue is all Italian.) This movie isn't like any other sequel in any other franchise that I've ever seen because most franchises are for action/adventure type movies, but The Godfather series is the only popular crime franchise. However like the first Godfather movie this one is nearly as flawless as this one with a great story, great cast, excellent and very effective dialogue co-written by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo (who also wrote the novel), as well as excellent performances throughout. In this review i'll try not to spoil anything but some of the most effective scenes in the movie are where Kay divorces Michael, Vito exacts his revenge on the man who did his family harm, and where Michael doesn't love Fredo anymore. This was a great movie and it makes me much more eager to see part 3. Even though there were other great films in 1974 such as Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown', and 'The Conversation' which Coppola also directed, but this one tops them all. In other words, this is the best movie of 1974.",10,0,1,12 April 2017
Fargo," Frances McDormand at her Oscar winning finest
","This movie was a great movie but not only that it is also the best movie of 1996, the movie tells the story about a man named Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy) whose inept crime ends up falling apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the tireless police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gundersen (played by Frances McDormand). Based on a true story the movie itself was a true masterpiece of the police movie genre, in which it compares to Dirty Harry, The French Connection, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, and many more. Director Joel Coen can make a classic out of each and every movie him and his brother Ethan Coen can make together. Frances McDormand gives the best performance of her career in this crime, comedy, thriller, masterpiece. This truly should have won the 1996 Oscar for best picture instead of The English Patient because Fargo required a lot more entertainment than The English Patient did. Also this movie is not only a great movie but it is a Coen brothers classic.",10,0,0,3 May 2014
Nightcrawler," A very suspenseful thriller
","This movie is not only one of the best thrillers I have ever seen in a long time mainly because the movie is different than most thrillers, and it is also one of the best directing debuts that I have ever seen. The movie is written and directed by Dan Gilroy and is a movie should have gotten a whole lot more Oscar nominations than the single original screenplay nomination that the movie ended up receiving. The movie stars Jake Gyllenhaal in a completely different performance as Lou Bloom a man who is desperate for a job who ends up getting fascinated with L.A. crime, even before he gets a job he starts night-crawling at first talking with a man named Joe Loder (played by Bill Paxton) while looking for a job for about a few days to a week when he meets a woman named Nina Romina (played by Rene Russo) who he kept showing crime footage to,mainly so that he could become more well known as a crime journalist. The movie has a lot of other good things about it besides the story , and the performances, but also James Newton Howard's score, and Robert Elswit's cinematography are just perfect for this type of movie. I am looking forward to seeing as to what films that Dan Gilroy will direct next because to me this film was worth a start for a great film career as a director for Dan Gilroy in the years ahead.",10,0,1,23 June 2015
The Aviator," One of 2004's best films
","Martin Scorsese's historically accurate drama about the life about Howard Hughes' career from the late 1920's to the mid 1940's is to me nothing short of great. The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes who at the time of his life was the richest man in the world had many different jobs such as a film producer, plane designer, aviator, and pilot. DiCaprio plays Hughes perfectly in this well done biopic. Director Martin Scorsese knows history movie accuracy and not only the movie had a great camera crew and cast. But the movie showed us who Howard Hughes really was. The movie also has great work from Cate Blanchett, John C. Reilly, Kate Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, and the legendary Alan Alda.This movie sort of reminds me of Flight which was directed by Robert Zemeckis, But Martin Scorsese's The Aviator was much better in my opinion. Also the movie has great costume design, art direction, and especially great photography from the magnificent Robert Richardson.",10,1,3,15 April 2014
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Williams is brilliant
","Barry Levinson's Good Morning, Vietnam is arguably his best film work since Rain Man (1988). The movie tells the story of Adrian Cronauer (played by Robin Williams) a wisecracking disc jockey in which some of his superiors really dislike his humor especially 2nd Lieutenant Steven Hauk (played by Bruno Kirby), but however most of his fellow officers do completely enjoy his humor (including me while watching this film). One thing that completely surprised me was the fact that this movie was inspired by a true story, as well as the fact that Williams ad-libbed those lines that the real life Adrian Cronauer mentioned during his time as an Sir force disc jockey. During the course of the film Williams meets a Vietnamese girl that he has a huge crush on and then follows her to her school and wants to teach the class that she is in.The movie also has a great supporting cast which includes Forest Whitaker as one of Cronauer's friend Edward a man he meets during his assignment,Noble Willingham as his commanding General,and as well as the two characters I hate and love at the same time Bruno Kirby as Steven Hauk a Colonel who is very full of himself, and J.T. Walsh as Sergent Major Dickerson a soldier who really hates Cronauer the most out of all the characters in the movie. The ending to this movie really touched me because how the Vietnamese girl who he had a crush on as well as her being one of his temporary students really didn't want him to leave the country, I would have felt the same way too if I was in the same platoon as Cronauer was in real life.",10,1,1,20 October 2014
Grease," Greatest High School Musical movie ever made
","Randal Kleiser's Grease is a very entertaining high school all the way from start to finish, the movie tells the story of a good girl named Sandy who falls in love with a greaser named Danny over the summertime and then find out that they both are in the same high school. The Movie stars John Travolta as Danny a greaser who has a girlfriend and acts like a hotshot around her when his friends are around him. Set in the 1950's California this entertaining musical not only has good songs that go with it, the movie also has some funny parts as well. This movie has many ingredients that are required for a musical such as the original songs that were made up for the movie, and of course the choreography for the movie. The only confusing thing about the film is that Sandy (played by Olivia Newton- John) always tries to end her relationship with Danny and she still keeps on going on back to him I mean if you are going to break up with somebody just do it. Besides that Grease is a great musical in which the songs for the movie will remain in your head for life.",8,0,1,29 April 2014
The Revenant," DiCaprio steals the show
","Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu's 'The Revenant' is without a doubt one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen and is also one of the most violent, it isn't a perfect but it has enough qualities in it that make it as good as it is. Leonardo DiCaprio won a long awaited best actor Oscar three years ago for his excellent performance as Hugh Glass a frontiersman and fur trapper on an expedition in the extremely cold wilderness in the early 1820's and his group of other trappers includes John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), as well as Captain Andrew Henry (Dohmnall Gleeson) among others. After we get to know the characters a little bit we see Glass in the woods by himself hunting for animals and finds a bear that ends up mauling him to the point where he's so badly beaten up that he nearly dies and is left for dead by his own fellow trappers. After Glass wakes up and discovers this he sets out for revenge against those who betrayed him. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the finest performance I've ever seen from him in a movie for a role which he went all out in preparation for and totally deserved that Oscar for, Tom Hardy is also very good here and got a well deserved best supporting actor nomination as a result. The acting is strong, the direction is very good, and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is nothing short of breathtaking. The only thing I would say about this movie that I had a problem with was that at points in the film it seemed a little drawn out with DiCaprio's mission to seek revenge on those who left him for dead but it is also understandable because it's his movie. The movie was actually filmed in the harsh weather conditions that are actually seen throughout its over two and a half hour runtime. Iñárritu is without a doubt one of the best directors of the last twenty years and part of the great Hollywood trio of Mexican filmmakers along with Alfonso Cuaron and Guillermo del Toro, and so far out of the three films I've seen that Iñárritu directed not one was bad. This is one of 2015's very best films.",9,0,0,10 May 2019
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg's most suspenseful film since Munich
","Steven Spielberg's latest film 'Bridge of Spies' is another great historical masterpiece in his entire film-making career but with this one being much different than the rest, with Schindler's List talking about a very successful businessman at the time who also happened to be a member of the Nazi party who ended up saving 1200 Jews from concentration camps, Saving Private Ryan talking about the D-Day invasion and the casualties on Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, Catch Me If You Can talking about the early criminal life of Frank Abagnale Jr., Munich talking about the five men assigned by the Israeli government to eliminate the terrorists responsible for the Black September bombings at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, Germany, as well as Lincoln talking about the last few months of Abraham Lincoln's presidency, and now with 'Bridge of Spies' not only does Spielberg tackle the Cold War but also takes on the subject of communism along with it. The movie stars Tom Hanks (in an Oscar worthy performance) as a Brooklyn insurance lawyer named James Donovan who is told by his boss Thomas Watters (played by Alan Alda) that he was the unanimous choice to defend a Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) whom the majority of Americans want to be hanged but I'm not going to give anything away. After the trial is over the mission of the U-2 spy plane is in effect which it's job is to take pictures of what is going on in the Soviet Union from an altitude of 70,000 feet in the air and the person on that mission is an Air Force Lieutenant named Francis Gary Powers (played by Austin Stowell).After Powers gets arrested and jailed by the Soviets Donovan flies to Berlin to negotiate an exchange between Abel and Powers, soon after a college student majoring in economics gets arrested and immediately ends up being a part of the exchange. Spielberg directed this movie with suspense,passion, and a huge love of country, and not to mention those scenes with Donovan and his wife Mary (played by Amy Ryan) are just heartbreaking. This movie is undoubtedly in my mind the best movie of the year.",10,2,6,27 October 2015
Hugo," The Best movie of 2011
","Martin Scorsese's Hugo is a story of sadness and a emotion and mystery, about a boy named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) who is an orphan thief and clock keeper who lives in the walls of a busy Paris train station. This is really like no other Scorsese movie I have seen that he ever directed. The movie also features a great supporting cast which includes Ben Kingsley who plays as iconic French filmmaker Georges Melies, Chloe Grace-Moretz,Christopher Lee, and Jude Law.Not only that this was an incredible motion picture achievement, it also just as incredible as the book was.The best part of this movie is when Hugo goes with Isabelle to the Melies residence to go to this box where they find drawings from Melies' films most importantly A Trip to the Moon (1902). Not only that it is also filled with great magic and visuals that Scorsese never used in his career.",10,0,2,6 September 2014
Doctor Zhivago," One of the finest love stories ever made
","'Doctor Zhivago' is one of the most beautifully filmed movies I've seen in a long time that is simply majestic to watch during its 3+ hour runtime and is worth every single minute thanks to its beauty. The movie is shot like Lean's previous film 'Lawrence of Arabia' (1962) as well as John Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' (1962) where the scenes set in the present are at the beginning and the end with most of the scenes dominated by past flashbacks. The movie is set during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and based on Boris Pasternak's novel of the same name and stars Omar Sharif as DR. Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago who after his mother died when he was just a little boy and is taken in by his mother's friends and lives with them and their daughter Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin) and then when he's grown up he goes to school to become a doctor and ends up marrying Tonya. The movie also focuses on a young 17 year old girl named Lara (Julie Christie) who hasa friend she calls 'Pasha' (Tom Courtenay) who is 9 years older than she is, and becomes a communist with the Bolsheviks that at that period in time were hellbent on taking down the influence of the Czar and institute a new form of government which they believed would benefit working people. Despite this and the fact that Lara is also having an affair with a businessman named Victor Komarovsky (Rod Steiger) she wants to marry Pasha and spend the rest of her life with him, but that is not to be due to the fact that Pasha eventually joins the Red Army. The movie not only focuses on the lives of its characters and the inevitable romance in the movie between the two main characters in the story but it also focuses on the history that went with that time period. The movie is one of the best romantic epics that I've ever seen and is right on par with 'Gone with the Wind' (1939) with its beauty and scope. Everything in this movie just clicks whether it's the excellent performances thorughout, the beautiful set design and costume design, Freddie Young's beautiful cinematography, David Lean's top notch direction, and even Robert Bolt's excellent screenplay. The movie isn't as captivating in its beauty as 'Lawrence of Arabia' which captivated me from start to finish, bu tthe one problem I had with this movie was that in the last hour the movie got a little boring for me but then it kicked right back in to high gear by the end. I also forgot to mention that this movie also has a very good performance by frequent Lean cohort Alec Guinness as Yuri's older brother who also happens to be in the Red Army. The movie doesn't try to rush anything and is very delicate and fragile in its execution which makes the already perfect chemistry between Sharif and Christie in the movie all the more effective and real to the point where you actually believe that they're in love with each other and also to the point where it's hard to believe that this movie wasn't popular with critics at the time it was released. The movie went on to become David Lean's highest grossing film at the box office during his magnificent career and if you already watched the movie it isn't hard to see why. This is one of 1965's finest films.",9,0,0,18 May 2019
The Shining," a horror masterpiece
","Stanley Kubrick's The Shining is nothing short of a creepy masterpiece which is an ingenious adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name. The movie stars Jack Nicholson in his best performance as Jack Torrance a former school-teacher, turned writer, and now is applying for a hotel job for the entire winter and takes his wife Wendy (played by Shelley Duvall) and their only son Danny (played by Danny Lloyd) to this beautiful looking hotel called the Overlook , and then Torrance starts to get really insane trying to kill his wife and son because from what I believe is because he didn't get to spend time with them or maybe he was writing for too much time. This spellbinding horror film is arguably Kubrick's greatest achievement along with 2001: a Space Odyssey (1968), Spartacus (1960), and Dr. Strangelove (1964). This movie just made me not keep my eyes away from the screen because of how masterful this movie really is. One thing I am really disappointed with is that when my parents compare this film to The Omen (1976) I don't get how they think that that film was better than this movie when it actually wasn't because it had more suspense, and more creeps for which The Omen didn't, And by the way if you are one of those people who think that The Omen is better than The Shining I really do recommend that you watch them both again and you will know when you change your mind.",10,3,8,30 October 2014
Judgment at Nuremberg," One of the best courtroom dramas I have ever seen
","Stanley Kramer's Judgment at Nuremberg is the most riveting historical period drama I have ever seen since seeing Oliver Stone's JFK (1991) but both films have two things common besides being historical dramas, they were both fictionalized, and both have great ensemble casts with JFK featuring Kevin Costner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Sissy Spacek, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, John Candy, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Rooker, and Tommy Lee Jones. As well as this film featuring Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Richard Widmark, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Maximilian Schell, and Montgomery Clift all in superb performances. The film is loosely based on the 1948 Nuremberg trials which originally had 99 defendants but with this film only having four of five, the movie stars Spencer Tracy as Chief Judge Dan Haywood who presides on the case against the defendants Ernst Janning (played by Burt Lancaster), Emil Hahn (played by Werner Klemperer), Friedrich Hofstetter (played by Martin Brandt),and Werner Lampe (played by Torben Meyer). Abby Mann's very suspenseful screenplay is also a very intense one because we don't know whether the four defendants will be found guilty or not because of the reasons that the prosecution and the defense bring to the table all because of the rivaling performances from Richard Widmark (who played prosecutor Tad Lawso)n and Maximilian Schell (who played the defense attorney Hans Rolfe and ended up winning an Oscar for his performance), this is Kramer's absolute best film as a director and also one of 1961's 10 best films.",10,0,3,22 June 2015
Apocalypse Now," One of the best military movies ever made
","Francis Ford Coppola was a director who could do no wrong in the '70's thanks to masterpieces like 'The Godfather' parts I-II and 'The Conversation' but this movie was very new territory for him as a director but not asa a screenwriter due to the fact that he co-wrote the Oscar winning screenplay for 'Patton' and with this he succeeded in making one of the very best war movies of all time. The main character of the movie is an Army captain named Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) who is assigned on a classified mission by Gen.Corman (G.D. Spradlin) and Col. lucas (Harrison Ford) to kill Col. Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who is a renegade soldier who has gone completely insane due to the effects that war has had on him, and whose actions are described as 'unsound'. Willard has to go through extremely dangerous territory whether it's going through battles with the help of Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), heading a long river with three other soldiers to help him get to the site of his mission, and finally being at the site of the mission which is a potential deathtrap. This movie isn't your traditional war movie because of the fact that there isn't a lot of battle scenes in it which isn't supposed to be the takeaway one gets from seeing a movie like this but the fact that that war is hell and damages a lot of people mentally. When Willard gets to Kurtz's house he meets a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) who is totally afraid of Col. Kurtz and an old friend named Colby (Scott Glenn) who has become one of Kurtz's followers. The movie is a masterclass in how a movie should be made with a masterful screenplay, amazing Oscar winning cinematography by Vittorio Storaro, great performances throughout (especially by Sheen and Brando who deserved Oscar nominations for their work), and of course flawless execution and masterful direction by Coppola. This is one of the best military movies I've seen in a long time along with 'The Deer Hunter', 'Patton', 'The Hurt Locker', 'All Quiet on the Western Front', 'Platoon', 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Twelve O'Clock High', 'American Sniper', 'Inglourious Basterds', and 'The Longest Day' just to name some prime examples. This is the very best movie of 1979 and one that is sure to not be forgotten anytime soon, it is a true masterpiece.",10,2,2,18 June 2019
Edward Scissorhands," Burton's best work since both Batman and Ed Wood
","Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands is an effort that to me is a near perfect Burton film, his film was inspired by a drawing he did as a teenager. As the movie opens we see an old lady telling the story of Edward Scissorhands to her granddaughter (in which this scene reminded me of Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride (1987) because both the beginning and ending scenes to both films are very similar), as the story is being told we see an Avon representative (played by Dianne Wiest) who is trying to sell makeup to her fellow neighbors who are really busy at the moment, after her makeup selling attempts are over she sees this creepy looking mansion and goes to it to see what is in there and as she gets to the attic portion she sees the creepy looking Edward (played by Johnny Depp) who is unfinished invention who happens to have scissors for hands and the Avon rep. ends up taking him to her place where he also happens to meet her husband Bill (played by Alan Arkin), her son Kevin (played by Robert Oliveri) and have a good time together for the first few days, and a few days after living there the oldest daughter Kim (played by Winona Ryder)comes home and Edward scares her half to death, and then becomes the local barber. Burton's film is a very delicate character study about Edward and the good and bad times that he has faced during his few weeks in his temporary new home. Before the movie is over things start heading downward for Edward because of the scenes where he gets beat up and insulted and put down by Kim's ex boyfriend Jim (played by Anthony Michael Hall)and officially becomes and outcast. The film is just one of those fairy tales that some people won't understand but will end up enjoying it depending on if you like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp or not.",9,2,4,30 December 2014
Divergent," More of a trailer than an actual movie
","Neil Burger's Divergent is a bad film version of Veronica Roth's 2011 best-selling book of the same name set in a futuristic world in which there are factions that are based on somebody's virtue. It stars Shailene Woodley (who was brilliant in The Descendants (2011), but flopped in this movie) as Tris a girl who gets tested for some unknown reason and learns that she is 'Divergent' and can't fit in, and ends up going to some training and also ends up falling in love with her instructor (played by Theo James in a very nauseating performance) whose name is hilariously the number Four and also meets another instructor named Eric (played by Jai Courtney whose performance reminds me of the way that Alfred Molina portrayed Johann Tetzel in Luther (2003). Then after that Tris finds out all of this information from her mother (played by Ashley Judd) and the culprit for the attempted Divergent destruction is a woman named Jeanine (played by Kate Winslet). There was a lot of other things that I didn't like about this film besides it's storyline but the acting, cinematography, directing, and especially the action sequences in which the action scenes were shot way too quickly, though i only liked two things in this movie which were the casting, and the stunt-work to the film.The one thing I don't get when it comes to watching it is when people like this film for no apparent reason at all but by just saying it's 'great' though I had many reasons to criticize it, I do think that this movie is nothing compared to sci-fi classics like Inception (2010), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Planet of the Apes (1968), E.T. (1982), Minority Report (2002), or even Jurassic Park (1993) or The Matrix (1999). Unfortunately little did I know that this was going to be a regretful experiences that this I consider to be one of the year's worst films.",2,1,1,15 December 2014
Jarhead," Masterful Historical war drama
","Sam Mendes' Jarhead is the true story of what former marine Anthony Swofford went through before, during, and after the Persian Gulf War. The movie stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Swofford a marine who fired his gun years before the gulf war happened but never got to fire a gun during a time of war. This is truly what I consider to be a great piece of movie making and with both Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx giving the best performances of their entire careers in one of 2005's best films. Director Sam Mendes took the time to create a war movie classic, which goes on a par with Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down, The Devil's Brigade, The Deer Hunter, and Patton. This move also shows what the marines have to go through constantly. As Gene Shalit of U.S.A Today 'A Masterwork, Jarhead is more than a movie, It's an experience.'. I truly agree with that because that is actually what Anthony Swofford went through during his time in the Marine Corps. For those people who are veterans in any military branch or are currently serving right now and if you get to watch this movie it will stay with you for a very long time.",10,1,2,1 June 2014
Dunkirk," One of Nolan's greatest achievements
","At this point in the century there is no question in anyone's minds that Christopher Nolan has proven himself to be one of the very best directors of his generation after directing great films like 'Insomnia', 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, 'Inception' and 'Interstellar', 'Dunkirk' is a worthy addition to that already masterful resume. The movie is a departure for Nolan because with this movie he treaded into unmarked territory and proved he could direct a masterful WWII movie up there with 'Saving Private Ryan', 'The Longest Day', 'Patton', and others as well as the best ever made but this movie tells the story of a key British event in that particular war. The film is based on the true story of how the German military surrounded the British, French, and Belgian militaries to the point where they had to be evacuated which amounted to a total of 400,000 people on the beaches in Dunkirk, even though people like me who are fascinated by history already knew how it unfolded somewhat Nolan and his frequent composer Hans Zimmer build up the tension and suspense quite nicely. The cast is filled with mostly unknown actors to show how young and inexperienced the soldiers were, but like any Nolan film it doesn't come without its big stars. Tom Hardy plays a British fighter pilot where most of his scenes are in a plane fighting the enemy, Kenneth Branagh plays a British Naval Commander who oversees the evacuations, recent Oscar winner Mark Rylance (who played the Russian spy Rudolf Abel in Steven Spielberg's 'Bridge of Spies' a few years back) plays one of the civilians who helps in the evacuation process in getting all of the soldiers to safety, as well as frequent Nolan cohort Cillian Murphy who has a minor role a British soldier who is afraid of going back to battle because he fears for his life. Overall the movie is near perfect but the one problem I had was that the city of Dunkirk didn't even look like a war zone, and there wasn't enough extras to make it seem like there was 400,000 people on the beach, which are only extremely minor problems. The movie is one of the very best military movies that I've seen in a long time and of the very best of 2017.",9,0,1,29 May 2019
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Just as magical as the first two
","These days Alfonso Cuaron has proved himself to be one of the finest film directors of his generation thanks to him making great films like 'Children of Men' (2006) and 'Gravity' (2013) along with adding this movie to his resume of memorable films back in 2004. 'Prisoner of Azkaban' is the third of 8 films in the entire Harry Potter franchise and it is a really good movie even though it isn't really as original as the first two movies in the series, even though Cuaron is very engaged with his storytelling here. Like the first two films the main characters along with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) who still continues his adventures at Hogwarts with his two good friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint), but the threat against Harry is much more serious against him this time. The threat to Potter and his friends is realized after he returns to Hogwarts and is told by Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) that a convicted murderer by the name of Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) from the prison of Azkaban who is supposedly out to kill Potter. After the other professors find out about this threat Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) tells all Hogwarts students that they have set creatures that look like the Grim Reaper called Dementors at every single entrance on the grounds of the Hogwarts campus. Black was convicted in Voldemort's plot to kill Harry Potter's parents but towards the end of the movie Black becomes a changed man, for reasons that I will not spoil. The visuals are still breathtaking as ever, and the supporting characters along with Black and Lupin, as well as the likes of Dumbledore, Snape (Alan Rickman), McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Trelawney (Emma Thompson) are expertly written. There are also other great components of this movie including the script by Steve Kloves who also wrote the screenplays for the first two films, as well as mind-blowing editing, excellent cinematography, brilliant performances, and the haunting score by the legendary John Williams are what make this movie work on a full scale. Though I have no problems with this movie, I do have a problem with Warner Bros. for not honoring the replacement request from Richard Harris who originally played Professor Dumbledore, of which Harris wanted his good friend Peter O'Toole to replace him after his death. Though Michael Gambon was excellent as Dumbledore I do happen to think that O'Toole could have done him one better. Despite that I still think that this is one of the finest films of 2004.",10,0,1,5 June 2017
Aliens," Cameron's best science fiction masterpiece since Avatar
","James Cameron's Aliens (1986) is nonetheless one of the best science fiction movies ever made along with Avatar (2009) , Inception (2010), Gravity (2013), 2001: a Space Odyssey (1968), E.T. (1982), Alien (1979), Minority Report (2002) and so much more, the movie picks up it's story from the last scene where the 1979 movie left off but instead it's 57 years later and Lt. Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver in an Oscar nominated performance) doesn't even know where she is and while being found she knows that the Aliens that she encountered before are about to strike again and everyone thinks she's crazy and then a few minutes later two men come into Ripley's apartment and ask her if she wants to assist a group of Marines on a mission to destroy the Aliens once and for all and things don't come out to be as intended to happen. Director James Cameron was a worthy successor as the second director of the Alien franchise and he proved it to me while I was watching this movie, if I were to choose which one of the two Alien movies to better than the other it would be a difficult decision for me to make because Scott's 1979 film has more suspenseful plot elements and has better storytelling, and this 1986 version is a lot more entertaining, ambitious, and still has great storytelling. The movie also has a great supporting cast to it including Michael Biehn, a young Bill Paxton in a very convincing performance as a soldier who is the most terrified of the aliens out of all his fellow Marines, and so many more. This movie is not only a great film it is also one of the best movies of 1986 period.",10,0,1,17 February 2015

The movie stars Ben Kingsley in his only Oscar winning role as Gandhi who really was a man of his word, the movie compares to historical epics like Braveheart, Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's List, Amistad, Malcolm X, and The Bridge on the River Kwai.

The Usual Suspects," Terrific Entertainment
","Perhaps Bryan Singer's most well known film The Usual Suspects was inspired from a line a line in the 1943 movie Casablanca which says 'Round up the Usual Suspects.'. Basically this movie is more of a crime, comedy, mystery, more than a drama film. The movie tells the story about five men who end up getting arrested and get brought up together for questioning. Then they plan an operation of revenge against the NYPD. But for them the operation goes well, but the influence of a so called Hungarian Gangster by the name of Keyser Soze is felt by every single one of them. The movie stars Stephen Baldwin as one of the suspects whose name in Michael McManus one of the suspects who gets brought up for questioning along with the other suspects played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Benicio Del Toro, and Kevin Pollak. What I found kind of funny about this movie is that when you first watch it you think that you know what is going on when you really don't. This movie was a great movie but with one of the most confusing plot lines of all time.",10,0,1,29 April 2014

While watching this movie there were a lot and I mean a lot of great performances throughout the entire movie from Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Thomas Mitchell, Leslie Howard, Olivia De Havilland, and Hattie McDaniel. Based on the civil war novel by Margaret Mitchell director Victor Fleming and producer David O. Selznick have crafted the masterpiece of the 1930's.

No Country for Old Men," Coen brothers at their best
","Joel and Ethan Coen's No Country for Old Men is kind of similar to a film that was directed by Quentin Tarantino but more thrilling. The movie tells the story about a hunter named Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin) who steps in the middle of a gone wrong drug deal and more than $2,000,000 in cash near the Rio Grande. The reason why I consider this to be similar to Tarantino's movies is because of the gory violence that goes on in this movie by Javier Bardem's character Anton Chigurh. also there was a special somebody who had an important part of this movie and that is the main character Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) the man who investigates this whole thing. Throughout this movie there were a lot of great performances from Jones, Bardem, Brolin, and especially Woody Harrelson as one of Llewelyn's friends. This was a great movie to begin with and also the best movie of 2007.",10,2,3,13 June 2014

Nolan uses a great cast besides Bale of which includes Tom Wilkinson, Katie Holmes, Cilian Murphy, and Gary Oldman. Nolan and his cinematographer Wally Pfister make a great team together of which they made a few other greats such as The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, and his mind bending masterpiece Inception.",10,1,2,6 July 2014
The Princess Bride," One of the best fairy tales ever put on film
","Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride is one of the best fairy tales ever in my opinion. The movie takes place in a sick child's (played by Fred Savage) home when his grandfather (played by Peter Falk) walks into his bedroom to read a story called The Princess Bride to him. When the grandfather is reading the story the movie is set in a farming area with the two main characters Buttercup (played by Robin Wright) and Westley (played by Cary Elwes) until Westley leaves and Buttercup finds out that he is supposedly dead and says that she will never fall in love again, until she gets engaged to a nasty prince named Humperdinck (played by Chris Sarandon) , then she gets kidnapped and held against her will by 3 men named Vizzini (played by Wallace Shawn), Inigo Montoya (played by Mandy Patinkin), and Fezzik (played by Andre the Giant) until Westley comes along and saves the princess under another identity. And then Prince Humperdinck and his men try to save the princess when she has already been saved but without even realizing and Westley is about to get killed by a little dwarf who calls himself the albino (played by Mel Smith), along with Count Tyrone Rugen (played by Christopher Guest) who killed Inigo's father 20 years earlier also known as the man with six fingers. then Westley is brought back to life by Miracle Max (played by an almost unrecognizable Billy Crystal) and his wife (played by Carol Kane). Then after Westley is brought back to life they have another mission on their hands crash the princess's wedding to the prince, and Inigo's mission is to kill the man who killed his father by repeatedly saying 'My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father prepare to die.' While watching this movie it reminded me of other movies like Forrest Gump a little bit because of how both stories were told, Touch of Evil because of Prince Humperdink's mission to kill his so called future wife after the wedding, and of course The Adventures of Robin Hood because of whole entire story-line to both films. The way Rob Reiner directs this movie is not only similar to the way that Michael Curtiz directed the 1938 movie version of Robin Hood, but also it brings William Goldman's book of the same name to life on the big screen. A great movie for a whole family to watch.",10,6,10,22 November 2014
Saving Private Ryan," Tom Hanks' best performance
","Steven Spielberg's saving Private Ryan is the best war movie ever made of the emotional impact and the excellent shooting scenes. The most emotional scene is the very beginning because of D-Day and the massive amount of casualties of war. The movie stars Tom Hanks as Captain John Miller who unfortunately did not win an Oscar for this movie when he really should have won, director Steven Spielberg has crafted his best movie since his first Oscar winning turn since his 1993 holocaust movie Schindler's List. Also in the movie there were a lot of other good performances from Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Vin Diesel. This movie goes on a par with war film classics such as Black Hawk Down, Patton, The Deer Hunter, Platoon, Sands of Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers, The Devil's Brigade, and 633 Squadron. Another reason why this movie was great is because the shooting scenes looked so realistic, This is a triumph that is the best movie of 1998.",10,1,2,14 June 2014

As the film opens we see an author (played by Tom Wilkinson) who talks about his days back then while at the grand Budapest hotel (who is now played by Jude Law) and sees a man named Zero Moustafa (played by F. Murray Abraham) and talks to him about his times with Monsieur Gustave (played by Ralph Fiennes) as the lobby boy of the hotel. Out of the 9 Oscar nominations that his film received I really think it should win 2 for best costume design, and best production design, the casting to this film is excellent (besides Fiennes, Abraham, Wilkinson, and Law) it also includes Willem Dafoe as a hit-man, Jeff Goldblum as a lawyer, as well as Wes Anderson regular Bill Murray as a hotel staff member, and Saiorse Ronan as the lobby boy's wife Agatha, as well as Adrien Brody as Gustave's nemesis Dimitri, and the unrecognizable Tilda Swinton as the old woman who stayed at the hotel for 19 years and was found dead in her bed from strychnine poisoning. When I first laid eyes on this movie I literally fell in love with it's humor, it's casting choices, it's story, it's set design, and it's costumes. This is one of 2014's best films.",10,3,6,26 January 2015
Seabiscuit," One of the most inspirational movies ever made
","Gary Ross's Seabiscuit (2003) tells the extraordinary true story of an undersized racehorse that lifts the spirit of all Americans during the Great Depression and while I was watching this movie I felt like I was alive during that time period. Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's book called Seabiscuit: An American legend, though I didn't read the novel I felt like I did read it long before I saw this movie. The movie stars Tobey Maguire as Red Pollard the man who rode Seabiscuit through most races, and after his leg gets injured he is persistent to get back on the track and that is one of the most inspiring parts about the movie, another inspiring part of the movie is the supporting cast members performances mainly from Oscar winners Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges who make the film much better than I thought it out to be. Ross's direction for the film is just flawless and sometimes heartbreaking. Even though I have very little interest in horse racing this movie made me even more interested in the sport, and this movie counts as one of 2003's 10 best films.",10,0,1,8 February 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," A magnificent motion picture with Peter O'Toole's best performance of his career
","David Lean's 1962 historical epic Lawrence of Arabia made the list of my all time favorite movies with Peter O'Toole giving the performance of his career as the charismatic real life hero T.E. Lawrence the man who tried the best he could to help the Arabs win the Arab revolt. Based on a true story this movie also features great supporting work from Oscar winners Anthony Quinn,Jose Ferrer,and Alec Guinness, and Oscar nominees Arthur Kennedy and Claude Rains. Director David Lean has crafted his best motion picture since his 1957 film The Bridge on the River Kwai. This movie also compares to such historical epics such as Braveheart, Gandhi, Gladiator, Spartacus,The Great Escape, The Last Samurai, and many more.n This is a truly unforgettable movie that will stay with you for a very long time.",10,1,3,28 May 2014
JFK," the best movie of 1991
","Oliver Stone's JFK is a great movie about the aftermath of the assassination of president John F. Kennedy but does not tell the story correctly, but still of what I thought was a great movie. Stone has never used a huge cast like this before in his directorial career but did for the very first time while making this movie which consists of Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Michael Rooker, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Jack Lemmon, and Donald Sutherland. A few people told me that they did not like this movie because it wasn't historically accurate but I personally do not care if a history movie is accurate or not I just care if it is good or bad. Director Oliver Stone has made his best movie since Platoon and made a lot of his actors give great performances throughout",10,2,10,14 June 2014
Gone Girl," A David Fincher masterpiece
","David Fincher is one of the true masters of modern cinema after more than 20 years in the film business he has proved time and time again that he hasn't lost his steam and with his latest film 'Gone Girl' is no exception to his excellent body of work as a director. This movie isn't based on a true story but it is based on a novel by Gillian Flynn who also happened to write the screenplay for the film as well, and it is her screenplay that makes the plot during the course of the movie much trickier than the trailers may lead you to believe. Ben Affleck plays Nick Dunne a man whose wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) mysteriously disappears from their home on the day of their 5th wedding anniversary and Nick promptly calls the police to report his wife missing. The police officers investigating the case are Detective Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) and Officer James Gilpin (Patrick Fugit). At first glance the house looks fine but is then promptly turned into a crime scene and Nick becomes the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance, which always happens in these types of cases. Every person in the community is doing anything and everything in their power to help find her. The evidence is very incriminating towards Nick and at the advice of his twin sister Margot (Carrie Coon) he hires a well known defense lawyer named Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry). After Bolt is hired Nick finds Amy's high-school boyfriend who is a man named Desi Collings (Neil Patrick Harris) and asks him some serious information about his past which I will not reveal in this review. Affleck's performance is what makes this movie so much more riveting, as well as Pike's Oscar nominated work as Amy, along with Flynn's screenplay, Fincher's direction, and the score by 'Nine Inch Nails' members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (who won Oscars for Fincher's 'The Social Network' (2010)). The film is truly great and is also one of the 10 best films of 2014.",10,1,1,13 June 2017
Frozen," There are a few good things in the movie but the rest is a big mess
","I really found this film to be a movie for children because I really think that they don't understand what a big flaw of movie-making this movie really was. All it is is Kriste Bell turning her own town and the rest of the world into an ice planet, and her sister and Kristoff trying to find her and bring her back to Aarondale but then all hell breaks loose with this Clayface like creature trying to get them away from her ice castle and Anna's heart being frozen, then it is a dopey race against time when Anna finds out that the man she really loved turned against her and wanted her dead and says she's dead when she really wasn't until she sacrifices for her sister. As I said in my summary that there were a few good things in the film and they were the music, the race against time, and the one good laugh in the end, but otherwise not a good movie. But in the end the movie is a huge waste of time about people who want summer back then that wish comes true then KRISTEN BELL'S CHARACTER MAKES WINTER COME BACK WHEN HER PEOPLE WANTED SUMMER! what a dopey piece of garbage.",3,4,11,21 July 2014
2012," Are you kidding me!
","Roland Emmerich's 2012 is the complete choice for the absolute worst movie of 2009 because of the boring premise that tries to tell us that the 2012 doomsday that was supposed to happen wasn't and we already know that that it happened more than 1 year ago. When Roland Emmerich did The Patriot in 2000 I completely enjoyed it and hailed it as the best colonial movie ever made and this just leaves me with one question what was he thinking while making this true piece of crap. Think about this you have a good cast such as John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, and Danny Glover embarrassing themselves in this completely boring disaster flick and made me want to fall asleep while watching it and I never want to see it ever again in my life.",2,1,3,13 June 2014
Good Will Hunting," A masterpiece
","Gus Van Sant's Good Will Hunting is one of the most inspirational movies that were ever made, the movie tells the story of a janitor at MIT who has a gift in math but needs direction in life after one too many run-ins with the law. The movie stars Matt Damon as that character named Will Hunting. Also the movie has a great supporting cast such as a young Ben Affleck,Robin Williams, Stellan Skarsgard,and Minnie Driver who gives a decent performance. Director Gus Van Sant has crafted of what I think is the best movie of 1997 because this is a true acting movie, the movie compares to inspirational films such as Million Dollar Baby, Rocky, The Blind Side, Rain Man, The Pursuit of Happiness, Remember the Titans,To Kill a Mockingbird, Lawrence of Arabia, Braveheart, etc..I personally would recommend this movie even though there is a few bad scenes but this is a movie that will stay with you for a very very long time.A+",10,1,4,1 June 2014
Schindler's List," Spielberg at his best
","Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List tells what the holocaust was really like from the perspective of the Jewish people when they got sent into the concentration camps until a man named Oskar Schindler saves them from the concentration camps. Schindler is played by Liam Neeson who gives the best performance of his career as a true real life hero for the German people even though he was a member of the Nazi party in real life. What Spielberg tries to prove with this movie is that he is not only capable of making swashbuckling epics like Raiders of the Lost Ark, or Science fiction classics like E.T, Minority Report, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Hitchcockian thrillers like Jaws, but what he did with this movie is that he set a new movie genre to his movie-making vocabulary that got Oscar buzz as soon as it came out into theaters and was a total smash at the box office. Also not only Liam Neeson gives the best performance of his career, but so does Ralph Fiennes who plays a Nazi soldier named Amon Goeth a soldier who five no mercy at all. In order for Schindler to save the Jews from getting persecuted what he does is that the talks to his accountant named Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) into making a list of the names of the 1200 Jewish people that he has to save. This was a remarkable movie that will stay in my memory for as long as i live and what a masterpiece Spielberg has created.",10,9,13,16 May 2014
Dog Day Afternoon," One of 1975's 10 best films
","Sidney Lumet without question is one of the world' s greatest directors thanks to masterpieces like 12 Angry Men, Network, The Verdict, and his near masterpiece Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. The movie stars Al Pacino as former Vietnam vet Sonny Wortzik a bisexual who goes with his man lover Sal (John Cazale) to go rob a bank in Brooklyn, of which was originally supposed to take 10 minutes, then 4 hours later the bank becomes a news channel circus show, then 12 hours later it was the most watched event in T.V. history. Director Sidney Lumet has staged this historically accurate movie with some magnificent heist scenes that goes along with Inside Man as one of the absolute best hostage movies ever made. Not only do Pacino and Cazale do wonderful in this film but so does Charles Durning as the police sergeant who tries to negotiate with Sonny. I really have to say that this was a great film because I found the performances to be very convincing, and I personally do not hold anything against this film just because Al Pacino and John Cazale play homosexuals.",10,1,2,18 June 2014
Gran Torino," one of Eastwood's greatest films
","Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino is arguably one of the best drama movies ever made as well as being comedic and interesting. The movie stars Eastwood as Walt Kowalski a racist Korean War veteran whose neighbor tries to steal his most prized possession which is a car that is the name of the movie a 1972 ford Gran Torino, also Eastwood's character is miserable because he has a spoiled family doesn't even care about him as well as a granddaughter who wishes he was dead just so she keep that classic car just after they went to his wife's funeral. As D.W. Griffith said when he talked about film making that 'A film with no message is a waste of time.' this film sends more than one message as a matter of fact it sends 2 instead of one the first one being that it is horrible to have an idiotic family that doesn't love you, and the other being to stay away from street gangs.",10,0,2,26 July 2014
The Hurt Locker," A Modern day war movie classic
","Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is one of the best war movies ever made in my opinion along with well done war films such as Patton (1970), The Deer Hunter (1978), Platoon (1986), Saving Private Ryan (1998), and Black Hawk Down (2001). The movie stars Jeremy Renner (in a performance that got him his first Best Actor Oscar nomination.) as Sergeant 1st class William James a man who was recently assigned as a bomb technician as a replacement after the death of Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson (played by Guy Pearce). The direction by Bigelow is the strongest direction for a war movie since that of watching both Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter (1978), and as well as the writing by both Bigelow as well as co-writer and co- producer Mark Boal which was truly brilliant, and also because of the suspenseful and patriotic music. There are many things I do love about this movie beside the writing, the music, and as well as the direction for the film, but also I loved the supporting cast, the cinematography, the characters are very interesting, and even acting is powerful.",10,0,2,23 October 2014
The Longest Day," A World War II classic
","This movie is one of the finest war movies that I've ever seen and unlike most movies that i've seen about the D-Day invasion this one goes into much more detail despite some inaccuracies that frustrated the real people even General Eisenhower walked out of this movie when it was being shown in theaters due to inaccuracies. Operation Overlord is frequently associated with Eisenhower as he was the architect of the invasion and during that time he sent fake intelligence to the Germans to trick them about the invasion. The movie also talks about the American soldiers behind the scenes such as Col. Benjamin Vandervoort (John Wayne), Brig. Gen. Norman Cota (Robert Mitchum), Brig. Gen. James m. Gavin (Robert Ryan), Col. Thompson (Eddie Albert), as well as the son of Theodore Roosevelt (Henry Fonda) who was a Brigadier General. The film also tells its story from the British and German perspective with precision and marvelous detail and perfectionism thanks to the direction by Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, and Berhnard Wicki who directed one of each of the episodes of this movie on such an excellent level. The performances are also excellent and impressive with actors from different parts of the world, and an excellent supporting cast including Richard Burton as British flying officer David Campbell, and along with Mitchum, Fonda, Ryan, and Albert, there is also people like Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Jeffery Hunter, Paul Anka, and especially a young Sean Connery who doesn't have that many scenes but makes it count with the amount of screen time he has. Feature films aren't known for accuracy when they're telling real life stories but documentaries are the only ones that are which doesn't bring this movie down one bit. The writing is superb, the performances are top notch,and every person involved made it into a masterpiece that ranks among the best military movies ever made such as 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), 'The Great Escape' (1963), 'Platoon' (1986), 'The Deer Hunter' (1978), 'Where Eagles Dare' (1968), as well as many others. This is an essential movie that is required viewing for history students who are studying World War II in their respective classes, and it is one of the most patriotic movies i've ever seen, as well as being one of 1962's finest films.",10,1,3,6 July 2017
Transformers," Bay's best film yet
","Michael Bay's Transformers is one of the best science fiction movies of it's generation with the excellent CGI to make the Autobots and Decepticons look real. The movie stars Shia LaBeouf As Sam Witwicky a high school senior who is getting picked on in school until he meets a pretty class mat named Mikaela Banes (played by Megan Fox) who then becomes his girlfriend who have no idea that the decepticons are after them to find the allspark. The first one he encounters is Barricade the Decepticon scout who like the others wants to know where his grandfather's glasses are but he can't trust them, until the Autobots help to gain his trust. Not only that this movie has a lot of good action, and CGI, it also has one scene that I found to be real sad which is where Jazz gets ripped in two by the Decepticon leader Megatron who was twice his size. Luckily four of them survived the mission city battle. This one of the best movies of 2007 because of the excellent writing, direction, and visual effects. Bay did good with this but not so much with the 2nd 3rd transformers movies.",10,2,3,23 August 2014
Lincoln," The best movie of 2012
","Steven Spielberg's magnificent well done Lincoln has Daniel Day- Lewis in his best performance since Gangs of New York but ironically in Gangs of New York he played a man who hated president Lincoln, but nearly 10 years after he actually was given the part to ply Abraham Lincoln himself. Also with other great performances from Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, Hal Holbrook, Joseph Gordon Levitt, David Strathairn, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Hawkes. Director Steven Spielberg tries to teach us not only about what Abraham Lincoln went through in his final months in office, but what he went through to try his hardest to get the 13th Amendment ratified and added to the constitution. Daniel Day- Lewis knocks t out of the park in 3rd consecutive Oscar winning turn as a wise and true American. But in the end of this movie we have to feel bad about what happened to Lincoln when he was assassinated because he was one of this country's most influential presidents.",10,1,2,13 June 2014
Million Dollar Baby," The best picture of 2004
","Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece to it's genre with director and star to the film Clint Eastwood playing a boxing trainer who doesn't believe in training girls in boxing. Then all of the sudden a girl comes to his gym by the name of Maggie Fitzgerald (played wonderfully by Hilary Swank). The movie is on a par with sports film classics such as Rocky, The Pride of the Yankees, and The Blind Side.Director and star Clint Eastwood really knows how to stage some perfect boxing scenes with his sensitive directorship or the movie. Also for the movie Hilary Swank gives the best performance of her career, and with the legendary Morgan Freeman in his best performance since The Shawshank Redemption. And what a great supporting cast that includes Michael Pena, Anthony Mackie, Jay Baruchel etc. Not only this was a great boxing movie it was also very inspirational at the exact same time.",10,1,5,10 June 2014
The Nightmare Before Christmas," One of Burton's very best films
","The Nightmare Before Christmas from my perspective is supposed to be a parody of the classic and poetic Christmas story Twas the night before Christmas. The movie is an animated character study about Jack Skellington (voiced by Danny Elfman) who is the king of Halloweentown who tries to visit another town by the name of Christmastown but does not understand what the idea of Christmas is. Burton is funny with the way he describes his characters with his first clay-mation movie and how he makes them come to life, but it was a huge surprise to me that even though Tim Burton wrote the screenplay to this film the big shame is that he didn't direct it as well but don't get me wrong Henry Selick still did a good job with directing this movie. The acting in this film reminds me of the acting in the clay-mation film Mad Monster Party (1967). But in the end it is one of the best movies of 1993 as well as being one of Disney's great animated triumphs along with the Toy Story trilogy, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and much much more.",9,1,1,17 October 2014
Grave of the Fireflies," A true masterpiece
","Isao Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies is arguably the greatest animated movie ever made, and one of the best war movies ever made as well.The movie tells the tragic story of two orphaned children a teen-aged boy named Seita (voiced by Tsutomu Tatsumi) and his 4 year old sister Setsuko (voiced by Ayano Shiraishi) who try to struggle to survive the U.S. atomic bomb attacks during World War II. Director Isao Takahata really does capture the essence of tragedy that WWII brought to the American people and the Japanese people alike in the same way, and to put it this way the Japanese got what was coming to them, and they were the ones that made us get involved in WWII because of the Pearl Harbor bombing, but I don't mean it in a racist way. The two main characters also try to show us not only how they felt during the war but also how important it is to love your family members more than anybody else in the world.",10,2,3,4 November 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," MARVEL's best movie yet
","Before I saw this movie in a theater I found this movie really hard to believe to be a directorial debut but the movie turned out to be another good one that is one of the best along with Citizen Kane, The Maltese Falcon, 12 Angry Men etc. The movie tells the story of Peter Quill (played by Chris Pratt) a man who has been abducted for 26 years after his mother's death of cancer, along the way he meets not a lot of people to make friends with on the planet Xandar meeting his future Guardians of the Galaxy teammates Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), Rocket the Racoon (Bradley Cooper), Groot (Vin Diesel), and Drax (Dave Bautista). Not only this was a real action adventure as well as being hilarious in most scenes. This is one of the best movies of the year, but after i saw this movie I was dying to see it again. In the beginning I felt bad for Peter because he lost his mother inside I really felt his emotional pain I would feel the same too if I lost a loved one too.A+",10,1,5,12 August 2014
Jerry Maguire," A very good movie on so many levels
","Cameron Crowe's Jerry Maguire is the first and the best sports-agent movies that I have ever seen before and it is a film that also knows a lot about TV sports-casting as well. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Maguire one of the top sports agents that works for a company called SMI and goes by the philosophy that 'being a sports agent isn't about how much money you get and how many clients you may have it is about the friendship with your clients' and gets fired as a result after his boss Bob Sugar (played by Jay Mohr), and before he leaves he decides to go establish a new business with a co-worker named Dorothy Boyd (played by Renee Zellweger) who is the only person that believes in Jerry, and his only client Rod Tidwell (played by Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Oscar winning performance) who acts like a brother to him, and as a result for Tom Cruise he goat a best actor Oscar nomination for his work. Crowe's screenplay is also well written and inspires many to follow their dreams whether you want to be involved in the sports business or not.Even though this isn't a great movie I did enjoy watching the movie. There are some other good things about the movie as well mainly being the humor of this movie which is funny in a goofy kind of way. This is a movie that I think many movie lovers should enjoy laugh with, and treasure as much as I did.",9,0,0,3 July 2015
Black Hawk Down," Ridley Scott's boldest motion picture since Gladiator
","Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down is not only one of the best war movies ever made but it is also a great movie at the same time. The movie tells the horrific story about 123 U.S. soldiers who drop into Somalia to capture 2 top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and end up finding themselves in a desperate battle with the Somalis. The movie stars Josh Hartnett in the title role as Eversmann one of the soldiers who fought bravely in that war,And as Oliver Stone said in his second Oscar acceptance speech ' That we learned nothing from the Vietnam War'. Just like we learned nothing from the battle in Somalia,Director Ridley Scott really showed how he really felt bad for those soldiers that suffered the casualties of war. The movie compares to war classics such as Patton, Saving Private Ryan, The Deer Hunter, Platoon,From Here to Eternity,The Devil's Brigade, Heartbreak Ridge, and Flags of Our Fathers. Also the movie had the exact emotional impact as Saving Private Ryan because what Spielberg did with Saving Private Ryan was that he tried to show how bad the World War II was, But Scott does the exact same thing here but has nothing to do with the WWII topic.",10,2,3,15 May 2014
Prisoners," A near masterpiece
","Denis Villeneuve's 'Prisoners' is not only one of the best movies of 2013 but also one of the best movies of the decade, and as well as being a very Hitchcockian type of movie. The movie stars Hugh Jackman in the best performance of his career so far as Keller Dover who in the beginning of the movie brings his wife Grace (Maria Bello), and his daughter Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) over to their friend Franklin Birch's (Terrence Howard) house who also happens to have a wife named Nancy (Viola Davis) and they have a daughter named Eliza (Zoe Soul). As soon as the Dover's arrive at the Birch's house the two girls are doing what little kids do which is play together. Then the unthinkable happens... Both girls end up going missing under mysterious circumstances. Then later in the movie the police is called and the lead detective on the case is a policeman named Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal). Then we wonder when the two girls are going to be found. With this movie Villeneuve has crafted Hitchcock like tales such as 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991), 'Sunset Boulevard' (1950), 'Witness for the Prosecution' (1957), and many others. Then by the time the end comes along Keller finds the woman who kidnapped the two girls who happens to be an older woman named Holly Jones (Melissa Leo). I won't spoil anything beyond this point because all of the other major moments including the ending are much too valuable to be spoiled. The acting in this movie is so good while most importantly Jackman and Gyllenhaal as the lead characters give such good performances that they were snubbed for Oscar nominations, and the supporting performances from Bello, Howard, Davis, and Leo are so good in this movie that Leo's performance is the darkest throughout this entire film. Because of this movie I can't wait to see more of Villeneuve's work such as 'Incendies' (2010), 'Sicario' (2015), and 'Arrival' (2016). This was a truly great movie that shouldn't be missed by anyone that is a movie fan.",9,0,1,3 March 2017
Big Fish," Burton's best movie since 'Ed Wood'
","Tim Burton's 'Big Fish' is not only his best movie since 'Ed Wood' but it is also his most interesting movie that he directed since 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990) and the most weird, and it is unlike any Tim Burton movie that I have ever seen. The movie starts in the present day at a wedding anniversary for Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) and his wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) but there is a secret that Will is hiding that isn't revealed until later in the movie which is that he is dying but the disease that he is fighting I will not reveal in this review for those that have not seen this movie. The movie also talks about reconciliation throughout the movie but it starts with Ed's son Will (Billy Crudup) who is annoyed at his dad reciting the same poem for his entire life but it gets better between the two of them in Will's final hours. Also during this time Will's wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) is having a baby. During the course of the movie there is a lot of flashbacks but in the past Will is played by Ewan McGregor and it goes through Will's childhood and his time in high-school sports and his time meeting and helping a big giant who his fellow townsmen want to be killed. Also during the past he meets and falls in love with at first sight his eventual wife Sandra (Alison Lohman) but he is ironically rejected at first and then gets approved. Also in the past after Will gets married we go through his times in the Air Force during the Korean war, which all of this is Will's stories of his life that he never told anyone else which to me is very heartbreaking and touching. Burton also directed the first Warner Bros. Batman movie in 1989 which was a very good movie and it's sequel 'Batman Returns' (1992) which was a terrible movie. Anyway when Will was young he also visited this small town where he met this little girl who messed with his shoes and a crazed writer named Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi), and then that little girl is all grown up and middle aged and as a grown up she is played by Helena Bonham Carter who happens to be Burton's wife. I will not spoil anything beyond that because it is for you to find out for yourself and believe me if you like Tim Burton's movies you will most likely enjoy it.",10,1,2,28 February 2017
The Insider," One of 1999's very best films
","Michael Mann's The Insider is one the best films that Michael Mann has ever done along with Heat (1995), Collateral (2004), and Public Enemies (2009). The movie tells the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe in an Oscar nominated performance)who used to work as a tobacco scientist who ended up getting fired and whistle-blowing what has been going with his former workplace to '60 Minutes' news anchor Mike Wallace (played by Christopher Plummer)amid receiving death threats along with his family and trying to get protected by the producer of '60 Minutes' named Lowell Bergman (played by Al Pacino). this was the first film that Pacino did for Mann after working on Heat (1995) four years earlier, everything about this film is just flawless especially when it comes to the amazingly good performances from Al Pacino, Russell Crowe,Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall, and Diane Venora as Jeffrey's wife (later ex-wife). Mann's and Eric Roth's script, along with Mann's directorship and Dante Spinotti's photography are just excellent, and as a result the movie got 7 Oscar nominations including Best Picture , Best Actor for Russell Crowe, and Best Director for Michael Mann. Which are few reasons why I think that it is a great film as well as the emotional range of the Russell Crowe performance which made me empathize with what he was going through throughout the course of the entire film.",10,1,1,16 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Redefined what the Batman movies were really about
","Christopher Nolan's well done second film to his Batman trilogy The Dark Knight not only was an action movie masterpiece, but also is very Hitchcockian at the same time. The movie stars Christian Bale who does it again with his role as Batman aka the caped crusader, the dark knight, or the world's greatest detective whatever you want to call him. The movie tells the story about when Batman, Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart who later becomes the schizoid criminal mastermind mastermind Two Face) and Commissioner James W. Gordon (played by Gary Oldman)end up launching an all out assault on the mafia after Commissioner Lobe's death and don't realize there is another psycho in the streets who calls himself the Joker (played by Heath Ledger in a shocking final performance) whose objective is to bring Gotham city to it's worst. Nolan uses a bigger cast and some of which were in his previous batman film Batman Begins (2005), the cast to this movie also consists of (besides Bale, Oldman, Eckhart, and Ledger) it also features Michael Caine who reprises his profound supporting performance as Alfred Pennyworth, Maggie Gyllenhaal who is Katie Holmes' replacement as Rachel Dawes, and Cillian Murphy who makes a brief appearance as the psycho- maniac Scarecrow. Man if only the other Batman films that came out before Nolan's trilogy/reboots would have been as great and well done as this film, as well as Batman Begins (2005), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012).",10,0,4,20 October 2014
"Girl, Interrupted"," One of James Mangold's finest films
","James Mangold's 'Girl, Interrupted' is the best film that I have seen about disabled people since 'Rain Man' (1988) but the key difference between those two films is that this movie is based on true events. The movie stars Winona Ryder as Susanna Kaysen who wrote the book that this movie was adapted from and it talks about her time and experience in a mental hospital in the 1960's but at first it isn't that easy for her to make many friends. During her first few days the only person she really trusts is the supervising nurse named Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg) whose job is very difficult and Goldberg's character is the polar opposite of Nurse Ratched who was played by Louise Fletcher in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1975). As her time in the hospital progresses Susanna meets a girl named Georgina (Clea Duvall), and then meets a girl who everyone really gets annoyed with and despises at times is a girl named Lisa (Angelina Jolie) who has a really bad attitude. Then in one scene we see Kaysen's boyfriend named Tobias Jacobs (Jared Leto) who is trying to sneak Susanna out of the hospital but Susanna refuses. Other friends that Susanna happens to make are girls named Daisy (Brittany Murphy), Polly (Elisabeth Moss) and others. The reason why Susanna Kaysen was sent to the hospital in the first place was because she was very suicidal which she was sent there by a psychiatrist named Dr. Potts (Jeffrey Tambor). The other doctor in the mental hospital has a very weird last name and her name is Dr. Wick (Vanessa Redgrave), the movie has an excellent cast and great performances throughout which are so good because it really makes you empathize with each and every one of the characters and we feel like we are actually there getting to know them. As the great Roger Ebert once said that 'For me the movies are a machine that generates empathy, it helps to understand hopes, dreams, aspirations and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us.' and that is exactly how I felt with this and many other movies. Despite this movie being one of the best films of 1999 it isn't the very best movie that James Mangold ever directed (that would be 'Walk the Line' (2005) which also happened to be a biopic). James Mangold has done a very good by making this movie just focus on the characters and their feelings instead of just shedding a bad light on them as people even though we know their problems are bad just like Barry Levinson did with 'Rain Man' 11 years before this movie was made. This was a truly great movie but as a warning it might only be worth watching once.",10,0,2,8 March 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," A riveting science fiction adventure
","Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is by far one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time with a perfect plot line for an intense sci-fi thriller. The movie tells the story of a man named Dr. David Bowman (played by Keir Dullea) is in a space shuttle on a mission and while that happens he ends up finding a mysterious futuristic computer called the HAL 9000 and ends up going on a nightmarish quest. visual effects supervisor, co- writer, producer, and director Stanley Kubrick really goes in depth when it comes to science fiction movies. The movie also compares to such sci- fi blockbusters such as Minority Report, Planet of the Apes, the Matrix, and all three of the Iron man movies. if you are a movie lover and especially enjoy the movies with the science fiction genre then it is a must see for you, but if i were you i would disregard the boring lame parts and just appreciate the movie for what it is.",10,1,2,28 March 2014
Pride & Prejudice," One of the best romance movies ever made
","Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice is a movie shot with beautiful brilliance. The stars Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennett a grown woman who I think is 2 of five sisters who ends up meeting a man named Darcy (played by Matthew Macfayden)who at first she underestimates him for a prejudicial reason and that is because he is 'wealthy'. Wright makes Jane Austen's 1813 novel of the same name come to life on the silver screen with his brilliant direction for the film, and not only that he also uses a great cast which includes Keira Knightley in an Oscar nominated performance, Rosamund Pike as the oldest sister Jane who gets proposed to by Darcy's best friend Mr. Bingley (played by Simon Woods), Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as Elizabeth's parents (but to me Blethyn's performance is a little over the top). and many more people. This movie as I mention in my summary is that this movie is one of the best romance movies ever made, along with Out of Africa (1985), and Days of Heaven (1978). Even though there were a few performances that were a little over the top I still liked the movie.",9,0,1,1 November 2014
Taken," A very well paced action movie cut into 93 minutes
","Pierre Morel's 'Taken' is an action movie that ranks among the best of it's generation despite the title sort of being predictable and giving the whole story away. The movie focuses on a retired CIA agent named Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) who has an ex-wife named Lenore (Famke Janssen) and a daughter named Kim (Maggie Grace). In the opening scene of this movie we see Mills go to his daughter's birthday party and is there only for a short time all he really does is get there give his daughter a present but not without confrontation from his ex-wife and he says hello to her new husband Casey (Jon Gries). Then the next day we see Bryan, Lenore, and Kim having lunch at a restaurant and Kim asks him if she can go to Paris, France with her friend Amanda (Katie Cassidy), at first he is reluctant but then after he is demanded to do it he gives in while still being reluctant to do it. Then we see Kim get kidnapped and once Bryan finds out about it he sets out to find who kidnapped her and send her back to her family and he will do anything to accomplish that which is what the tag-line of the movie happens to give away but I won't spoil it beyond here. In the movie Liam Neeson, Famke Janssen, and Maggie Grace gave such good performances in the movie, but the only problem I had with it was that the movie could have had a better title in order to make it less of a predictable movie which made the film focus more on the plot elements than on the actual characters, but it was suspenseful in some aspects. This wasn't a great movie but it was good and entertaining but it also would have been better if it had Hitchcockian like plot elements added to it, but otherwise it worked as a short action movie.",9,3,3,28 February 2017
Avatar," One of the best science fiction movies ever
","James Cameron's Avatar shows a perfect example of what a awesome science fiction movie really is. Writer, editor, producer, and director James Cameron uses a good ensemble cast which includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Michelle Rodriguez, Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, and the legendary Sigourney Weaver. Avatar had all the perfect ingredients for a science fiction epic. The visual effects to this movie are stunning, the cinematography is magnificent. the art direction is fantastic, and even the action sequences are just awesome. Also even the acting is perfect for a science fiction film, Sam Worthington gives the best performance of his career in James Cameron's best film yet. For those of you movie lovers who love science movies and haven't seen this one yet i have nothing else to say but just watch it because for me it was a great movie watching experience.",10,2,4,31 March 2014
Chariots of Fire," One of the best sports movies ever done
","Hugh Hudson's Chariots of Fire is unlike any other sports movie that I have ever seen before, and it is by far one of the most inspirational films of that genre. The film tells the story of two British track athletes one named Harold Abrahams (played by Ben Cross) who is Jewish, the other who also happens to be a missionary named Eric Liddel (played by Ian Charleson) who does track in order to please God though are trying to beat one another while competing in the 1924 summer Olympics. Though unfortunately for Abrahams every time he runs the track with Liddel he takes the first few losses not very seriously until the most recent time he lost to Liddel there was a scene where he was sitting on a chair in the stadium wallowing in self pity thinking that Liddel may be 'a little too competitive' and his girlfriend is trying to help him out and he hires a pro training coach named Sam Mussabini (played by Ian Holm in an Oscar nominated performance) whose character reminds me of the boxing manager Mickey Goldmill in the first few Rocky movies. though this movie is unlike all the sports movies that I have seen but it has one thing in common with all the ones I watched and liked that all of them were inspirational works like Raging bull (1980), Million Dollar Baby (2004), Cinderella Man (2005), the Pride of the Yankess (1942), Remember the Titans (2000) etc. The thing about this film was the neatest part to me was the fact that every track running scene all the runners were moving in slow-motion, as well as the classical score that made me get a lot more involved in the story to this movie. In this film there were a few other great supporting performances besides the Ian Holm performance but as well as by the legendary John Gielgud as the master of trinity, Lindsay Anderson as the master of Caius, as well as the second greatest supporting performance of the entire film was by Brad Davis as an American track runner named Jackson Scholz. This film is very profound but to me it didn't deserve the Academy award for best picture as much as Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark which was nominated alongside this film, but I still enjoyed it, and I really do think it is one of the best movies of 1981.",10,1,1,31 December 2014
Invictus," Morgan Freeman's finest performance yet
","This movie was a true masterpiece with Morgan Freeman perfectly portraying Nelson Mandela. Co- starring Matt Damon as the captain of South Africa's rugby team the Springboks, Under the Oscar level direction by the great Clint Eastwood. I totally didn't understand why Morgan Freeman didn't win the 2009 Oscar for Best Actor because i thought that he totally deserved it. Matt Damon gives a great performance as well,And i really liked the costume design for the movie. And i don't get why Clint Eastwood wasn't even nominated or even won the Best Director Oscar.I loved this movie and those of you who did not watch this movie yet i recommend that you should watch it but trust me it won't waste your time because of how excellent this motion picture really is.",10,1,2,15 February 2014
Sinister," A very well made horror film
","Scott Derrickson's 'Sinister' is one of the best horror films I've seen in recent years and like 'The Conjuring' that came out not long after this movie did it never let up for one second of its runtime, and is really worth your time if you're a fan of horror movies or not. The movie stars Ethan Hawke as Ellison Oswalt a crime novelist who moves with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and children to a new home only to find out that something isn't right after a bunch of old film reels are found in the attic, and a bunch of paranormal things happen with their children (Michael Hall D'Addario and Claire Foley) which leads to a series of events that make the movie even creepier and scarier as the film progresses. In the beginning of the movie when Ellison decides to movie into the house even the local sherriff (Fred Thompson) warns him not to move in and he doesn't listen which makes you ask questions as to what his motives were. Scott Derrickson does a very good directing job and did a very good job with co-writing the screenplay inot not making this movie rely on jump scares all the time like 'It' (2017) did. Derrickson's other credits include 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' (2005) and 'Doctor Strange' (2016) which is one of the best Marvel movies that I've ever seen. The performances are also very strong in the movie with Hawke's performance being the one that stood out to me the most while watching this movie. The movie is one of the best horror flicks I've seen that this century has to offer along with 'The Conjuring' (2013) which I consider to be one of the finest horror films ever made. The supporting performances are very good, and the suspense that this movie builds makes you feel like you are watching evil unfold right in front of your very eyes, and is right up there with 'The Conjuring' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' as one of the creepiest horror films that I've ever seen.",9,0,0,12 May 2019
Where Eagles Dare," One of the best WWII movies of all time
","'Where Eagles Dare' isn't only one of the best WWII movies of all time it is also one of the most entertaining, and in addition it also the best adaptation I've seen of Alistair MacLean's work since 'The Guns of Navarone' (1961). At the time this movie was in production Richard Burton's career was in a downward spiral due to the box office failure of many films including 'Doctor Faustus' (1967) and 'The Comedians' (1967) (of which these two films he did with then wife Elizabeth Taylor). So Burton badly needed a hit and even though he didn't like war movies he did this because he wanted to revitalize his film career by doing an action movie in close coordination with MacLean and producer Eliot Kastner. Thus the movie was made and Burton got his box office hit. Burton plays the title role of British army Major John Smith who is in charge of a mission to go to the Nazi 'Castle of the Eagle' dressed up as Nazis in order to rescue an American General (Robert Beatty) who is held prisoner, while dressing up as Nazis. The person on the team that Smith trusts the most is an American army Lieutenant named Morris Schaffer (Clint Eastwood) who is totally confused as to why he is involved with the mission, the rest of the team consists of Brits and is allied with two women Mary Ellison (Mary Ure) and a woman named Heidi (Ingrid Pitt) who pose as Germans in order to infiltrate the castle. The movie was directed by Brian G. Hutton who would direct Eastwood again in 'Kelly's Heroes' (1970) two years after this movie was released. Burton and Eastwood give one of their best performances of their respective careers, and MacLean's screenplay really kept me in suspense as well as shock with the amount of major plot twists which are too important for me to spoil in this review. The movie does have echoes of other World War II classics such as 'The Guns of Navarone' (1961), 'The Great Escape' (1963), and 'The Heroes of Telemark' (1965), and like those films this one was truly Oscar level thanks to Hutton's expert direction made this movie the masterpiece that it truly is. This is one of 1968's finest films.",10,1,5,22 June 2017
Groundhog Day," Bill Murray's greatest performance
","Harold Ramis' Groundhog day is a comedy that really works with it's story, as well as it's characters. The movie stars Bill Murray as Phil Connors a weatherman for the Pittsburgh weather channel who finds out he is reliving Groundhog day over and over again and really gets annoyed about it (I would too if i reliving the same day over and over again too, but thank god that doesn't happen in real life.) As well as telling the rarest of all plots for movies especially for a comedy reliving the same day which really would be annoying if that happened in real life, (of which was Ramis' message.). This movie is one of the best comedy movie that I have seen in a long time thanks to both Bill Murray's and Harold Ramis' comedic genius as well as a movie that made me have more appreciation for comedy movies even though I like more serious types of movies. But in the end it was a comedic pleasure as much as very funny when the same scene was being repeated all over in which made me laugh a lot more.",10,0,1,1 August 2014
National Treasure," Riveting
","Jon Turteltaub's National Treasure tells the interesting story about a historian by the name of Benjamin Franklin Gates (played by Nicolas Cage)who races to find a Templar treasure before at team of mercenaries. What I saw from this movie was that it was very entertaining in a sense because of the interesting plot and the wonderful acting, The movie also compares to other great films that have a similar plot line for example, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and The Da Vinci Code. And that so called Templar treasure is The Declaration of Independence, What Gates's objective was to keep the Declaration away from the mercenaries that want it badly, then gets busted by the FBI led by Agent Sadusky (played by Harvey Keitel). Then Gates tells Sadusky after his arrest that he can get it back from the leader of the mercenaries Ian (played by Sean Bean). Nicolas Cage gives one of the best performances of his career in this absolutely entertaining adventure film.",10,2,3,5 May 2014
Some Like It Hot," Hilarious
","Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot is a movie that is 10 times funnier than all the Jim Carrey movies combined thanks to Wilder's comedic genius. It is Jack Lemmon who gives the funniest performance through out the entire movie which has a sort of Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire like story but it is a lot different. This movie is about 2 musicians who end up witnessing the St. Valentine's Day massacre end up dressing up as women and leaving Chicago in order to go with an all female band to perform music, while on the way the 2 so called 'women' end up meeting a girl named Sugar Cane (played by Marilyn Monroe). The 2 musicians that are dressed up as women are played by Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in their best performances since I don't know when. Writers Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond have created intelligent lines for a perfect comedy like this one as well as being one of the best movies of 1959.",10,1,1,21 June 2014
Inside Man," Best Hostage movie ever made
","Spike Lee's Inside Man is a perfect example of how a good hostage movie should be with a good cast trying to prove it such as Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. The only problem that I had with this movie was the Arabic music that has nothing to do with this movie that was being played in the beginning and in the end, otherwise it was a great entertainment that I selected as one of the best movies of 2006. Director Spike Lee really knows what he's doing with thriller movies like this one. The movie also has the cast giving great performances throughout this thriller movie achievement.",9,1,1,7 June 2014
"McFarland, USA"," One of the best sports dramas I've seen in a long time
","Niki Caro's 'McFarland USA' is a film filled with pure heart and soul, dedication, determination, and pure inspiration, which this is a movie that is also based on a true story. The movie stars Kevin Costner as Jim White a high-school teacher who just got fired from his job as a football coach and takes up a job as a cross-country coach. After Coach White assembled a cross-country team the team isn't really that inspired at first, but then White pushes them to their real hidden potential so that they can perform as well as they can and how he would want them to in cross-country meets. With this movie Niki Caro who directed the movie really proves she knows how to direct a very well made sports movie. While I was watching the movie I was reminded of another sports movie called 'Remember the Titans' (2000) which was made 15 years earlier with Denzel Washington in the leading role. I was reminded of that movie for two main reasons, the first one being because the things that coaches White and Boone are that when they started in their respective sports as the new coach in town everyone practically hated them and then came to respect them, and the second reason being that both White and Boone pushed them to their limits with their approaches being totally different with White being more laid back and encouraging, and Boone being tough and hard as nails, as well as being very strict. This movie also happens to be one of the best sports movies ever made. Kevin Costner gives one of the best performances of his career as a simple but flawed man who proved that his coaching skills were still good. This is a great movie as well as a near masterpiece that shouldn't be missed at all, and it is even a gem of a movie for all kids to enjoy.",9,1,1,3 March 2017

","Chris Columbus' Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (aka Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) is a masterpiece to it's genre, and the only franchise in movie history to contain eight movies. the movie itself as you already know focuses on the character of Harry Potter (played by a young Daniel Radcliffe)whose parents get killed while he was just a baby then he gets taken by his aunt and uncle (played by Richard Griffiths and Fiona Shaw) who neglected him and only cared for their only son, then after all his mail got burned by his uncle Vernon he was taken to Hogwarts academy for witchcraft and wizardry by Rubeus Hagrid (played by Robbie Coltrane). While Potter is on the way to Hogwarts academy by train he makes two new friends one named Ron Weasley (played by Rupert Grint) and the other a girl named Hermione Granger (played by Emma Watson).The professors at the academy have very interesting personalities such as Prof. Albus Dumbledore (played by Richard Harris), Prof. Snake (played by Alan Rickman) and Prof. McGonogal (played by Maggie Smith). This movie is the best Chris Columbus movie that i have seen since that of Mrs. Doubtfire (1993).",10,0,1,10 October 2014
Thor," A well made superhero movie
","Kenneth Branagh's 'Thor' is one of the best movies that MARVEL comics has ever made along with he other franchises that they have done and practically strikes the right chords every time, and is directed by a man who at the time was very inexperienced with making these types of movies. The movie stars Chris Hemsworth who is perfectly cast as Thor (who also happens to be my second favorite hero in the MARVEL universe) who is the Norse god of thunder, and lives in a realm known as Asgard. Thor is also a man who believes in doing the right thing but sometimes he also lets his morals get to his head a little too often. Thor's father is a god the vikings would pray to named Odin (Anthony Hopkins) who is married to Frigga (Rene Russo), and they only have another child who is very similar to Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus in 'Gladiator' (2000) and is obsessed with ruling Asgard, who happens to be Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is the god of mischief. Later as the film progresses we see Thor get exiled from Asgard for talking disrespectfully to his father and he sees himself on earth and then goes on a rampage and is then taken in by SHIELD agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) for questioning. After the interrogation is over he meets a young woman named Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who is with her family just so that they can get to know who Thor is, and during that time his personality changes from being less arrogant to being a lot more caring towards humans who he previously felt were inferior to him. The visual effects in this movie were breathtaking to see and not only is Hemsworth perfectly cast but Hopkins is as well and deliver fine performances, along with Portman, Russo, and Hiddleston, but as well as Idris Elba as Heimdall, and Stellan Skarsgard as a teacher. But however even though the movie is very good the only thing that prevents it from being great is a routinely frequent problem with MARVEL movies is that some times they really don't get the costumes right which is the case with Thor's costume even though they nailed most of it they just forgot his winged helmet even though this isn't really a major problem for me. Even though this isn't a perfect superhero movie it is one of the best movies that MARVEL and their creator Stan Lee have ever come up with and is one of the best superhero movies of 2011 and of this decade.",9,1,1,2 April 2017
Castle in the Sky," A milestone for Japanese cinema
","Hayao Miyazaki's Castle in the Sky is a true fantasy masterpiece as well as very well done, and very entertaining. The movie tells the story about a boy named Pazu (voiced by James Van Der Beek) who finds a girl named Sheeta (voiced by Anna Paquin)floating down from the sky with some mysterious crystal on her necklace, and then it comes on to a race against time to find the legendary Laputa (aka the castle in the sky) against pirates and foreign agents in order to get to it to prove that it is real before any one else does. The animation for this film is just excellent, as well as the writing, acting, and the story-line to the film. Miyazki directs this film with adventurous passion, and excellence that he fulfills his effort to direct the best animated Japanese film since Grave of the Fireflies (1988). There is also a great supporting voice cast which includes Oscar winner Cloris Leachman as the leader of the pirates Dola, and the original Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill as Muska one of the foreign agents who wants to use the power of the floating castle for evil purposes. But in the end it is one of the best movies ever made and as well as being s film that I consider to be a Miyazaki classic.",10,3,3,26 November 2014
The Godfather: Part III," A good movie but not as good as the first two
","Compared to the first two Godfather movies which were masterpieces, even though this third and final installment in the franchise is a disappointment even though I did happen to like this movie. This movie wasn't adapted from the Mario Puzo novel but it obviously did use mostly the same characters with some new additions. The movie is set roughly 20 years after which part II ended beginning in 1979 and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is still the head of the Corleone crime family but now he is using his power before retirement to do good with founding the Vito Andolini Corleone foundation (which is obviously named after his father) with his daughter Mary (Sofia Coppola) who happens to have a crush on her cousin Vincent (Andy Garcia). With that relationship Michael is very reluctant to let it continue. Also during this time Michael and his ex-wife Kay (Diane Keaton) are still divorced, he has only one sibling left which is his sister Connie (Talia Shire), and he wants his son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio)to join his foundation, but his son refuses and then goes on the path to his own career. Before and during Vincent and Mary flirting Vincent had a girlfriend named Grace Hamilton (Bridget Fonda). Francis Ford Coppola is no question a great director and a fantastic screenwriter but this movie not only flops compared to the first two films, but it also pales in comparison to every great mob movie that I have ever seen, which is why I think that it's a good movie not by any means a great one. The problems that I had with this movie are that, Coppola could have gotten deeper into the story like he did with the first two, and one of the positives is that the acting is very good with standout performances from Pacino, Keaton, Garcia (who got an Oscar nomination), Fonda, Shire, and the great Eli Wallach as an aging mobster named Altobello. But the only performance that was really embarrassing to watch was Sofia Coppola's because I got the impression that when she was filming her scenes her dad was probably telling her to improve and she didn't every time and then pretended to like it with in the next several takes, and that she was cast all because she is Francis Ford Coppola's daughter, but then again that's just me. This was a beautiful movie to look at and to watch but if Sofia Coppola had improved on her performance the movie would have been better than I currently perceive it to be, but it's still an honorable conclusion to follow two masterpieces.",8,1,4,15 April 2017
Mystic River," Sean Penn's greatest performance
","Clint Eastwood's Mystic River is a movie of sadness and loss of a daughter that reunites a group of old friends again. The movie stars Sean Penn as that man who loses his daughter and goes through that midlife crisis with the law and to trying to find the man who murdered his daughter. The movie also has a great supporting cast such as Marcia Gay Harden, Tim Robbins, Laura Linney, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Bacon. Director Clint Eastwood has crafted the best movie about a midlife crisis since Robert Benton's 1979 film Kramer vs. Kramer. Especially featuring a great script by Brian Helgeland, and great photography by Tom Stern. This movie truly touched me in all the correct emotional and I also felt bad for Sean Penn's character in the film as we all should because of what he went through emotionally but it is still a great movie.A+",10,1,2,1 June 2014

The American film institute had the perfect reason to rank this film as # 1 on their 100 most inspirational movies list because of how inspiring of a movie that director Frank Capra made it out to be and of which I consider to be the best movie of 1946.",10,2,6,23 June 2014
A Beautiful Mind," A triumph
","Ron Howard's A Beautiful mind is a film done with skill and excellence, with Russell Crowe giving his best performance since Gladiator but this time playing a controversial person instead of a Roman general. The man who Crowe plays is Professor John Nash a mathematician whose cryptology problems have dealt with economics and other things, but there is one thing that makes us feel bad for Nash and that is that he suffers from a disorder called schizophrenia a disorder where you see things that aren't visible but seen in his imagination. Howard uses an excellent cast Besides Crowe (in a performance that should've won an Oscar) but the film also has Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, Christopher Plummer, Judd Hirsch, and Josh Lucas, but it is Harris and Bettany who play as his delusions. This was really one of the most powerful dramas I have ever seen with Russell Crowe giving a virtuoso performance. This is in some people's lists as one of the worst best picture winners of all time and that the first Lord of the Rings movie should have won, but from my perspective there was something behind it that I think that it should have won best picture and that is that how powerful it was. There was other things that were good about the film besides the direction by Ron Howard, and the excellent performances, but the other things were, the magnificent cinematography by the great Roger Deakins, the score by James Horner, and last but not least the makeup and costumes. But before I saw it I truly underestimated this movie claiming that Ridley Scott should have won best director for his film that came out around the same time Black Hawk Down but I really think that they should have tied but with this one taking home the award for best picture.",10,0,2,7 July 2014
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," A well done fantasy film
","Many people say that Chris Columbus's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) is much better than it's predecessor due to the more, action, entertainment, and thrills, but not with me what I look for in a Harry Potter movie is good action, entertainment, humor,acting, effects (now I do because e I didn't expect these types of effects to be used in Sorcerer's Stone.), and many more. The movie tells the story of while Harry Potter (played by Daniel Radcliffe) is back in his Uncle Vernon's (played by Richard Griffiths) and his Aunt Petunia's (played by Fiona Shaw) home with Potter being tortured starved and neglected just like he was in the very first Harry Potter movie, meanwhile while Vernon has guests over and gets distracted talking a little house elf by the name of Dobby (voiced by Toby Jones) comes along to tell Harry not to return to Hogwarts because something very serious that he for some reason doesn't mention because maybe that is all he knows what happened, or whether none of the professors told him that the chamber of secrets had been opened. And of course Potter thinks that Dobby is bluffing because from what I believe he doesn't think that it was possible for someone to get it to open.After the short/rackety and over-dramatic visit that Dobby gave to Harry, then all of the sudden Harry gets rescued by his old friend Ron Weasley (played by Rupert Grint). One thing that I have noticed while watching the first two Harry Potter movies I noticed that they both reminded me of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy of which I saw earlier this year. There is a lot of things I do love about this movie, of which I love the characters, casting choices, costumes, the magnificent score by John Williams, direction by Columbus, the screenplay, and the visual effects to this movie. This movie is one of the best fantasy movies that i have seen in a very long time, and I hope that I do enjoy the rest of the Harry Potter movies which includes Prisoner of Azkaban (2004), Goblet of Fire (2005), Order of the Phoenix (2007), Half Blood Prince (2009), and Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2 (2010 and 2011).",10,0,1,24 October 2014

That mole in the Boston police force named Colin Sullivan is played by Matt Damon, ant the mob boss who he is working for is played by Jack Nicholson. This movie also had good cast members such as Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen. Director Martin Scorsese has crafted one of his best movies as a director throughout his entire career, and goes on a par with mob film such as American Gangster, Bugsy, and Goodfellas.

Psycho," The Very Best movie of 1960
","Perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's most acclaimed film Psycho is a film that should have won best picture, and best director instead of Billy Wilder winning both awards for his film that came out in that same year The Apartment. The movie tells the story of two of the most important characters in the film which begins with Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) a woman who stole $ 40,000 in cash to go see her boyfriend Sam (played by John Gavin) then after running into the police she goes to a car shop to borrow a car then on a rainy night goes to the Bates motel where she meets a man named Norman Bates (played by Anthony Perkins)who seems nice but really is a troubled psychotic maniac. Who then dresses up in his mother's clothes and ends up killing Marion in the most famous scene in the movie 'The Shower Scene'. Then a private investigator (played by Martin Balsam) and her sister (played by Vera Miles) search for her. When I was watching this film last night for the very first time I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen because of how scary and well done the film was. The performances were top notch from Leigh, Gavin, Perkins, Miles, Balsam, and especially John McIntire as the sheriff.",10,1,2,1 July 2014
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," One of the worst movies of 2009
","When I first watched Michael Bay's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen I happened to think that it was really good due to the action sequences and the effects, when at the time I didn't even pay attention to what the story was really about. The movie stars Shia Labeouf who reprises his role as Sam Witwicky a recent high school graduate who is in the process of going to college with the escort of his dumb parents Judy Witwicky the annoying (played by Julie White), and Ron the pessimist Witwicky (played by Kevin Dunn). But while Sam is starting college the decepticons want to cause a ruckus in China in the town of Shanghai, when you see any Transformers movie sequel you start to think that Oh the vehicles are good but Bay uses way too much effects because he doesn't care about a good story, and people including myself really do wish that Michael Bay could put a lot more effort whenever he makes a movie because a lot of his movies are considered plain terrible for example (to name a few) Armageddon (1998), Bad Boys 2 (2003), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), and Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014). In this movie there is rarely any good acting and no good screenplay, what I really do wish is that the next time that Michael Bay makes a movie is that it could be a well done movie just like the first Transformers movie was, and the reason why I think that the Dark of the Moon as well as this one were bad sequels in the Transformers franchise is three things, one he is full of himself, two maybe he only wanted to direct the first Transformers movie, and three maybe his obsession for Transformers characters that end up being in movies and whichever one he directs he just wants to get the film over with.",4,0,5,7 October 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," A very good movie about a major moment in the war on terror
","Kathryn Bigelow's 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a very gripping and suspenseful account of the raid authorized by former President Barack Obama to take out Osama bin Laden the man who was responsible for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and after that event happened he was under the radar for almost 10 years until May 1, 2011 until he was shot and killed by members of SEAL team 6. The movie stars Jessica Chastain in an Oscar nominated performance as Maya a CIA agent who in the movie came up with the original plan to take out Bin Laden. The movie isn't as suspenseful as her previous movie which was 2009's 'The Hurt Locker' which was a total flawless masterpiece and one of the best war movies ever made. Then Maya tells her colleagues at the CIA as well as then director Leon Panetta (James Gandolfini) her plan to take him out while most of them agreed with it. Bigelow and her screenwriter Mark Boal are probably the greatest modern director-screenwriter duo currently working which Boal wrote the Oscar winning screenplay for 'The Hurt Locker'. Even though this film wasn't as good as 'The Hurt Locker' the scenes where the mission to take out Bin Laden were so intense that I didn't know what was going to happen next. My cousin's best friend told me that the movie was bad because it was inaccurate before I even saw the movie even though I was still looking forward to watching it and the movie totally worked for me, and now that I think about it the movie could be ranked among the best military movies ever made even though it isn't really a war movie. Because of experiences like this one and 'The Hurt Locker' I am totally looking forward to seeing what movie that Bigelow and Boal do next, because this is one of the best movies of 2012.",9,1,3,28 February 2017
All Quiet on the Western Front," One of the most rousing war films ever made
","Lewis Milestone's adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's ' All Quiet on the Western Front' was definitely a better film on his military resume than the flawed but still good Pork Chop Hill (1959). The movie is a character study of a young man named Paul Baumer (played by Lew Ayres in an Oscar snubbed performance) who is in college during the start of the film with some classmates of his and a teacher who convinces them to serve in World War I and that 'It is a wonderful thing to die for your country, which is the heroic thing to do'. Then as soon as Paul persuades his friends to enlist and go off to war they begin to realize that killing people isn't as fun as they previously thought to which they go from a pro-war to an anti-war stance. Although I disagree with the film's point of view I think that is a great thing for people to serve their own country, and the great thing about movies is that people can tell a story from a certain perspective. The movie compares to some of the greatest war films of all time for example Platoon (1986), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Patton (1970), The Deer Hunter (1978), and The Hurt Locker (2009). Even though the war films that I just listed take place in different wars that we have been involved in, the thing that made me love the movie a whole lot more was reading the novel because it gave me a better understanding of what the film was about and the emotions of the characters, which is why in the film's case it is great on so many levels even the storytelling, acting, photography, and writing, etc. Also these are reasons why I personally think that the movie should received more Oscars and nominations that it ended up receiving at the 3rd Oscars ceremony.",10,3,5,13 May 2015
12 Years a Slave," A monumental achievement
","Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave is one of those movies where you are not supposed to be entertained, but instead for you to get pulverized. The movie tells the true story of Solomon Northup (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor in an Oscar nominated performance) a free citizen, and is a musician is having a normal life at his home in Saratoga New York, until the year 1841 where he is in the process of looking for a job in Washington D.C. and then then he gets drugged, kidnapped, and sold into slavery for a horrific 12 year period of time of torture, horror, and misery. But the good thing is only one of his slave masters was actually good t him and his name was Ford (played by Benedict Cumberbatch.) but too bad Solomon only has him as a slave master for only two years>) and Solomon was sold to Ford by a guy named Freeman (played by Paul Giamatti) in which Solomon is sold along with a girl named Patsey (played by Lupita Nyong'o in an Oscar winning performance.) Then after two years pass by Solomon and Patsey are sold to cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps (played by Michael Fassbender in an Oscar nominated performance.) along with his wife (played by a mean but brilliant Sarah Paulson) where they both get tortured, beat up, and Patsey gets raped in one scene. The way McQueen directs this movie is kind of like the way that Spielberg directed Schindler's List (1993), or Amistad (1997) (but to me this film is much better than Amistad.) but totally different. The movie is arguably the best movie of 2013 that really showed how horrible it was for black people who were enslaved by white people all because of their skin color, and fortunately none of that happens anymore even though there is still some racial prejudice going on the world a lot of times without even realizing it.",10,0,1,21 November 2014
Wedding Crashers," A comedic disappointment
","The purpose of all comedy movies is to make you laugh your head off so much that you are actually laughing with what the characters are doing, but that is not the case with David Dobkin's Wedding Crashers. The movie stars Owen Wilson as John Beckwith and Vince Vaughn as Jeremy Grey who are two men who belong in the wedding crashing business, but I have to give them credit for knowing how to get in and how to crash one. Before I watched this film I thought it was actually going to be funny throughout, but turns out I was mostly wrong because most of it was just humor with no humorous replies with laughs as this movie was expecting, I also thought that this movie in every scene was just going to be how they plan and crash weddings but in the scenes where John and Jeremy do so you just can't tell how they are doing because in advance all Jeremy says to John before they crash into a Jewish style wedding was'We have a bunch of weddings to crash'. Then a few weeks after that wedding they find out that that Treasury Secretary William Cleary's (played by Christopher Walken) daughter Christina (played by Jenny Alden) is about to get married to a guy named Trap (played by David Conrad). The only things that I noticed during the Secretary's daughter's wedding was the facial expressions (especially those by Walken). i really do think that the director to this movie David Dobkin could have done a much better job than what he did without thinking of revisions for his direction before the film was released. Then John ends up falling in love with one of the Secretary's daughter Claire (played by Rachel McAdams) when she already has a boyfriend with a sort of native American name Sack Lodge (played by Bradley Cooper) (What a huge coincidence that is, also when Sack doesn't even know about it). there was a lot of other things I hated about this movie besides the directing, I didn't like the story especially because it made fun of a time where we are supposed to feel good about ourselves and that is when someone gets married to the person who we think is the correct person to marry, the acting i would have to give half credit because in some scenes the acting was good as well as totally stupid/insane at the same time, the person who really does give the creepiest performance in this film as Isla Fisher (who also plays as one of Secretary Cleary's daughters) who plays a woman who is thought to be a virgin to some men when she is really a sex offender, and not only that there is also other people who gave horrible performances such as Will Ferrell as John's friend Chazz who end up crashing a funeral and Ferrell acts like a spoiled brat, Ellen Albetini Dow as the crazed grandmother who does act like the pessimistic octopus from the animated nickelodeon TV show Spongebob Squarepants, and by the way during the scene when John and Chazz were crashing the funeral I thought to myself 'What did this movie turn into? funeral crashers', I also hated the script to the movie because of the fact that most of it was sexual garbage,and i especially hated Keir O' Donnell's performance as the only son in the Cleary family Todd who is a freakishly homosexual artist who tries to creep the heck out of Jeremy. What a dumb movie.",3,1,2,24 November 2014
The Bridge on the River Kwai," The best performances of both William Holden and Alec Guinness
","David Lean's masterpiece form the year 1957 The Bridge on the River Kwai is an epic WWII treasure to cinema. With both William Holden and Alec Guinness giving their finest performances yet, Based on a true story , this movie was a total great that can be watched over and over again. the movie compares to history movie classics like Schindler's List, Malcolm X, Spartacus, and Gladiator. Director David Lean really worked his heart out in order to make into an Oscar winning success which is why he won his first Oscar for directing this movie in the very first place. I would recommend this movie for all people that are into any period pieces like this one that will stay with you for a very long time.",10,0,1,25 May 2014
Man on Fire," A first rate thriller
","Tony Scott's Man on Fire (2004)is a superb thriller that was based on real history, while watching this movie what i learned from it this movie is that being kidnapped is worse than it sounds because a stranger can tell you that they are going to give you a ride home when they are not because young kids don't know better and fall for it very easily. The movie stars Denzel Washington as bodyguard John W. Creasy (who was originally played by Scott Glenn in the 1987 version.) who is hired to protect a young girl named Pita Ramos (played by Dakota Fanning)who then gets kidnapped by these unknown people in Mexico as well as corrupt cops (which doesn't surprise me that much because Mexico is a very corrupt country.) The movie also has a great supporting cast that includes Marc Anthony as Pita's dad, Mickey Rourke as the family attorney, Christopher Walken as a good friend of Creasy's, and Radha Mitchell as Pita's mother. This is one of the best action movies i have seen in a long time thanks to Scott's fantastic direction for this well done thriller.",10,1,2,21 September 2014
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nicholson knocks it out of the park
",Milos Forman's One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was a great movie to begin with because of not only the acting in the film but the humor in it as well. Based off of a Ken Kesey novel tells the story about a man named Randall Patrick McMurphy (played by Jack Nicholson) who ends up going to a mental institution while getting in trouble with the law way too many times (which makes me think back to Good Will Hunting.)then rebels along with his nutty institution friends to try the best they could to escape while the evil Nurse Ratched (played by Louise Fletcher) isn't there. Director Milos Forman has crafted one of the greatest movies ever made because of it's humorous moments and the electrifying performances throughout.,10,1,2,13 June 2014
American Gangster," One of the best mob movies i have ever watched in my entire life
","This movie brings us back in time to when Frank Lucas was heading the New York mafia and the movie tells the story beautifully with Denzel Washington portraying Lucas perfectly. Also Russell Crowe portrays the detective who was trying to pursue him brilliantly. Director Ridley Scott really knows how to execute a perfect crime biopic. Also for some reason this movie feels like a movie that was directed by the masterful Martin Scorsese when it really wasn't. Director Ridley Scott uses a great ensemble cast such as Denzel Washington, Russell Crowe, Chiwetel Ejiofor,Ruby Dee as Lucas's mother, Carla Gugino as Lucas's wife,and Cuba Gooding Jr. as Nicky Barnes. This marked the third collaboration between Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe and was a success. The movie also compares to historical landmarks such as Schindler's List,Gangs of New York,Munich,Valkyrie,The Last Samurai,and Men of Honor. Also Scott depicts the film almost near accurately. I thought that this was a perfect crime tale to put onto film and i enjoyed it a lot.",10,2,4,24 March 2014
The Green Mile," The best prison movie since The Shawshank Redemption
","Frank Darabont's The Green Mile is his boldest motion picture achievement since his 1994 directorial debut The Shawshank Redemption. This prison film fantasy tells the story of a prison guard named Paul Edgecomb (played by Tom Hanks) a man of whom at first doesn't believe in miracles until he encounters one for the very first time and that is a black man named John Coffey (played by Michael Clarke-Duncan). Director Frank Darabont has not only created a great prison film, but also he has created an inspirational and sometimes sad fantasy. This is the absolute best movie of 1999 because of the great effort put forth for this inspirational masterpiece.",10,1,3,18 June 2014
Jaws," An Instant classic
","Steven Spielberg's Jaws is a movie shot with brilliance and filled with Alfred Hitchcock level suspense (which is the only reason why he didn't want to meet his biggest fan which was Spielberg, because he 'made the fish movie.' That Hitchcock wanted to direct so badly but was already working on his final movie Family Plot (1976) at the time. The movie stars Roy Scheider as New England police chief Martin Brody (played by Roy Scheider) a man who wants to have a good time at the beach until all horror breaks loose because great white sharks are coming ashore to kill people. Then after he realizes what is going on at the beaches he teams up with an oceanographer (played by Richard Dreyfuss), and the captain of a tiny boat (played by Robert Shaw)and set out to kill the shark.The score to this movie is nothing short of fantastic from John Williams as well as being suspenseful and creepy at the same time. Scheider, Shaw, and Dreyfuss are just flawless with their excellent performances in the film.",10,1,3,21 September 2014
Shooter," An impressive political thriller
","While watching Antoine Fuqua's Shooter another movie entered my mind about 10 or 20 minutes into the film and that movie was Orson Welles' Touch of Evil (1958) because the plots to both of those movies are just so similar especially because one character gets framed in each movie. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg as former Marine Sergeant Bob Lee Swagger (who also happens to be a sharpshooter) retires and is in peace at home with his dog relaxing and doing target practice as usual, then he meets former Colonel Isaac Johnson (played by Danny Glover) and his other friends and they talk about a conspiracy to assassinate the president of the united states ( whose name is not mentioned in the film) for about five minutes or so then Johnson leaves Swagger's residence and after Johnson leaves Swagger thinks about it and approves of the idea. After a few days he says goodbye to his dog and goes on his way to assassinate the president , and after the archbishop of Ethiopia is done with his speech and the president and one of Johnson's teammates attempt to shoot the president and instead hits the arch bishop, then all hell breaks loose Swagger gets shot twice by a cop who witnesses the assassination attempt and runs away. then he meets FBI agent Nick Memphis (played by Michael Pena) who is just about to arrest him and again Swagger gets away realizing he just got framed.And also while watching this movie one other movie entered my mind without thinking about it and that was Andrew Davis' The Fugitive (1993) because of the chase scenes. Two things I find funny with the characters is the last names of both Wahlberg's character Swagger which is a term used to mean cool, and for Pena's character which is a town in the state of Tennessee. but in the end it was a very well done movie.",7,0,0,13 October 2014
Arrival," One of the best science fiction films this decade has to offer
","Denis Villeneuve has proven himself as one of the great modern directors after movies like 'Prisoners' along with this movie and others of his that I'm just flat out dying to see like 'Sicario' and 'Blade Runner: 2049' and on top of that this movie is one of 2016's very best. This is no ordinary movie about aliens where we learn to love them and want to be their friends such as in Spielberg's 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'E.T.' have shown us or a movie that makes us want to be scared to death of them like 'Alien' or 'Aliens' , but it is a movie that makes us uncertain and curious as to what they want to do to us and why they're here on Earth in the first place. The movie stars Amy Adams in a top notch performance that was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar nomination as Louise Banks a linguistics professor who along with the rest of the world learns that 12 mysterious alien ships have touched down on 12 different locations around the globe and is recruited by an Army Colonel (Forest Whitaker) to find out what their purpose is on this planet mainly because she has a top secret security clearance. She then is taken into a helicopter to go to the site where they will find the alien ship and on her team is a man named Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) who she develops a close relationship with on the mission. During the first scenes in the movie while I was waiting for the aliens to appear I felt the same feeling I had waiting for the shark in 'Jaws' but only this movie isn't as suspenseful. Villeneuve is a director who really knows what he is doing behind the camera and really knows how to get strong performances from his actors whether it's Hugh Jackman in 'Prisoners' or Amy Adams in this movie. The movie is one of the very best science fiction movies I have ever seen along with 'Inception', '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'ET', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', 'the 'Star Wars' films and more. This is a movie that will stand the test of time over the next several decades and is truly a masterpiece.",10,1,3,10 June 2019

Director John Lee Hancock did a magnificent job with his Oscar level direction of this sweeping biopic.There is no other words i could say better about this movie other than it was a true epic masterpiece. Tim McGraw also gives the best performance of his career as Bullock's loving husband.Also this movie has one of the best ensemble casts of 2009.

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Inarritu's best film since 'Babel'
","Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's 'Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a movie that is one of the most original movies that I have seen in this decade with a cast that literally knocks their performances out of the park in this movie and now that i'm writing this review I couldn't agree more that this was an Oscar worthy movie. The movie stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson a broke Broadway actor who is in the process of making a play called 'What We Talk About When We Talk About Love' that is adapted from Raymond Carver. Thomson also wrote the script and directed the play and this his chance to make or break his career. Thomson is also having personal struggles he has a daughter named Sam (Emma Stone) who has at first a rocky relationship with him, and an ex-wife named Sylvia (Amy Ryan). During one of the rehearsal scenes of the play we see Riggan practice with co-stars such as an actress named Lesley (Naomi Watts) as well as two other actors and one of them he refers to as 'The worst actor he's ever seen.' who then gets injured. After the injury scene he talks with his attorney and his best friend named Jake (Zach Galifianakis) to find a replacement actor for the play. Within a few minutes they find an actor named Michael Shiner (Edward Norton). Another actress that I forget to mention that was in the play was an actress by the name of Laura (Andrea Riseborough).Like some of my other favorite filmmakers I have never seen such a style like Inarritu's when it comes to directing a movie in a long time even though with a lot of filmmakers like Spielberg, Scorsese, or Tarantino it's till there and that skill is to get to the point with any type of story, and believe me Inarritu's direction is excellent. During the movie the play went on to become a huge hit and resurrected Riggan's career as an actor. Even though this is a great movie that teaches people that when you are in a bad situation of any kind such as your career being in dire straits you can always redeem yourself and soar above your problems and be at the top of your game once again. This is one of the 10 best movies of 2014.",10,1,3,2 March 2017
The Big Short," One of 2015's best films
","Adam McKay's 'The Big Short' is the best financial movie I have seen since watching Oliver Stone's 'Wall Street' (1987), but the only difference between these two movies is that this movie was based on true events. The film takes place before and during the recession of 2008 in which some aspects of this movie are pretty funny if you ask me. The movie was adapted from the book by Michael Lewis and it basically starts off with Dr. Michael J. Burry (Christian Bale) who was the first person to predict the housing market crash by actually betting against the housing market before it actually happened despite everyone else thinking that he was a crazy person. Then 20 minutes into the film we see a banker named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) talk to a Morgan Stanley employee named Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his coworkers and Vennett tells them that not long from now the economy is going to collapse and that nobody was even talking about it. also during the movie and in between all of the financial conversations Baum is going through a personal tragedy that I will not reveal in this review for those people that haven't seen the movie, and Baum is getting comforted between phone calls and at home by his wife (Marisa Tomei). The screenplay for this movie by McKay along with Charles Randolph took home the Oscar last year for best adapted screenplay and I had a few minor gripes with it here and there but then again it was directed by a man who normally does comedies. Then later in this movie we see 2 other men in the finance world (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) end contacting a retired trader by the name of Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) who is the fourth person to predict the collapse of the housing market. the only major problem I had with this movie was the shaky camera angles which could have been improved on, and also I think that Adam McKay could have been more impartial instead of openly mocking the corporations but then again that is just my opinion, but otherwise the performances from Bale (who got an Oscar nomination), Gosling, Carell, and Pitt are top notch, as well as Marisa Tomei's. This is one of last year's greatest achievements in film, and I stand by this review.",9,26,30,23 February 2017
The Conjuring," One of the finest horror films of the decade
","James Wan's 'the Conjuring' is a far better horror film than I had expected it to be, but four years ago when it was released into theaters I thought it was about a person being possessed but when you watch it for the first time you will find out that it is so much more than that. The movie is based on the true story of Roger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) who have five daughters named Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver), who then move into an old Rhode Island farmhouse which is haunted but nobody notices until a few days later when the mother goes to some sort of paranormal activity class and learns about signs of demonic activity which happens to be taught by supernatural activity investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) who then get told about the situation and then decide to take a look at the house for themselves, but after they're hired things would get a lot worse than an ordinary person would be able to comprehend. During the many investigation scenes Lorraine finds out that there was a young woman hung by a tree by her own mother that was possessed by some demonic spirits to kill her which she then finds out will happen eventually but for reasons that I will not reveal, but things get scarier and scarier with really effective jump scares which are written at just the right times, and Wan's direction is very similar to the techniques of Alfred Hitchcock in terms of building up suspense in the movie. The performances especially from Farmiga and Wilson are very good, and mostly everything is totally realistic for a horror film. But at the same time I feel like this movie could have been a lot better despite being a near masterpiece. This is one of the best movies of the decade but not the best horror film that I've ever seen, although it is one of the very best, ranking among greats like 'Psycho' (1960), 'The Silence of the Lambs' (1991), 'Carrie' (1976),'Poltergeist' (1982), 'The Shining' (1980) and many others. But compared to this movie the other Wan movie that I watched recently which was 'Saw' (2004) this movie is nearly twice as better than that one, which is why I would highly recommend it for horror movie fans who haven't seen this movie yet.",9,0,0,2 August 2017
Platoon," One of the best war movies ever made
","Perhaps Oliver Stone's most well known film Platoon is a masterpiece to it's genre, the movie tells the story of a young recruit in the Vietnam War who faces a moral crisis when confronted by the horrors of war and the duality of man. The movie stars Tom Berenger as Staff Sgt. Barnes a soldier who only cares about killing. The movie also stars Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Johnny Depp, Francesco Quinn, and Forest Whitaker. What Oliver Stone tries to teach us with this Vietnam epic is of the horrors of the Vietnam War and what a horrible event it really was in our history. The acting is complex, the music score tries to make us think of the horrors of all wars, the cinematography is terrific, and my gosh what a great movie this really was. Not only Oliver Stone's direction was really good but he was an actual veteran of that war, and this is a great movie to remember those who died during the Vietnam War.A definite A+",10,3,4,1 May 2014
Scream," A weird horror movie that is very good in its own right
","Wes Craven's 'Scream' is a truly original horror film with a very original plot that wasn't even thought of before it was made, though it is very creative it isn't perfect and most movies aren't. The movie opens with a high-school girl named Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) who is home alone in her house making popcorn and is about to watch a movie until some sort of creepy voice calls her on her cell phone asking her questions that are related to horror movies such as 'What is your favorite scary movie?' along with 'What was the name of the killer in Halloween'?', and 'Who was the killer in 'Friday the 13th'?' numerous times after repeatedly hanging up on him, and then he says to her that if she hangs up again, as well as gets any questions wrong he will kill both her and her boyfriend Steven, and unfortunately both of them get killed by a serial killer dressed in some sort of ghost-grim reaper costume. The next day her whole school in shock and grief after hearing about the murders. The next person on the serial killers hit list is a girl who was a friend of the victims named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) whose mother was murdered approximately a year earlier and fears that she might be next, and as a result is staying over the house of her best friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan), and also being guarded by a local Sheriff's deputy by the name of Dewey (David Arquette), while also being stalked by a journalist named Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) who wants to ask questions about her mother, and how she is doing after the murders happened, and as a result of that her school principal (Henry Winkler) suspends school for reasons of curfew until the serial killer is captured by the police. But however I will not spoil anything beyond this point which will practically give away the entire movie due to the major plot twists towards the end of the movie. During the movie however Craven and his screenwriter Kevin Williamson do a very good job of messing with people's heads by making people think that a certain person committed the crimes and then constantly make us think that it was a different person every few minutes. Craven's direction and Williamson's screenplay are very good and well balanced but could have been better with a lot more tension and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock once said to 'Always make the audience suffer as much as possible.' Which is what I feel like is lacking here. There is no question the Craven was one of the most popular horror filmmakers of all time along with George Romero, James Wan, John Carpenter, James Whale, Tod Browning, and many others. However this movie did make me more excited to see other horror films by Craven such as 'The Hills Have Eyes' (1977), and 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (1984) which may be much better films to watch, but then again that's just me.",8,0,0,3 August 2017
Paths of Glory," Another Kubrick masterpiece
","Stanley Kubrick is one of the true masters of making movies with so many masterpieces to his name including 'Spartacus', 'Dr. Strangelove', '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'The Shining', and 'Full Metal Jacket' this movie is a worthy addition to that resume for me and is the best war film that Kubrick ever directed. I haven't seen that many WWI movies in my life besides this movie and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' which was from the German viewpoint, and the key difference with this movie in terms of the plot is that this movie presents the French point of view. Kirk Douglas stars in one of his finest performances as Colonel Dax a soldier who is in charge of group of soldiers tasked with the impossible task of taking the Ant Hill from the Germans and once he realizes the impossibility of the mission they're forced to retreat and General Paul Mireau (George Macready) the commanding officer present for the failed operation accuses Dax's battallion of cowardice in the face of the enemy and court martials them and only three soldiers can be tried and Dax himself volunteers to defend them in a trial rigged against them and are thus found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad. I had been dying to see for years and it really exceeded my expectations as to how great it was going to be because I went into this thinking it was going to be a war movie that just focuses on the fighting but this movie is more than just fighting and loyalty to one's country. When Kirk Douglas accepted the AFI lifetime achievement award in 1991 he said that he used to believe that movies should be merely entertaining and not have a message and that belief gradually changed as he got older and believes that movies should make statements in order for the betterment of mankind. The movie is a movie effectively hones its message of war being hell for the soldiers that fight in them andsometimes even in impossible odds get punished even though they were trying to serve their country which rarely happens in any country's military. The movie is one of the most well acted and well made anti-war statements ever put on film along with 'Platoon' and 'Saving Private Ryan' and is one of the very best movies of the late 1950'.",10,0,1,9 June 2019

","Brian De Palma's 'Carrie' is not only one of the best horror movies ever made it is also on e of the best Stephen King adaptations that I have seen in a long time. Based on the novel 'Carrie' by Stephen King the movie stars Sissy Spacek as Carrie White a high school senior who is also not a very social person and who gets bullied by other girls in her class and is also has a religious nut for a mother named Margaret (Piper Laurie),also in the movie the only friend she seems to have is her gym teacher Ms. Collins (Betty Buckley), then afterwords a girl in her grade named Sue (Amy Irving) has a conversation with her boyfriend Tommy Ross (William Katt) to take Carrie to the senior prom but at first Carrie doesn't know anything about it until Tommy drives over to her house but at first she is very reluctant to accept his offer to take her offer (because she told her mother and was forced to say no) but it would eventually take a few more tries before she accepts his offer. Then the night before the prom starts two teenagers named Billy Nolan (John Travolta) and Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) go to a farm and slaughter a pig and pour it's blood into a bucket in order to ruin Carrie's most exciting moment of her life which I won't give anything else away here. Brian De Palma and his screenwriter Lawrence Cohen do a very good job here at including the jump scares at the right moments. The movie is also ranked with 'Poltergeist' (1982), 'Psycho' (1960), and 'The Shining' (1980) as one of the best horror films ever made. Also Carrie has telekinetic powers which she learned how to use with the sole purpose of defending herself from her own mother and her enemies. The movie behaves like a Hitchcockian thriller that was filmed by a rookie director. Both Spacek and Laurie should have won Oscars for their performances in this movie and both of them gave the best performances of their careers. This is one of the best movies of 1976, Period.",10,0,0,25 February 2017
Raging Bull," Scorsese's boldest film yet
","Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is not just a boxing movie, or a man who talks about sex as a joke, but it is the story of the life of Jake La Motta (played by Robert De Niro) who uses his anger and rage in and out of the ring. De Niro plays La Motta with brilliance but in order to play him he had to learn how to box first, both De Niro and Pesci give their career's best performances that really deserved Oscars for their wonderful work, especially Cathy Moriarty for her well played performance as La Motta's 2nd wife. Scorsese has made a masterpiece out of this film that tells us how Jake La Motta was in real life and how he would destroy his life out of the ring. The movie also deserved a lot more academy awards than it actually got, but it deserved best actor for De Niro (for which it actually won), best picture, best director, best supporting actor, best supporting actress, best sound editing, and best cinematography. On an episode of Siskel & Ebert where they both selected this film as the best movie of the 1980's I absolutely agree with them but Siskel included another true statement that said 'After you're done watching this movie you feel like you actually know that person.' and I did feel as if I knew him in real life.",10,2,2,13 July 2014
The Silence of the Lambs," Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins at their Oscar winning finest
","Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs is one of cinema's greatest political thrillers of all time. The movie stars Jodie Foster as FBI trainee Clarice Starling who tries to learn information about another serial killer from former psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter (played perfectly by the great Anthony Hopkins.). Director Jonathan Demme totally knew how he would execute this movie and he did it perfectly. Also the movie not only has great performances throughout but it also has a great score from the magnificent Howard Shore.Also the movie stays true to it's storyline. Based on a novel by Thomas Harris the movie ended up winning 5 Academy Awards because of it's Hichcockian thriller style that was used for the film but in a different way, and also for the Oscar level effort the great cast and crew put forth. The Silence of the Lambs is an adrenaline shock to the senses that will make your heart beat rapidly.",10,6,14,12 April 2014
Ben-Hur," Great Movie
","William Wyler's 'Ben-Hur' is the most entertaining religious epic that I have ever seen with some of the best stunt-work I've ever seen on film. The movie stars Charlton Heston in an Oscar winning performance as Judah Ben-Hur a rich Jewish prince who has a best friend in a Roman named Messala (Stephen Boyd) who eventually betrays him and sends him into slavery. After Ben-Hur is taken out of slavery he seeks to get revenge on Messala for his betrayal by competing against him in a chariot race in the Roman Colosseum. While Ben-Hur is out of slavery he meets a man named Sheik Ilderim (Hugh Griffith). The chariot scene in the movie is the most famous scene in this film and it's the best scene in the entire movie. Wyler also directed such classics such as 'Roman Holiday' (1953), and is also well known for directing 'Dodsworth' (1936), 'Jezebel' (1938), 'Wuthering Heights' (1939), 'The Best Years of Our Lives' (1946) of which none of those movies I watched besides 'Roman Holiday'. This movie is also the best color epic since both 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' (1938), and 'Gone with the Wind' (1939). the saddest scene in the movie is where Ben-Hur is witnessing the crucifixion of Jesus but before that happens in the movie he gives him some water and is then pushed away by Roman guards. The performances are perfect for a movie like this, as well as the stunt-work and action sequences, and the Oscar winning cinematography by Robert Surtees is excellent who would also photograph movies like 'The Sting' (1973) which was another great movie. The movie also happens to be the best movie Wyler ever directed and one of my all time favorite films. This a true masterpiece that can't be missed by anyone.",10,0,2,13 June 2014
The Deer Hunter," An epic and emotional war drama
","Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter is a a great war film that really stays true to it's genre and it's storyline. The film also includes a great cast for a war movie such as Robert De Niro (in one of his best performances.), Meryl Streep, John Cazale, Christopher Walken, George Dzundza, and John Savage. Co- writer, producer, and director Michael Cimino knows how to execute an excellent war movie. The movie should have won De Niro an Oscar for his hard work at portraying his character perfectly. Also the film has great supporting work from both Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep (in her first academy award nominated performance.). The movie has excellent cinematography,writing,acting, and costumes. This is one of the best war movies i have ever watched in my entire life. This a very sad story but a great movie at the same time and it is a total must see but it isn't a movie for the whole family.",10,0,3,2 April 2014
The Producers," Arguably the funniest movie of all time
","Mel Brooks' debut film is also his best film, telling the story about a down on his luck producer Max Bialystock (played by Zero Mostel) who has been romancing elderly women , ends up meeting an accountant named Leo Bloom (played by Gene Wilder) who together plan intentionally on producing the absolute worst play in Broadway history called 'Springtime for Hitler'. On opening night for the play at first the production duo think that their plan is working until the end of the show when it becomes a success and they get mad that their plan had failed, and then blew up the theater and the audience that was scheduled to see the play was crying because the theater blew up. Brooks' film has so much laughs in it but in case if you laugh so hard your going to need a drink of water while you pause the film. But i did love it, so much it belong with other comedy movies as the funniest movies of all time such as Some Like It Hot (1959), Tootsie (1982), Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), It Happened One Night (1934), The Gold Rush (1925), Planes, Trains, and Automobiles (1987), Spaceballs (1987), Mrs. Doubtfire, Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928), and The Kid (1921) etc. Also not only that this movie is the funniest movie of all time it is also a very well done and masterful comedy that is worth seeing over and over again.",10,0,2,29 November 2014
Rear Window," A dynamite suspense thriller from the great Alfred Hitchcock
","This is my all time favorite Hitchcock film because the thrills and chills throughout the entire film including the performances by Jimmy Stewart, Grace Kelly,Wendell Corey,and Raymond Burr.The film has a great storyline to it, in my opinion i think that this is Hitchcock's best film ever because it has a lot of thrills that you won't even know what even happens next, a shattering climax,and a great direction by Alfred Hitchcock. Jimmy Stewart gives the best performance of his career as an actor.And also this is one of the best movies of 1954,and when i first watched this movie it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish, Director Alfred Hitchcock really knew what he did behind the camera while he was shooting this timeless classic.",10,0,3,15 February 2014
Munich," A Monumental Achievement
","I totally loved this movie not only because it was directed by my all time favorite director Steven Spielberg, The reason why i loved this movie is because the movie explains the story of these men who are hired to kill the people responsible for the Black September terrorist attacks at the 1972 Munich Olympics, Director Steven Spielberg completely knows what he is doing behind the camera. Curse those jerks at the academy because Spielberg didn't win the Oscar for best director because he totally deserved it. Munich also deserved to win best picture at that ceremony, the movie also has a very vengeful plot to it. The movie features great performances from the entire cast including Eric Bana,Daniel Craig, Geoffrey Rush,Ciaran Hinds,and Michael Lonsdale.Those of you who didn't watch this masterpiece watch it, but kids i think tat you should wait until you get a little older in order to watch it by yourself.",10,1,2,15 February 2014
Casino," One of Scorsese's finest crime dramas
","Martin Scorsese is without a doubt one of the finest individuals to ever sit behind a movie camera having directed great films like 'Raging Bull', 'The Departed', 'Goodfellas', 'Gangs of New York', 'Hugo', and 'The Aviator' this movie is a welcomed addition to that already masterful resume for me. This movie is the ninth collaboration between Scorsese and his right hand man Robert De Niro and so far it's their most recent until their upcoming Netflix film 'The Irishman' comes out later this year. De Niro stars as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein who owns a casino in Las Vegas called the 'Tangiers' and happens to be based on Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal who started out as a sports better in Chicago and the mob decides that he would be a potential asset to their income and decides to send him to Vegas to run a casino. Rothstein then moves down to Vegas to run the place and not long after his best friend Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) along with his brother Dominic (Philip Suriano), and his associate Frankie Marino (Frank Vincent) are sent by the mob bosses to make sure everything in the place runs smoothly. Rothstein's trusted manager is an older guy named Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) who at his side at all times during working hours and also watches everything that goes on and makes sure nobody does anything wrong. Then one day while the casino is in operation Rothstein sees a blond haired woman who he instantly falls in love with named Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) who is a hustler and former prostitute who has a pimp friend named Lester Diamond (James Woods) who she has known since they were kids and sometimes presents obstacles in her marriage to Rothstein. The movie's story is more than just the rise and fall of a mob family but also the downfall of one man's life, relationships, and wealth. Scorsese is a director who pays an immense attention to every little detail in his movies which makes it feel like you are there in the movie with his characters going through certain things in their lives, and in this case presents the excess that the characters live in perfectly proving that money can't make your life happy no matter how much you may have, and there are dire consequences with messing with a mobster's trust. This is one of the most violent gangster movies I've ever seen. Scorsese's direction is always in top form especially with this movie and his screenplay that he co-wrote with Nicholas Pileggi (who also co-wrote the screenplay for 'Goodfellas' as well as the books that both films are based on.) Robert Richardson's cinematography is excellent same with the editor by Scorsese's longtime editor Thelma Schoonmaker. The acting is also superb especially by Stone who nabbed an Oscar nomination for best actress who managed to get the movie its only nomination. But however my only problem with the movie is that it seemed a little bit on the long side for me which makes it seem a bit drawn out and at the same time is justified due to Scorsese's fast pacing and deep focus into Rothstein's personal life, and as a result is one of the best inside stories about a gangster I've ever seen along with 'The Godfather' series, 'Scarface', and 'Goodfellas'. The movie is one of the best of its kind and is a near masterpiece.",9,0,1,23 May 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The best movie of 1977
","George Lucas' 1977 science fiction epic Star Wars was a great film that I consider to be a masterpiece that is also one of the best movies ever made. The movie tells the story about Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill) who joins forces with the Jedi, a cocky pilot, and a wookie to help save the world. This was a groundbreaking achievement for it's time and it still is. Writer- director George Lucas really knows science fiction just like a few other directors like Steven Spielberg, Ridley Scott, and James Cameron, and Stanley Kubrick who crafted masterpieces like Alien, E.T., Avatar, and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Lucas uses a great cast for this movie besides Hamill which includes Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing, David Prowse, and Alec Guinness. Not only that but it was a film that deserved all of the Oscars that it was nominated including Best picture and best director for Lucas.",10,0,6,3 July 2014
Apollo 13," Brilliantly Executed
","Ron Howard's Apollo 13 tells the riveting true story about how the Apollo 13 space mission happened. This movie has an excellent ensemble cast which includes Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise,and the great Ed Harris. Not only the movie was historically accurate but it was a riveting race against time as well. Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances of his career along with the Oscar level work from the cast members who starred alongside Hanks. Tom Hanks plays Jim Lovell perfectly (as what he does with the other characters he plays.). The movie has not only great actors but it also has excellent cinematography, art direction, costume design, and it also has excellent writing. Director Ron Howard can make i history movie look so realistic as he tries to make his actors go in depth with their characters. Composer, conductor James Horner scores his music at just the right moment at the right time. This is a true must see for all movie lovers.",10,0,0,29 March 2014
Gangs of New York," A Monumental Achievement
","This movie was a landmark epic for a first motion picture that Leonardo DiCaprio did for Director Martin Scorsese. Also for this movie 'Man what a terrific cast Leonardo DiCaprio,Daniel- Day Lewis,Cameron Diaz,John C. Reilly, and the great Liam Neeson (who has a small part in the beginning of the entire film). I truly think that the director to this movie Martin Scorsese should have won the 2002 Oscar for best director because he made this movie one of 2002's best films. The Movie has great performances, great cinematography, and a very vengeful plot as well. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career as an actor, and Cameron Diaz also gives the best performances of her career as well. If you really want to see this movie but for some reason you did not get I would personally recommend this film for you to watch, but it is not a film for the whole family to watch. But in order to watch it with your family you would have to wait until your children get a little older in order for them to watch it with their parents.",10,0,0,16 February 2014
Braveheart," A Masterpiece
","Mel Gibson's Braveheart is a powerful historical epic that tells the story of a man named William Wallace and how he fought for the freedom of Scotland. The movie stars Mel Gibson as Wallace a man who was devoted to his country's natural rights. Director and star Mel Gibson really knows the history behind how Scotland got their independence from England, this movie has a similar story to Gandhi by Richard Attenborough in which both of those films had only one thing in common both Scotland and India wanted independence from England but in different centuries. What Mel Gibson tries to teach us from this film is how much of a hero that William Wallace was in real life at the time he was alive. Also the musical score by James Horner was just plain perfect for the movie itself. Also the movie compares to epic historical masterpieces like Schindler's List, Lincoln,Gandhi,Saving Private Ryan, The Great Escape, and many more.A Definite A+",10,9,15,26 April 2014
The Social Network," One of the Best movies of 2010
","David Fincher's The Social Network tells the very interesting story of how the popular website Facebook was created by the youngest billionaire in the world Mark Zuckerberg. The movie stars Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg who was perfectly cast as his character for the film.Although the movie was not only historically accurate I thought of it as Jesse Eisenberg's best performance yet. Director David Fincher really knows where his facts came from for the movie, and the screenplay by the great Aaron Sorkin is what I call very good as always. Thee movie also has great supporting work from the new Spider-Man actor Andrew Garfield, and current music success Justin Timberlake. This is the best movie that tells the story of the newest computer billionaire since Bill Gates who is currently the richest man in the world.",10,1,1,24 May 2014
The Pursuit of Happyness," An inspirational achievement
","Wow this is one of my favorite movies of all time because it tells the true story of a homeless man named Chris Gardner (played by Will Smith) who tries to become a banker so he can have a job and not be homeless any longer. Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to execute an an inspiring story that deserved to be put on the big screen. Also Will Smith gives the best performance of his career for his brilliant work in the movie.In which it has a great supporting cast such as his son Jaden Smith,and Thandie Newton (who plays as Smith's overworked wife in which they end up getting divorced).I truly think that Will Smith really deserved an Oscar nomination for his brilliant work (as he does in his other movies.). Also the movie is historically accurate in which the movie compares to such inspiring stories such as Remember the Titans,Rocky,Malcolm X etc. This is a perfect movie for the whole family to watch but put aside the language and it's PG-13 rating and just appreciate the movie for what it is a true monumental masterpiece.",10,1,2,26 March 2014
Back to the Future," Zemeckis' best film since Forrest Gump
","Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future is a very entertaining science fiction film of which is also pretty funny at times as well. The movie stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly a teenager who was sent 3 decades back into the past all the way from present day 1985 to early November 1955 in a vehicle that runs on plutonium that was invented by his friend Dr. Emmett Brown (played by Christopher Lloyd). But when he travels back in time and visits his mother's house at the time he was young he has a huge problem which is that his teenage mother is in love with him instead of his future father. Zemeckis really knows good visual effects, a film i consider the best science fiction movie from the 1980's sine executive producer Steven Spielberg's 1982 classic E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Not only that this works as a science fiction classic, it also works as a comedic family adventure. This movie is a huge sci-fi entertainment for the whole family to see.",10,1,1,11 July 2014
Goodfellas," The Best movie of 1990
","Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas is an epic historical mob film which is similar to Bugsy, and American Gangster. The movie tells the story of how Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta) and his mob friends Jim Conway (played by Robert De Niro), Tommy De Vito (played by Joe Pesci), and Paul Cicero (played by Paul Sorvino), ended up working their way up through the mob hierarchy. What Martin Scorsese tries to show not only how the mob underworld, but he also tries to show us how brutal the mob can really be against their own crime family members. Also without question Martin Scorsese is one of the world's greatest film directors, thanks to great movies like Gangs of New York, The Aviator, and his Oscar wining turn for The Departed. Both Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta give the best performances of their careers in Scorsese's well done mob picture. And another thing Scorsese tries to show us in this movie is the conflicts between Henry and his wife Karen (played perfectly by Lorraine Bracco). This was a mob movie achievement and of what I thought was an absolutely great movie.",10,0,1,17 May 2014
The Great Gatsby," Decent, but not good or great
","The reason why I say that Baz Luhrmann's adaptation is terribly overrated is because this movie is supposed to be based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel but the movie doesn't stay true to the book more than book to film adaptations normally do even though I am not normally a person to criticize a movie because of those factors, though I won't give anything major to this film away in this review. This time around the movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jay Gatsby who is a well known businessman and is one of the richest if not the richest person where he lives. There are a lot of key major differences between this movie and the Robert Redford version that was made 39 years earlier. This movie also depicts Gatsby as a man who has parties in a modern fashion but another key problem I had with this movie is also that it didn't completely stay true to the period in which the story was supposed to be set in.Also this movie despite having such a good cast the movie is horribly over-acted, and the only thing I liked about the film was the production design and the costumes.Also in this movie are the accurate characters such as Daisy (Carey Mulligan),Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton),George Wilson (Jason Clarke) and his wife Myrtle (Isla Fisher), as well as Gatsby's good friend that he met in the beginning of the movie Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire).However there are some things that director Baz Luhrmann actually got right, such as the love affair between Gatsby and Daisy, the 'old sport' exchange between Gatsby and Tom, and many other scenes.In the end I didn't like or dislike this movie but even though the movie deserved the two Oscars that it won three years ago. I happen to think that if it stayed true to the period, and wasn't over-acted, that it could have been a better movie (even though it was good) with a hell of a lot better storytelling it was an OK movie even though I do agree with what Roger Ebert once said about accuracy in movies to Gene Siskel in which he said that 'A movie doesn't have to be accurate in order to be good.'",6,0,0,20 February 2017
Cinderella Man," An extraordinary and triumphant masterpiece
","Cinderella Man is the film that i consider to be Ron Howard's best work since that of A Beautiful Mind, 2 film starring Russell Crowe with him giving 2 masterful performances. The movie tells the inspiring and emotionally moving story of James Braddock (played by Russell Crowe) a washed up boxer whose family became poor at the time of the great depression and tried so hard to make his family rich again. Ron Howard does it again but not only with his 2 film collaborations with Russell Crowe but making extraordinary films out of them both. This is a boxing movie that hasn't inspired me as much both Rocky, and Million Dollar Baby inspired me.Also not only Crowe gives an excellent performance but and besides Renee Zelweger as his wife, but is Paul Giamatti's great supporting performance that made the film even more inspiring. This is a film that should have been on all film critics lists as one off 2005's greatest films.",10,0,0,8 July 2014

Also this movie is on my list for the best movies of 2008, in which the movie has a vengeful plot to attempt to assassinate the German president at the time Adolf Hitler. The movie is also 100% accurate for a history picture. Valkyrie is a total must for those of you who haven't seen this critically acclaimed movie achievement in all of movie history.",10,1,1,15 February 2014
The Martian," An entertaining thrill ride from start to finish
","Ridley Scott is without a doubt one of the finest film directors of the last 45 years and in that time he directed great movies such as 'Gladiator' (2000), 'Alien' (1979), 'American Gangster' (2007), and 'Black Hawk Down' (2001), and with 'The Martian' he has not only added another great film to that elite resume he has also directed one of the finest science fiction movies of the decade. The movie is based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name (which I did not read prior to seeing this movie) and stars Matt Damon in one of the finest performances of his career as Mark Watney who is on a mission to Mars with Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) who is in charge of the mission, Major Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) the mission's pilot, Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara) the mission's systems operator, and Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) who is a surgeon on the mission. At first everything seems fine on Mars but goes horribly wrong in an instant when a dust storm forces the crew to evacuate and in the process leaves Watney behind after not being able to find him. After Watney finds himself left on Mars he has to resort to his wits in order to survive on Mars for as long as he possibly can until help arrives while also try to figure out a way to tell NASA that he is still alive and well. The movie is not only one of the best sci-fi adventures this decade has to offer but it ranks with '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968) and 'Apollo 13' (1995) as one of the greatest movies about space exploration ever put on film. The movie features excellent performances throughout especially from an excellent supporting cast which includes Jeff Daniels as the president of NASA, Chiwetel Ejiofor who plays the man in charge of all of the missions to the red planet, and Sean Bean who plays the flight director for NASA. Scott's direction is on point and Drew Goddard's screenplay places tension at all the right moments to the point where you are actually there with them in this uncomfortable situation. This a very entertaining movie that has some very pulse pounding moments that is sure to be remembered for years to come, and put simply is a must see film.",10,3,4,10 May 2019
The Godfather," Arguably the greatest of all mob films
","Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made because to me it was a pitch perfect mafia film that definitely compares to the greatness of Scorsese's GoodFellas (1990), and Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967) but so much better than those two great films put together. The best summary for this film would be about an aging mob boss named Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in an Oscar winning performance) who in a few years time is going to retire from his position as Godfather and pass the Corleone family leadership to his reluctant war hero son Michael (played by Al Pacino in a performance that should have won him the Oscar as 1972s best supporting actor). Besides GoodFellas and Bonnie and Clyde having the most obvious thing in common with this film is that all three films talk about the mob, and the second thing that all three films have in common is that they give people who watch them how ruthless the mob can be in real life. Though I didn't read the Mario Puzo novel I understood this film perfectly thanks to all the perfectly acted performances by Brando and Pacino, but as well as Robert Duvall as the family lawyer Tom Hagen, James Caan as Sonny, as well as John Cazale as Fredo. Coppola's film not only depicts how ruthless the mob can be in some instances but also how violent the mob can be as well as those were the perfect requirements for movies like this. The one thing I really disagreed with most with the 45th Oscar ceremony is why Marlon Brando rejected his 2nd academy award for lead acting when in this movie he gave the best performance of his entire since A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront (1954), and as to why Francis Ford Coppola didn't win the Academy Award for best director when I really do think he deserved it. But in the end this film is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish.",10,6,9,16 January 2015
