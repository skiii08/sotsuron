Scarface," More like a cartoon
","Watching this movie is just a guilty pleasure as it's so ridiculous yet fun. But as a movie it's more like a cartoon like a good drama. Everything is so over the top it makes me laugh. from Al's accent to the story line and even the shootouts.
To be rated as high as it is seems absurd. The best thing about Scarface was it's poster.",5,1,3,14 February 2020
The Hangover," Are You kidding me ?
","I think my sense of humor is pretty wide based. I loved 'Animal House' while I also enjoy subtle less sight-gag humor too. I can laugh at the Three Stooges and well as appreciate a Woody Allen comic view of life.There was absolutely nothing unique about 'Hangover'. The whole bachelor party gone bad has be done before and better, as well as the whole 'what happens in Vegas stays' movies.I had about 3 or 4 good laughs but found the movie forgettable and at times predictable. After trying to be so different, the ending was a total cop-out and simply done by the numbers. To see this movie in the TOP rated 250 films here is the biggest laugh this movie actually gave me.",3,8,24,10 June 2009
Minority Report," A great SciFi thriller
","Seen some comments here referring to Spielberg as a mediocre Director. Well there was an intelligent comment. Hopefully that person will use the same ID every time so I can be sure to read all of his enlightening insites. Yeah right. On just about everyone's top 100 films of all time, Spielberg has more films there than any director who ever lived. Enough said on that.. Minority Report was a fascinating Sci-Fi thriller that was well acted, well directed and visually a treat. Tom Cruise can get the most out of any character he portrays on the screen. Thats all anyone can ask. His intensity and energy level is always relentless. The story is very thought provoking yet not too complex. Preventing a crime before it actually happens ... (sigh) if only we really could..",Null,0,1,19 November 2004
Wind River," Excellent thriller
",Beautifully captured to film and a great slow burn story with good acting and great directing.It was some of the best acting I've seen Jeremy and Elizabeth do so far...all the actors nailed their roles. And I'm glad it was not another unrealistic Hollywood film where the leads just have to fall in love just because it thinks it has to. They avoided that clichÃ© by giving them realistic dialog.I look forward to seeing more from the director.,9,2,5,30 September 2017
Star Trek," I made my decision...
","Which would you rather see, another crappy film that tries to stick to all the old Star Trek facts or an excellent new film that breathes new life into the what was becoming a worn-out series..With the exception of Wrath of Khan, I found all the Star Trek movies mainly dull, tedious and forgettable. And this coming from a longtime fan of the 60's series...The new Star Trek movie was exciting, stimulating and just plain fun. I really believed these were the younger versions of the Star Trek crew that I enjoyed as a kid.. It did not try to lecture us, or remind us of anything, it just tried to be entertaining. And to me it absolutely did so. I'm sure a second film will be in the works if this one is a success. And I think it will be. So here's my hand raised for someone looking for it..",9,5,14,10 May 2009
Argo," Excellent Movie
","As someone who followed the events of the Iran hostage crisis on a daily basis, this movie brought back all the emotions I felt back then. The tension, anger, frustration and the eventually emotional relief were all presented right there on the screen. Ben Affleck did a fantastic job with the direction and all the actors gave excellent portrayals. With a special nod to both Ben and Bryan Cranston for their roles.While I know some dramatic artistic license was taken on exactly how some scenarios played out, the essence of that event was kept together in a gritty suspenseful cinema experience. It's a movie I will definitely buy on DVD.",9,0,1,27 October 2012
The Irishman," Sadly over-rated
","Everyone seems to be so overjoyed seeing the paring of the BIG THREE together, they overlook just how boring, tedious and uninteresting this film becomes over it's 3 1/2 span... If it had stayed more focus on the Hoffa/Kennedy saga it might have been more tolerable. But of all the characters in the film. Robert De Niro's portrayal of Mr Sheehan is a snooze fest... He seemed to be sleepwalking. The constant facial CGI didn't help..
Love most of Marty's films, but this goes near the bottom for me..",4,7,18,28 November 2019
Orphan," A mixed bag...
","Right off let me say that Isabelle did a fantastic performance with her role as Esther. She has a lot of depth for someone so young. All the actors did a commendable job with the material they had.My problems were with the script and directing/production. I read others say the movie had the guts to go in a direction uncharted. While I thought the so-called 'surprise' was novel, they seemed to have done a cop-out at every opportunity they could to avoid any controversy.If you removed the few bloody scenes, it was nothing more than a Lifetime Channel movie about a family needing counseling. Nothing after the surprise has not been done before and done better.Their decision to make the final scenes in such dark settings was contrived, frustrating and deliberate. It was actually hard to see and follow what was even happening at the theater I attended !! It's difficult to go into details as I do not want to give any spoilers here, I'll reserve that for the Forum board. Parts were fun,, parts were frustrating and the sum was disappointing..",5,2,7,28 July 2009
Zodiac," Great script, great acting and great music.
","Having grown up in the 60's and 70's, I do recall the Zodiac story. This movie creates in great detail the events of that notorious time. The acting in the film is top notch. While some have noted it's long in length, it does seem to fly by if you are engrossed as I was. I also wanted to commend the producers on their music selection. From tunes by Three Dog Night to early Santana , it definitely added to the atmosphere of that era. If you love a good mystery, a good police drama or just want to learn a little history of the Zodiac, I do highly recommend it..I bought the DVD., I only do that on 9 and 10's.. :)",9,0,1,7 August 2008
We Are Marshall," The emphasis was wrong...
","Based on a true story of a very tragic event, I felt the emphasis was poorly placed on the new coach hiring and not enough on the school,coach,players and family of those who died. For me the best way to have ended this film was shown like 20 minutes into it, when the school was chanting outside that school president and board of directors meeting. After that it lost focus and emotion.Thoughts and prayers are still there though for those who were effected by that day..",4,1,2,14 November 2017
Interstellar," Good not great !!!!!
","Gee, another recent SciFi/Superhero movie that fanboys think is the greatest movie ever made. LOL, if nothing else they are consistent.It is a 'good' movie with some great visuals. the storyline though is a smörgåsbord of everything scientific. They threw in everything, even if they are unproven theories, They used, time travel, black hole travel, alternate universe and frozen hibernation, and topped it off with a underlying human story that Lifetime network would love.Despite all that, it was entertaining, although I hated Matt Damon's character, it was over the top.Nice to see on a Big screen with popcorn, again a good movie, not great.",7,0,2,17 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Only good thing about this trilogy was the Trailers...
","It made tons of money yes,, but for me I wished there was only the original trilogy started in 1977 and it all ended with Empire Strikes Back.. the following 6 films afterwards were completes messes... Everyone gets excited about the trailers then gets let down as there was NOTHING new, just rehashing the original concept over and over and over again.. They had no idea how to handle Hans, Luke and Leah coming back other then to kill off and/or minimize them.. It was a slap in the face to the original movie goers in the 1970's who helped launch the series.. thanks for making our heroes 'ghosts'...",2,43,74,28 December 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Man pumped with steroids is our real hero ?
","Okay, it's just a fantasy superhero film, and while you can just put your mind on numb and enjoy it, I hated the whole premise. So while other soldiers in the film give their lives to servicing their country, and men of science create wonders never before seen, who gets all the adoration and hero status, why the it's the good looking guy who's pumped up with steroids of course. Can't get more American and Hollywood than that. While we do shower our Sports athletes and actors with untold riches, the rest of us struggle along everyday just to make ends meet and I need to pay for a movie to remind me of that ? hahaThe acting was at best just average, the storyline was your typical good vs evil, nothing we haven't seen before. Some nice action scenes and of course the inevitable setup for the sequel.",6,17,38,27 July 2011
The Thing," Good but still prefer the original..
","The original 1951 version while dated has always remained one of my favorites. That movie approached it as more of a science fiction story than the horror movie that John Carpenter made.. While this 1982 version was not the exact same storyline, it took the premise of what the original offered then ran with it.. If you go back and look at the original what made it really stand out was the crisp and intelligent dialog that went on though out the movie.. The 1982 version seemed more like a bunch of cowboys on ice rather than intelligent beings and scientists battling a being from another world. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it but for me visual scares do not put fear into me as much as that of an unknown terror approaching. Carpenter's version had the visuals but for me lacked suspense and intelligence.",6,4,5,2 November 2013
Collateral," Excellent Film with a ridiculous ending
",Loved 99% of the film... One of Tom Cruise's best performance ever. It had a such an intense tight feel throughout and was directed and filmed with great care.. My only complaint and it's a big one was that ridiculous ending. To think that a cabbie who could barely hold the gun would somehow win a shootout barely ten feet away from a professional hitman was pure nonsense. Not to mention it destroyed any chance of Tom recurring that role for future films. It was great for that first watch but knowing the ending I've never watched it a second time.,8,1,3,7 April 2020
The Conjuring 2," Contrived offering in a worn out genre..
","Every other week someone is putting out another film on the over blown self righteous genre of the paranormal haunted house scenario. It's one of the few areas of 'horror' movie lore that seems many customers go into the theater with the assumption that such things actually exist. I want to almost vomit every time I read the promo of such nonsense that says based on a true story.. a true story ??? Why, because some mentally disturbed person said it happened. No proof mind you. LOL Unbelievable!!!This entry was weaker than the first Conjuring. The old sudden loud music and sudden thump routine to get you to jump was needed as most of the scares were weaker. I'm sure though if it makes enough money there will be another sequel, and another after that. Until lazy Hollywood has sucked enough money out of it.Best horror movies these days are definitely not coming out of Hollywood.",4,0,6,13 June 2016
Independence Day," Just great fun...
","Seen a lot of ridiculous comments made about the film... Some want to be political, some want to be just the immature morons they are.. Anyone who couldn't get popcorn and a soda , sit down in a movie house and not be blown away by the visuals and entertained by this story just doesn't have a pulse. It's called having 'fun' gang.. I feel sorry for those of you that seem to have none. I rank it up there with Armageddon as the best fun and most exciting Sci-fi adventures ever put to film.. There are some great 'serious' sci-fi movies but I consider that another genre. The 90's were a great decade for Blockbusters and this was one of the best.",6,1,3,25 April 2007
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," One great scene then boring
","Okay, the scene of walking on the skyscraper was excellent but that alone is not going to make this movie rise much above mediocrity. It doesn't have the flair of Bond movies nor even the intensity of the Borne films. The script was thin and action scenes ( with exception of the skyscraper scene) were been there, seen that. The first of Mission Impossible movies starring Cruise was excellent, they have been going downhill since then. While some may think this will help rescue Tom's career from the drought it's been in, I just see it as another missed opportunity. Besides for me the mission impossible scenario should be more focused on a group rather than an individual, like the original series. It's not a terrible film, good for a popcorn night, but very forgettable. I guess I just expect more from this series.",6,2,11,19 December 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Good,,but far fro great..
","It was a fun okay summer movie but it no way compares to some of the bygone great summer films of yesteryear...The Computer generated monkeys were okay except it made Caesar look a little too unreal. His facial features were unlike any chimp I ever seen at a zoo or in a documentary. The other primates looked better.The storyline was okay but it all seemed very rushed. They wanted to make mankind look so cynical and mean , even the one good guy was oblivious and uncaring in some of his actions, it was as if the movie's intention was hey, we actually deserve to be eliminated. Since we all know it's sort of a prequel to the famous first Planet of the Apes film from the 60's, there was very little suspense to it. There still however is a big gap between where this movie ends and where that one begins so there might be a second prequel ? LOL",Null,1,5,6 August 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The Emperor with No Clothes
","It reminds me of that old fable. People go to see Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in a film by Tarantino and assume it has to be great despite what they are actually seeing on the screen.. The film is incredibly slow paced and neither funny nor suspenseful. Throwing in a 5 minute fantasy violent scene at the end after over two hours of boredom did NOT make me change my mind..
Sadly disappointing to this fan of most Tarantino films.",3,2764,4295,27 July 2019
Amadeus," Great Motion Picture
","A beautiful story, great direction,,great acting and great visuals.. To me thats what makes a great movie... To all those who seem to think more about History than movie making, why are you even here and not grading 5th grade history exams somewhere else. To say that anyone knows 'exactly' what happened hundreds of years ago is totally absurd. Recording history in those days was just one man's opinion given to another given to another etc.. So stop the pompous approach just because you remembered something you read in some current history book and enjoy true movie magic..!!! It remains one of my top 10 and I never see it falling out.",9,2,6,3 July 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Good but could of been better
","I enjoyed seeing the movie and it definitely had moments of near greatness.Unlike trying to stretch the point today, this was truly a time in our history that challenged the very core of constitutional rights of individuals. While Senator McCarthy didn't invent the fear they lived in , he truly used it for his own obsessive agenda.Where the movie lacked being a top film was how it strayed all too often from what we all wanted to see and know. That silly hidden love-affair and relationship going on in the office took precious time away from trying to comprehend this historical time. Why the writers and director chose this approach is very puzzling.I still recommend the film but not with enthusiasm. Reading a good historical book on Murrow vs McCarthy , and how it all came about, would give you better insight than the film did.",6,1,2,30 June 2006
Caddyshack," Very Over Rated
","Okay, I'm not going to trash the movie but for so long this movie has been so ridiculously over-rated I just had to comment. To me they took what could of been a just a fun Saturday Night Live skit and stretched and stretched until they had a feature film.. Bill Murray ( of whom I'm a fan ) has been much better in other movies and so has Rodney Dangerfield for that matter. There's a few good laughs but the majority of comedy skits in it are both slow and extremely predictable. Maybe it was golfers that pushed it over the top . I don't know if its losing some of its reputation with each passing year, but for me it wasn't that great the year it was released.",5,6,18,9 February 2007
The Dark Knight," Very good but ..
","Okay,, It was a very good movie.. but the current 9.7 rating I see and the way some people are shouting 'the greatest movie of all time' is just so ridiculous.. Yes ,It was action packed, with good acting but the storyline was almost too simplistic and it was about 30 minutes too long. The ending tended to really drag out some. The storyline moved along so fast in the beginning that it seemed more like it all happened in real time instead of an epic approach like Batman Begins. Heath's Joker was a memorable character though and I do see him getting at least a supporting actor nomination. In the end it was just an enjoyable blockbuster . I had fun, ate lots of popcorn but by the time I got home it was over. I didn't come home thinking about it, analyzing it, sleeping on it as I have done with numerous great films I have seen. Why some people want to insult some of those greatest movies ever made with their 'latest and greatest' attitude about this film is just beyond me.",6,1,8,20 July 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Drag me to this movie
","As that is the only way I would see it again. Boring, predictable and disappointing are the first things that come to mind.Is it suppose to be a comedy with horror overtones or a horror movie with comedy ? In either case it comes up way short in each. The way the initial car attack scene ended told me all I needed to know about this sad movie. The old lady has a chance to finish her off then and there but nooooooooo.., that would make too much sense. It's one thing to suspend belief at a movie, it's another to suspend your intelligence. The few scares are phoned in ahead of time and the predictable ending (not matter what,horror always survives or wins)just makes me shake my fist at the writing. If you're 13 ( the target audience in my opinion) or never seen any good horror films you may enjoy some of it, but I give it a BIG thumb down and I'm now moving on...",2,21,48,2 June 2009
Titanic," Should be in the Top 10 All-Time.
","Because IMDb has too many fanboys who think Batman should be the top rated film of all-time, movies like Titantic will never succeed here. Great storytelling, a historical background, good acting, excellent directing, great special effects and a beautiful soundtrack.. Titantic won all those Oscars and is the highest grossing film of all-time. I don't think anyone involved with it will lose any sleep on how it's rated at this site. I loved it when it came out and still watch it a lot.. It's the type of film that makes being a movie fan a joy. It's film making at it's best and no moron trying to put it down will ever change that.",10,6,15,28 September 2008
The Departed," Good but it's being over-rated
","Okay, yes, it's a good movie. Interesting script, loaded with good actors and nicely directed. But I read one reviewers remarks that said to forget 'Goodfellows' and 'Raging Bull' as this is Martin's finest work. To him I say 2 things (1) put down the pipe (2) step away from the keyboard. Goodfellows is still the definitive Mob movie ( The Godfather being the definitive Mafia film ) and there is no movie ever made that rivals the visual style that Raging Bull brought to the screen. To me The Departed is a movie about corruption. I never felt any sense of organized crime ,it was more like organized chaos. Characters are never developed or made memorable , thats all sacrificed to make more room for showing how intense the movie is suppose to be. Maybe because 2006 was such a lackluster year this will get more praise than its due. I enjoyed it for what it offered and will leave it at that. I think Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon were fine but it was Leonardo DiCaprio that gave the best performance. Since Martin Scorsese has never won an Oscar for Best Director he will probably be given the lead to win it come next Spring. Even though I see nothing here that he hasn't done better in other films.. Once again, its good,,just not as good as it's being touted..",3,7,13,18 October 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," Excellent film
","I see many people outside of the USA, giving the movie low marks. From the reasons most give they are not rating the film, just their attitudes about the subject matter. This film was about the long intense search for Bin Laden, the frustration in finding him and then finally the mission to get him. To portray it any other way would of been Hollywood nonsense. The actors all gave intense portrayals of their characters, especially Jessica. Her character represented the long emotional endurance of the entire undertaking. It was well filmed,,well acted, and well directed. Was well deserving of Oscar considerations.",9,0,1,4 February 2014
Kong: Skull Island," Disappointing
","The movie felt so uninspired. Compared to other Kong films, he had zero personality in this film. Other than being huge, Kong actually seemed bored. The 2005 film, of which I was not that crazy about, at least it made Kong feel alive and interesting...This storyline was very minimal. Other than the old WW II pilot, everyone seemed rigid or stereotyped . And none of them actually showed much awe with what they have encountered. Like one pilot almost joked, ' is that a big monkey ?' Really ? They seemed so hung up on CGI that they overlook creating a good story. King Kong vs Godzilla won't have one either, I'm sure of that now. Shame..",4,4,7,16 September 2017
Arrival," Good acting but with cliché writing.
","Do we need to have Alien spaceships land around the globe to know that we have major problems to contend with here on earth ? The fact that so many countries do not trust one another is not science fiction, it's a reality of which we're already painfully aware. And if the answers to overcoming this dilemma is dependent on some giant ET coming to earth and reading out thoughts, then I say we're in big trouble.The film was more about the internal struggles inside Amy Adams character than it was about our first encounter with alien lifeforms. As usual Hollywood ran with the same old formula that 99% of these type of films always do. Politicians play their games, Scientists want to investigate but the Military wants to blow things up. Not to mention the same treatment that somehow an alien life form, with all their incredible technology and capable of traveling light years, doesn't even know the concept of communication. Really ??Acting was good though but it was still an underwhelming view.",5,2,9,18 November 2016
Prometheus," I just don't get it...
","While I found the movie to be somewhat entertaining, I still shake my head on the mentality of the entire script. Is that what the future of scientific technology amounts to ? Lets spend a trillion dollars to send mostly nitwits and a robot across galaxies to represent us.. ? At no time did I feel anyone was really intelligent. They seemed to all have their own agendas. No one was there to actually represent Earth .. LOL With that said, it wasn't a total waste of time. Just an average sci-fi movie that was suppose to be a prequel to the original movie Alien.Not sure why it even has a high rating. Guess given the crap movies being thrown out these days it's expected though.",5,9,14,15 June 2012
Vanilla Sky," Beautiful and Thrilling
","Vanilla Sky remains one of my favorite films. It took me on a ride and journey unlike any film I have ever watched. From the opening scene of a deserted Times Square ,right to the twists and turns of the ending. Tom Cruise was perfect in his role of David. He brought an energy and intensity that few actors can transmit through the screen.. The supporting cast was also great..Cameron and Penelope were both beautiful and convincing, but I especially thought Kurt Russell's performance was the best acting he has ever did.., was nice to see him in a non-action film for a change. When you combine the best elements of a Mystery, Drama, Thriller and Sci-Fi in one film, add good Directing and great visuals to go with the excellent acting out of a great story,, well you simply can't go wrong.. It did 'Open My Eyes'",10,0,3,3 December 2004
The Dark Knight Rises," Ridiculous rating
","Every time a good superhero movie is made ,fanatic fanboys have to rush to IMDb to declare it as the 'Greatest Movie Ever Made' LOL,, I do give them credit for a least being consistent. With that said, it was a good movie but should not even be in any top 100. Yes, the storyline was far fetched for real life but hey, it's the norm for a sci-fi thriller action movie. Villain wants to destroy stuff,, hero must stop him. It was well acted, and the action, while not ground breaking was shot very well. While Anne Hathaway is great to look at, and done an okay job , I felt you could of totally removed her character from the entire film and it would not have made any difference . It was almost like her role was just filler material. In the end to me it's just a fun summer movie to get lost in,,but not to put on a pedestal...",6,28,59,28 July 2012
Mother!," Self Indulgent disappointment ..
","It's just a pretentious main stream approach to putting a female thru torture and horror for no reason and with no happy ending, like so many B movies accomplish on a regular basis these days.. Jennifer's character really has no chance, no choices and only has a personality of just another on screen screaming damsel in distress. Regardless of what anyone says, it's just a Rosemary's Baby clone, just with a different finale that suppose to make the audience believe otherwise. All the secrecy leading up to it's debut was just to hide the fact it was always just that.I'm sure it'll get high marks from those who enjoy films with supposedly no boundaries etc,, but just because it can, doesn't make it good.. It just becomes 'Oh look at what we can do', with little meaning other that to give a quick silly shock effect..",2,346,670,9 September 2017
Midway," Rather watch a good documentary on Midway
","While impressed with some of the CGI visuals, the overall storytelling of this event in history just felt too Hollywood. The scope of what laid before them and the true bravery of the men who fought that day seemed lost in all the visuals.
The importance of how the intelligence gathering before the fighting was handled initially, then eventually was also poorly presented. They are some excellent documentaries on Midway, suggest you track them down..",4,32,50,12 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Was fun but terrible script... !!!
","Seriously,,, can we stop already with the Father and Son scenarios !!!!!! Yes, it was fun to re-visit old friends from the 70's trilogy and I enjoyed a lot of what it had to offer.. But that silly overdone plot has worn out its welcome..And it was just mean spirited to kill off someone that could of just rode ( well flew) off into the sunset. The newest heroes are likable but do not come close to the characters we first saw in the first Star Wars film in 1977. Not sure what the sequel will offer but I can guarantee it won't have the reception this one did.. I just hope when it all ends, it can do so with some flair so it can at least hold up over time.. Never thought I would look more forward to the next Star Trek movie than the next Star Wars movie... hehe",5,16,20,19 January 2016
Looper," Going back in time is just pure nonsense.
","I do enjoy intelligent Sci-fi movies. And I do believe that some type of suspended animation so that someone could exist into a future time that a normal lifespan would not allow could someday be feasible. But in doing so you would no longer exist from the time you left until the time you appear in the future. You would simply be a 'missing person'But somehow to be able to go 'back' in time is just pure gibberish nonsense and whimsical silliness, not good science fiction. And then somehow to be able to interact with a flesh and blood version of yourself at an earlier age when you do go back, only adds to ridiculousness of the scenario. You would NEVER EVER be able to interact with yourself in the same world, it would have to be in some alternate universe in which basically you never even existed in to begin with. The acting was very good in Looper. The script however was all over the place. One minute trying to be intelligent and in the next moment just a pure action film. I fully expected the Bruce Willis character to start quoting Die Hard lines as he blasted everyone in sight. The movie is totally over rated to me. I actually found it more laughable than suspenseful.",4,0,3,5 August 2016
Life," Horror vs Science Fiction
","If you just want to approach the film as pure horror then you can stop trying to analyze it so much and just go with the suspense and scares. It's well acted and has a good build up and can be a fun ride. The problems start to occur if you view it as sci-fi and take on a more realistic approach as to what would be the protocol if an event like it really did happen. The sheer fact that they wanted to even initially create an environment that would allow it to grow does seem both implausible and reckless. Also why is it that Hollywood always has the approach that any living orgasm from space is always indestructible. That scenario has been so overdone. Anyway, I enjoyed it but it's not in my top list. :)",6,2,4,22 June 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Some fun, mostly NOT
","When dealing with a James Bond type of thriller you always need to suspend belief and go with the flow. I get that. But when the flow is boring as watching paint dry, and the main hero character has zero talent or screen presence, you're in for a long couple of hours. Colin Firth was excellent in his role but no one else added anything to this film. Samuel Jackson plays another yelling, complaining character on screen, now there's a surprise for you. His character was also so stupid and cartoonist that it was impossible to believe he rose to the power he was suppose to have.It's just a lot of noise that went south quickly. I rather watch a rerun of any Bond, Bourne or Mission Impossible movie than this train wreck.",3,5,14,30 March 2015
Braveheart," A fantastic film
","One of the best epics ever put to screen.. The story, acting, and directing were great enough, but throw into it beautiful visuals and music and you have a timeless masterpiece. Once again the people with no artistic vision only complain about the historical accuracy of the film and to those again I say this. There is NO such thing as historical accuracy of events that took place long ago. Its all either hear-say passed on,or political propaganda. Last time I checked there was no CNN crews hundreds of years ago. There was no video recording of anything as it unfolded. Only documentation written usually long after events happened. And again because the country you happen to live in has a history book that you read as a child you accept it as proof of something. Please give it a rest.. Braveheart was the telling of a incredible story of a ordinary man who helped his nation overcome extraordinary odds.. It was told beautifully and with great passion on the screen. Thats what we're talking here. Movie-making.",10,5,11,7 July 2007
Mad Max: Fury Road," Why ???
","Lets spend millions on remaking an iconic film. Why ? well you just can't have enough post apocalypse in Australia movies, now can you !!! As usual we let mainstream film making off the hook again with it's 'we have no more ideas but hey we can blow things up better these days' approach. I really believe they would love to just remake the same films over all the time, just make us live our movie loving lives over and over again like in Ground Hog Day. They probably be remaking that one too. LOL Okay so the film blew up crap better.. but it had NO character at all like the original Mad Max films. Once again though it'll make money and they be another soon.. sigh",3,13,31,20 May 2015
