Skyfall," One of the best Bond movies
","After I watched Quantum of Solace, I really hoped for a different kind of Bond movie, and it came in the form of Skyfall.Where Quantum of Solace really focuses on being spectacular, Skyfall returns to the form of older Bond movies. The focus lays more on storytelling, however the producers didn't forget to let some really nice action bits in the film. This is what you already see in the opening scenes of the film with the motorcycle- and car chase. However, there's also a point of criticism: how on earth did Bond survive the gunshot from Eve?When you look at the rest of the film, it's actually on a really high level. In my opinion the villain (performed by Javier Bardem) and the Bond girl (performed by Bérénice Marlohe) lift this film to great heights. Not to mention Daniel Craig an Judi Dench, who I think also did a very good job.The villain Raoul Silva is such a great villain. Throughout the film you discover that he actually is a tragic figure, who is on a constant search for himself. On the one hand he shows great anger when fighting Bond. But in the final scene of the film he looks really concerned when he sees M heavily injured. This makes him a man with two faces and also makes it hard to fathom him.But what I especially like about his film are the final scenes where it all comes together. First of all there's Silva's men entering the Skyfaal mansion. After that the entering of Silva himself by helicopter (also notice the music coming out of the speakers underneath the helicopter, brilliant!). Of course there also are the usual explosions involved. But the last scene is actually an atypical ending for a Bond film. I think this is one of the very few moments we could see emotion from the character James Bond when M dies. It's a shame that Judi Dench got written out of the Bond films though, such a great actress!If you are looking for a very nice Bond movie, including both great storytelling and great action scenes, this is the one you've been looking for!",8,3,8,1 December 2015
Quantum of Solace," Moderate, but not an awful Bond film
","OK, I have to be honest. When I first saw this Bond movie I was a bit disappointed. However Daniel Craig did a fantastic job in his first Bond movie Casino Royale, so it wouldn't have been easy to do better on his next film. The film is mounted in a fast way. Sometimes too fast, if I'm honest. For instance: the car chase at the beginning of the movie is an incredible bit of craftsmanship but this just goes too fast. Also a few characters in the movie barely have the time to develop their selves. For instance General Medrano.I think the general disappointing feeling of this film can be related to the director of the film, or at least the way they see Bond. Martin Campbell, who directed Casino Royale and Goldeneye, is more of a story teller. He really wants to tell a story within the film. this is the case with both Goldeneye and Casino Royale where there is a clear storyline involved. Along with the storyline, there's of course the usual Bond action involved.On the other hand, there's Marc Forster, the man who directed this film, Quantum of Solace. Forster is a director who puts more effort into making this Bond film spectacular. In fact he tries to make it so spectacular that the storyline is a bit forgotten. After all: the film is just about Bond wanting to take revenge for the things that happened in Casino Royale and that's pretty much it.However, there's no need to be only negative about this movie. A lot of actors did an amazing job trying to make the film as spectacular as possible. For instance there's this great ending battle between Dominic Greene and Bond, and also the battle between Camille and General Medrano. I also like the way Bond drops Dominic Greene in the middle of nowhere. It's, in my opinion a better and more inventive way to get rid of the evil than Bond for instance 'just' killing the African generals in Casino Royale.",6,1,4,1 December 2015
Casino Royale," The best Bond movie: enough said
","As a hardcore Bond fan I fell in love with this film from the very first time I saw it.In my eyes, this is the purest, the truest interpretation from the character we have seen so far.Simply said, this film is absolutely amazing and blows your mind. From the great black & white pre - titles to perhaps the best titles sequence ever. From the free running chase to the simply beautiful interiors of London. From the mysterious, super cool Le Chriffre to the Judi Dench's worried M. From the hart broken lover to the stone cold killer.Style and action are perfectly in balance.The best Bond movie: enough said.",9,2,8,10 December 2015
