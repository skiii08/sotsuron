Million Dollar Arm," Underrated
",I hadn't even heard of this movie before I was channel surfing one night and saw it on TNT and decided to give it a try. I was not at all disappointed. No it didn't get critical acclaim but I found it to be a very compelling story with excellent acting. I don't post often and only do so when I feel that a movie deserves more credit than what it received. If you're a fan of sports or just inspiring stories I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. Give it a chance.,9,0,0,31 July 2019
