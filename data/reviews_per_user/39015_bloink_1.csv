The Blair Witch Project," does not live up to the hype
","I went into the theatre thinking that i was about to be scared, i wasn't.  I had been waiting all week to see this film and went in very excited.  I was watching th first 3/4 of the movie in complete boredom but i've read other reviews that said the last 20 minutes are good, so i waited.  they were not scary, at all.  I saw it yesterday and for some reason can't get it out of my head.  I even want to see it again.  I don't know why.  The longer I wait the less I remember the movie sucking so bad.  I guess I'll just have to wait and see how it is the second time",7,2,3,17 July 1999
