Antz," A highly entertaining classy example of film making
","I really enjoyed this movie.  I was rather reluctant to see it, thinking it wouldn't be anything special...I was wrong!  The animation is absolutely outstanding -- it will blow your mind from frame 1.  The story as a whole is definitely targeted to an adult audience -- note the 7 or 8 profanities and/or sexual references -- and the movie has some great lines.  I had a great time watching Antz and would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a little fun at the theater!",10,0,0,11 October 1998
Mission: Impossible II," A rocking good time
","This movie kicked some serious a**!  The special effects during the fight scenes follow in the footsteps of similarly great scenes in The Matrix, and the movie was just fun to watch.  This is where to go if you're looking for a good time :)",Null,0,0,24 May 2000
