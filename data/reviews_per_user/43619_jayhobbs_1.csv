United 93," Like nothing I've ever seen before...
","'United 93' is without a shadow of a doubt one of the most powerful films ever to embrace the cinema screen. Its writer and director, Paul Greengrass, produced a remarkable adaptation of this unforgettable event. The production gave an out of this world insight into this terrifying flight, as well as incorporating the events that unfolded on September 11th.The most notable moment in the film, personally, was shortly after the flight had commenced. It was announced to the passengers that they were able to see an aerial view of the New York City skyline. Here, the World Trade Centre was the clear focal point. It became truly chilling how all the assailants took one last look at it, knowing its inevitable fate.The film has numerous elements that will remain in the minds of viewers for days, weeks or even months after viewing it. From the time the terrorists say 'it's time', to the final farewells of those on board and the horror of people involved, the picture is a gripping masterpiece. A tasteful, emotional and truly heartfelt portrayal of man's will to survive.This review was written with the greatest respect to all those who lost their lives on this tragic day.",9,0,2,16 June 2006
