United 93," A total experience
","For someone that experienced 9/11 in America, watching this movie made me experience a 'panic attach' outside the movie theater after the movie was over.I was crying and sobbing for a while, till I finally got a grip.The movie was made in a most clever way; by having unknown actors and the way the movie was shot makes you almost believe you are watching a documentary.You experience the horror as you're watching it. You believe it was real then and real now. And that's what makes it worst on you mentally.It made me go back to that day, and realized how much I minimized the effect it had on me over the last five years. This film makes you experience real terror as closely as ever made by the cinema.",10,1,2,23 September 2006
