The New World," Mediocre film considering that it's historically accurate.
","I found this film to be very historically accurate despite that it was quite bland.As for the young lady who played Pocahontas, she was good however I do think that Alex Rice would have played the part better. The only reason why I say this is because she's been in more films and is more well known. As for Colin Farrell, I'm afraid he didn't play John Smith very convincingly. The gentleman who played Pocahontas's 2nd lover should have been John Smith while Mr. Farrell should have played the 2nd lover.But.....ANYWAY....other than it's historical accuracy, I don't believe it'll win any Oscars. This is unfortunate because I love any film that deals with Native history. I'm just saying that this film could have been a lot better, that's all.",6,0,8,26 January 2006
The Revenant," A modern day version of 'Jeremiah Johnson'...
","I liked this film because LDC stated afterwards that 'it's about time that Indigenous People get the fair treatment they deserve' .. or something along those lines.I made reference to when Robert Redford starred in Jeremiah Johnson because Redford also played the role of the mountain man just like LDC did in this film except that this film had more realistic looking scenes. But personally I don't think LDC should have starred in this film at all because he just doesn't have that historical mountain man look. In fact, I think someone like Kevin Costner should have been given the role of Hugh Glass because of his previous role in 'Dances with Wolves'. Costner's role in the 1990 film would have been synonymous with the role of Hugh Glass. This was NOT the kind of film where LDC would be in. I mean this isn't his kind of role: the outdoorsy kind of actor where you would normally see him. Some actors fit in perfectly with their roles but with LDC should NOT have been contacted by the other film crew to play the part. Some will agree with that one. I found this film to be about survival ... how we all have to survive throughout life. It was a perfect way to convey the message through this film in a historical setting based on the factual account on Hugh Glass's struggle to survive in such harsh natural environments. I've always been a huge fan of films based on historical accounts where Native Indigenous People are involved.Anyways... I gave this one a 7 out of 10.",7,0,2,15 January 2016
Windtalkers," Not enough recognition for Navajo efforts in helping Allies win the war!
","I liked this film since Nicolas Cage and Christian Slater were the perfect choices to star in such war/action films like this one. However I strongly believe that the Navajo people weren't given enough credit for all their efforts in both the film and in real life. Of course if it hadn't have been for the Navajos coming up with that code in the first place, the Americans would have been more exposed to the Allies' enemies and thus allowing them to be defeated more easily. This is only how the way I see it. But what the real problem is that the Allies never saw the Navajos as the real true heroes that they were since it was them who practically won the war for them anyway! Unfortunately you'll never hear about the contributions the Navajo made during the war because just like back in those days, the white American mentality of Natives being 'savages' are still too deeply embedded in their minds.But....... ANYWAYS.......... this is why I've chosen to give this film a 7 out of 10.",7,0,2,2 January 2005
