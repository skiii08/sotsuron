Requiem for a Dream," Aronofsky brings something new to the table
","Once I heard the plot to this story and thought back to what this brilliant director did in Pi, I could only see good things for this film. It is a non conventional drug film with a conventional drug message. If you want an original spin to be taken on a movie that has been done a million times, I would choose none other then this man. I just can't wait to see what he does next, considering that his next project is called Batman: year one, I can only imagine.Oh ELLEN BURSTYN was ROBBED of an oscar. 9/10",10,0,0,25 May 2001
Memento," Best Movie of the Year
","Very simply put, there aren't many original movies out there and if there is they aren't very good. This hasn't been as good a film that was written and directed by the same person since way of the gun which is of course the best there is Christopher McQuarrie ( The Usual Suspects ). If you are the type of person that likes simple movie that don't move you or make you think for more then 5 or 10 seconds then this is not the film for you. Sit back pat attention and don't try to figure out the whole film half way through because YOUR WRONG.This deserves more then a 10 out of 10 but i don't make the rules.",9,0,1,14 May 2001
Lost in Translation," Save your sanity and if you like money, put the 9 dollars back in your pocket
","Wow, i find solace in the fact that i am home typing this review on my computer instead of being in a dark theater watching a two hour long piece of crap.Great acting + good cinematography = bad movie. Doesn't make sense unless you add an non-existent plot to the equation. So Sophia Coppola gladly did and there you have it, a bad movie.Some people will say that there is a plot and that the plot entails the two main characters having a meetings of minds in a far off land. OK, fine, that's nice. Am i entertained at least while they have that meeting of minds--- NO, so if you are under the understanding that those two people having a meeting of minds is plot enough for you, I hope you enjoyed it.Sorry for the negativity but I send this message up as a warning to those who havn't seen it.SO...... Avoid the terror.",1,1,3,9 October 2003
American Beauty," Here is a word to those bashing this great film
","I have read many of the comments on this film because i love to look for comments saying bad things about the films i love. It allows me to question myself. I have seen many comments saying these characters aren't real or that you didn't feel for any of the characters. I disagree, i believe that everyone felt something for all the characters but then you found out there was something you didn't like about the character. Everyone is supposed to be cheering our main character Lester look what his main goal is, to sleep with a 16 year old girl when he is over 40. That I believe is the genius in the film, it is real because we are all lead to do things that are wrong because they feel right. That is human, that is real, and that is American.10/10,   sometimes a movie has hype because it deserves it.",10,0,0,17 May 2001
