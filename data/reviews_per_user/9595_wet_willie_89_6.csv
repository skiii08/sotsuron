Raiders of the Lost Ark," My favourite film
","Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom used to be my favourite indiana jones film, until i saw Raiders of the Lost ark. I immediately changed my mind and raiders turned to be my favourite indiana Jones film not only my fav indiana jones film but my most fav film of all time. Raiders had everything a good story, good characters, great action sequences and a touch of romance. And Harrison Ford was great as Indiana Jones, and i wouldhave loved to have seen Marion again in one of the other indy films. The Naziz were great villains and were themain villains, i didn't consider Rene Belloq as a villain he was more of a competitor to Indy...but hands down a great film and is probably one of the greatest adventure films of all time.",Null,0,1,7 December 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," masterpiece
","Terminator 2 judgment day is an absolute masterpiece and lives up to the original in many ways. The Biggest shock for me was that Arnold became the protector i was sort of saddened as the original terminator was an astounding villain and could have went on as a villain. But Arnold was still excellent as the terminator, and robert patrick as the liquid metal t-1000 was also a great performance. And Linda Hamilton took her character further and made it much greater and delivers a great performance. Earl Boen delivered another great performance as Dr peter silberman and Edward Furlong was pretty good as john but could have been better. The Action today still is great and sometimes a lot better than today's action. 10/10",Null,1,1,9 December 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," fairly entertaining...
","I can say i enjoyed this movie but i can't say it was a fabulous adaption of the book. I mean they took out so many important scenes that would be useful in the later movies, aside from that the acting was terrific Dan, Emma, Rupert, Robbie, tom and etc all played there roles perfectly. And Professor Mcgonnagal played by Maggie smith was once again brilliant, and Gary old man's performance as Sirius Black was my favorite. David Thewlis gave a terrific performance as Professor Lupin, and the visual effects were great and my favorite was Buckbeak he was so beautiful i wish i could just take him home. A downfall was the director Alfonso Cuaron now i'm not being mean i don't think he is a bad director but he was bad director at making a harry potter movie. And what was with tom the barkeeper he turned all goofy and weird, and even though tom felton did a great performance as Malfoy his character was sissy than ever...Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a fairly good entertaining movie but it was missing stuff the other two potter movie's had.",7,0,1,4 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Fantastic adaption of the book.
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic book and now a fantastic movie. It was pretty much what i expected though i wish at the start they showed more of the dursley's as i have a soft spot for them. The casting was great to Daniel was great as Harry, Ron pretty much matched Ron and Hermione was was pretty good to, and since i knew the movie was coming out i could see robbie coltrane as Hagrid and Richard Harris was stunning as dumble dore. The Movie was very faithful to the book and kept it all together thanks to columbus of course. And the visual effects were pretty good especially for fluffy the three headed dog and the ghosts and things but this was a fantastic movie...and i look forward to the second one.",8,0,2,3 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Even better than the first.
","Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets is everything i expected funnier, darker and scarier and even more magical than the first. It is a great adaption of the book and once again the actors did a terrific job. Everyone was back and even some new ones came in like Colin and Jason Isaac's who portrayed Lucius and play him brilliantly. The whole feel of this film is dark and creepy and the visual effects in it are better than the first and the most creepiest bit for me was the spiders as i am scared to death of them. But this movie is better than the first and i think the only negative thing in the whole movie was Gilderoy Lockhart.",9,0,1,4 January 2005
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," I loved it!!!.
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it sure beats the crap out of temple of doom and a lot of other films. They brought back everything i missed the Nazi's, Marcus Brody...and just the spirit of the first Indy film and that was everything that was lost intemple of doom. The Chemistry between Indy and his Dad is great and very funny and Sean Connery was the best choice for his dad. There were great action sequences like boat chase scene, the motorbike chase, the Nazi after Indy and Henry all the time and the tank scene. Like the first film Indy is after a christainty artefact, and it's the holy grail. The Story is superb and i loved Elsa she was very smart to trick Indy as to being a Nazi...overall i love this film almost as much as raiders and it's great fun.",Null,12,25,7 December 2004
