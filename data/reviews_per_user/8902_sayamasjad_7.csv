Conquest 1453," The conquest of Constantinople
","First of all, Fetih 1453 is the first Turkish realistic historical epic movie. Almost everything was perfect especially costumes, catapults and places. The costumes were very impressive because movie team gave us the moment of 15th century. The Places were awesome they have given the moment and takes us those times. I enjoy the every second of the movie, yes definitely they can't wrap thing of years of struggle in two and half years but it was amazing.
The Sultans acting is a bit weak but lovely, and some fighting scenes seems funny but lots of improvements for Turkish cinema and movie production companies. And it's a bit smells politics but as i said, it's worth to watch and I would definitely recommend the movie.",10,1,2,1 June 2020

",We can not only easily grab the setting of the evil clown and what he wants by this quick exposition. It is a typical bogie man story who eats and kidnap kids who are afraid of it.,8,0,0,23 September 2019

Avengers: Endgame," The End of an Era
","It's funny, it's sad, its serious, it's crazy. The ending is mental.🤓 The plot is nuts.😋 4 years ago, I remember how surprised I was that Ironman, got such a great movie.🙂 I never dreamed that 21 films later, I'd be bawling in the theater, watching it all come to an end.😔
A culmination of 10 years and 21 movies deserves a finish like this.👏 I will never ever get over that ending.✊ When Iron Man's heartbeat stopped, I felt someone ripped out my heart. 💔
11 years, 21 movies, all leading to #AvengersEndgame 😎",10,0,4,29 April 2019
The Lion King," The Lion King
","I have never seen the former animated The Lion King, so no history there or need for comparison. We noticed during the movie that a lot of other people were singing along or even predicted out loud what would happen next. And no we didn't attend a matinee, so there were no children present, they were all grown ups. But that shows how much people loved the earlier animated version (as a part of their childhood) and perhaps that explains the bad reviews. I've read a lot of them and there are people that complain that this version is the exact same and others complain that it leaves out too many details. It seems that it could never live up to the expectation no matter what. We really enjoyed it, I get that the animated older version gives the animals more expression. But choosing to do it in real life form, is choosing for less expression. Because in real life a lion does not have human expressions. The CGI was breathtaking, and for us it was a combination of a great National Geographic documentary combined with a nice story (not too complicated).",9,2,5,3 August 2019
