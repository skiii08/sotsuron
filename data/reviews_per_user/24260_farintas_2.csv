Lucky Number Slevin," my impressions
","*I checked the spoilers just to be on the safe side*It is indeed a very good film. I suggest you to see it. Paul McGuigan does a very good job although he used different techniques and a mix of CGI and film that worked most of the times. I would like it to be a bit darker since it is a mob story and the super modern sets of the gangsters' lairs where a bit to unrealistic. After all the scenario is Hollywood reality and a bit unbelievable by itself. I would first like to mention the brilliant job Sir Ben Kingsley does. Honest you are up for a surprise. This actor is so multi-sided and he doesn't stop bringing a variety of characters on the screen, thats why he remains one of my top ten males. His cooperation with Morgan Freeman is truly professional.Expect to see a Jackal and SinCity mix of Bruce Willis whose character although in the background is the common denominator. After all the above three actors where the reason I saw the movie, me not being a huge fan of Hollywood.The only other time I had seen Josh Hartnett was in SinCity where I cant remember if he even has more than a line and in this one he does not make any impression to me and found him rather planate. He is still young though and I respect that he appeals to a particular audience.The scenario I mentioned is very well written and the dialogues intelligent.

Donnie Darko," So close to getting the whole picture yet so far away
","A great film. After seeing it for the first time I spent about 3 hours surfing the reviews and the fun sites. I had not visited the official site before seeing the movie, so that was where I first went. It answered most of my questions but created more. I suggest to anyone that might suffer from Darkitis to do the same.I particularly enjoyed the films reference to ancient Greek Drama, which is the mother of all spectacles. In the scene where Donnie is being held down at knife-point, he uttered the phrase 'deux ex machina'. I think such a twisting plot could only be resolved artificially.I hope there will be more work of that level from Richard Kelly once he goes into bigger budgets. He could even do a sequel on one of the so many subplots that are in this movie. Maybe he tried to include too many stuff in it though, thus, causing confusion rather than interest to the viewer.Regards",7,0,0,28 November 2002
