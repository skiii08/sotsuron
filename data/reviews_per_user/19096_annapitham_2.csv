Hereditary," Confused
","This film is one where we both looked at each other at the end with a bamboozled look??? 
Slow going for the first hour with not much to be scared about apart from 'Charlie's face. Then when she gets killed off by her clearly psychotic brother things start to get a little more interesting. Annie's insestant wailing made me want to reach into the screen and throttle her. The story is not clear and I'm still wondering what the hell it was all about. If you like seeing a load of old fat naked dudes then this is the film for you. Certainly is no Conjuring or Insidious.

The Shape of Water," Beautifully depicted fable
","This is quite possibly one of the best films I've seen this year. Everything about it was beautiful, the 60's setting, the music and storyline. Some would say this is a kids film but I'd say not. Sex between a fish and human is something I wouldn't like to explain to the kids. I cried buckets whilst my husband rolled his eyes. Not a film for the boys.",8,2,5,13 October 2018
