Ford v Ferrari," A Fun Ride with Plenty of Bumpy ClichÃ©s in the Road
","James Mangold's 'Ford v Ferrari' is a fun two-and-a-half hour ride down memory lane, circling the lives of legendary race car driver Ken Miles and equally esteemed car designer Carroll Shelby.The film gets off to an uninspiring start, introducing the main characters using quick-hitting scenes that turn each into an eye-rolling archetype. Shelby is the inspired engineer. Miles is the irascible wildcard. Henry Ford II is the cutthroat Man of Industry ... and they even give him a sniveling bulldog lackey.The second half of the film picks up the pace and is considerably more engaging. Mangold does a fine job filming the racing scenes, choosing just the right balance of different viewpoints and cuts. Beyond that, he thankfully spares audiences from the awful 'shaky camera effect' that some filmmakers would've used anytime they wanted to ramp up the action on screen.Given that the '24 Hours of Le Mans' race is indeed twenty-four hours long, Mangold also excels at keeping an even pace down the final stretch, not relying too much on either the racing or the off track drama, but rather striking an even balance between the two.",7,1,8,15 November 2019
First Man," Damien Chazelle's perfect record remains intact
","Damien Chazelle's perfect record remains intact. His third feature film, 'First Man,' is an extraordinary achievement in filmmaking and immediately becomes a front-runner for best movie of the year.The technical aspects of the film are flawless. Everything from the writing to the cinematography to the sound design and score are as compelling as they are precise. Yet it's the pacing and emotion of the film--which are directly a result of Chazelle's exceptional directing--that complete the package, making 'First Man' his most audaciously planned and executed project to date.",9,1,5,15 October 2018
The Death of Stalin," 'The Death of Stalin' immediately becomes this year's hidden gem of the season
","'The Death of Stalin' is the kind of film that makes you want to climb inside the head of the writer/director--in this case Armando Iannucci--and probe all the little dials and sprockets and gears to see what makes him tick.Iannucci somehow manages to create a wholly original and surreal work of power-mongering satire steeped in dark humor and absurdism while perfectly blending together the largely true events surrounding Stalin's death.Add to that a powerhouse cast of dry comedy and improvisation, including Jeffrey Tambor, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Palin, combined with magnificent settings, and 'The Death of Stalin' immediately becomes this year's hidden gem of the season.",8,7,11,12 April 2018
Us," A step back from 'Get Out'
","Jordan Peele's work is immersive. A few minutes into watching his movies everybody sitting in your vicinity seems to disappear and all that remains is you and the gripping story unfolding on screen. He achieves this effect by allowing his films to breathe. Sometimes the camera lingers on scenery. Sometimes it lingers on a person. Either way, it demonstrates a patience in filmmaking that is rare for a first or second-time director, meaning that Peele undoubtedly honed this skill throughout the 53-episode run of his comedy show and was able to successfully apply it to horror.This duality-comedy and horror-is perhaps the most striking (and successful) component of Peele's new film 'Us,' the follow-up to his Oscar winning debut 'Get Out.' There are just as many laughs littered throughout the film as there are moments of shock and tension.Yet there's a hollowness to 'Us,' as though the burdens of being one of the most prolific creators currently working in Hollywood stunted the overall development of the film. Peele likely took years to write 'Get Out' and the astounding density of the story shows. Peele had perhaps half as much time to write 'Us'-while being twice as busy-and the product speaks for itself.For example, there's an interesting red-blue dynamic applied to the costume and set design, but its intended meaning doesn't always feel consistently applied. Furthermore, one of the on-screen deaths is needlessly unrealistic, while a particular shot setup towards the end of the film tries to be artistic but just doesn't work ... at all.As a result, it begs the question of whether 'Us' is disappointing compared to 'Get Out,' or if it's disappointing entirely on its own.",6,5,9,22 March 2019
Knives Out," Rian Johnson's Brilliant Whodunit Is Unceasingly Engaging
","Ignore any noise being spouted from jaded 'Star Wars' fanboys. Rian Johnson is among the finest filmmakers currently working in Hollywood.Consider his resume: he wrote and directed 'Brick;' he wrote and directed 'The Brothers Bloom;' he wrote and directed 'Looper;' he directed the Breaking Bad episodes 'Fly,' 'Fifty-One,' and 'Ozymandias;' and most recently he wrote and directed easily the best murder-mystery of the year, 'Knives Out.'The plot is dense and brilliantly serpentine--just as one should expect from a quintessential film of the genre--taking on the characteristics of an ouroboros.Each of the characters in the film are familiar, flawed, and driven by their own delightfully selfish motivations.But it's the writing-oh the wonderful writing!-that makes this picture as powerful and poetic as it is. From the plot to the dialogue to the very last gasps of the denouement, Johnson keeps the audience completely rapt and on the edge of their seats wishing the saga could somehow continue ad infinitum.",8,3,17,24 November 2019
The Irishman," A Throwback to the Golden Age of Cinema
","There's no question Martin Scorsese has forever left his mark on cinema. Still to this day he serves as the ordained staunchest defender of cinema. And when his maker finally reclaims him to the grandest of Wonder Theaters in the heavens above, he'll deservedly be placed on the Mount Rushmore of cinema down here on earth, forever perched just a bit higher and with far greater permanence than us regular folk.This review won't be some drawn out ode to one of the greatest filmmakers of all time-and in particular our favorite director. His latest flick, 'The Irishman,' is magnanimous in its breadth and scale, though it isn't perfect. We wish the blood effects used throughout the film were practical instead of CGI. The Canada Dry product placement is nagging. The decision to cast Action Bronson for a certain scene is downright bizarre and the ending should've been edited down, shaving off some of the bloated 3.5 hour run time.Yet think about what this film represents. We have Scorsese directing De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci along with a veritable 'who's who' of the gangster genre. It's a once-in-a-lifetime reunion of what is called the 'New Hollywood' era of cinema, the movement in American film history from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s when a new generation of young actors and filmmakers came to prominence in the U.S.We were fortunate enough to see this film at the gorgeous and historic Belasco Theatre. The experience felt like a throwback to the golden age of cinema. We'll always cherish the memory and be thankful for all the enjoyment and pleasure Mr. Scorsese has given us over the years. If you've benefited the same, see the movie in select theaters now or on Netflix beginning November 27th.",8,6,14,10 November 2019
Deadpool 2," Best superhero sequel since 'The Dark Knight'
","When considering 'Deadpool 2,' there hasn't been another superhero sequel as good if not better than the original since Christopher Nolan flexed his muscles in the genre with 'The Dark Knight.'The main body of 'Deadpool 2' blends together the action, plot and soundtrack to such a high degree that it's virtually unparalleled compared to other films. From recent memory, the only other film that comes close-besides the first Deadpool-was last year's 'Baby Driver.'The film's dialogue is packed with movie references, nods at pop culture, and even jokes at Ryan Reynold's own expense, so much so that a second viewing would absolutely be necessary to try and catch them all.The movie isn't perfect. For example, the first half of Cable's storyline feels a bit disjointed from the rest of the film. However, it steadily becomes increasingly well integrated over time.However, for a franchise that prides itself on violent irreverence, it'd be unthinkable to assume that they were capable of making audiences well up with emotion at the end, yet they had the entire theater choking back tears, a rare achieve that strongly rounds out this film and places among the best in its class.",9,20,45,21 May 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Best of the New Trilogy
","Even though J.J. Abrams prefers to paint by numbers, his works remain fulfilling.",7,3,7,27 December 2019
Yesterday," Disappointingly Formulaic
","The premise to Danny Boyle's 'Yesterday'-that a struggling musician realizes he's the only person on Earth who can remember The Beatles after a strange worldwide blackout-is incredibly alluring. Too bad the film itself effectively wastes the opportunity to explore such a novel idea in any sort of resonant or meaningful way.The biggest problem with Boyle's approach is how formulaic the entire movie is. There's the dedicated small town talent manager, the jerk part-time boss, the one supportive fan, and the dopey sidekick. The performer's musical career, played by a wonderful Himesh Patel, isn't going anywhere until the Beatles thing happens. Then fame, success, and a stereotypical super-agent steps in. Before we know it the singer-songwriter has everything he ever wanted but is miserable.There's no need to dwell on the finer details or the love story because you can probably guess them all already. Sure, there are a number of things that are disappointing with the film, but most of all it's that Danny Boyle couldn't make 'Yesterday' something on a similar level as 'Slumdog Millionaire' despite ample opportunity to do so.",6,0,2,3 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Going Out On a High Note
","The biggest takeaway from 'Avengers: End Game' is just how much of an emotional roller coaster it is. There are countless opportunities to laugh out loud throughout the three hour movie-our personal favorite was the line 'pick a side, Lebowski'-which themselves are perfectly balanced (pun intended) by thrilling action sequences, nostalgic interludes, and genuine moments of sadness.Despite Endgame representing the denouement of the Avengers franchise (and the 22nd film to be released by Marvel Studios for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) the movie itself is also surprisingly self-contained. The only thing anybody would have to know going into the film is that Thanos snapped his fingers at the end of the last installment and half of all living things vanished into dust.Speaking of Thanos, his arc is presented most masterfully of all, far more unexpected and complex than anyone could've reasonably guessed. And as of this moment there's a brilliant Easter Egg on Google celebrating the opening of 'Avengers: End Game.' Google 'Thanos' then click on the Gauntlet icon containing the infinity stones on the right hand side of the screen. Enjoy.Rating: 8.5/10",8,0,2,26 April 2019
Climax," Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' ceremonial gathering scenes on bath salts
","Gaspar Noé's 'Climax' is labelled as a 'trippy drama horror musical.' Not a lot of people read 'trippy drama horror musical' and think 'Now that's my kind of movie!' Indeed, most people will find the movie to be quite objectionable, but that certainly doesn't mean 'Climax' is devoid of artistic merit or accomplishment.The film is a menagerie of dance, neon lighting, long takes, and astounding camera work, propelled forward by a pulsing EDM soundtrack that fills every scene with a frenetic energy. It may best be described as Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' ceremonial gathering scenes on bath salts. If 'Climax' were a painting, it'd belong in the Modern Museum of Art.We're not quite sure which drug one should be on to see the film, but some drug is definitely recommended.",8,33,54,19 March 2019
The Favourite," An Outright Brilliant Film
","No other period pieces come to mind when trying to find a comparison for 'The Favourite,' and even if there were, none would hold a candle to this 18th century tale of social scheming and palace politics.Director Yorgos Lanthimos previously caught the attention (and admiration) of art house audiences with 2015's 'The Lobster,' followed by last year's 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer.' However this film is different, and it will justifiably earn Lanthimos a spot at the table reserved for Hollywood's elite directors.The cast is outright brilliant. Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone, and Nicholas Hoult each deserve their own paragraph of praise. However, it is Colman who ultimately takes the cake for her performance (pun intended!). She looks to be the early front-runner for the Academy Award for Best Actress--a statement that is further bolstered by the fact that she just won that award category at the BAFTAs.Expect her official nomination come January ... along with a slew of other nominations covering just about every Oscar category.",9,12,26,5 December 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," All-You-Can-Eat Buffet Action Film
","'Avengers: Infinity War' smashed the box office record for biggest opening weekend taking in $258 million on its way to sprinting past a billion dollars in worldwide receipts, becoming the fastest movie ever to do so.The writing, visual effects, and a truly overwhelming amount of star power all make this film worthy of holding the title of reigning box office king. But my predominant thought leaving the theater was wondering who the hell could possibly follow the film's dizzying two-and-a-half hour story arc ... much less all the individual Marvel story arcs that preceded it, considering 'Infinity War' is the culmination of 18 different superhero movies. I recognized most of the actors (and most of their characters). But when you have three or four (?) different groups of heroes fighting three or four (?) different groups of baddies on three or four (?) different planets the film quickly turns into an all-you-can-eat buffet of action that, while still very appetizing, is quite a different experience than that of a neatly composed--and somewhat moderately portioned--meal.",8,1,6,11 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Occasionally Meandering but Always Intriguing
","We're not going to lie: Quentin Tarantino's ninth film, 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' is not an easy film to review. There are plenty of good, bad, and indifferent parts of the movie to touch on, all further complicated by the fact that the bar for any Tarantino picture is already incredibly high-perhaps unfairly so.What do we mean by that last part? Well, overall the film has been received quite positively by film critics, though Tarantino acolytes seem to be a little more tepid about it. But what if this film weren't written and directed by Tarantino, and instead was made by a lesser-known entity? Would it be considered a masterful piece of filmmaking, a breakout success largely unparalleled by anything else released so far this year? There's no actual answer to this. We simply wonder ...Meanwhile, let's start with the bad stuff. The middle of the film is somewhat meandering, meaning this is the third film in a row that Tarantino could've trimmed some fat to make the movie that much more invigorating. And what do his three most recent movies all have in common? The absence of Tarantino's long-time editor, Sally Menke, who tragically died at the age of 56 while hiking in Beachwood Canyon during a heat wave.Furthermore, a key component of Tarantino's movies is the way he incorporates music into the film, choosing the perfect song to complement what is seen on the screen. Our biggest gripe with 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' is that the songs were often abruptly cut short, never being allowed to fully play out and truly meld with the action unfolding on screen.On the positive side, the film is about 90% less violent than a typical Tarantino flick, meaning it'll be a lot more accessible to moviegoers who previously avoided the filmmaker due to his penchant for frequently utilizing gory deaths. This makes the film closer to 'Jackie Brown' in both substance and style than most of his other works.Lastly, 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' proves once and for all that Leonardo DiCaprio is among the finest and most talented actors of his generation. He is downright captivating in every single scene. And considering he is an actor playing an actor-one of the hardest roles there is to pull off in Hollywood-it makes his performance that much more extraordinary.",8,8,13,29 July 2019
Django Unchained," The first step backwards for Quentin Tarantino in his illustrious career
","In our opinion, 'Django Unchained' represents the first step backwards for Quentin Tarantino in his illustrious career.There are a couple of reasons for this. First, Christoph Waltz's accent never sounded right to us, which is quite bizarre considering Waltz is a German actor who speaks English ... playing a German character who speaks English.Secondly, there's a fair amount of fat throughout the flick that in our humble opinion could've been trimmed to make the film's runtime a little less laborious, the most notable being Tarantino's ill-conceived cameo segment.As a result, 'Django Unchained' represents the most commercial yet least effective of the seven films up to this point in his career.",7,0,2,4 June 2019
Call Me by Your Name," 'Call Me by Your Name' is an airy, meditative look at a summer of sexual discovery.
","'Call Me by Your Name' is an airy, meditative look at a summer of sexual discovery. Armie Hammer and Timothee Chalamet--who was recently introduced to audiences in 'Ladybird' and is destined for an even bigger spotlight--bask in the Northern Italian countryside, soaking in each other's company as the camera drifts like a zephyr through the idyllic scenery.The acting and cinematography particularly stand out, so much so that one must pity those (or themselves) who have to trudge back to their cars through crusty snow and single digit temperatures after watching these two lovebirds lounging in the sun for an entire summer.Given the subject matter and release date, I suspect that various film executives hoped this film would replicate last year's success of 'Moonlight'--which, let's not forget, won the Oscar for Best Picture--yet 'Call Me by Your Name' is simply far less compelling. And while it served as a pleasant respite from the harsh winter, it felt more like a June release both in feel and overall impact.",8,2,7,1 January 2018
1917," '1917' Rubs Up Against Perfection
","The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The director, the actor, and the cinematographer. Sam Mendes, George MacKay, and Roger Deakins.This trinity of artists has achieved something truly special with their World War War I masterpiece '1917.' There are good movies. There are great movies. And every so often-perhaps once a year at most, if we the audience may be so spoiled-there are movies that advance the art form beyond its present state, towards a loftier plane of existence. '1917' is indeed one of these movies.Upon seeing the film, words feel trivial in trying to characterize or describe in any meaningful way the experience that this movie provides. Give director Sam Mendes a pen and a camera and there isn't anything he can't do. Afford him the privilege of working with lead actor George MacKay and sublimity follows. Pair them both with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins and transcendence awaits.The 'single take' effect in which the film is presented is not new. Others have also done it to great acclaim, such as Alejandro G. Inarritu with 'Birdman' or Ilya Naishuller with 'Hardcore Henry.' But no other film has done it better than '1917' and quite frankly there are few, if any films in recent memory, that have been so thoroughly exceptional in every other facet of the filmmaking process.",Null,0,3,10 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," 'The Last Jedi' notably serves its purpose as the middle child in this latest trilogy
","'The Last Jedi' finds itself as perhaps the most polarizing installment of the Star Wars franchise since 'Return of the Jedi,' with die-hard fans either dwelling too much on the bad parts of the script, or obsessing too much on the good. The fact is, the film gets more right than wrong, and even features some of the best sequences of any Star Wars film, period.It's largely the first half of the film that suffers. There are times when the comedic relief falls flat, or perhaps shouldn't have been attempted in the first place. It's also the first time that the 'Disneyfication' of the franchise feels quite apparent, with softer storylines, muted violence, and cuddlier creatures. I, for one, could readily punt one of those Porgs off a cliff into the ocean and not feel guilty doing it.However, there's good reason why Disney has decided to hand director Rian Johnson the keys to the next Star Wars trilogy. He's managed to successfully blend the commercialization of the 'The Last Jedi' with the tradition and lore of the larger franchise. Furthermore, his action sequences are quite riveting (and two in particular are insanely good), his color palettes throughout the movie are visually stunning, and the musical score is rather delightful.As a result, 'The Last Jedi' notably serves its purpose as the middle child in this latest trilogy, tying up all of the loose ends from 'The Force Awakens' while setting up the next film for a fresh take on the Star Wars universe.",8,0,0,17 December 2017
The Shape of Water," A tour-de-force of Guillermo's del Toro's world-building ability
","The Shape of Water stands out for the way Guillermo del Toro is able to give this fantasy-laden film such a distinct time and place, in this case a military research facility set in the 1960's, which highlights del Toro's masterful screenwriting ability. The writing is further gilded by its intellectual depth, with characters remarking about the origin of certain words and names, or drawing on biblical references to better frame the predicaments they're in. And if del Toro only wrote the screenplay, he'd still be receiving acclaim, yet this entire production is his. All told, he's credited as the writer, director, and producer.The film exhibits an alluring, Amelie-like color profile, with water motifs throughout, featuring a career-making performance by Sally Hawkins. The selective use of nudity and sexuality adds a real sense of depth and fullness to her role, making the character seem that much more lifelike, and Hawkins certainly makes the most of it.Her performance is quite simply magnanimous. She's outwardly tender and sweet, with an inner strength and resolve that manifests itself whenever the occasion calls. It's a combination of perfect casting and the actress rising to the occasion that, in my estimation, places her as the odds on favorite to win the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an actress in a drama, for which she's currently nominated, and the Academy Award in the same category, for which she most certainly will be nominated.",8,58,110,22 December 2017
Joker," A Gritty Origin Story With As Many Flaws As Arthur Fleck
","Before any of us see a single frame of Todd Phillips' 'Joker' we're all well aware of the film's many plaudits and longtime critical acclaim. Even prior articles of our own have covered the fact that 'Joker' received an eight minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, or that it also took home the Golden Lion, the festival's award for best film.Based on the competition, such illustrious awards may very well be warranted, but over time, reaction to 'Joker' seemed to falter, starting with the movie losing out to Taika Waititi's 'Jojo Rabbit' at the Toronto International Film Festival. Even now, 'Joker' is only garnering a 69% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 58 on Metacritic. Frankly, we don't disagree.For as much as we appreciate the grittiness and stripped-down nature of the film, which represents a welcomed departure from the typical superhero/supervillain genre (or action genre in general), the film simply has too many flaws to earn our outright acclaim.For example, a lot of the gratuitous violence just doesn't feel organic. Instead, it feels like Phillips knew he needed to show some gruesomeness-or perhaps he just wanted to ramp up the shock factor-so he wedged a few bloody scenes into the script. Worse, a lot of the scenes were shot using a heavy filter, which to us made it feel like we we watching a movie-within-a-movie, which itself provided an emotional filter distancing us from the story unfolding on screen.Lastly, leading up to this weekend, plenty of people have made comparisons between 'Joker' and Martin Scorsese's 'Taxi Driver.' Sure, Todd Phillips borrows a lot of imagery from the classic, especially the handgun gesture Arthur Fleck uses all too often. But if the same people are comparing the two in terms of quality and merit, they are severely overselling 'Joker,' severely underselling 'Taxi Driver,' or both.",7,3,9,4 October 2019
Parasite," A Worthy Winner of Cannes
","There's an unmatched clarity and precision to Bong Joon Ho's filmmaking. Parasite doesn't fit neatly into a genre box--it's part drama, part thriller, and part mystery--and the overall spectacle is indeed a worthy winner of Cannes Film Festival's top prize, the Palm d'Or.",9,0,3,3 November 2019
Black Panther," Box office results should never be mistaken for a barometer of a film's quality
","I'm happy for 'Black Panther.' Money talks, and right now the film's box office dominance is sending a powerful and culturally important message to Hollywood and beyond. Stories of all colors and stripes are waiting to be told, and cinema fans are pining for fresh takes and innovative ways to convey those tales.However--one way or the other--box office results should never be mistaken for a barometer of a film's quality. 'Black Panther' brings the fictional nation of Wakanda to life while shining a bright light on a handful of social justice issues that desperately need to be addressed. 
 I particularly like their bad-ass female version of the Praetorian guard. 
 But in end, those highlights aren't enough to overcome the handful of illogical moments scattered throughout the plot, the hewing of action scenes towards a more juvenile audience, and the frequently lame dialogue in which Michael B. Jordan's character is easily the worst offender.",7,0,2,16 March 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Among the Finest Examples of Satire In Recent Memory
","'What did they do?' Jojo asks his mother, inquiring about the townspeople he sees hanging in the village square.'Plenty of good,' Jojo's mother responds, reinforcing the noblest of convictions to both herself and her impressionable young son.The above interaction is just one of many poignant scenes found throughout Taika Waititi's 'Jojo Rabbit,' about a young boy in Germany's army who discovers that his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in their home.Beyond the many instances of poignancy and incisiveness, 'Jojo Rabbit' is equally packed with witty dialogue and humorous interludes, making it among the finest examples of satire to emerge from Hollywood in recent memory.So color us mystified as to why critics have given this gem such a paltry 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 58% on Metacritic. Those who panned the movie are either unable to laugh at absurdity, or they themselves are so absurd that it's not worth anyone's time to read their brainsick thoughts.",8,135,216,27 October 2019
Green Book," 'Green Book' takes us on a poignant journey
","'Green Book' barrels past some initial hokeyness to take us on a poignant journey through the deep south ... and into the heart of America's persistent deficiency in overcoming racial inequality.Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen both disappear into their roles as only actors of their caliber can, making every scene so captivating that the movie's 130-minute run time feels half as long.There's plenty of contemplation and outrage to go around. However, it's the genuine laughs that truly round out the film, providing a full range of delightful (and sometimes dizzying) emotions that quickly come and pass like mile markers on the side of a highway.",8,2,5,30 November 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Noble Aspirations Can't Save a Sloppy Shoot
","There is no more prescient of a time for Spike Lee to put out a film. He's arguably the world's most important Black filmmaker and his latest movie, 'Da 5 Bloods,' hits screens at a time when race relations in America are at their most pivotal point since the civil rights era.Lee's films nearly exclusively center on race. To this day his debut feature film, 'Do the Right Thing,' is not only dissected, discussed, and analyzed everywhere from the streets to academia for its filmmaking prowess, but also for the clarity and depth of what the film has to say about the Black experience in America.Not stopping there, Lee set his sights on the life and times of Malcolm X, turning out a three-and-a-half hour epic that lays bare the noxious pretense of equality in America that existed during Malcolm X's lifetime, at the time of the film's 1992 release, and still exists to this day.Lee's latest, 'Da 5 Bloods,' is centered on four old war buddies from Vietnam who travel back to the country to retrieve a stash of gold along with the remains of their fallen friend.The opening of the film is not for the faint of heart. It depicts real life photos and news footage of some of the more horrifying memories of the Vietnam War era, such as the burning monk or the captive Vietnamese man executed in the street with a bullet to the head. Equally repulsive is the notion that war, oppression, racism, and corrupt politics isn't some figment of our distant past but every bit as widespread then as it is today.A number of scenes in 'Da 5 Bloods' contain fun to spot Easter eggs or homages to its cinematic brethren. Some are rather obvious, like the 'Apocalypse Now' writing on the wall of the dance club or the usage of the song 'Flight of the Valkyries,' harkening back to the same movie. Others are a bit more meta, like the one-legged Vietnamese man throwing fire crackers at the feet of the protagonists, playfully referencing the terrifying 'Dance!' scene in 'Platoon.'But as much as Spike Lee might've wanted 'Da 5 Bloods' to represent his own 'Apocalypse Now' or 'Platoon,' it just isn't. Not even close. Far too many corners were cut while making the film for it to be considered in the same realm as such distinguished titles.Just look at the blood spatter CGI used throughout 'Da 5 Bloods' as an example. It looks no better than the stock blood spatter effect in Adobe. Matter of fact, it probably IS the stock blood spatter effect in Adobe. Why not spend that Netflix money and use squibs? Alternatively, if the effect is going to make the film look like a B-rated zombie flick, why use anything at all?And what are the chances that someone looking for buried gold on the side of a mountain goes to dig a hole to take a dump in and his shovel hits ... gold. A million to one? A billion? Who cares because Spike Lee is an acclaimed writer and such mind-numbing coincidences should never make it onto the page, much less into the film?The full list of frustrating coincidences found throughout the film is about as long as this entire review, so I'll spare you the details. The bottom line is simply that 'Da 5 Bloods' isn't the film we all hoped it would be. Spike Lee is among the finest filmmakers alive. Kubrick is Kubrick because he never settled for 'just good enough.' Scorsese is Scorsese because he never settles for 'just good enough.' After watching 'Da 5 Bloods,' I find it very disappointing at how many times Spike Lee apparently settled for 'just good enough.'",6,1,1,26 June 2020
Annihilation," 'Am I you? Are you me?'
","'Am I you? Are you me?'These are the pivotal words spoken late in 'Annihilation,' Alex Garland's directorial follow-up to his breakout hit 'Ex Machina.'The film is unequivocally high-concept--perhaps too much for its own good--in a dazzlingly-shot, heady sci-fi thriller. The more one understands biology--specifically cell biology--the more one is able to appreciate how tightly woven the plot is, and how insanely clever and audacious the ending turns out to be.",7,2,5,27 February 2018
