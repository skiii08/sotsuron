Spartacus," salute to a great movie
","I cannot believe that I had this movie in my collection for 3 YEARS and I just had the time to watch it, maybe I was hesitant because of it's length ...Great acting by Kirk Douglas 'salute' :) and a wonderful first encounter with the lovely Jean Simmons ... Loved the character of Antoninus :)AND HERE COMES THE SPOILER ... the scene where Spartacus and Antoninus fight is the best scene in the movie, I guess you truly feel what kind of a person Spartacus is and the kind of morals and values he and his fellow gladiators stand for ... I give 8/10.",8,3,4,25 November 2006
