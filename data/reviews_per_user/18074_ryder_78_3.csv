Alien 3," The Worst Ever Alien Film Without James Cameron That Refrained Me From Watchin Alien Resurrection
","I am going straight to the point. This movie is pure garbage. It plunges deep down into the ravine full of rotten tomatoes and maggot-filled pies. It is that bad.I have been a true fan of the Alien franchise after being exposed to Aliens 1 & 2 many years ago when I was still a kid in high school. Just lately, I got the Aliens trilogy(1, 2 & 3) and didn't consider Alien Resurrection(4) as I read Sigourney Weaver was not in it and the quality of the movie sucks. I am relieved that I didn't get the 4th instalment after watching the 3rd one just yesterday night.Without James Cameron, the movie seriously lacks quality and depth. The storyline was poor and the acting was terrible. I don't know why the director of this movie chose to focus on the bandits in the prison this time but the vulgarity used in the movie pretty much killed the entire film. Even the iconic Sigourney Weaver cannot salvage this movie from the brink of disaster.To sum it up, this film is pure garbage.",1,56,70,26 July 2008
Over the Top," Best All-Time American Classic
","I have grown up watching Stallone as a kid. From his untouchable blockbuster movies(Rambo & Rocky) to the most recent Rocky Balboa in its 6th iteration, Sly has carved a name for himself as a legend in American movie history, putting him alongside the late Christopher Reeves in portraying the all-time greatest American hero in Superman. All these great classic movies will never fade in time and would be still enjoyed by generations to come.Over The Top remains the best under-rated movie I've ever seen with a great powerful storyline that conveys strength, love and sacrifice coupled with great action and drama as with most Stallone's works. Even after 20 years since I first watched the film as a 9 year old kid, memories of my 'idol' going against all odds in arm-wrestling battles are still fresh in my mind. Nobody on earth can portray the underdog hero better than the man himself(not even Arnie!!)and Sly shows he is more than just rippling muscles by showing his tender side as a lone father with a child.I will always remember the final battle between Sly and the big guy. Although his nemesis's biceps are probably twice in diameter compared to SLy's(it's like pitting a golf stick with a fat baseball bat), Sly came out tops. I've forgotten if Sly broke the guy's arm, but hey it's been 20 years and I can still recall bits and pieces of the storyline so it's not that bad!!All in all, a great movie and kudos to Sylvester Stallone in bringing great characters to life. Age seems to be catching up but looks like there's no stopping this man!",10,3,4,10 December 2006
Gladiator," Magnifico
","I'll make this short since there are probably thousands of reviews here already.This is the 2nd movie after Saving Private Ryan that reduced me to tears at the end of the show. The success of this film was largely made possible by the talented director, great cast and a huge budget allocated for the movie. Although Crowe was the lead actor, much credit have to be given to Richard Harris and Joaquin Phoenix(not forgetting Oliver Reed) for adding depth and character into the movie. If I were only allowed to choose one, I would pick Harris(in portraying the slain emperor) as the best supporting actor over Joaquin, Oliver or Connie Nielsen. I think his performances are very powerful and not to mention the fact that I particularly admire his incredible acting in the scene where he told Joaquin he was not going to be his heir to the throne. His gestures, his expressions when listening to Joaquin's rant were just so real that you really feel for him being an aging but noble emperor.Russell Crowe is better off given roles as a fighter(for a good cause) just like James Braddock in that boxing movie. He's still better suited to movies with patriotic kind of battles such as this one in Gladiator. Crowe just sucks big time acting in dramas and movies with love elements. Please we don't want to see him fall in love with Meg Ryan! We want an action star out of Russell!! I hope the directors are reading this so that Crowe can be given more roles that involve leading a pack of army or something and turn out to be a hero at the end. Never mind if he's dead or alive at the end of the show but it just adds more compassion and probably reduce some folks to tears if he really fails to keep on breathing at the end.My 2 cents worth.",10,0,0,19 February 2007
