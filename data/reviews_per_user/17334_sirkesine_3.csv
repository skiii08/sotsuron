First Man," Soo boring. and.. Come on!!!
","It was really boring.
And 2 untolerable scene...

The Shape of Water," Good colors, Great sets but poor script.
","I dont like this film as Pan's Labyrinth or Pacific Rim.Because of this very big plot holes : 1 - They are working a secret goverment facility but all cleaners have free pass to all rooms.2 - Why the cleaners all the time in facility ? They are everywhere and everytime and noone couldn't find id akward.3 - Why Dr. Hoffstetler tell the true before he die to Strickland? It's not make sense.4 - Elisa wrote to the calendar : Rain/Dock And Strickland find it very easy. Like 'We are in dock.. come and find us' Really? Seriously ?5 - Why they wait for the rain. They have sea. They can release him to sea not the canal..Okay the colors, music and some scenes is so beatifull. But in the first shot it remembered me Le fabuleux destin d'AmÃ©lie Poulain. Same color palette.Im sorry but this is the worst film of Guillermo del Toro after the Mimic for me..",5,3,4,3 March 2018
