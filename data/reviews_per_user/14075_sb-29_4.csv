Skyfall," Massive Spoilers Ahead
","Here's my condensed review for the ADD society we have become.What's good about it:.1. New Q.2. Ralph Fienes as future new M.3. Old Aston Martin cameo.4. Shanghai and Macau scenes photography.5. Scenic photography of Scotland.6. Nice London tube scenes and stunts.7. Honest portrayal of UK weather.8. Half decent motorbike chase at beginning.9. Good music.What's bad about it:.1. Ridiculous Villain (acting, makeup, you name it).2. Too serious, not enough fun.3. Nothing we haven't seen before happens.4. No decent cars or gadgets.5. This Bond is looking too old already, never liked him anyway.6. Bond girls were super average.7. Villain had no decent evil plan.Overall pretty unsatisfying, which has pretty much been the case since Craig took over the role.I'm sure it'll still make baskets of money though.Mission Impossible 4 was a way better 'Bond movie' in every way.For the next one how about:.1. Clive Owen as 007 (which he has always wanted).2. Mark Strong as the evil villain.3. Spielberg to direct (which he wanted in the past).4. Aaron Sorkin for the screenplay.5. Emily Browning (tarted up like Sucker Punch) as the bond girl.Now that's something I would pay to see. :-)",6,2,7,13 November 2012
Nacho Libre," Couldn't get to the wrestling bit.... so bad !!!!!
","OK... I usually reckon you can spot what's going to be a really entertaining movie in the first 3 minutes. e.g. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Superbad, Die Hard 4, Kingdom, Norbit (even!)In the first 3 mins of this garbage I was suspicious, after 10 mins puzzled. When does the comedy start I asked myself ? After 30 mins I was just thinking... hang on, what are the IMDb boys thinking of this garbage ?? Is it just me ?? So after checking the rating of 5.7 and seeing a few pages of obviously fake good reviews from the people behind this movie, I then found the endless stream of 1 star, 1 star, 1 star, 1 star...Aha.... yes ! The true depth of this movie, total garbage. I'm just getting to the wrestling part now as I write this... still not funny in the slightest. For goodness sake don't even *consider* renting or purchasing this movie. I'm going to turn it off now. And hell, I liked Norbit, School for Scoundrels, and even the Big Momma movies, so I'm certainly NOT a tough crowd. :-) If ya want a good, silly movie, go see Balls of Fury instead ! Even if you don't find it funny, you can at least gawk at Maggie Q for a couple of hours. Shaun",1,3,8,19 February 2008
Up," Yes, finally quite a failure for Pixar
","Pixar, used to creating $200m hits were sure to slip one day and this is for sure it. I'm sure there will be a lot of investigations and soul- searching going on after this mess. The film's basic idea is pretty lame, and then the execution is even worse. There were certainly some promising moments in the film. The couple's cute life in silent mode, the almost cute dog with his squirrel distractions. But they were more than overshadowed by the distractions like the Bird ???, the super-explorer turned villain and the little kid.All in all quite a disaster, its like it was done by the Pixar trainees without one touch of supervision from the people who made the studio's mega blockbusters.As an aside, I'm not sure IMDb can do much, but the fake high ratings and fake great reviews for this movie are unprecedented. But when your a studio with x million dollars to invest in marketing, hiring 50 interns for 4 months to write comments for you makes a lot of sense. But of course, as with any useless movie on IMDb. Go to the first entered 4 pages of comments to see the *real* opinions.Don't be fooled, this movie is a disaster, and not your Finding Nemo or Wall-E.",4,5,12,11 September 2009
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Disney Star Wars. Good Enough.
","Just got back from a pretty early showing in Manila. The real winner here was the production design and art direction which beautifully created an up to date version of the star wars universe whilst lovingly staying faithful to everything from the earliest movies. Together with the awesome special effects and locations the movie looked stunning. Unfortunately the story and the concepts in the movie just really felt like a remake of episode iv (the original 77 movie). Many of the key elements were simply redone. As for twists and turns just think of any long running soap and you'll have an idea. The music also had some nice new pieces mingled in with the main themes. Basically this is Disney star wars nostalgia and we'll never get tired of whatever is dished up. In the same way as the 007 franchise, we will whine a little and then continue to watch the next one. Just the music themes and the sound of droids bleeping, phasers blasting, and dark lords breathing heavy will give us a rush no matter what.",7,12,28,16 December 2015
