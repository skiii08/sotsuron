Howl's Moving Castle," A beautiful film!
","When I first watched this film I did so on cable and with no real enthusiasm, since I seemed like it was a Spirited Away rip-off. The view of the film is very similar.However, I fell in love with the story, more so than I did with Spirited Away, it had a more grown-up aspect to it and it was still as magical as Spirited away.A story about courage, dealing with what you're given and it's so romantic that keeps you touched all the way through and allows you into the fantastic world that is Howl's Moving Castle.Maybe not as artistic in the making as Spirited away (although it's very artistic on its own), but I find the story just as beautiful or even more so. The movie looks well, it'll keep you entertained and it's not very long either, not slow-paced at all and simply beautiful to watch.",9,1,2,3 July 2007
Grave of the Fireflies," OK, i was depressed for a week
","OK, the only thing i can think of to say is that if you're about to see this movie, grab a tissue or something, it is one of the saddest anime or movies for that matter, ever. I surely recommend it, absolutely touching in an exhausting way, you'll cry your heart out get frustrated at the fact that there are a lot of things to be done to prevent the turning of events, and yet all you can do is watch as they happen anyway. Beautiful, without big effects or a lot of anime tech, just simple and sweet. I recommend this to everyone who watches anime movies to be touched by them, this one you won't forget in a while. Well deserved critics, it's a wonderful movie. I give it a ten...",10,6,9,9 January 2005
The Dark Knight," My mind is BLOWN!!!
","This was the perfect way to bring a superhero movie to a non superhero world. They made it so that you could believe that this could happen at any time. How do you do that? Well... a couple of aspects were put into place: First, write a wonderful script that explains how everything happens. Bit by bit, nothing left to wander. Also about the script I should say that it helped a lot that a lot of mini-stories were played together so you wouldn't be bored for a second, and you will be very busy following everything that's going on, story-wise, because every bit is important and there are no filler moments. It almost gets to a point were you don't want to blink to miss what's going on. Try not to.The next aspect, to bring it to play. And in this, we have to take into account that even a good story (and specially a superhero story) could turn out ridiculous if badly developed. Great directing by Nolan leaving you busy at every second of the way, so that when the action wasn't catching your attention (and few moments it wasn't) the character development was, and more times than not, everything was happening at the same time. The casting was a dangerous part too, and risky, casting Ledger to fill in the shoes of Nicholson, and to everyone's surprise, well.. it has been the best joker ever! and in this influenced the fact that Ledger was strictly prepared for the role and it showed, and the character was fairly better portrayed, in the script, and in action. It was as sick as you'd expect and yet he didn't take himself too seriously, you almost felt like sharing some of the fun he was having. But even so, he wasn't the only one in the spotlight. In that sense, you can remind yourselves of movies like 'Ocean's eleven' or 'The Departed' in which everyone played their part and got enough screen time not to make the movie just about one. This movie is about Batman (more so than about Bruce Wayne), it's about Harvey Dent (and he portrays brilliantly the role, one to surely remember), it showed the human side of things, by the hands of Gordon, Rachel Dawes (who is so much better and a refreshing change this time around) and in the hands of all the secondary characters, that cement the whole ensemble. If you're looking for action sequences, you won't be disappointed either, this movie delivers. You'll find it to be a 'slice of life' movie, in an alternate reality that you'll certainly find believable and will identify with. If you look beyond the action and superhero gimmicks you'll also find the deep political critique behind the story, and the struggle that everyone feels, between wrong and right, every character in this movie is faced with the choice, and it's what they choose, that we can all relate to.It's a must see. I give it a ten.",10,7,16,13 August 2008
V for Vendetta," I was simply amazed
","When I first went to see this movie, I wasn't familiar with the 'v' novel or anything, and I figured it was an action-packed-two hour and so- movie, that I had to watch because my boyfriend wanted to. The truth is, I never expected it to be first of all, so weird, dark and engaging and to be so character driven. You get everything from this movie. Yes, there are bangs, and they're pretty cool. There's drama, a lot. They keep the story going every minute so you won't get bored. There's a love story and a lot of character development, as you see each character grow with the choices they make. Because in all, it's a movie about choices, and how they can change the course of things.Natalie Portman is excellent in this movie, one of her best roles to my knowledge, V is flawless, and although the dialog could use a little less 'brittish-ism' it does sound kinda funny when they say the colorful things they say.Finally, it's also a movie that makes you wonder. Places a scenario that is very likely to happen and although the world is fictional, it's portrayed so real, that you walk out of the theater wondering if it'll come to be any time soon. It's definitely a movie to recommend.",10,1,3,6 May 2006
