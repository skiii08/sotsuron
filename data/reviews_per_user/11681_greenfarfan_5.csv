Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The Bride is back!
","If you watched Kill Bill: Vol. 1, then you practically have to see Kill Bill: Vol. 2 because it's no ordinary movie sequel. In fact, it is more of a continuation to an unfinished movie. Where the first Kill Bill film had chapters 1-5, the second film contains chapters 6-10. And by watching Kill Bill Vol. 2, you get any unanswered questions Volume 1 had. The second half of Tarantino's 4th film will essentially give satisfaction to its viewers. Volume 1 was the more action- packed/exhilarating part, in which Volume 2 is the more drama-filled/emotional part. However, it is better not to think of Kill Bill as two separate parts because when it comes down to it, Volumes 1 & 2 are just a means of presenting this film into two halves. In the end, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill should be considered as one long, epic, martial arts, revenge-film. So if you liked Vol. 1, Vol. 2 is a must-see.",10,1,2,10 November 2016
Inglourious Basterds," A World War 2 film like none other.
","Unlike most movies about World War 2, Inglourious Basterds shows an alternate version of what went down in history. That's right, Quentin Tarantino made a film that says, 'Imagine this happened instead'. Split into 5 different chapters that perfectly divide each section of the film, Inglourious Basterds introduces the major and important characters of the story, as well as why and how they have to do with the movie's plot until the climax hits in the final chapter. Though the cast members did a great job, the one person that stole the show was actor Christoph Waltz. His portrayal as Colonel Hans Landa was superb making the character one of the most memorable movie villains in recent film. But Waltz's character wasn't the only memorable thing. The film's scenes that are both funny and tense is what also makes Inglourious Basterds stand out from other war movies.",10,1,3,17 October 2016
The Hateful Eight," Another Quentin Tarantino masterpiece!
","When it comes to filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, you have to expect the unexpected. But then again, 'unexpected' is something you can't except. That's one of Tarantino's best traits. You don't know what your going to get before watching one of his films however, you do know that it's going to be one hell of a movie. The Hateful Eight is a testament to that. With it's outstanding dialogue, excellent music, and impressive performances, The Hateful Eight is much more than just 3 hours of talking and violence. It's brilliant and powerful, arguably making it the best movie of 2015. Not to mention the fact that Mr. Tarantino decided to show this film in a special roadshow event presented in 70MM, making for quite the experience.",10,1,3,14 October 2016
Django Unchained," Probably the best slavery movie ever made.
","Writer and Director Quentin Tarantino took the topic of slavery and mixed it with the western genre in which 'Django:Unchained' was made. This film tells the story of a black slave in America named Django who is confronted by a German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz. The two characters make a deal that leads to the plot of the film, turning the story into a tale of drama, violence, and love. Keep in mind this is a Tarantino movie. If you know any of his films, then you know you're in for one hell of a ride. Django:Unchained is an action-packed historical/western film that reveals the harsh reality of slavery in America. The performances by the cast were outstanding; particularly Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson and the directing couldn't have been better.",10,1,4,17 October 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Oh revenge . . . sweet, bloody revenge.
","Kill Bill: Volume 1 is the first half of a two-part epic revenge film that leaves you excited too see the 2nd volume after watching it. 'Revenge is a dish best served cold'. Well, one can truly see where that quote is coming from after watching a film like this one. We all know violence is a big factor in Quentin Tarantino movies. But after witnessing the amount of blood and gore Kill Bill has, Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs or Django Unchained don't seem so violent. Sure, the brutal action plays a major part in this film however; it's not just that. It's the gripping characters, the memorable quotes, Lucy Liu & Uma Thurman's performances, and of course, the storyline that makes Kill Bill Vol. 1 definitely worth watching.",10,1,4,10 November 2016
