Come and See," And I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder...
","Come and See (1985)**** I first saw this movie a couple of years ago. I didn't really know what to think of it at first. The soundtrack on the DVD is a little messy and the acting was a bit strange. I knew it had affected me though in a way that not many other movies had. As time went by I began to realize just how much of an impact the movie had on me. It really, really stuck with me. One night, while writing a review of Errol Morris's latest documentary 'Fog of War', I found myself thinking more and more about Come and See, and decided that I had to watch it again immediately. I ran out after midnight and rented it, and watched it 3 times or so over the next week. I started to see why the film had been haunting me and sticking around my thoughts. The reason was that this movie is simply a masterpiece.Elem Klimov directs the film, starring Aleksei Kravchenko as Florya, a young boy who desires to fight with the Partisan's army against the invading Nazi army. He digs until he finds a rifle, then the next day he is off to a camp in the middle of the woods. The scene is chaotic it seems and unorganized. The fighters try to take a photo that takes about 5 minutes to accomplish because everyone keeps messing up their positions. Florya spots Glasha (Olga Mironova), a young girl, who has the younger fighters swooning over her, and who also seems to have some sort of relationship with the leader of the camp. What that relationship is exactly we never find out. Florya gets left behind on the attack because he is perhaps too young, and besides another older fighter needs some new boots, and swaps with the new kid. .The anxious Florya is upset by this decision and he takes to the woods for some solitude, he cries and then discovers that near by Glasha is also crying at being left at the camp, more so for being left alone than behind. The two begin to bond and end up in an open field when German planes attack and begin to bomb the encampment. The scenes that follow next teeter on the brink of madness on film. Come and See is likely one of the most maddening films ever made for that matter. The key is the soundtrack. Florya is struck deaf for a few moments by the bombs. Sounds are muffled, but not like anything you've ever seen in a Hollywood film. The soundtrack is a mix of strange ringing and sounds and music, adding to the atmosphere of chaos that the two youngsters have now been thrown into. Much of the film has this style of soundtrack, which makes the Florya's descent into madness much more poignant.The film movies forward from here back to Florya's village which has now been deserted. The two head to an island on the other side of a bog where Florya believes the town is hiding along with his mother and sisters. The scene where they climb through the mud is another example of Florya losing his mind. The soundtrack again becomes ambient and menacing in its strange blends of sounds. They eventually find some villagers and Florya now even more loses his sanity, along with some of his hair, which is given to recreate a statue of Hitler. This will be the last time we see Glasha in the movie, as Florya goes with a party to collect food for the starving people.The most famous scene, and the one that will likely never leave you, is of a village being ransacked by Nazi soldiers. The scene is chaotic and culminates in a barn stuffed with the townspeople being burned and shot apart. Another one of the most famous shots from the movie is of Florya shooting a photo of Hitler, each bullet making time reverse. The photo goes back in time until it is a picture of Hitler as a baby on his mothers lap. He is an innocent infant, and Florya cannot bring himself to fire another shot. These shots are incredibly powerful and they stick in your mind.Obviously, Come and See was filmed with influences of Soviet Propaganda in it, but it hardly matters because it is so well made and so maddening you can't help but be totally absorbed by the experience. The movie has a hypnotic quality about it, and without being horrifying because it's a jump out of your seat surprise bloodbath, it is horrifying in its representation of the cruelty people are capable of in war.I can't remember ever seeing another film that expressed the descent into madness any better and being so involving as Come and See. By the end of the film, you feel like you've just experienced what it must be like to lose your mind. The film never goes into the desensitizing of violence in war. Instead it focuses on the violence which causes those who witness to become desensitized from the madness of its cruelty.Elem Klimov created this film out of his actors and their emotions, and essentially used the viewer as another character. This movie draws you in and makes you experience exactly what the characters must. There are few other films that do that to you, especially to the extent that this one does it. And for that, Come and See is not only a masterpiece, it's really one of the best films you'll ever see. Find it, but don't just watch it. Allow it to take you in; even if that means you have to see it a couple times. Let it take you in, and you're in for an experience rarely found in cinema anymore",10,93,120,25 September 2006
The New World," With all deliberate speed- over your head and under your feet
","The New World: ****Terrence Malick's fourth film in thirty-two years is 'The New World.' It's based upon the John Smith/Pocahontas tales, but this is no live action Disney production. Malick wrote the script back in the 70's and finally puts it on film here in 2005(6). Pocahontas is played by newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher, in a wonderful turn as Pochahontas. Colin Farrell, plays John Smith, doing probably his strong work. And of no big surprise, Christian Bale also does some of his best work here playing the future husband of Pocahontas (or Rebbecca as the English rename her). None of the actors here really have a lot of dialog to work with, so Malick has them express and convey their emotions through body language. It works to magnificently. Some people clearly were bored with the movie due to this reason, but this isn't your average film. It reaches out and wants to make you feel like you are really there. And the fact that there is little dialog, outside of Malick's trademark voice overs, makes this possible. You don't have overly talky situations in real life, and often the most meaningful gestures are expressed without words. Nothing is said here for the purpose of filler.Just like every other Malick film, 'The New World' is chalk full of symbolism. Just as every word spoken on screen is full of meaning, every image Malick inserts in his film means something. Most movies take the easy way out and explain these things for you in the end. Not Malick. He relies on his imagery to tell his hidden philosophical points. Emmanuel Lubezki takes the reins on the camera and does a beautiful job. With each film Malick has used a different cinematographer, but his visual style is always evident. Crew members have often spoke of Malick's almost preternatural understanding of cinematography. The look of his films are his own. He establishes dogmas of cinematography: for The New World, only steadicam or hand-held shots were to be used, and the cameraman was encouraged to move on his own to find the rhythm of the shot, among other things. This movie is not for everyone. Malick's movies, all four of them, move very slowly. But they do so with all deliberate speed. Malick has a way of lulling you into almost a hypnosis with his flowing camera movements and editing style. It makes you feel closer to the real story, and it does make his movies feel longer than they actually are, in that rarely positive way. They draw you in so that you are there, in that world. If you have it in you to allow yourself to be taken in, the payoff to be found is deeply rewarding.The plot to 'The New World' is easy enough. Everyone will get the basic pattern here. Understanding the big picture, however, is a whole other story. Malick, more-so than many other directors, has a way of getting under your feet and over your head. This is very frustrating for many people who are expecting a classic narrative style. For those with the willingness to allow Malick to take you in and let the film run over you, then 'The New World' will be unforgettable.",10,8,17,24 January 2006
Frost_Nixon," It's Your Life, Mr. President
","Frost/Nixon (2008) ***1/2His most lasting legacy, as a character in the film suggests, is the the use of 'gate' as a suffix for every political blunder since his own. Richard Nixon was not a delusional man - he likely recognized this as well. We all make mistakes, but his was broadcast widely and cost him the American Presidency. We all know how affecting our greatest blunders are to us - imagine the effect it must Nixon's must have had on him. Given the comparably larger scale, I suspect it must have been devastating. The new film adaptation of Peter Morgan's much admired play, Frost/Nixon, is rooted firmly in its performances and screenplay. Michael Sheen plays David Frost, the British television host who coaxed Richard Nixon into exercising his guilt in a series of interviews. Frost was at the time living in almost a form of entertainment exile, banished to Australia, though still successful. He was something of a playboy, something of a joker. When he proposed interviewing the disgraced former president, he was balked at. He was a variety brand host, not a serious journalist or seasoned interviewer. Nixon would eat him alive. But he persisted, and put it all together, largely out of his own pocket. Nixon, played with shocking embodiment by Frank Langella, and his people accepted, due in part to the $600 thousand payday, and in even larger part because they agreed with the general consensus - Nixon would eat this joker alive.And so he did for most of their sessions. Nixon routinely circumvented questions with anecdotes and hyperbole, with Frost allowing him to ramble without response. But Frost, though disheartened, never gave up, and kept doing his homework. To help him was his friend and producer, John Birt (Matthew Macfadyen), Bob Zelnick (Oliver Platt), and James Reston Jr. (Sam Rockwell). While David spends much of his time away promoting films he's produced, or courting potential advertisers, his three wise men cram and plan their attack. Reston Jr has already written four books about Nixon, and has a hunch about a key date and meeting early in the film which turns out to be the key to breaking Nixon down. On the other side, Nixon is almost never without his right hand man, Jack Brennan (Kevin Bacon). He believes in Nixon to the end, in his righteousness, and wants to protect him from further attacks. The film, directed by Ron Howard, uses an interesting technique. It's structured as a documentary, right down to the retrospective interviews with those involved. In a way, it's sort of a mockumentary, but sincere and without the satire or slapstick. I was slightly off put at first, wondering perhaps if this would have been better as a documentary, but it works out pretty quickly thereafter. After a while I was actually looking forward to these moments. And although the subject would make a fascinating documentary, Frost/Nixon has something that a documentary would not be able to attain - Nixon himself. Nixon was reviled at the time, hated by nearly all. Frost/Nixon and Frank Langella do not make Nixon an evil man, but a stubborn man, dedicated to his predilections. What he considered moral and just were misguided, but he was not evil. He was simply a man who made many mistakes, not least of which the abuse of his power. Most films would have taken the easy road and turned the interviews into some sort of revenge themed tale - the horrible Nixon defeated and embarrassed by a television fluff host. Frost/Nixon does not. Instead, thanks especially to Langella's powerhouse performance, we're made to empathize with the man. We don't have to sympathize with someone to criticize them, bu we ought at least empathize. How else could we even begin to comprehend what we ourselves would have done if placed in the same situation? What makes Frost/Nixon work is the two lead performances by Sheen and Langella. Both actors played their roles in Peter Morgan's play, and seem to wear their characters like an old pair of pants. Frank Langella is the great highlight of the film. His Nixon is startlingly transcending - not necessarily because he looks like or sounds just like the real Nixon, but because he so profoundly embodies the man's soul. When he elaborates on his misdeeds, it seems almost more because that soul is so tortured, the weight of guilt burdened too heavily on his shoulders, than because he has been outwitted.",Null,1,5,14 December 2008
Walk the Line," Walks a fine line....
","Walk the Line: ***.5* (3.5)'Walk the line' opens in the dull and drab atmosphere outside Folsom Prison. A faint echo of music cuts through the air barely recognizable. We move inside and see the band play while Johnny Cash (Jaoquin Pheonix) runs his fingers along a saw blade. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie as we flash back to Johnny's childhood, and then move forward until we catch up with the beginning. Pheonix captures perfectly the spirit of Johnny Cash. This should be no surprise as Cash chose Phoenix to play the role in the first place. As a child we hear Johnny listening to the Carters on his radio, quizzing his older brother Jack on which Carter is singing. 'Thats June' says Johnny. And, as we all know, Johnny meets June and is immediately smitten with her, if not in love with her. June Carter is played by Reese Witherspoon in what is far and away her best role yet, and possibly ever. That is just how good she is in this film. Phoenix also does some of his best work here, but its no surprise as he is a wonderful actor. Whats is surprising though, is that both Phoenix and Witherspoon sing every song. And they absolutely nailed it. That is part of the mystique of their performances. It is one thing to nail your character, its another to nail their songs. And, boy, do they nail their characters. Last years big music movie was 'Ray' which garnered a lot of attention for Jamie Foxx. Phoenix far and away out does him here. Watching 'Ray' I saw Jamie Foxx playing Ray Charles. In 'Walk the Line' I saw Johnny Cash on film. While both 'Ray' and 'Walk the line' are fairly conventional, 'Line' is definitely the better movie. Walk the Line overcomes its conventionality with spot on performances from Phoenix and Witherspoon. Its a conventional film without seeming so. The concert scenes are fantastic, whether you're a cash fan or not. This movie sweeps you off your feet and into the life of one of the greatest music icons of all time. 'Walk the Line' walks a fine line and never over steps it. This is one of the funnest movies of the year for sure, especially if you love Johnny Cash's music. 8.5/10",8,1,2,14 January 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Great Camera work and imagery, yet almost absent storyline.
","Requiem for a Dream: ***The Camera work of Requiem for a Dream is interesting and wonderful. Arnofsky uses split screens at times which was something not often seen, and fast moving sequences in which the drugs are taken. Very slick stuff, even if it becomes repetitive. Aside from the interesting visual experience to be found in 'Requiem' there isn't much else to be had. The story line is marginal and though this is perhaps intentional, it offers us little in regards to sympathy for the characters. The only person I felt for throughout the movie was Sarah, the mother. Ellen Burstyn does a fantastic job here and makes her character seem real. You will feel sorry for her. As for Leto's, Wayan's, and Connelly's characters, I certainly felt very little, if not nothing at all. They bring about the products of their own demise. We learn somethings about them along the way, but their stories feel forced. Wayans character has a flashback to his childhood with his mother, which has some fantastic cinematography, but it feels pointless and clichÃ©d. We learn that Connelly wants to be a designer but other than her drawing occasionally in between hits, and the attempts of Harry (Leto) to get her to open her own shop, it registers little with us. Harry Goldfarb has one pivotal scene with his mother in which we see that he does love her, and is sorry for pawning off her television regularly for drug money. This scene is far and away the most emotionally involved, and my favorite, scene in the whole movie. I hoped that after such a fantastic scene that this emotion would continue, yet it doesn't. We see Harry's concern for his mothers new found diet pills, yet thats it. He cries afterwards, then it is no longer mentioned. All of these things may very well be intentional, but they take away from the emotions we should feel for all of these people. Seeing Sarah being torn apart and spiraling into insanity was very realistic and it grabs you and punches you in the guts, but not the others. In the end, this movie feels more like a collection of pictures that have been jammed together. Despite these flaws, I'm still giving this movie a 7/10 ( or *** out of four stars if you will) I give it such a grade because this movie puts this collections of pictures together and offers fantastic visions and insight into the mind( or lack of) a drug addict. Most of the scenes are a visual representation of something, and all of such shots are useful and never unnecessary. Thirdly, even if you only feel sympathy for Sarah Goldfarb, you feel so terribly for this character that you literally will feel, I mentioned above, like you've been punched square in the guts. The most important reason however is that this film is important. It is a gritty look at the tortured lives of addicts. It shows how horrible these drugs are, and no sane person will leave this thinking ' gee we should go get high' It will turn you off, and leave you flacid.",7,0,1,16 November 2005
Au Revoir les Enfants," Au Revoir, Louis Malle.
","Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejtö) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.4/4",10,75,78,9 April 2006
Zodiac," Who's the Hurdy Gurdy Man?
","Zodiac (2007) ****Zodiac is a great procedural film that focuses not so much on the crimes of the infamous killer, but the meticulous and frustrating search for him. This is, I think, Fincher's best film. He's is back in the serial killer genre, and he one up's his other near masterpiece Seven. This is a long movie, clocking in at almost 3 hours, but it's never boring. Fincher doesn't overplay the violence, but he doesn't underplay it as well - the murders are brutal, made all the more so by the fact that Fincher manages to make them seem incredibly authentic. Essentially all of the violence is out of the way in the first hour, and then it turns head on into the frustrating process of trying to catch a killer who it turned out to be impossible to catch.. Gyllenhaal is listed as the main character, and he for the most part is, but the films narrative jumps around between Graysmith and the police, headed up by Mark Ruffalo in a career best performance as Dave Toschi. Robert Downy Jr and Anthony Edwards also give some great performances.Even though the big 'scares' are out of the way early, Fincher finds ways to add tension to the small moments, which are very nice. Even though Gyllenhaal doesn't quite have the right look in my opinion, he does give a good performance that despite doubts was believable enough. The films huge strength is in its great story telling, and very solid direction from Fincher. He doesn't resort to the camera tricks of his past films, but he works some great cinematography in a more subtle and far more effective way. Not to mention a great soundtrack used the perfection.Zodiac is one of the best American films so far this year, and even though it's not making a big box office splash, looks for this one to garner a lasting reputation.4/4",10,3,5,25 March 2007
Once," Once upon a time, a guy met a girl.
","Once (2006) ****A minimalist musical. It sounds an oxymoron. Alas it is not, it is John Carney's charming 'Once.' Carney directs the picture with no more and no less than what is necessary. This is an admirable choice for an indie film - a category that has come to be muddled with flash and pizazz cinematography. It is also admirable in that Carney takes his seat at the back, unnoticed, and allows his two leads, Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, to take front and centre. The film belongs to them and their music. The story opens as the guy (Hansard) busk's, chases a man who is apparently a friend stealing his money, and then after dark when he can play his own songs (for people only pay for what they already know) he is questioned by a young woman, Girl (Irglova). Names are never given. She asks him what the songs are about - his ex he says. Where is she, girl says. She's gone, guy says. Why don't you go get her in London, girl asks? He converses with her, to his slight annoyance, and tells her that his official job is working in his father's vacuum shop. Great she says, I will take you my hoover and you can fix it for me tomorrow. Sure enough she shows up, dragging her hoover behind her as if she is walking a dog. Its strange, amusing and surprisingly charming. He tries to get out of it, saying he doesn't have his tools and that he is going on break. She persuades him to allow her to come along and he can just have a look at it. She tells him that she is a musician as well, a pianist, but that she cannot afford a piano, so she plays for an hour every day at a local music shop. They go, he listens to her, she persuades him to teach her one of his songs. This will be the first time they play together, and we get the feeling immediately that there is something special. After fixing her vacuum back at the shop, at his fathers house where he lives, they go upstairs and listen to his tapes. He asks her to stay. Surprisingly she seems offended and shocked and leaves. After apologizing the next day, he finds that she has a daughter. After a motorcycle ride, he finds out she has a husband back in the Czech Republic. He asks her how to say 'Do you love him,' in 'the Czech.' She tells him, he repeats it back to her as a question. She responds in Czech, and refuses to translate. She persuades him that he should go to London, seek out his ex, and pursue his music career. First he must get a professional recording. After securing a bank loan, from an unexpected and hilarious loan officer, he recruits fellow buskers and girl to join him. The music they create is beautiful enough to sway the jaded producer. Their feelings become obvious to us - he asks her to come with him to London, she says she has to take her mother and child if that was the case and they both realize its not possible. They complete their recordings, the music acting as the medium into which they channel their emotions for one another, the guy buys his ticket to London with encouragement from his father on his music, and she tells him that her husband is coming to Ireland to work things out for the sake of their child. Thats great, guy says. That Marketa Irglova and Glen Hansard fell in love in real life gives more poignancy to the story, and adds that much of punch by the time the inevitable must occur. The film breaks conventions not only of musicals but of romance. It is another example of how sometimes the most romantic movies of all can end up unresolved. Think of Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love. In neither film will you see the leads kiss, and there is barely an embrace. But the emotion is there, and that makes them all the more powerful and painful.Once is about the love you feel, but cannot express. Guy and Girl have the rare opportunity to channel their emotions through music. Right from the get go, it is established that Guy is a broken soul, he has been writing about and yearning for his ex. Girl shows up and represents something new, and we find too that she is a broken soul. Once breaks down the standards of movie musicals as bombastic and entertaining spectacles, and instead shows us how music can be at once the bemoaning of our pain, and the mending of our souls.",Null,3,4,16 October 2007
Forrest Gump," An Odyssey into Modern America
","Forrest Gump (1994) ****Forrest Gump is the sappiest of melodramas, but it is also a wonderfully made and wonderfully touching film. Everyone of course knows the plot of the film, so I won't bother discussing that. Robert Zemeckis' talents as a special effects filmmaker are astounding, and the effects in Forrest Gump are no less than incredible. Such as the scenes in which he meets a number of presidents in archival footage, and his address of a peace rally in Washington. The film seems to have either a love it or hate it following. What surprises me most though is the extreme hate and overreading that some people have regarding the film. Some critics have claimed that the film is 'mawkishly conservative,' and triumphs the idea that ignorance is bliss. The biggest shame is that the film has been politicized - it is not political, it is human. I am inclined to agree with Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel's interpretation in suggesting that the movie is about how America has never come to terms with its historical past, and is not about neglecting things such as the Vietnam war. It is not about following rules, or suggesting that if you're a hippie you will become a drug addict or anything like that. The movie is simply about the journey that life is. To politicize the film is to present an element to the film which was never there to begin with. Forrest Gump is simply a story about humanity. I've never understood the 'ignorance is bliss' comments. The film has nothing to do with that. Like the politicization of the film, so too is this an element brought in by critics which was never part of the film. The picture is about the reaffirmation of life. Forrest Gump is not a smart man, but just because he is not smart does not mean that he cannot succeed in life. This is a problem that i have with many liberal academics, and I say this as a left wing academic myself, wherein uneducated or unintellectual people are regarded as failures and placed on a pedestal far lower than they place themselves upon. One does not need to be intelligent to be enlightened, and enlightenment is not an intrinsic characteristic of intelligence. Forrest Gump is a magical and touching human dramedy. Take it for what it is, and what it is is a much smarter film than people give it credit for. Its a wonderful movie, and its shame that its been politicized because of its historical odysseys.",10,1,3,12 May 2008
Fargo," A freezing fable of stupidity
","Fargo: ***.5*Fargo is a strange little movie. It is, in my opinion, the Cohen Brothers best film. It deals with a very serious subject, yet somehow it does so without taking itself overly serious. There is a very realistic quality to be found here- The subject matter is dark, yet there is a crack of light shining through always. The conversations are spot on with how they would probably be spoken in real life. McDormands character, the pregnant Marge, is the persistent pursuer but she is not obsessive like so many other movie clichéd 'good guys' are when it comes to catching their adversary. She is involved, but remains detached, just as 95% of real cops will be. You see it clearest in the conversations she has with her fellow officers; husband, and just about everyone else she speaks to. You really feel that she is, as her character says during an interview, just doing her job. This realism is not just present in Marge, but in every character. None are over the top, though the accents are probably slightly exaggerated.Jerry and his cronies are stupid. We never really find out Jerry's original troubles, but we are front row center for the idiocy that follows. There are no super intelligent characters which you find in many other crime dramas. There is only those who have some wits and common sense, and those who are helplessly daft.Personally, I loved this movie. It's quirky; it's real; it's charming; and its just plain fun (though bordering on the edge of painful) to watch this freezing fable of stupidity unfold. I did however feel that the ending was a little rushed, but this is not really a bad thing. I felt that the scene of Marge with her friend Mike in the city could have been removed, and that time could have gone to filling out the ending a little more. All in all, this nitpick is rather insignificant, and does little, if nothing at all to distract from the quality of the movie. I wanted to give this movie a 10, but it is lacking something, i don't know what, which is preventing me from giving it so. I also feel that it deserves more than a nine: 9.5/10",9,13,19,4 December 2005
Ratatouille," A Feast For All
","Ratatouille (2007) ****I'm not sure why, but I just can't allow myself to give Ratatouille anything less than full marks. As far as creativity in roles goes, its pretty standard dealing with humans (nothing new to animation there) and talking rats (linguistic rodents, been there done that). There are no talking cars or monsters or fish or super heroes. Ratatouille is an example of a classic storyline overhauled and directed at adults and children all the like. This IS a movie for everyone, young and old, rich or poor. To top it off, its without a doubt the most brilliantly piece of animated work I have ever seen. The movie is at once elitist and proletarian. It takes the lowest of all creatures, rats, and uses them to defend intelligence and quality and at the same time ridicules snobbery. It makes the rats cute, but at the same time still unsettling, especially when seen in packs. The film opens in the French country side, with a rat named Remy, our hero, jumping out of a window and then a freeze frame of him with glass smashing around him in mid air. Sound familiar movie buffs? It should. A direct homage to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. This is just the first of many salutes to other films right up to Usual Suspects.Remy gets separated from his clan and ends up in ol' Paris, which is stunningly animated right from the Eiffel Tower to the rotary and the cobble stones. To make a long review shorter, he meets up with the imagined ghost of the great Gusteau, who's motto 'everyone can cook' inspires the young rat. He is lead to Gusteau's restaurant, which has faded since his death, and is now run by a short temperamentally authoritarian chef. Remy manages to befriend a new kitchen worker named Linguini, who may or may not be Gusteau's son, who cannot cook unless Remy hides under his hat and uses some very interesting puppetry. Ratatouille takes classic character types and strips them down and removes the clichés and manages to deliver the unexpected. The film also takes those characters, their surroundings and the food they use to create their meals and animates then in absolutely stunning fashion. Every little detail is noted, from the look of a wet rats fur right down to the beats of water on fresh vegetables. The animation is nothing short of incredible.Yes, Ratatouille uses big words that kids won't get - they will however get the point - and that is because this film is first and foremost, I think, for adults. The kid factor is just a side pot. The films defining monologue comes from a critic, who acknowledges the ultimate insignificance of a critics work, yet retorts that their work is made worth while by being able to influence people to try something, if even only a few. It also acknowledges that though not everyone can be great, greatness truly can come from anywhere. This monologue is perhaps the best ever given in an animated film. Like the rest of the movie, it delivers its point in eloquent fashion, but does it easily enough that a child can understand what its getting at. The movie is not overly hilarious . Its not always going for those big laughs. It finds joy in going for big payoffs in quality. Its a great story, and it never forces itself to be funny. That said, don't think that this movie isn't a laugher, there are lots of good little jokes that will have you smiling. And after all, its often more pleasant to just sit there smiling from ear to ear often than busting a gut occasionally.And that is what makes Ratatouille so great. It truly is a film that manages to be ageless; defend quality through the lowest ranks while damning elitist snobs. The critic's monologue was right: We can't all be great, but greatness can come from anywhere. And Bird and his team at Pixar chose the least likely of creatures to carry out that message, and I'll tell you, those rats get the job done.4/4",10,4,6,3 July 2007
No Country for Old Men," Said he was going' to hell. Reckoned he'd be there in about 15 minutes
","No Country for Old Men (2007) ****When I first reviewed the Cohen Brothers' Fargo, I was openly aware that I had enjoyed the film and thought it was something excellent. Nevertheless, I was left slightly perplexed with the feeling that something in the movie just didn't quite work enough to give it full marks. I took to ranking the film as 9.5/10 whenever I was asked. Where is that other .5? In 'No Country for Old Men' I found it. Yes, it contains the perfect mixture of its elements  all in balance. The film, adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy, examines the situation which follows after Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin in another excellent turn) discovers a drug deal gone bad in the deserts of Texas. He finds the bodies, the guns, and then the money. He takes some of the guns, all the money, and leaves the bodies behind. He soon realizes that he is being hunted; on one hand by a gang of Mexicans who have something to do with the deal; on the other hand by a ruthless psychopath named Anton Chigurgh (played incredibly by Javier Bardem). Both parties were hired by a rich businessman of sorts (William Root), who in turn hires a bounty hunter (Woody Harrelson) to take care of things when things get out of hand. Also in the mix is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones in anther great performance). He investigates the killings in the desert, and the bodies of others who were unfortunate enough to meet Chigurgh along his hunt for the stolen money. Jones delivers two great monologues in the film. One at the start, off-screen, narrated to Roger Deakin's beautiful cinematography, and the other at the very end of the film as the camera remains steady on his face. These monologues are just two of the marvels of No Country for Old Men. The cinematography is breathtaking; the dialogue superb. Another marvel of delivery in the film is virtually every line of dialogue delivered by Bardem. Consider one scene in which, after being offended by the small talk of a gas station attendant, where he forces the man to call a coin toss. The wager is 'everything,' and though it goes unspoken, the attendant quietly realizes the brevity of the situation. The only issue I take with the film is with some of the lines given to Carson Welles, the bounty hunter played by Woody Harrelson. Some of his lines seem out of place, but that they are delivered so well it hardly matters. That the film makes no real false steps completely erases any other small issues. The film merits some serious artistic credits. Shots, dialogue, editing all have moments of incredible beauty and meaning. The camera work and set up of shots are incredibly well crafted. Things move at a deliberate speed, never too fast, never too slow, and serve to heighten tension to a tee. I was reminded of one of two films this year that blew me away. That film was Bela Tarr's The Man from London. The other was No Country for Old Men. Though the camera shots are never as long or as lingering, some of it's fluid and slow movements reminded very much of Tarr's style. Whether the Cohen's have seen his work or not however is irrelevant. One of the most glorious moments in the film comes as one character makes his final appearance. The framing, the dialogue, and the final slow fade amount to such a great sendoff a better one can not be imagined. The film takes its subject matter more seriously than Fargo did, and contains just the right mix of violence, poetry, odd humor and pathos. Therein lies the .5 missing from Fargo. In that film the mixture was off, not a bad thing but nevertheless after seeing No Country for Old Men I recognized that's what had been perplexing me. The closing monologue by Ed Tom Bell about a dream he had of his father, is one of the most important moments in the film, delivered by its most important character. His final words and the final cut in the film will stay with you: 'And then I woke up.' Cut to black.",10,2,8,3 December 2007
The Love Guru," Love and Comedy, I think not.
","The Love Guru (2008) *1/2I enjoy Mike Myers' work very much. He has been more or less consistently funny throughout his career. Wayne's World and the Austin Powers films are noteworthy comedy classics. He's mastered the fine line between clever stupidity and just outright stupidity - or so you would have thought by now.The Love Guru is almost devoid of any cleverness. Jokes fall flat, and I sadly rarely laughed. Even sadder, I rarely even grinned. The Love Guru may well be a terrible film, but I didn't hate it by any stretch. I was just supremely disappointed. I had low expectations to begin with, so maybe that is why I didn't hate it.Myers is the Guru Pitka, in a surprisingly unfunny turn. He's hired by Jane Bullard (Alba), the Toronto Maple Leafs owner, to recoup their star player, Darren Roanoake. His wife has run off with Jaques Le Grande (Timberlake), and he is distraught. Myers and Alba develop a baffling relationship, and he is on a quest to remove his chastity belt. That's about it for the plot.The jokes are crude, vulgar, and simply not funny most of the time. It's a bad sign when you have your characters laugh more at their jokes than the audience. Chuckles are far and few in between, and mostly come from supporting players. Timberlake has some good moments. His reference to Quebec Pizza had me in stitches, even in the previews. I suspect any other Canadians found this rather amusing, not because the Pizza in Quebec actually comes on poptarts, but because anyone who's ever eaten pizza in Quebec knows that it may as well. Stephen Colbert has a few moments as a commentator as well.Asides out of the way, the film tries to make some attempts at inside pokes and humor regarding the Leafs history (ie, the Ballard curse), but it spends most of its time making penis jokes, which literally come at least once every 5 minutes.I'm sure there is an immature and I assume young audience of teenage boys that will get a big kick out of the onslaught of lowbrow. There is nothing wrong with mindless comedy when its consistently funny, but The Love Guru just isn't. And that, I must confess, is sad for Myers et al.",Null,1,5,29 July 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The Legend of Bob Ford
","The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) A newspaper man in an old John Ford film once proclaimed that when legend becomes fact, you oughta print the legend. Well, they've been printing the legend of Jesse James now for over a hundred years. He's been a Robin Hood at times, a cold blooded killer others. It's the old wild west conundrum: for every tale of outlaw heroism is a tale for outlaw ruthlessness.And now here's a tale that is as decidedly conflicted as the legends themselves. In Andrew Dominic's The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Jesse James is no hero, even shown to kill a man in the same manner that supposedly made Ford a coward. But at the same time, James is also shown to be a doting and loving husband and father. His paranoia has made him ruthless. Though he does now have his reasons to be to be paranoid, its that very paranoia which has alienated those around him.The picture seeks to dissect the legend, not necessarily to get to the facts, but the essence of reality. In a way, it's striving for what Werner Herzog calls ecstatic truth. Though that's not necessarily aimed at James himself, but his assassin, Bob Ford. Yes, that is the legend that is most steeped in hyperbole.Was Ford a coward? The title would lead you to be believe such, but that's the irony. If there has ever been a more matter of fact title, I've not heard it. Some of said the title says it all in this case, but nothing could be further from the truth.Casey Affleck steals the show in his portrayal of Robert Ford, the young man who idolized, then feared, and finally assassinated Jesse James. He gives a mannered but electrifying performance. Brad Pitt portrays Jesse James as a contemplative but quietly menacing man, troubled by his increasing ruthlessness. Sam Rockwell plays close James friend, and brother to Bob, Charlie Ford. Elsewhere, in one of my favourite performances of the film, Paul Schneider plays the outlaw and notorious womanizer Dick Liddel. It's a film full of excellent performances, though none match that of Affleck's.The plot is lingering and lyrical. When the film debuted it played in a four hour version (there have been rumblings about a future release of this version, but other than a few select screenings there have been no solid leads). The picture goes off in different directions, with the ultimate aim of eventually coming back together, but without force or haste.The film opens with a train robbery, the last of older brother Frank James (Sam Shepard) who is weary of Bob. But Jesse takes him along, not so much because he trusts him, but perhaps because he enjoys the flattery of Bob's idolization. Eventually Jesse begins knocking off those who he suspects of going against him. Dick Liddel has been teamed up with another team member working on their own scores. Although he is close with the Fords, he reminds Bob at bullet proof not to betray him.Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner), Jesse's cousin, shows up at the Ford home one snowy winter day. Hite has it out for Liddel, who's living there, after he slept with his father's young new wife. Hite storms the bedroom and he and Dick shoot it out. Just as Hite has Liddel in his sights, Bob pulls the trigger. They must hide that Wood has been killed, knowing that Jesse would kill them for sure now. Slowly, fearfully, and regretfully, the Ford's are enlisted to conspire Jesse's arrest. Only after they it absolutely dire does Bob commit his infamous deed. Though we know it's coming before we even enter the theatre, the assassination scene's grace and poignancy are unexpected. And the way Jesse meets his end prods existential queries. Throughout the film action is frequently narrated in a calm manner by Hugh Ross, often simply telling us in words what is happening in screen. Where in many films that may seem trite, here it feels uniquely transcendental.Director Dominic is not satisfied to simply dissect the legend. The film is, quite frankly, one of the most stunningly beautiful films in recent years. Dominic and Roger Deakens capture the action with an unabashedly artistic eye. Chilling sky blues blend with the golden wheat of Alberta, evoking the aesthetic qualities of Days of Heaven. That film was admittedly a huge influence on the visual style of the picture. Dominic not only shot the film in the same fields, but hired the same costume designer (Patricia Norris). To top off the stunning look and mood of the film is Nick Cave and Warren Ellis' beautiful score. Cave is proving himself not only an immensely talented singer-songwriter, but a wonderful composer as well.If there is one word to describe The Assassination of Jesse James, it is undoubtedly beautiful. Which is not to say that it's all look: the substance is also quite remarkable. The film held me in its grip for every minute of its length. Though I have not read the source material, the storyline and approach to the legends of Jesse James and Bob Ford I suspect owes much to the book. Much of the narration sounds like it may have been taken verbatim from the book.This is a highly ambitious film, and one that I will unreservedly stand behind. There are usually only a few films that hint at a lasting reputation for greatness. I think this is one of them, and that will be recognized in time. And I'll stand by that.",10,3,6,19 October 2008
Gran Torino," Grrrr... I used to be Dirty Harry
","Gran Torino (2008) *** When I saw the preview's for Clint Eastwood's new film Gran Torino, I kind of thought, 'What the hell is this?' Then I looked into it, and found that the film has so far received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Clearly, the advertising for Gran Torino wasn't doing it justice. The truth is that Gran Torino is simply out of sync with the current movie marketing paradigm. The film is a delicious throwback to old school hard boiled tough guy B movies of the 70s and 80s. Eastwood has his tongue planted firmly in cheek, and the end result is a film a helluva lot funnier than could ever be anticipated by the grim growly TV trailers.Eastwood, directing and starring, plays Walt Kowalski, a widowed and grumpy Korean war Veteran. The film begins with Walt's beloved wife's funeral. He grimaces with embarrassment as his materialistic sons arrive with their greedy and inappropriately dressed children. The sons seem to think that their father will get in trouble all alone in his neighborhood, but neither is willing to take him in. He wouldn't leave anyway. When one son later brings him pamphlets for a retirement villa - along with some other comically old-people themed gifts - he has a long scowly growl before throwing him out of the house - on the old man's birthday no less.Walt's neighborhood is now inhabited by immigrant Hmong families. 'Why'd they have to move here?' Walt growls then spits; 'Why is that old white man still living in this neighborhood?' the elderly Hmong lady next door grumbles, then out spittles the old man. The young boy next door, Tau, is something of a push over, and is harassed by his older cousin and his gang banger friends. They persuade him to steal Walt's prized possession - his '72 Grand Torino. Walt catches the boy and he runs off. Tau's cousin and gang return the next night to tell him they'll give him another shot, but a fracas ensues. When it spills onto Walt's grass, that's when he gets angry and pulls his rifle. He stops the fight and scares the gang off. The next day, to his surprise, he's greeted as a hero by his Hmong neighbors. They give him gifts and food he does not want.Walt later stops a group of thugs from harassing Tau's sister, Sue. The girl takes to Walt, and pesters him with invites and friendly conversation. One day Walt finally agrees to go next door to a party. He begins learning about his neighbors and their people, and is shocked by their kindness to find that he has more in common with them than his own two greedy sons. Walt takes Thao under his wing after his family says he must allow the boy to make amends for trying to steal the car. He, of course, becomes fond of the boy. He teaches him how to talk like a man, and gets him a job at a construction firm to toughen him up. After Thao is stopped one day coming home from work by his cousin and the gang, they break some of his tools, leading Walt to react. From there, the violence only escalates.Gran Torino finds lots of little tongue in cheek moments of humor, from Walt's near perpetual grumpiness to his bigotry. He's like Archie Bunker with a hangover. His racial insults are comical in their obvious bigotry. For some reason most of his insults do not seem malicious, but rather almost innocently ignorant. His Hmong neighbors greet his ignorance with amusement. Of course by the end of the film Walt has come to respect those who are different from him, and even comes to terms with himself and his own dark past. He's pestered by the young Parish Priest, who was asked by Walt's wife to keep an eye on her husband, and see that he confesses. Walt refers to him as an overeducated 27 year old virgin, but sees that even though the Priest is young, he's also wise. When Walt tells the priest he knows nothing of death, the priest responds in turn that Walt knows nothing but death.Gran Torino has a lot to say about respecting and understanding each other, while also sticking it to the attitudes of young punks. It's a film that could clearly and probably will be taken the wrong way by many people, just as All in the Family was in its day, even with its ultimate end message. But Gran Torino is cheerfully tongue in cheek.Walt Kowalski is something of a loving parody of Eastwood's bad ass characters of the 70s. He's a geriatric Dirty Harry. It's not an explicit comedy, but it is quite funny - and on purpose. Gran Torino is a genuinely sincere effort from Eastwood to channel his past, and has a little bit of everything, just like a good B movie should.",Null,4,7,21 December 2008
The Illusionist," Abracadabra and Hocus Pocus.
","The Illusionist (2006) *** The Illusionist is a finely crafted and gorgeously photographed film and well acted, if not so well written. Its a twisting and turning fable of magic, murder and deceit. The magic scenes are interesting, and in my opinion the best thing about the film.It's very light fare, with nothing particularly great about it, but if you're willing to accept it as more of a fable then its quite enjoyable.It suffers from some not so great dialogue, and a few incredibly cheesy lines. In the end, The Illusionist is best when it stays away from the love scenes which are poorly done, and sticks to its magic and mystery, which are a nice touch. Many say that they don't care for Phillip Glass's score, but I kind of enjoyed it and it brought something a bit different to what is really a pretty classical narrative.I never really guessed the final outcome, and its quite morally questionable, but for its faults The Illusionist is a pretty, and enjoyable way to spend a couple hours.3/4",Null,0,0,15 March 2007
Transformers," Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots
","Transformers (2007) ***Perhaps its the kid in me. Perhaps its the kid I was; back when I adored the Transformers cartoons and toys. Whatever it is, its not because Michael Bay knows how to craft beautiful art. It might be though because Michael Bay finally kicked the paint can with enough force and accuracy that when it hit the canvas it made some pretty neat patterns. Yes, Transformers has faults and plot holes that an Autobot could fall through. Yes its over stuffed and overblown. Yes its far too long and filled with more product placements than you see during the super bowl. Yes 90% of the dialogue is cheesy and no Michael Bay still cannot direct humans to save his own life. But I'll admit, when I was enjoying Transformers, I enjoyed the hell out of it.Michael Bay, who has arguably directed some of the most awful movies in the world (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) and my choice for the worst (Bad Boys II), has finally done something right. Its too bad that he realized it at some point and kept running a few miles past the finish line with it. The movie starts out with some traditionally cheesy moments and gung ho join the army because we're awesome junk. No big surprise, Bay stuffs in the greatness of the US Army wherever he can. However he does poke some fun at Bush and the US Government's lies. Too bad its regarding Aliens and nothing actually significant. But even the staunch member of the opposition that I am, I was able to ignore it most of the time. When there is humans on screen, when they work its because of one reason only, Shia LaBeouf (Well John Turturro has his moments). He is showing himself to be a great actor, even in the middle of otherwise mediocrity. The movie works because of the Transformers and LaBeouf, and the completely over the top and silly action sequences of which there are many. The CGI is great, but Bay who seemingly realized this flaunts it to the point of exhaustion and tedium. And because of that, Transformers just about overstays its welcome. So much time is put into the final fight, that it feels like they were unsure where to go from there and how to actually end the fight itself, which seems to come quickly considering how long the fight lasts. But for all its faults, Transformers is far and away Bay's best movie. Though if there is a sequel i would much rather see someone else direct. If you go into this with low expectations and in the mood to see popcorn movies at there most buttery, then I think you'll feel you didn't waste your money... well that kid inside you will feel that way.3/4",7,0,1,6 July 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A 'Goodnight' for Clooney
","Goodnight, and Good Luck: ****'Goodnight, and Good Luck,' written and directed by George Clooney with Grant Heslov, is a wonderful portrayal of the battle between Edward R Murrow and Sen. Joeseph McCarthy in the 1950's. This battle has become legendary, and while not every may know Murrow, they certainly have heard of McCarthy. I do not feel unfair to state here that McCarthy was a bully, an intimidator, and quite possibly an unstable man. He terrorized many innocent citizens unjustly, and it is shocking to still see that there are people who support his actions. Yes, it's true. Clooney, who's father was a newscaster, clearly has a handle for the procedures and processes of the early newsrooms. The sets are excellent in showing the tight spaces. The image that comes to mine here is of Clooney, playing Fred Friendly, tapping Murrow's (Strathairn) knee to signal the on-air cue. The performances here are outstanding. Everyone does a fantastic job, especially Strathairn. No one feels out of place, everyone nails their characters and the result is that you actually feel as if you have been put back in time and are watching it unfold all over again. The choice to go black and white for cinematography was perfect. And it works so well, because it enhances the best performance of all in this movie. That performance is of Sen. Joe McCarthy, played by, dum da da da, Sen. Joe McCarthy. The inter-cutting of archive footage works wonderfully here. Why hire an actor, when you capture the mood by using the real man. It was reported that some people walked out of the screenings claiming that the guy playing McCarthy was overacting. Well, he was. McCarthy overacted and overplayed the communist threat and took it out on many people who were never part of that threat, a threat, which was never really a threat to begin with. 'Goodnight, and Goodluck' is one of the better films of the year, and is certainly one of the most important. Not only is this a film about McCarthy, this is a film about values, exploitation, and the misused power of television. Murrow discusses the role of television, and the preference for entertainment over education. What if we did, as he suggests, move some of these prime time entertainment slots and replace them with shows promoting education, political issues and the like? Would we do any more harm to ourselves than to become a little more enlightened on issues that are important to the state of the world? This is one of the films of the year that should not be missed. It is not an isolated piece connected only with Murrow and McCarthy. There are important connections to be made with our society today, and the American war on 'terrorists' and their sympathizers. 10/10, big thumbs up.",10,2,4,16 January 2006
The Dark Knight," It's going to be a long dark night
","The Dark Knight (2008) ****Why so serious, Batman? Well, because it's the way you were meant to be. The Dark Knight is just as its title would suggest - this is a dark, brooding, and maddening film. Lead by an array of characters, Christopher Nolan's new installment weaves, dances, and smashes its way through its story.This time out, Batman of course does battle with the Joker. This is not your Jack Nicholson Joker, nor your campy 60s Joker. Heath Ledger takes the legendary character and turns him into what he was meant to be - a maniacal, socio-psychopathic agent of chaos. He adds moments of humor, indeed, but in the darkest and often most disturbing of manners. Given how many people want to see this, I will waste little time in divulging plot details. Suffice to say that the story by the Nolan brothers and Goyer twists and turns its way through a continuous maze of carnage and chaos, full of surprises and intelligence.This is a long one, clocking in at 2 1/2 hours, but it moves with break neck pace while maintaining nail biting patience. Nolan makes use of tense build-ups, and some chillingly effective moments in the score. The camera work is fantastic, with the camera often weaving and spinning its way through scenes, creating an almost unconscious sense of bewilderment and dizziness.To call The Dark Knight a comic book film is entirely inaccurate. It has more to do with a standard crime thriller (or even a horror film) than standard comic book fare. Which is in no way meant as an insult to comic book films (or comic books). This is simply an observation. Nolan has taken Batman and made him real.Chicago is again used as Gotham, and this time gets even more into the city streets. Action is flanked by towering buildings along narrow city streets, creating a sense of the real down and dirty violence that simply is not afforded by other CGI fantasy cities. Even Batman Begins is nowhere near the level of realism presented by Gotham here. The entire film is shot with the hand and eye not just of a true filmmaker, but a great one. Christopher Nolan has breathed entirely new life into the Batman legacy, which was once almost doomed to camp and cornball antics in the 90s. This is such a dark, gritty, and mesmerizing experience, one that transcends the boundaries of standard filmgoing experiences, and literally makes you feel like you are there. Nolan deserves all the praise in the world for taking on a pop culture project and turning it into an intelligent, thoughtful, and darkly artistic portrait of madness.Much praise must also go to the actors. To begin, Heather Ledger, who steals every scene he is in. His performance is a work of mad genius, that likely will garner him at least an Oscar nod. Of course Christian Bale also continues to show why he is the best Batman ever. Aaron Eckhart also gives a very strong performance as Harvey Dent. They all play second fiddle to Ledger though, and all seem very happy to have done so.Now like any self respecting cinephile, it's often difficult to praise the genius of a film the likes of Batman. It's pop culture mainstream fair. You can see that in the reviews of lots of critics. But it simply would be unfair to deny the greatness of The Dark Knight. There are only a few minor problems with the picture, none significant. Its everything it needed to be. And while I may not be able to say if this is the best fest film I've seen this year, it's certainly the one I can't wait to see again most.",10,6,13,23 July 2008
Taken," Pimps & Assassins: Do the Math
","Taken (2008) **Is it better to evaluate a movie on what's good about it? Or is it better to judge a movie on what's bad about it? If 2/3s of a movie are competently entertaining, but another third shockingly dreadful does the good still outweigh the bad? That's the issue with the new Luc Besson/Pierre Morrel Liam Neeson starring vehicle Taken.Neeson plays Bryan, a former spy/assassin of the government sort. He's retired, now living in California to be close to his daughter, who lives with her mother and step father in a lavish mansion. She wants to go to France with a friend, and she needs her father's permission. He's hesitant but lets her go, only to find out she's actually following U2 around adding to his nervousness. Of course he's right to be nervous, as she is kidnapped immediately after settling into the city. This occurs while he's on the phone with her, which conveniently has been recorded so that his ex-assassin buddies can analyze the call, pinpoint that the kidnappers speak Albanian, with an accent they can apparently narrow down to one village, and then determine that the man speaking into the phone is named Marco. With this information he travels to Paris to search out his daughter employing his mad skills.While there he pieces together one by one who is behind it, finds them, finds where the girl has gone, kills a lot of people and then, well I won't spoil it but I'm sure you know where this is going. The plot line in the picture is very, very standard. Allow me to quote film critic Jules Brenner in his review of Taken: Just calling this formulaic doesn't cover it. The script should be credited to the computer software template that originated it.' Now that is a gem of a soundbyte. It's also pretty much bang on. Besson never really takes any time to seriously look at a very serious subject. It's just a conduit through which he can insert standard action movie happenings. Just because a movie is made in Europe doesn't mean it's any less prone to Hollywood clichés.In describing the movie, I'm realizing more than I did when I started writing how mediocre the actual story is in the film. But, for 2/3s of the movie you can kind of forget about that most of the time. Fact is, the action sequences are quite well done, and director Morrel realizes that the key to keeping the audience from realizing just how predictable and substandard his story really is, is to never give them a chance to think about it. The film moves at breakneck speed, and when the hunt is really on its quite entertaining.Liam Neeson goes from totally unbelievable to mildly believable by the end of the movie. He gives a good performance, but sometimes he's a bit of a distraction. Question: Is he American or British here? Sometime he doesn't seem to speak with an accent, others he clearly does. All his ex assassin friends are American (save for a French guy in France), he lives in the US and his American wife refers to him sacrificing for the good of the country. Anyway, that's irrelevant.So that's what's good about Taken. Now, the bad. Well we've established that the plot originated from a standard action movie template. It's got the usual foreign baddies and fat cat Arab's lusting for Western virgins. And for an underground human smuggling operation, it's surprisingly easy to find. Oh, and of course, the bad guys all have terrible aim while the good guy's is dead on - but that's so old hat in any movie with a gun fight I probably just wasted 20 seconds typing this out. So this is all forgivable given the success of the nonstop action in denying us the opportunity to reflect on the plot. What's not forgivable is just how shockingly awful the first half hour of Taken is. How bad is it? I don't even know if I can describe it. Things really go down hill when a bunch of cheery, wildly unbelievable former assassins show up at Neeson's door.... with beer, and chips and hotdogs for a BBQ. They chat nonchalantly about jobs in Beirut and so on and so forth. The effect can only be described as unintentionally hilarious, or perhaps the most unbelievably miscalculated plot point since Micky Rooney played an Asian in Breakfast at Tiffani's.Then there is the daughter and her friend. I don't know if they're bad actors or just entirely at the mercy of the worst written characters I've ever seen in a film with such prestige. For that matter, I assume Besson must have wrote in French then translated to English. Lost in translation is the only conception I have to explain such awful lines ('They're there, I can hear them!'). Its no word of a lie that I almost walked out after the opening third confused as to whether give Taken half a star for sheer ineptitude or 5 for being the funniest comedy I'd seen in ages.But, I stuck it out. I guess I'm glad I did. In the end, yes I was entertained. Then I had the opening conundrum. I was really almost ready to give Taken a mild pass. But now that I've come to the end of the review, I've been given the time to reflect. And Taken is still dogmatically formulaic. Maybe if you don't think about it afterward you'll be satisfied. Unfortunately for me, I thought about it.",Null,3,6,15 October 2008
Groundhog Day," An ode to the Groundhog
","Groundhog Day (1993) As Roger Ebert pointed out in his great movie's review of Groundhog Day, it is so good, so entertaining, so fun, that its all too easy to overlook its greatness. I agree.Groundhog Day is nothing less than a classic. It is a once in a lifetime kind of film, one that worked so well in the context of its own time period that its simply impossible to imagine the film having the same impact if it was made either 10 years earlier or ten years later. If that makes any sense. I suspect if you've seen it and loved it (which more often than not is simply the by-product of having seen it) you know what I mean.The premise, of course, Bill Murray plays a smarmy weatherman who is forced to relive groundhog day over and over again until he comes to great realizations about the meaning what it is to live. It's not only a very funny idea, but also a deep one with philosophical and existential undertones. Yes, not only is Groundhog Day a film so enjoyable its underrated, but also underestimated.Bill Murray is one of the funniest men to ever work in cinema, with the ability to express humor without emoting, to express subtle depth, profundity and sadness while slapsticking. Groundhog Day is one of his best outings. It's one of the few films that truly makes me nostalgic for days gone by, but optimistic for the days to come.I realize this review is little more than a puff piece, but why waste precious time on the small trivial faults when the sum of the parts is so wonderful. It is only suiting in the context of the picture itself.",Null,1,3,29 July 2008
The Happening," There's Something Happening Here
","The Happening (2008) *** I should admit that I have a predilection for disaster flicks. My fascination with natural (or something like it)disasters on celluloid has lead me to give generally favorable reviews to otherwise not very strong films. I debated myself whether to go with a 2.5 star review or the positive 3 stars. I at first chose 2 1/2. I slept on it, and decided that I was interested enough in The Happening to kick it up half a star. This review is one of guilty pleasure, and may be against my critical judgment.This movie is preposterous, hammy, cheesy, corny and silly. Despite that, its execution is clever, and its premise is terrifying and, to me, extremely intriguing.An unknown natural disaster is affecting the North Eastern United States, beginning in New York City and spreading throughout the region. Eliott (Mark Whalberg) is a high school science teacher, who lectures his students on the disappearance of bees all over the country. He's soon after pulled out of his class room and informed that there is some kind of 'event' happening. This event causes people to become disorientated, attacks their motor skills as they stand still or walk backwards, then triggers them to kill themselves. Suicides come en masse and no one is safe - other than animals. Eliott, his wife Alma (Deschanel), his friend Julien (Leguizamo) and his daughter hop a train to Pennsylvania in hopes that this 'event' wont' be happening there. Of course it moves there, and they're train is stopped in the middle of nowhere after it loses contact with everyone. Stranded, they attempt to flee west, where the event is not happening. Julien, frantic over his wife who is in Princeton, heads off to find her, leaving his daughter with Eliott and Alma, who are struggling to keep their marriage afloat.The origins of the 'event' are not really in the end officially determined - its proposed that the plants have released toxins as a self-defense mechanism; others propose its an army experiment gone awry, to which the government refuses to comment upon. The plant theory is the most precedent among the group. This of course equals trouble since they're stuck in the middle of nowhere surrounded by forestation.The Happening goes to some pretty extreme, and pretty silly lengths to get its message across. Some of the suicides are so over the top they're comical - I'm still unsure if Shyamalan was in on this little joke or not. There are other moments which seem to be added for nothing more than shock value. The movie is rated R, and it earns it with a number of moments.Shyamalan certainly has a strong talent for direction and photography - the film shows that definitely - but he is deeply lacking in the writing department. Tracing back his films, there has always been a weakness in his writing - dialogue is often contrived and expositional when its unnecessary, dating from the Sixth Sense to Signs (both films which I like very much). Poor writing hurts The Happening, and there a few cringe worth moments of foolishness. There are scenes where it sounds as if voices were dubbed in later to explain what we just saw in case we didn't pick up on it ourselves. There is a scene near the end that offers this method of clarification, where the problem isn't actually that it was explained through dialogue (it probably needed it) but the manner it was done. A shot cuts to outside of a house, and Eliott's voice cues to sum up what just happened in one exposition heavy sentence, end scene. I'm not suggesting that I necessarily have a better way to clear this up, but its done so poorly that I simply must be possible. What comes after that is also extremely clichéd and entirely tacked on for no reason other than sentimental posturing. This of course is the fault of the writing. Oh, and also get ready for people to say the word 'happening' or some variation thereof at every chance.Nevertheless, Shyamalan's directing chops are still sharp, and there are some very effective moments throughout the film. The manner of how people are affected is not only interesting, but awesomely eery and creepy. There is something about seeing a entire park of people stop dead in their tracks and become disorientated that his a nerve. There are moments in the film where when these people stand still that it almost seems to take on the creepiness of a similar scene in a far different film. Alain Resnais's Last Year at Marienbad has a famous scene in which two people talk on balcony overlooking a garden at a hotel. The people in the garden stand entirely still as they cast shadows but plants and other fixtures cast none. I suspect that if you know this shot, it will make the scenes in The Happening that much creepier. The pacing of the movie (which has a fairly short run time) has been attacked as 'too slow' and 'nothing happens.' I actually thought the pacing of the film was one of its strongest assets. It takes its time, and I enjoy that in a film.From what I've said here I'm really not justifying giving this a positive review, however its the premise of the film, which I think is so deeply interesting and truly scary, that keeps this afloat, but may also damn it at the same time. I will say it here and now that I am disappointed, and frankly if it came out tomorrow that The Happening was being remade, I would jump to see it get a do-over. Either way, I was still entertained by this one.",7,2,6,17 June 2008
War of the Worlds," In like an injured lion; out like a lamb.
","War of the Worlds: **War of the Worlds, adapted from HG Wells classic novel of the same name, starts out as an interesting semi original take on the alien attack genre with a few flaws. Dakota Fanning(Rachael) shows up for what seems like her millionth movie in about 3 days, playing Tom Cruise(Ray)'s daughter. Both Fanning and her on screen brother Robbie (Justin Chatwin)are extremely annoying in their characters which may or may not be on purpose, but either way, both come across as scripted and I never once felt involved enough to care about them because it was impossible to even pretend that they were real their dialog was so wooden. This, and a few other flaws (why the hell did that camera still work?) are relatively minor and I was still able to enjoy what was on screen. I thought the concept used, the migrations and evacuee scenes or confusion and disorder were very interesting. It's display of panic and chaos serves as a perfect companion to 'Signs' (which was a much better film overall) which took the micro approach of one family isolated in their basement over the macro approach here. Thats about as far as I can go with praise. The first 2/3s were OK, and at least interesting, the last third was utter rubbish. Spielberg has made some pretty good films, though I wouldn't consider many of them at all to be overly intelligent rather than Hollywood extravaganzas, with some exceptions of course (my personal Spielberg favorite is Empire of the Sun). I consider him a good director...but I think he is overrated. Some filmmakers you know are going to deliver something at the very least good to you every time: Terrence Malick, Werner Herzog, Robert Altman, Scorcese, Wenders, etc)unfortunately Spielberg is, to me, not one of those directors. I initially had high hopes after seeing the teaser trailer, but the more i learned about the direction the film would go the less my expectations were. Unfortunately, the film wasn't able to even meet with my lowered expectations. We're given nothing more than a summer blockbuster filled with stupidity, ambiguity, tons of plot holes, and such unrealistic situations and reactions that we should be able to ignore, because it is after all a movie, but are unable to overcome. There is the seemingly pointless death of Tim Robbins' character (Cruise and Fanning are making a lot of noise throughout these scenes as well. Robbins has quieted down by this point) and the clichéd 'I thought you died in that massive explosion/inescapable situation but here you are at the finishing line anyway without any explanation of how you defied physics and all logic' cop out. The son, Robbie, and his actions and motives are clear, yet unclear at the same time- not to mention overly clichéd as well. So many things in this movie so obviously don't make sense that it was impossible for me to look back at it and say that it was worth it. If you want to pay, watch the first 2/3's, then hit the road you'll be satisfied with your transaction. It won't matter that you didn't' see the ending, because if you did you would not be satisfied. You're better off reading the last half of Wells' novel (infact you're much better off reading the book and avoiding the movie altogether). 'War of the Worlds' comes in like an lion (an injured one-still has some bite in him) but closes out like a lamb- the final product is weak and very, very flawed- but if you're out there just looking for some dumb action and fun, you'll enjoy it. Myself, I'm not just looking for such films: If i want to see dumb, mindless action, I'll turn on my TV and see it for free. The only thing that saves this movie from getting a failing grade is the decent first two thirds. Nonetheless, it gets a thumbs down.5/10.",5,1,2,11 December 2005
Wedding Crashers," Your childhood puzzle masquerading as 'Wedding Crashers.'
","Wedding Crashers: **.5* (2.5)'Wedding Crashers' stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as Jeremy Gray, and John Beckwith, two middle aged single men who have made a career out of crashing weddings to pick up women. Now, here is a movie that has garnered much praise and adoration, and has been hailed as one of the most hilarious comedies in years. Naturally, after so much praise and suggestions from others to see it, I gave it a go. Perhaps The praise it received led me to expect too much, or maybe it just really wasn't very good. Afterall, I went into 'Anchorman' and 'The 40 year old Virgin' with high expectations and found myself laughing out-loud. And its not like I expected a very good movie, just a funny one. So, what happened? 'Wedding Crashers' starts off with some nice little musical montages. They were fun, but alas, not really very funny. I kept waiting and hoping for some big laughs to start during the first half hour or so, but sadly they never showed up. I began to find myself growing bored. I almost tinkered with the thought of simply walking out, but, as movies are expensive, I chose to stay and push that thought away. I thought to myself, 'boy, these things really should be making me laugh. Whats going on here?' I grinned a few times, but no laughs. The jokes are intentionally corny, but rather than a corniness that you laugh at, the jokes don't' have that edge or subtle comedy that previous work from Vaughan and crew had. Maybe it's just that we've seen these jokes done better before, and they feel too recycled to be funny anymore. Now don't' get me wrong, I laughed a few times, and there are a number of funny parts. My problem is that there should have been many more funny parts; parts that were there in which comedy shines through, but its as if you are looking at it through glass in an aquarium: You see it, but cannot touch it.As the movie progressed, I did find it funnier. The dinner scene in particular was quite funny, and a few other parts did make me laugh. The fact that Christopher Walken, who is in many respects a comedic timing master, and is hardly used is upsetting. Here is a man who, as Roger Ebert put it, could order pizza over the phone and make it a hilarious event. 'Wedding Crashers' has its moments, but ultimately falls short of its goal, whatever it was. Its clichéd heart is too clichéd to be sentimental or funny. The film ends up being that puzzle you tried to put together as a child which always had a missing piece. That missing piece keeps the picture from being whole and successful, and try as you might, you can never find where its been hidden. That childhood puzzle has been manifested as 'Wedding Crashers'- You can still see what the picture is without that piece, but its never as good as it should be with it. 5.5/10. A regrettable thumbs down.",5,2,4,12 January 2006
300," Gory Glory Glorification
","300 (2006) *1/2'300' has earned itself a fairly hefty reputation among the movie going masses as a very good film. I can see why so many people enjoy it. It is action packed, satisfying to blood lust, and it's the kind of rah-rah film that the masses love. And not to step on the toes of the public and insinuate that stupidity and ignorance are beyond common expectations, but I have to wonder seriously about the depth of the mass public's sense of morality. 300, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, follows the Battle of Thermopylae (the hot gate) through King Leonidas (Gerard Butler). We begin at his birth, where the narrator cheerfully describes that had he not been in good birth condition he would have been tossed among the carcasses of other less than perfect children. The massive army of Persians come to Sparta and tell them that they must kneel to their deity Xerces or be destroyed. Of course, Leonidas kills the messenger and declares war. On being denied permission to go to war by the freakish oracles (who are as we are told traitors to Sparta) Leonidas puts together an army of three-hundred and there is our movie.My problem with 300 is not its constant graphic violence. My problem is not with the films near relentless pretentiousness. Nor is my problem with the constant stupidity of 300. My problem is the unique combination of these elements which 300 creates into a complete glorification of violence with a dash of racism and a hint of fascism. The film's visual style and flair allow for some beautiful imagery and astonishing sights. There is no arguing that arduous labor went into creating 300 for the big screen. Zak Snyder shows that he is a good director (His remake of Dawn of the Dead was a very good film, especially considering its material and what it had to live up to). That the film is well made does little to save it from itself in the end. The dialogue is incredibly poorly written, with more cheese than a mouse could stomach. It's pretentious to the point of preposterousness, and preposterous to the point of pretentiousness. When the characters aren't talking about the glory of slaughtering, a narrator does it for them. 300 is essentially nothing more than a feature length portrait of sado-masochistic macho porn on a multi-million dollar budget. It's an offensive film that revels in its violence not to disgust us by it, but to enthrall us with it. Its violence is so stylistic that it can hardly be described as offensive, but it is in how the story feeds off it like the life blood that bacterium suck from a host. The heroes of the movie, all extremely buff white men (since apparently ancient Spartans had ready access to anabolic steroids) go around slaughtering then reminiscing about how great it was to slaughter their enemy, all of whom are either Arabs or freaks, save for one white traitor. 300 defenders will surely attempt to draw parallels with other violent epics such as Braveheart, a film that dealt with essentially the same theme. My response to those defenders would be that films like Braveheart never glorified its violence but repulsed in it - violence was a consequence of the plot, instead of plot as a consequence of violence. It also never separated its characters by race or grace. 300 is so well made that its rather unfortunate it hasn't the legs to tread water in its sea of moral repugnance. 1.5/4",Null,1,2,19 August 2007
The Thin Red Line," The Beautiful War
","The Thin Red Line (1998) ****I first saw Terrence Malick's take on James Jones Novel, The Thin Red Line, the year that it came out. I didn't know what to make of it. Perhaps it was my age, I was younger then and could not understand it. It wasn't full of battle scenes and gore like Saving Private Ryan. I would even say that I ended up being bored.Since then I've seen the film numerous times; what made me go back and give it another shot I do not know. What I do know, is that The Thin Red Line is the film that turned me onto film. Over the years since the films release I've fell into love with it. In my mind, there is no movie of the 90s that has matched its greatness. The Thin Red line is frankly a modern masterpiece.Like most masterpieces, it is bound to be misunderstood. I can think of very few other films that are filled with such depth and beauty. Like Malick's other films, what you see isn't necessarily what you get. There is an abundance of underlying messages and meaning in the film, making it very difficult to grasp. Also, the films style is strange, having an almost total lack of narrative, making it as Martin Scorcese put it, an endless picture. The names and voice overs are difficult to distinguish and often indifferent to what is happening on screen, but it's all done for a reason. War has faces and names dropped on you out of nowhere with recruits and the chaotic nature of it all; often people disappear amid the bullets and the carnage, and new faces replace them.It has been said that the movie has no main character. This could be true, but there are multiple main characters, similar to the book. Witt, Tall, Welsh, Staros, Bell; all main characters. Perhaps the best way to describe it is to call the whole company, C company, the main character.The film follows the company through Guadalcanal, dropping into the lives of various characters here and there, all trying to deal with the war in their own way. It is difficult to get into a descriptive plot outline simply because the film is almost plot less. Those who've read the book will recognize the machinations, but the film was more inspired by the novel, rather than a film version of it. It would be virtually impossible to film the book.War is chaos, and the film clearly displays this, and recognizes that war does not ennoble men, it 'turns them into dogs. Poisons the Soul.' The film focuses more on how those men that are thrust into it try to cope with the dehumanization, all looking for inner peace. The Thin Red Line is filled with beautiful images and beautiful poetry; starkly contrasting the horror of reality. The film also contains one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen. The scene involves the company charging through the woods looking to attack a Japanse bivouac. They walk through the fog carpeted forest as you hear only the whiz of bullets passing by from seemingly out of nowhere. When they finally reach the site of the attack, the camera moves frantically, chasing soldiers here and there, from the viewpoint of both American and Japanese soldiers. The music in this scene is quite possibly the key to why it becomes so powerful. Everything in the Thin Red Line clicks, especially the music and the cinematography.The Thin Red Line evokes a sense of tranquility in the middle of chaos, and begs questions that may possibly never be answered, but need to be asked nonetheless. The late Gene Siskel called the film on its release 'the finest contemporary war film.' The film is still misunderstood years later, but its popularity is growing and its finally becoming regarded as a masterpiece. Martin Scorcese has called this the second best film of the 90s- it should be noted that the film he chose as number 1, was made in the 80s, it just never gained popularity in North America until the 90s.Unlike films like Saving Private Ryan, who's repeat viewings offer nothing new, you can watch The Thin Red Line time after time after time, and see a different film every time. It is my belief that in the years to come, The Thin Red Line will gain wide recognition as a masterpiece. 4/4",10,1,2,30 October 2006
Pineapple Express," Comedy as an artform.
","Pineapple Express (2008) ***1/2 It was one of the last names you expected to see helming an Apatow joint - David Gordon Green. Yes, the indie art filmmaker, of George Washington and Undertow fame. Being a fan of a) Green, b) the silly but sweet stylings of Apatow, Rogen, et al, and c) marijuana, I was definitely in for this one.And yes, I will admit, I was under the influence when I saw this picture. Does it matter? Despite what the critics say, I really don't think so. Then again I was high, what do I know? Seth Rogen plays Dale Denton, a process server who happens to love smoking weed, and has aspirations to become a talk radio host. His dealer is Saul, played hilariously by James Franco (yea you read that right, he's damn funny). After buying some extremely rare weed from Saul, Dale goes to serve one Ted Jones, the guy who sold the weed to the guy who sold the weed to Saul, who is the only guy in the entire city with it. Got that? Dale sees a lady cop (Perez) and Ted (Cole) kill a man in cold blood, and being high, you know, like, totally freaks out. He tosses the roach, and flees to Saul's place. They put 2 and 2 together, and realize they better get the hell out. From here on out, they are chased by Cole's henchmen, and must find ways to hide, until high school girlfriends, old age home grannies and dead cats are brought into the mix. Meanwhile, they make use of pretty much every action movie cliché along the way.Pineapple Express is very, very funny, in that lackadaisical random conversation kind of way. If you're into that kind of humor, I'm sure you'll love it. Meanwhile, the action scenes are quite well done, and choreographed to comedic effect right down to the staple one liners (you've been served, bitch).Among the funnier characters in the film is Red, played by Danny McBride. He not only continues to sell out the heroes while trying to be their friend, but continues to get beat up, shot, and live to hilarious effect. Also funny is the final shootout, which makes full use of the action movie rule that when you run out of bullets, you will immediately find a new fully loaded fun within arms reach.Green's finger prints are evident throughout the film, although I'm sure most viewers will be paying no attention to that. As Kubrick once mused about making a porno, Green takes that a step further by making a buddy action comedy. Its not just in the great tradition of 80s staples, but more or less is one. Green is one of the great young filmmakers working today, with credits such as George Washington and the highly underrated and overlooked Undertow.The film-making is assured, with Green taking on board his usual crew. Tim Orr's cinematography and compositions are quite refreshing in a comedy. He and Green continue to make use of wide shots, flowing camera movement, and simply just great cinematography. Green also employs his usual great editing style. This time he makes some great use of classic scene transitions and wipes that are nice to see on the big screen again.Pineapple Express certainly is funny, yes. What sets the movie apart though is Green's direction. He clearly had a ball making this picture, and the unique style in this comedy is likely to send more big budget work his way. Although, I'm sure I speak for everyone, when I say please remember to stick to your artful small films. On the other hand, I'm sure I speak for many of you when I say, kudos good sir.",Null,2,6,7 August 2008
