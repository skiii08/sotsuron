Alien 3," Mostly underrated.
","Yes, I know: The screenplay is quite confusing at some points. But still I like this one better than 'Alien: Resurrection'. Why, you ask me? Well, I believe, Sigourney Weaver does her best performance of all Alien parts here ( Though not even Oscar-Nominated, as she was in 'Aliens' ). Her fateful, unfortunate relation to the Alien was not that convincing in any other part of the Alien saga. This is it, what keeps this movie alive, and makes it a worthy conclusion of the first Alien Saga. ( The end of the Saga, because I DISGUST the fouth part! )",7,1,3,3 March 2002
