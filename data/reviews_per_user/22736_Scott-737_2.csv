Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I cried.......it was that bad
","This film has destroyed my childhood.............This is so obviously a commercial exercise rather than an attempt to make a good film that it deserves utter contempt. See if you can spot the bit in the future Star Wars films that is specially designed for a computer game.When I was younger, Star Wars and The Empire Strikes back were the bench mark for the modern blockbuster. This films shows how bad the majority of blockbusters have become.The motivation to make this film was money, don't give them yours. Buy the original films (and why does he (Lucas) feel the need to mess with these?) on DVD and leave these new Star Wars films alone.",4,1,2,22 December 2004
Gangs of New York," a big disappointment
","As a fan of many Scorsese films, this came as a big let down. Apart from Lewis, most of the cast was unconvincing. The script was messy, and was let down by so much happening in a short space of time after a long / slow / boring, build up.This isn't as good as the classic Scorsese films. There are actually many annoying features in the films, such as the inappropriate music and the stereo-typing of Irish people.Ultimately I found the film confusing, and couldn't see what Scorsese was actually trying to tell us. I was left unconvinced as to how important these gangs were to the birth of New York. The major turning point in the film, actually had very little to do with the gangs, and seemed to be the more important moment in the history of New York.If he was trying to impress us with the colourful characters in the gangs, well the film fails on that count as well. Only Day-Lewis is memorable.If anyone else had directed this movie, it would be described as average. For Scorsese, it's a disappointment.",4,23,50,22 December 2004
