50 First Dates," Great movie.
","---MINOR SPOILER ALERT---As I write this, the movie's rank is: 4.7/10 (58 votes)That score is nuts - I hope it goes up fast.  This is a great movie, probably Sandler's best. Thoroughly enjoyable, without resorting to everything working out perfectly in the end.  If anything, that's the theme:  You can find happiness even in the face of major obstacles.",9,0,0,15 February 2004
