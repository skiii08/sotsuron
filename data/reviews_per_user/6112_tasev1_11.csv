Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Disjointed, lousy sequel
","Let me get this out of the way first: I loved the first film. In fact, for this one I had high hopes especially since we were finally dealing with Moriarty.This film severely disappointed me. The story was disjointed, and there was no clear direction of that story until the very end. They used their iconic cinematography, wild action scenes, and silly humour to carry the film nowhere to the point that both my friend and I were actually bored of it. And that, unfortunately killed the ending for us during which we did not care at all for the characters nor for what kind of ending the film carried. I never read any original Sherlock stories, but I found that Robert's portrayal, though well acted, was excessively 'OCD' and 'insane' - far more than the first film.I'll be honest - I far more enjoyed Brent Spiner and his co-star portraying these characters on Star Trek the Next Generation than this film.",4,23,46,26 December 2011
Skyfall," The good outweighs the bad
","No matter what, I gave this film a high score because what it did well, it did VERY well and it more than made up for the things I hated about it.Positive - for the 50th anniversary, this film does a fantastic job at playing homage to all the original films from the obvious, right down to the smallest of detail that may be missed. The movie takes Craig's Bond full circle in character development through 3 films (from rough inexperienced, through angry and vengeful) right into the 'final version' of his Bond's character and gently depositing him in Connery's shoes. The movie is not in my opinion a traditional bond flick, but that in it's own respect is what I actually like about it (QoS was more traditional). We get an insight into his soul and where he comes from. Character introductions were brilliant.Negative - Bond villain was terrible. Bond girl (if that's what you call her) was even worse. Eve his fellow agent was more of a Bond girl than anything, and though beautiful (and no offense intended - you will understand at the end) was the wrong (in my opinion), er, nationality. Q was way to young to be believable despite the fact that they try to excuse it in the film. And his TWO gadgets, well, apparently we just don't use gadgets anymore . And the story: WEAK. Old plot device told poorly (and they almost allude to that in the story itself).",9,1,9,11 November 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not a bad film, but...lacking.
","caution: spoilers Shall we begin.... The movie was fun, and I was entertained. Because I know Trek, certain plot twists and characters kept me entertained. I applaud JJ for misleading us in the trailer and misleading us in Benedict's character, and that is the ONLY reason this movie still had any surprises left for us. Well, and also not copying the original story and making it different, adding to the surprise. The trailer showed plenty, but left lots of room to be shocked. I did indeed like the plot, and I appreciate the changes made in order not to copy the original.On the other side without going into lengthy ranting: plausibility factor thrown out the window, any form of logic was continuously broken, the characters were ridiculous and thrown in with the dogs, and I could go on. That's not to say there isn't a movie that doesn't do that - but in these JJ films they GLARE. What on earth were they thinking hiding a starship in an ocean and not expecting to be seen? You know there's lots of SPACE up there for a SPACE ship, right? Shuttlecraft go there too. Is Kirk stupid or something? They actually admit in this film that Kirk doesn't belong in the chair and he's not ready for it...so they get rid of Captain Pike AGAIN, and throw Kirk into command AGAIN just because he's a hero. At least Shatner's Kirk EARNED his stripes through a valid career.",7,1,12,18 May 2013
Ted," stupid movie - full of jokes and no substance
","I like a good comedy sometimes, but it's because of films like this I never watch them in the theatres. I didn't find this one all that funny at all. As stupid of an idea as a man attached to a living teddy bear may seem, that's the point of the comedy - I get it. I just thought it was dumb and didn't work.What I expect is not only laughs, but a good story to support those laughs and more emotion for the characters (i.e. stakes) to make it that much funnier and enjoyable. Mark and Mila's characters had absolutely no basis in their relationship (there was nothing concrete actually keeping them together, nor was their union) so when 'Ted' compromised that and everything went to hell, I didn't care one way or another. Nor did I care about Ted and what happened to him near the end either.The story was weak, the characters were weak, and that made a weak comedy - no matter how funny the jokes.",3,9,20,7 July 2012
Cloverfield," Be careful when you see this
","At my local cinema there have been A LOT of people complaining about this movie - the method of photography tends to make many people sick and nauseous. I fly aircraft in turbulence without seeing anything out my window, and I don't get sick. This film I COULD NOT HANDLE. I barely made it to the halfway point before I left.Now, I don't mind the idea of the perspective, but there is an excess of camera movement and lack of focus to make the film anything but enjoyable. I think the movie would have been quite fine if they still did it from the perspective of the people on the run, with camcorder cut-scenes stuck in for good measure, but would have still provided the box office numbers. I was truly looking foreward to this film, and was very disappointed.Godzilla was way better.I sure would like to see the ending though.",2,5,12,23 January 2008
Salt," A few issues don't bother me.
","I pretty much got exactly what I wanted out of this film, and thus I walked out quite satisfied. A female version of Jason Bourne, mixed in with a '24'-style storyline and old cold-war movie nostalgia and some good plot twists made this action film great to watch. No matter how skinny Jolie may be (or how she may look in real life), Hollywood always makes her look pretty on the big screen - covered in blood or otherwise. HOWEVER, my biggest qualm IS Jolie - her size doesn't fit the role and the type of stunts she does. She certainly appears capable, but certainly not believable. I have to agree with an earlier comment, Michelle Yeoh would have been a better fit for this role (and a female lead in this film would surely have been more interesting than Tom Cruise).In contrast, PERHAPS Inception may have been a better film and more successful at the box office, BUT I walked out far more satisfied after watching Salt than Inception.",9,19,38,30 July 2010
District 9," This is unique
","Amen, this is NOT just another alien movie! Thank god. It absolutely blew me away! The one thing I think that made this movie such a success is the fact that it was filmed (for a good chunk of it) from a documentary point of view. That is what brought this film down to Earth, believable, suspenseful, intriguing, and most importantly current. The fact that the cast was unknown, to me at least, was a help. I certainly could not have had the same effect if any non-South African Hollywood superstar played the role.The perfectly chosen location of Johannesburg, South Africa allowed the film to play homage to Earth's past conflicts, from your well known African civil wars and arms dealers, to forced relocation of a society and segregation of African-Americans (to name a few). Essentially, these creatures behaved as we would have under similar circumstances, except with this story our roles are reversed - we are the aggressors.",9,4,8,16 August 2009
The Bourne Legacy," It was no legacy...
","Ouch. I wish Greengrass directed this film, because to me it felt like a mess. Had a good idea with a solid backing, but it failed to take advantage of it. I like that they intertwined the story within the Ultimatum storyline like you see in the preview as well as playing homage to the original series, but the execution sucked not to mention that the Bourne events had no influence on Cross' character - something that 'Legacy' would suggest. The storytelling felt disjointed, and the action sequences had way too much camera shake to enjoy them (the first trilogy wasn't so bad). Other than Manila, and the solitude of Alaska, location is one trademark of the legacy that just wasn't there. In the first three films, the assassins didn't need to speak to have personality and character - this film's assassin was just a ghost in your memory.Even though not directly stated, I think most people would understand by watching this film what MAY have actually happened to Jason Bourne. The only way this film will have any more meaning is if they continue the new trilogy.",6,118,197,10 August 2012
Cars 2," Sequels need to be different, and good
","A fun filled ride both kids and adults can enjoy. They certainly couldn't copy the first film with location and story, so they had to go all out with the story in a new direction to keep things fresh and interesting. Following the ever popular spy-thriller genre, for me, they succeeded - I love spy thrillers. What's next? Cars from Space? (haha - Carboys and Aliens).I saw this film in 3D, and Pixar never ceases to amaze me. The locations are beautiful, the story is good, and the humour is still there. Pixar sticks adult jokes or references in there that most kids won't understand (like Mater in the washroom, or certain bond references), and locations I have been to recently (namely Paris) were a welcome sight for me to visit in the film.The only thing I can say for sure is that I don't think it will leave an impact as the first film did for me: Cars 1 was really my first introduction to Pixar, when I fell in love with their work. That film blew me away, and I will never forget my experience watching it. The only thing new in this film for me was the scenery and the story. But that doesn't mean I enjoyed it any less.",9,3,6,27 June 2011
Avatar," Mind blowing, yet seen before
","I give this film a 9 out of 10 just because it was so fantastic to watch (in 3D), enthralling, mind blowing, emotional, and there aren't many films where the end credits roll, and THE AUDIENCE STARTS CLAPPING. However, there are two things that bug me about this film (and it isn't the military General that you truly hate, despise, and would love to see his guts painfully strewn everywhere). No, it is character development. I feel like I was emotionally attached to the aliens as a species, and I felt nothing for the humans. I don't know if it was the cast, but I didn't find any particular character I liked, or felt for, or rooted for. (thankfully the emotional context was high enough to compensate for that). Sam Worthington didn't particularly impress me. The other thing was the fact that a few weeks ago I saw the film 'Battle For Terra' - which coincidentally had almost the same plot. Humans invade planet to get what they want - they can't breathe there - and are willing to destroy an alien species to get what they want. The politicians/scientists want to negotiate and the military wants to dominate. Of course, one human soldier is taken in by the aliens and is forced to take sides.Both films are different in look and back story, yet similar in context. Both are good.Sound familiar?",9,1,3,25 December 2009
Inception," Good movie, but cerebral
","There is no doubt that this film is a great movie. But you have to have an open mind (literally), or your won't understand most of it. Very creative indeed, with an all-too basic story to back it up which is why it is so interesting.Nothing about this movie is realistic, and there is no other film like it (save for The Matrix series), so it is really hard to compare with anything.I honestly don't know what to say about this film though. I liked it, it was good, but I was far more satisfied and entertained watching Salt. Between my friends and I, Salt garnered far more post-movie discussion than this. Except for the end - that opinion is up to you! (For me, it was very predictable - I saw it coming and wasn't surprised)",8,0,2,30 July 2010
