Iron Man 3," Fan-Challenging but Ultimately Successful Third Episode.
","Often, such as in the case of 'The Green Lantern', comic book movies are declaimed to be lesser than their source material. The cluttered mythology is either forced all at once into one film or film producers squeeze all the costumery, monsters, mad scientists and fun out of a title so as to deem it almost unrecognisable.The 'Iron Man' film franchise had it tough from the get-go in 2008. Tony Stark was a sixties throwback into whom creator Stan Lee had parlayed cool-at-the-time-not-so-cool- now misogyny and materialism, sticking him in a clunking great robot costume that made him look like an angry fire hydrant at times. He was a near unknown character to anyone outside of the humid, cumin-flavoured recesses of a comic-book nook. Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jnr did well to play into the new-found trend for anti- political correctness. Hot on the heels of Daniel Craig's bastardly, born-again Bond, Downey's Stark was every bit the callous, corporate mogul playboy struck down by destiny to rethink his life and re-harness his talents.Favreau selected Downey Jnr for many reasons, principally for the spooky parallels twixt actor and character but also because of Downey Jnr's career re-defining performance in Shane Black's whip-smart dialogued 'Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.'Iron Man 3' returns the favour to Black by having him helm this new instalment. This new movie takes a cue from Chris Nolan - how could a 'real world' version of the sci-fi-fantasy of comic books play out - and looks behind the corporeal and figurative masks of hero and villain. To wit, Black plays geek-defying games with stalwart Marvel villain 'The Mandarin', offering a take that may please conspiracy theorists with views on who Al Quaeda really are rather than comic book fans. It is a very brave move and one which is satisfyingly resolved - 'The Mandarin' is in this film, he just may not be who you think he is.Overall, with cute kid and damsel in distress tropes comically toyed with, the film is a success and made me decide that Downey Jnr and the Favreau films (he produced this one as well as reprising Happy Hogan here) are my favourite take on the Iron-Man mythos. There are false notes in this film too - Don Cheadle's Rhodey seems better completely out of his Iron Man suit and the Shane Black wisecracks/grabassing can be indulgent in some scenes - but this is a geek-discussion-fuelling, edge-of-the-seat-gripping great night out at the flicks!",9,2,10,27 April 2013
Star Trek," Making Myths of the Mundane
","'Star Trek' is boring. From the first series through to the last chapter in the saga. It is dialogue heavy, it refers to itself, there are published manuals on the technical rules and regulations of the Federation. It is about heroes who are paid to be just that. You are watching Kirk do his job, Spock do his job. Picard doing his job. It is about chores and was invariably a diversion or a chore to watch.'Star Wars' is myth, fantasy - Perseus with lazer swords, King ARthur with hovering landspeeders and weird creatures. This is why J.J. Abrams can be accused of cheating. He has attempted to place the Arthur story, the Hero's Journey, onto Kirk and the Enterprise, revisionist storytelling that should be as offensive to 'Star Trek' fans as it is to 'Star Wars' fans.The new film is damned exciting in places, but Eric Bana's brooding rogue Romulan could have been lifted from 'Star Trek: Nemesis'. Spock was never as petulant as Skywalker, Kirk was never as cool as Han - so the new producers and directors have cheated and grafted those personas onto them. Uhura is Leia, Old Spock is Yoda/Ben Kenobi and the chop-n-shoot style of seventies' Lucas is imported. Even the scramble for the shuttles is straight out of 'Jedi'.You can't cheat - 'Star Trek' fans, you all know Trek is not and should not be as engaging as this - Abrams has ripped up your classic characters and started again so he can make this appeal - which should also offend. 'Star Wars' fans, by turns, should accept not this pretender to the throne. Abrams should have made his own space epic and he was a fool not to.If Karl Urban is not at least nominated for a Best Supporting actor Oscar, however, I am never watching the Academy Awards again. May you live long and the force be prosperous.",6,1,7,17 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Playing 'Soldiers'.
","If the males - and some females - may recall, playing at being soldiers as a boy was usually all the more fun because every death on the pretend battlefield was the most spectacular or most gory that kid had ever witnessed and now copied. Every 'Sir! Yes, sir!' was emulated from the most memorable sources, be they Saturday matin√©es of war movies on television or misremembered quotes from films our 'grandpappies' told us. The baddies, including Hitler, Saddam Hussein or whichever popular enemy of the state was in the news at the time would be holed up somewhere a bunch of kids could easily bomb. It didn't have to make sense or be historically accurate - it was kids playing soldiers and all the fun, ponderousness and real-life dram that could be produced as a result.This is exactly the tone, albeit kitted out in period-accurate clothes and environs, of Tarantino's homage to the 'War' movie. Brad Pitt, the popular kid in school, is the chief 'goodie' while Christophe Waltz, in the cinematic performance of the year, essays the nerd-brained, psychotic villain. Jewish revenge fantasy? 'B-Movie' script transformed into Oscar fodder at the insistence of the Weinsteins? Very possibly - however my advice is to leave your history degree and copy of 'Sight and Sound' at the door and enjoy Tarantino's cheese-dream vision of WWII.",10,1,8,29 September 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," Blame or Credit the 'Parallel Universe'?
","Eric Bana's renegade, time-warping Romulan Nero has a lot to answer for. Not only, in the first film, did his 'A Sound Of Thunder' style time-messing change Kirk's physiognomy, but also that of Chekov. Brunettes became Aryan Adonises. Olive-skinned Hispanic television actors became high-cheek boned, dyed-black-redhead English TV ones.Why fuss over racial casting? Why moan over the choice of the brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch in a role he makes his own (he looks more like a 1960s TV baddie than Ricardo Montalban at any rate)?Well, Gene Roddenberry created a well-paced series with a cast whose very presence on screen broke barriers. Khan (for it is he played by Cumberbatch here) was a landmark role for Hispanic icon Ricardo Montalban and it is strange that one of his fellows was not cast here. Benicio Del Toro would have been magnificent.Why keep tribbles as lumps of faun wool when the grandeur, flawed glory and warped codes of the Klingons are dispensed with in favour of turning them into disposable LOTR orcs acting like the stormtroopers from 'Star Wars'?My rambling has a point. Abrams has all the ingredients of exciting and funny space opera yet his batch of flash-bang gumbo, with odd, sleight-of-hand emotional wringers and wiki'd-in-a-day nods to Trek-lore tastes bland compared to the sometimes cheesily overcooked banquet Roddenberry bequeathed.That Trek lore and history - even aesthetic - is so drastically altered, apparently by that attack on the Kelvin by Eric Bana all those years before - leaves less of a blank cheque to rewrite than JJ Abrams has a right to cash.An entertainingly thrilling film - but an unsettling watch all the same for anyone remotely familiar with Trek in all its TV incarnations - where diplomacy and philosophy were merely flanked - and for solid plot-motivating reasons - by phasers and torpedoes.Whatever any viewer's reaction may be, Karl Urban's uncanny channeling of DeForest Kelly is, as in the first film, worth the price of admission alone and his is the most memorable performance in the whole interstellar jambalaya.",6,2,15,11 May 2013
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Vitally Visual!
","Guillermo Del Toro plays the film world as a game of chess. He has his big guns, his noble pieces, he has a few pawns, but he knows what will be mainstream and what will come more from his heart.It is often said that to own two fluent languages is to be possessed of two souls.Del Toro exemplifies this. His Spanish-language work is breathtakingly stylistic, but with excellent political and world sentiment.The visuals are metaphoric as well as stylistic. His mainstream work was viscerally pulled from the world of comic-books and European gore-horror as well as evident influences of the work of Brian Froud, Jim Henson's fantasy movies and the work of Lewis Carroll's chief illustrator. Moebius,. the inspiration for many of the uniquely stylised characters in the 'Star Wars' movies, was influential also.'Hellboy 2' marries the comic book viscera, lovingly regurgitated references to creature-features such as 'Gremlins 1 & 2', Harryhausen movies, not to mention 'Labyrinth' and 'The Dark Crystal'.In the casting of former Brit pop star Matt Goss as the elven prince Nuada, for example, there are echoes of legendary British rock star David Bowie essaying the role of Jareth, the goblin king, in Hensosn's 'Labyrinth'.'Hellboy' himself is clearly a labour of love for Ron Perlman and Del Toro and is sympathetic - even in the stepping-stone plot.Plot, however, is of little note when these kinds of sumptuous visuals are on display, proving Guillermo, possibly with inspiration from Mike Mignola, has a visual style as recognisable as Tim Burton's.",10,2,4,20 August 2008
Ready Player One," South Park did it!
","In 2009 'South Park', the animated tv show (and best current affairs programme on any US TV channel) showcases a three-part arc called 'Imaginationland'. Satirising the American paranoia of terrorist threats and access to too much violent pop culture, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone conjured a fantasy land, accessible via the Stargate portal, containing every pop cultural hero and villain from Zeus to the Terminator and beyond. 
 'Imaginationland' has since become a genre where books, games, films and TV shows use a panoply of pop culture franchises to populate its roster of settings and characters. The first of its kind was arguably Zach Snyder's 2009 'Sucker Punch' wherein the abused denizens of a strip club escaped into a fantasy land of anime warriors and robots, zombie invasions and superhero worlds in order to thwart an aggressor. 'The Cabin in the Woods' pitted college kids in a log cabin against a veritable vending machine of successive horror archetypes. 
'The Lego Movie' arguably copied the 'Imaginationland' plot more, utilising the many franchises licensed to Lego to people it's Universe. 
The novel 'Ready Player One' was published in 2011 and continues in the 'Imaginationland' trope. This time a poor but good kid (in his mid twenties!) enters the Oasis a virtual reality world to escape his slum life and combat and compete with avatars of every pop cultural character from Beetlejuce to the Iron Giant. He falls for Artemis, a female rebel highly reminiscent of the Lego Movie's 'Wildstyle'. His band of suitably diverse (think the Lost Boys of Spielberg's 'Hook') friends are racing for the golden ticket style keys to Mark Rylance's autistic Wonka 'Halliday''s kingdom. Control of the Oasis itself. 
 Add Ben Mendelssohn's effective but off the peg corporate bad guy Nolan and the film is set for showdown twixt good and evil. 
 
 Spielberg has his name on the marquee but as the effects are labelled on, by myriad effects houses, the impact is lessened. It's thrilling initially to see Tron like soldiers chase the Delorean into the arms of King Kong. However the wonder lessens to the same surprise one might have for a pinball feature from a pinball's eye view. 
 The hero, Wade, may drive the Delorean but at least audiences cared about Marty Mcfly.",8,0,2,30 March 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Andy Serkis is the Breakout Star
","With set design and even lighting to be added later, Steven Spielberg was as free wheeling in his direction as he almost was of the first 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' could certainly have done with the injection of air and deftness of touch that Spielberg applies to TinTin. The reason to see the film, however, is the performance of Captain Haddock by Andy Serkis - only slightly enhanced by a veneer created by the bank of CGI animators at WETA.Serkis channels a range of influences, from Rab C Nesbitt, Billy Connolly, Sean Connery and even not a little Marcel Marceau in his Rabelaisian creation and it is fascinating to watch.Eminently Oscar worthy - three times the charm, Academy!",7,0,4,24 November 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Ridley Scott meets Kurosawa, Coppola, Jack Kirby and Joseph Campbell, under twin moons!
","Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, is a contender for Episode V's coveted 'Best Star Wars Film' title. The film is magnificent, marks the coming of age of CGI and tows the line Lucas set down in his endeavour to create a new mythology for generation x. When Lucas references his earlier work and the work of those who influenced him, he conjures visual wonder. With the depreciation of the Jedi in the eyes of the republic, we have a new interpretation of the delapidation of the samurai of feudal Japan Kurosawa worked wonders with. The cityscape of Coruscant is a knowing nod at 'Blade Runner', with Ridley Scott further referenced. He's there in the gladiatorial arena on Geonosia and the descent of the clone carriers upon the same planet - those snazzy 'hand-held' shots were a treat. The latter reminded the audience of 'Black Hawk Down', as well as the ride of the valkyries in Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now'.Yoda's final lightsabre duel is not only jaw dropping - I wonder if any Star Wars fan will be able to use his/her mandibles again! The way he opened his cloak with a flourish and his lightsabre leapt to his hand was an almost spiritual moment for me and the Glasgow audience I watched it with. And then there is Anakin. The bewildering, shocking sequence of his trip to Tatooine is appropriately so, his slaughter of hundreds to atone for his mother's death was a touching metaphor for the gung-ho military actions taking place in the world right now. This is an excellent film of symbols, meaning and magic that will spellbind you.",Null,0,0,17 May 2002
Man of Steel," Reeve Still Rules
","One of the first images seen in 'Man of Steel' is a Kryptonian 3-D X-ray of the baby Kal- El's heart. This looks like it contains a heart but is really just a melange of special computer effects that briefly dazzles but doesn't truly contain any heart at all - and no more fitting mission statement could be provided for Zach Snyder and Chris Nolan's 'Man of Steel.The prologue on Krypton is far more fleshed out than in any previous versions. Russell Crowe plays a vastly more kinetic Jor-El than Brando - hopping from a showdown in a council chamber to a race on a giant bi-winged bat - yet so begins the difficulties with the film. Richard Donner's 1978 motion picture showed only mini-models and plaster sets to denote Krypton while Snyder's film gives vistas of Kryptonian flora and fauna and a planet wide civil war - and Donner's Krypton still trumps it. One should not be asking why Jor-El now looks and acts like British TV star Noel Edmonds - as happened here - while Brando's chiselled countenance and glowing white hair seem subtle by comparison.Henry Cavill plays Clark Kent by way of David Bruce Banner from the 1970s 'Incredible Hulk' series. In this version, his childhood and upbringing in Smallville was - appropriately for an alien-on-Earth story but wandering from canonical story lines - harrowing and alien.The young Kent takes off on the road to work in a variety of the bluest of blue-collar jobs like a Calvin Klein littlest Hobo, solving the odd industrial accident here and the odd sexual harassment case there.This self-exiling Odyssey through every job on the Discovery Channel's 'Extreme Careers' list brings him to an Arctic military outpost. A millenia-old Kryptonian colonising vessel has been found by the US government and is about to be excavated. Clark Kent is set to reach it first but not before Lois Lane (Amy Adams) follows him. Adams is problematic and, again, one cannot help but compare her to Margot Kidder and the final obstacle to 'Man of Steel' truly winning the hearts of audiences is revealed. Donner's films realised that, like Clark, Lane was still an innocent under her posturing. Reeve and Kidder had chemistry that we saw grow in front of an audience. Cavill and Adams, mouths too crammed full of expositionary gobbets, fail, ironically, to lift their relationship from the ground.'Man of Steel's effects are truly special. It does not fail as a comic book movie because it delivers the bang, crunch and pop that Bryan Singer's strangely elegaic version lacked. Michael Shannon's Zod is an amalgam of almost all despotic super villains from Kal-El's rogues gallery - two parts Darkseid to one part Armageddon and a backstory and motivation cribbed from that of Brainiac. So there are enjoyable set pieces and moments of tension caused by the uber-destruction of Zod and his crew's arrival. Donner and Reeve's films remain untouched, at the top of the tree, because relationships and plot were shown to us, not told to us. We see so many more wondrous CGI confections in Snyder's films yet shown so much less than Donner showed.",Null,0,0,15 June 2013
Non-Stop," Funnier than 'Airplane!' If you watch it fro. A certain viewpoint.
","Being Scots-Irish myself, I've been on family vacation flights where a burly Irishmen was, as Neeson's Bill Marks character, drunk as a lord and threatening to tie up fellow passengers with duct tape.Fortunately he never had Air Marshall powers to carry out his threats. However, given the number of SkyMall perusing, bored-looking Air Marshalls I've seen travelling on internal and international flights, I hope they don't see this film and try to reenact it to alleviate their mundanity. Neeson is in 'Taken' and 'Unknown' territory again, here and he simultaneously always knows this is multiplex fodder while also avoiding completely phoning his performance in. There's no Bruce-Willis-on-NyQuil stuff here. Neeson attends to economy class stuff just as passionately as he graces business class fare such as the Dark Knight trilogy and historical dramas.With Julianne Moore as a red haired herring and Neeson out-McClaning the Die Hard franchise, it's a fine blockbuster thriller in the old school tradition!",7,1,3,7 April 2014
The Bourne Legacy," Ironically Ignores The Legacy of Previous Movies
","Paul Greengrass hints that he will never make another film and this sequel, made with scant regard to the artistry with which he redefined the action hero for the twenty first century, perhaps seals that deal.Where Greengrass's Bourne was a psychological Frankenstein's monster, eating his own soul with every act of violence he had to commit, Renner's character is explicitly a genetically manipulated killer in a storyline more in line with popcorn superheroics than verite style parable.Where Greengrass made the world, the post-Communist and hyper-capitalist modern planet, a character, he makes a fearsome obstacle machine. Damon's Bourne could, at any moment, have been killed. Greengrass's brilliance is lamentably and very obviously absent from this profiteering production.",3,1,5,16 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," A Love Letter from Children of the 70s and 80s to Sci-Fantasy
","Like lead character Quill/Starlord's many Kirk-esque alien-female conquests, 'GotG' charms our pants off but doesn't just coast along on a lot of that charm and humour. That's not to say that the charisma and quirkiness of the movie are not sincere and artful but that the humanity of one character (Pratt's Quill) is more deeply explored than previous Earth- to-fantasy heroes, including Harry Potter. He is Alice in Wonderland with a cool leather jacket and guns while the myriad creatures and characters around him are enticingly eccentric, have their moments of humour and pathos and become wondrous in director Janes Gunn's hands.Gunn is a great conductor of an audience - which is a modern rarity in blockbuster effects films - if you look at Michael Bay movies shows what happens when the heart dissolves from a project.Rather than just tip the toys out onto the playmat, Gunn gives them voice and emotional resonance. However, more than any other director in the cycle of 'Geek revolution' comic book movies and TV shows, Gunn has tapped into why many 'geeks' retreated into or embraced sci-fi and cult pop culture in the first place. Here is the group of toys or comics that listened when you were bullied. Here are the records mom or dad played in the den while you immersed in kenner playsets or Marvel one-shots. Here are the matte vistas of 'Heavy Metal' magazine with the frenetic edits and dynamics of cartoons like 'He-Man', 'Thundercats' or 'Galaxy Trio' yet couched in human roots (or Groot's) so deftly, it reawakens why you loved such 'kid's stuff' in the first place. A love letter from kids of the 70s and 80s.",9,2,6,3 August 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Good but not the dabble in the Marvel Palette It Could Have been.
","I think that the film was fine but basically a retread of the original 2011 movie. However The Winter Soldier, with a fairly complex and even thought provoking plot and Guardians of the Galaxy which was a Sci-Fi effects movie with indy heart and soul promised something from Age of Ultron that wasn't delivered.I think Whedon and the producers should have retained Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) as inventor of Ultron, commissioned by a US government ashamed of what SHIELD had become. There could still be conflict with Stark with Ultron invading his armoury. Add a more unstoppable Ultron element (in the time he was away he could have brought world finance to a halt) then you would have had an epic scale sense of peril that wouldn't just be limited to one small Eastern European City (even if it was going to be used as a nuclear warhead) Overall I enjoyed the film but last year's Marvel films wrote a plot and tone cheque 'A:AOU' failed to fully cash.Introducing Pym (Michael Douglas) and having him be Ultron's creator wouldn't have been difficult. I feel this would have made so much more sense and added that extra layer that it needed - then Pym's history and initial protection of his creation could have provided a character arc that would have led more neatly into 'Ant-Man'.Marvel/Disney own Pym and Ultron - there was no need to erase Pym from Ultron's history. OK, may be OCD-geek of me, but I truly think that just on film terms that would have enhanced the drama.I enjoyed the film but despite Ultron's excellent CGI capture of Spader's performance, Tom Hardy - for example - with a plastic mask and shaved head managed to hold so much more dramatic power as a super villain because the timing and plot showed so much more tacit threat.",7,0,3,27 April 2015
The Dark Knight," A Child's Rage
","Batman has been a perfect Tabula rassa for artists in almost all media. He isn't locked into any one archetype such as his Kryptonian ally, but can perfectly reflect his time and fashions. 'The Dark Knight' is no different. What director Chris Nolan has deciphered perfectly is that Batman and the Joker are different sides of a child's rage - the rage of the outcast, the abused, the alone in the dark. In many ways the nemeses are the most in-control characters in the world of the film - like the war god and trickster gods of mythology.It is the Joker who truly kills for his sport, as Shakespeare once observed of the gods - but, when sacrifice is required, Batman is not averse to treading on lives in his pursuit of justice.Yes, Nolan has hung his story on pegs left - at various points - by 'Heat', '24' and even the 'Saw' movies, but it is an ingenuous one. Batman is the avenging angel the 'good' people of Gotham prayed for, the Joker is the demon Gotham's underworld unwittingly summoned - both represent the potency of the unlocked child within to conjure bravery, goodness or mischief and pure evil. Dent's dilemma at the end of the film is that of the plain-sailing, smart 'jock' who experiences a troubled adolescence, a body-horror - all of a sudden, in the middle of his perfect, adult life.'The Dark Knight' is the unspooling of the inner child in a way no other comic-book movie has dared - a perfect comment on the USA, the west and it's two-faced dilemma now.",10,2,5,27 July 2008
Thor," A Wagnerian Action Comedy Masterpiece of the genre.
","There is a poignant scene in cult 1980s BBC sitcom 'Red Dwarf' where the super-organised hologram Rimmer talks about why he actually likes his polar opposite Rastafarian, slob, scouse room-mate Lister. He compares him to a hangover-cure 'fried egg and chilli sauce ciabatta sandwich' Lister has offered. 'All your ingredients are wrong - but somehow it works, somehow you're right!'The same has to be said for 'Thor'. A giant WWE escapee taking down scientists and CIA men in New Mexico just after having been banished from his monster-infested, operatically armoured home-universe sounds like the worst straight to video Triple-H starrer ever made - but it all somehow, not only comes together, succeeds in throwing more at the screen than many superhero movies could lay claim to.Marvel's vision and slight tinkering of the Norse Edda, the mythological testament of the vikings, remains. Loki is Thor, not Odin's, half-brother, while Heimdall, usually the janitor of the Gods in mythology books, becomes a noble and stoic guardian of the godly kingdom of Asgard.Kenneth Branagh resurrects the one thing that was good about his 'Frankenstein' - sweeping camera shots, heated melodrama that evokes the excitement of a children's story as well as the drama of Shakespeare. In fact, Branagh's grounding in the bard means that the plot's interweaving of 'King Lear' in Odin, 'Macbeth' and 'Iago' in Loki's character, of 'Hamlet'-llite in some of Thor's darker ruminations and not a little of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' s immortal/mortal interpersonal dynamics is deft.Thrilling and refreshing too is the involvement of monsters, giants and archaic robot menaces as well as real-world threat and suspense in a superhero movie for almost the first time in the cycle of superhero movies since 'X-Men's' rekindling of the genre. Bryan Singer might want to take notes if he ever revisited 'the Man of Steel', while Zach Snyder might do well to notice that human drama need not be sacrificed in the face of a slew of special effects.There are only a few negatives. Once Thor lands in the desolate New Mexican town and finds friends he just kind of hangs with them there. Moving from place to place may have heightened the thrills in the earthbound sequences. The prosthetics of the Frost giants look off-the-peg creations compared to their giant CGI hell-hound-troll and this may come from two different effects houses handling these respectively.These are minor quibbles in a movie that blends humour, whimsy and outrageous action with genuine urgency, real world dilemmas and not a little goose-pimpling Shakespearean cinema. Oh, and the brief glimpse of Odin's steed Sleipnir shall have comic-book and mythology fans in a state of complete awe.This will satisfy everyone who attends it and all that remains to be said is this to the developers of the new 'He-Man' movie: Look at 'Thor' - it can be done.",10,28,52,28 April 2011
Dark Shadows," Maybe Not Slavishly Faithful - But Evocative of a Childhood with Monsters.
","'Dark Shadows' is a TV show I was never familiar with apart from when Tim Burton and John Waters name checked the 1960s American Gothic soap opera in their 1989 UK promotion of 'Beetlejuice' and 'Cry Baby' respectively. So, to me if no-one else, Burton seemed a natural to bring a condensed homage to the show to the big screen. Though having never seen the source material, I enjoyed Burton and Depp's 'Dark Shadows' as it evoked a childhood, much like my own, spent as an outsider even the Dungeons and Dragons crowd wouldn't have, let alone the football team - why throw a dice or obey a DM to become a monster when you could drape a sheet over yourself, bare your top set of teeth at bemused girls in the playground and be Christopher Lee, dive about a local forest on a BMX like Skywalker on a speeder bike or carry a plastic gun through a car park as if I was Shaft... OK maybe my parents should not have shown me a videotape of 'Shaft' at age 7.What 'Dark Shadows' central performance, Johnny Depp as Barnabus Collins, was a refined version of, was the remotely talented kid channelling a vampire in play. Eva Green's all powerful witch Angelique had something of the same quality and so a brilliantly staged, professional version of kids at play was infectiously delivered on screen.This sense of play from children of the nineteen seventies where the age of tweens truly took hold has been in other films. This was the personal, deep way films like 'Where the Wild Things Are' and 'The Muppets (2011)' were interpreted for the cinema. This is professional fan fiction writ large and with its heart on its sleeve. Depp may have been the very seven year old who aped Jonathan Frid's original Barnabus Collins while Burton may have been formed by the era of inventive exploitation movies and solid auteurs of horror. Kubrick's 'The Shining' is inferred at points in the opening exterior and intermediate interiors of the film while Donner's 'The Omen', Argento's 'Suspiria' and even 'The Godfather' are woven into the film's Proustian depiction of seventies life in a way, for example, JJ Abrams never quite recaptured the eighties in 'Super 8'. The music of the time doesn't just pervade the soundtrack - one representation of a werewolf is straight out of 'Ozzy Osbourne's 'Bark At the Moon' cover while a CGI-makeover-ed Alice Cooper struts iconically in one party scene and all but steals the show.The soap operatics insist that character arcs from five series of a late sixties, early seventies TV show are condensed into one film and this is fairly well handled. I bow to the opinion of disappointed fans as I would never want, say, a big screen 'the Prisoner' to cram the whole slow-burn plot into one film. However the summoning of 'Dallas' and not a little Hammer (there was after all a 'Dracula: AD 1972')is present.Overall a film to sate original fans of vampires, ghouls, witches and wolf-men who collected garish art cards and abandoned Aurora kits to swamps of glue. 'Twilight' fans can keep their anaemic teenage monsters.",8,3,12,13 May 2012
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Bayeaux Film-making
","This is a grand tapestry of a film, weaving iconic mythological images with a tangible science-fiction realm. As with all legends, the elite play out their tragedies and apotheoses for us - despite the pro-democracy message the film concentrates on events involving kings and lords, princesses, leaders and knights.Maybe this is why the original films are so beloved. In those we follow a knave - Han Solo - and a fool - Luke Skywalker and in 'Revenge of the Sith' we have the final fall of ambition and elitism. This, despite whatever politics we hold, makes for a compelling film and is fired by the humanity of politics, rather than the politics of humanity - which became a turn off, especially when so forced in the prequels. In the end Lucas makes a quite sophisticated point. What is the point of usurocracies, monopolies and schism when, in the end, it is driven by a few ideologues and followed by those who like the flavour of the idea - but will serve it in the end.Parallels between Dubya's post-9/11 actions and those of Palpatine can be drawn, but then disaster has always been exploited by the power-hungry - be it deliberately in the case of Hitler's Reichstag fire or on accident, as Nero's detractors exploited the great fire of ancient Rome.Obi Wan is a holder of ideals and in the service of unshakeable truths - as he believes him. This is why he lets Anakin burn and stares in dread and wonder at his twins. The death of Padme is also the death of Anakin's feminine - read human side, the emperor's final revelation of Padme's demise being the true catalyst of Skywalker into Vader.Overall there is a pervading sense that Chewbacca is somehow controlled by Yoda in the original trilogy - carrying out his will far beyond the reaches of Dagobah.",9,2,4,19 May 2005
The Dark Knight Rises," Plot, performances and production are perfect.
","Chris Nolan's 'Dark Knight Rises' takes the filmic mythology of Batman that only the best conic books dared dream. ¬†While 'Begins' chronicled Bruce Wayne's renunciation of a normal life in place of legend, proceeding to meet an adversary who had never had a normal life in 'The Dark Knight', Bane is the full circle opposite of that which Batman was never fully able to do - immerse himself in a new guise, mask himself completely and risk lives upholding an archaic and deranged sense of just society. ¬†Bane had a contrasting life to Wayne's and so becomes a despotic monster in a way perhaps Wayne pretended. Where Batman used smoke and mirrors and rejected Neeson's Ghul's edict of necessary harm to criminality, Bane just does it, takes lives, blows up a football field, isolates Gotham to make it his own vigilante dictatorship. ¬†Enter Catwoman, the epitome of smart petty crime, who Batman must work with to return from punishing defeat by Bane to combat his raging tyranny. ¬†Just as the Joker could be taken as a symbol of America's ruthless economic face and Harvey Dent America's inability to cope with losing face, so Bane is the vengeful, despotic monster America has been in parts of the world and one day could wholly become. ¬†Batman is America's brave heart, Catwoman its smarts and sass that it must embrace to knife out potential lapse in true morality. ¬†Performances here are exquisite. Tom Hardy is at once grand scale circus strongman Bully and Mussolini-esque born leader, playing far beyond his years as the Goliathic Bane. Anne Hathaway possesses a guile and wit to give the world the first complete Catwoman, while Christian Bale perhaps gives the performance of his career. ¬†Chris Nolan delivers Batman's finest hour, topping even Inception's set pieces as he steers a realistic sci-fi fantasy that Kubrick would be proud of - whose influence is as pervasive here as Mann's in 'The Dark Knight' or Ridley Scott's in 'Begins' ¬†Some twists - one fan sating cameo - and you have a copper bottomed critical and commercial masterpiece.¬† ¬†Go see it!!!",10,9,19,18 July 2012
Beowulf," Gnostic cinema continues...
","A line of kings, heir-less, their sons begotten by demons - monsters who return to wreak havoc upon their kingdoms, feeding from the pain and pestilence they bring. It is a story as old as the Naga of Indian mythology, and Typhon and Echidna of Greek legend. Monsters and Heroes, glory and damnation inextricably linked. An allegory for the exclusivity of inbreeding oligarchies who revel in the wealth of their ancestor's glory.Gainman, Avary and Zemeckis respectfully plunder from the stories of Norse myths, particularly the hapless, yet mischievous Loki, father of monsters. The English legend of the Lambton wyrm is in there somewhere too, among the wobbling, bountiful breasts of wenches, the quite extraordinary CGI naked buttocks of Mr. Ray Winstone and 'Carpenter's 'The Thing' for kiddies that is Grendel. A highly remarkable film.",Null,1,3,21 November 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Frank Drebin, Young Training Day and Hermione fight Spoiled brat cosplayers
","A broadly Glaswegian accented space pirate berated Han Solo and the Glasgow audience I watched 'Star Wars: Episode 7: The Force Awakens' with took it to their hearts. It is a people pleaser. JJ Abrams comes at the Star Wars universe with both a fan and auteur's eye. Fan's, in the sense that he has focused in upon a story that revolves around the 'lunchbox' characters of Star Wars. Auteurs in that he retains an individual look - this is a Star Wars universe stretching right back to the abandoned concept art of the original movies and using them to set the tone for worlds, environments and creatures. It was logical for the sprawling Timothy Zahn original trilogy sequels to be abandoned as they would have used up three movies per book. But what real fan of the films, however philistine the view may be, was truly enamoured of Star Wars as a Frank Herbertesque, sprawling political space opera? Instead is the theme of lost promise and lost past - of a bleak future for the celebrating-too-soon victors of Return of the Jedi but weirdly that salvation may come in a return to the days of the much maligned prequels. In fact how fans view the films, reaction that reputedly left George Lucas despondent after the prequels and was the monkey on Abrams' back at every turn, becomes the subtext of 'The Force Awakens'. This is a film that juggles commentary on fanaticism with blockbuster obligations, very much having its popcorn and eating it too. That Lucas did not have much to do with the story is debatable seeing as rabid, young, spoiled 'fans' of the galactic empire - the First Order - are the new movies' bad guys. However with that paean to Lucas made, Abrams also rubs George's nose in how much faster, more intensely, bigger, funnier and more entertaining he can drive the franchise without need for a Jar Jar or Trade Federation starship. Oscar Isaac channels 1970s Pacino chutzpah into Poe Dameron - a Han understudy. John Boyega acts like a young Denzel Washington playing Superman III Richard Pryor while Daisy Ridley as independent Rey and Adam Driver as the pretentious and petulant Kylo Ren, are Star Wars through and through. Again, like the prequels, there are wild disparities when CGi and manual effects wash the screen - not least when aliens that are clearly masks or puppets vie with undulating, breathing cgi ones. In fact one CGI big bad - Snoke - hints more at a future Wizard of Oz style revelation (look to cinema history not other Sci fi to help . In any case this is a drink of water in a long drought for fans of the original movies and a huge signal that Disney mean business.",9,1,16,17 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Creaking, mirthless vacuum of wonder ends.
","Some things seem beyond criticism. Flaws can be pointed out, but these are not welcomed by many.As a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I'm often chastised or quizzed heavily about my dislike and disinterest in the 'Harry Potter' books and films. My answer is that the books are obese, verbose tomes lacking in any turn of phrase or wonder. The film adaptations are empty confections, old rope dressed in great actors and special effects that stifle the wonder and the oxygen of true humour and peril.Rowling is no plagiarist, but her books were always imaginative responses to the canon of British children's literature from Blyton and Tolkein through to Pratchett and LeGuin - not to mention Lucas. In this last film, Rowling and the movie makers' huge snowball of influences has gathered so much weight that it pulls itself off course and rushing down a ravine taking all loose plot ends with it.The film delivers what the book was - no accident that the final tome's drafting came at the time the Lord of the Rings movies were popular as wholesale set pieces are nigh on recreated here. The assault on Hogwarts could be that upon Minas Tirith. The final scene could be the parting of the ways. Dumbledore in a dream is Gandalf the White for Puddle Lane readers.The way mythic and fantastic elements are glossed over, showcased as living, breathing monsters or magic, but with no life in them past being wall candy for the video-game- simple plot, is frustrating. Tolkein or Douglas Adams had the ability to pull out from their story as their characters drove events, explaining weird and exotic creatures as they went. Rowling drapes stock figures of trolls and dragons around her groaning wedding cake of stacked ideas and ultimately gives in to the American audiences who helped make her famous - her hero just shoots his problem. 'Bang', Voldemort's dead. 'Slice' a snake's dead... World of Warcraft is like Pinter in comparison.No moral victory for Potter, certainly no satisfying victory when the defeated characters in Rowling's world are the most interesting while the victors are the blandest. David Yates does an admirable job and some of the set pieces are phenomenal, but how can he ultimately create anything of interest in a world where Deus Ex Machina was used in ways that would lose a ten year old marks on a story grade?",Null,0,0,17 July 2011
Deadpool," Time to make the chimichungas!
","Superhero movies always navigate a very narrow furrow that can easily slip into self- parody or unintentional laughs. What is impressive about 'Deadpool' is that it tests the edges of both mainstream superhero movie franchises and the validity of comic book sacred cows. Marvel was ever the more fun comic house than DC and as a comic book Deadpool was a melange of underground comic humour and coolly wrought ultraviolence from British comic books. All of this is present and correct in a film that absolutely knows it is a reboot - and tells you - breaks the fourth wall into jokes about the fact it knows it is a movie and contains genuinely funny and poignant moments. That the film plays ultra fast and ultra loose with the medium yet makes you care about and want to see further adventures of this Deadpool on the big screen is testament to what Hollywood long thought a risk. For year the most profitable comic-book adaptation was 'The Mask'. More films should have been made like it and here us why. Go see it with a big crowd and enjoy. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want chimichungas.",10,5,16,12 February 2016
The Hangover Part III," At least the original film just keeps looking better and better...
","The first Hangover film was a surprise hit. Yes, it had glossy Hollywood production values, but it had no big name stars and in fact made stars of the three main actors. Hangover 2 was a cash-in, deliberately politically incorrect retread of the original. This part three, well... it could have been great. The original idea was to have Alan already committed to a psychiatric ward with the 'wolfpack' (a throwaway joke in the first film that became something akin to the jedi order in the sequels) breaking him out so that he could attend his father's funeral. To do this they utilise the 'demon inside' Stu by plying him with a cocktail of drugs. The Marshall vs Chow story was to have been a subplot. This was jettisoned in favour of a plot that Jon Favreau did far better things with in his movie 'Made'. There are some funny moments, but Bradley Cooper - on Bruce Willis-ian phoning-it-in mode - seems embarrassed to be there now, while the relatively weak acting chops of Ed Helms and Ken Jeong are laid bare by the threadbare script. This is Galifianakis's movie and one is left wondering how funnier it would have been just to focus on his character. Lack of exposition, of any knowledge of the real story on the characters' part is what made the original such a treat. A terrific script powered it. In part three, funny sketches occasionally raising laughs, there us no such genius at script level. Acres of exposition fill the mouths of actors - John Goodman deftly using this to his advantage as the no-nonsense Marshall - and ultimately it is the audience who are lost and wrong-footed when, in a 'The Hangover' movie, it should be the characters. I mean, did we all really enjoy the nauseating 'Mr Chow' so much as to have him be a breakout character? As a movie, Hangover 3 makes a terrific trailer.",Null,0,1,24 May 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," The Ingenuity of Modern Fantasy TV Writ Large...
","'The Cabin In The Woods' in a way fulfils the promise that producer Joss Whedon implicitly made in the 1990s - that he would one day put on screen a film that rivalled 'Buffy' or 'Firefly' in originality and play.The Cabin In The Woods.¬†¬†Critics of our mainly capitalist Western lifestyle could observe self-defeating hallmarks of our society. Corporate moneymaking, fast food, franchise cinema and war. These things entice as well as repel us and are ripe for satire. ¬†¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Usually South Park can be relied upon to give implicit commentary in hilariously surreal and or scatological, movie-toned episodes and it is this idiom¬†that Joss Whedon and Writer/Director Drew Goddard work to in The Cabin In the Woods. ¬†From the SAWesque posters advertising the feature to the first few minutes of the film, it seems we are in torture porn/ teen slasher territory.¬† Fatherly figures banter by the water cooler in an office then we cut to a veritable Scooby Doo gang of college students assembling for a trip to the eponymous cabin. What becomes clear is that the patriarchal administrators are following the every move of the gang. From a creepy redneck gas station owner to ultimate terror at the hands of undead hillbillies, the entire night in the woods is conducted to collect sacrifices for some unnamed benefactor or entity. From the second the audience think it has watched a staged snuff movie created by a slick corporation for the entertainment of a blue chip client, we are again wrong footed. ¬†An apocalyptic modern myth unfolds, the implication being that every Jason, Black Lagoon creature, werewolf and Hills Have Eyes family are genetic mutations created to despatch youthful sacrifices. Their blood is then drained to some subterranean chamber.¬† ¬†Survivors of the latest onslaught have almost been beaten by the corporation of power dressing acolytes. Like any ¬†office of weapons brokers or television execs in a reality show they are in permanent denial of their dirty deeds. There's even an office sweep stake among the remote torturers. ¬†Two of their latest victims escaping, there is, revealed in the industrial complex beneath the ramshackle cabin, a¬†veritable giant vending machine of slashers, fiends and monsters criticise generally trending geekdom or the impotence of an original artistic idea once it becomes a franchise or action figure. Immolated child molester and murderer Freddy Krueger became a toy and children's' costume, lest we forget. ¬†With all its commentary and change of pace and audience roller-coaster reminiscent of 'From Dusk Til Dawn', 'The Cabin In The Woods' follows Kevin Smith's 'Red State' as being a genre film that refuses to play by genre rules and is ultimately more scary and unsettling in places than a by the numbers franchise movie. It is a classic worth seeing for its playing in the glossy arena of blockbuster horror - and is also possibly the finest Scooby Doo film never made.",8,4,27,2 April 2012
The Godfather," An Impressive Study of the Banal Slide to the Dark Side.
","The core of 'The Godfather' may be pinpointed in one scene. The youngest son of the Corleone crime family, Michael, wrestles with the possible fate of his and his family's fortunes as he sits across a restaurant table from the gangster, Salazzo, hungry for the power of the Corleones and the police chief in his employ. He looks down, wide eyed in thought but also at the raging fires of the abyss as he contemplates whether to flee the scene and secure the downfall of his family or kill the two figures who most immediately threaten his family and interests. A train's wheels on the track become the wailing of the damned as Michael pulls himself out of these thoughts, pulls out a gun and kills them. So begins Michael's inexorable slide into powerful evil. In exile from is double murder charge, in Sicily, he is able to flex fledgling muscles of power and suffers not a little tragedy. These are inoculations, tinctures of the life he will embrace when he returns to America. It is as if his soul feeds on these morsels to steel itself for the trials and tribulations of the rank of Don.The wise-cracking college kid who displayed some bemusement at his family's business returns to embrace it more vigorously and more purposefully than his father ever did. His father became a powerful criminal out of necessity, Michael does it as if to prove his mettle, that he can be greater than his father and combines traits of his brothers - Santino's rage and warrior spirit, Fredo's duplicity and Tom Hagen's cunning - to achieve his goal.As the door finally closes on Kay at the end of the film, the door closes on the Michael she fell in love with all those years before.",10,1,2,29 September 2009
