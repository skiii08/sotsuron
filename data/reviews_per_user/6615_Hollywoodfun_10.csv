Changeling," A Truly Moving Picture
","'The Changeling' is a beautiful movie about a woman who searches for her true son after is lied to by the police when they return a different son but is similar-looking who claims that he is Walter Collins, the woman's real son, as a set-up by the police. In the woman's, Christine Collin's fight, for her real son, she gets placed in a mental asylum by the police. Eventually, after other members of the police department interfere with the way Christine is being treated, she gets released out of the asylum. Over time, more and more evidence about what happened to the real Walter Collins is figured out, as Christine Collins relies on one feeling that her son will be returned to her: hope.Angelina Jolie plays an Oscar-deserving performance in this movie as Christine Collins, the mother of the real Walter Collins. As usual, her acting remains consistent throughout her role, and through her amazing performance, it is possible as an audience to understand or at least try to understand the feelings that Christine Collins had after her son went missing. Her anger at frequent times in the movie also provides insight to how it feels to be lied to by the police, and to have strangers like the police tell her that the boy is the real son, when in fact, the mother knows in her heart that he is not.The overall plot in this film was very thought-out and intricate, as it relates to the true story of Christine Collins. I think that Clint Eastwood did an excellent job at directing this movie. This movie is definitely worth your time, so go watch it, and experience the courage of a woman in desperation for her real son to come back to her.",Null,1,2,12 February 2012
Captain Phillips," A Must-Watch Thriller
","Not too many movies strike a chord with me, make me think and reflect upon the movie for days or weeks after, or even force me to re-watch the movie in the same way that this movie did. 'Captain Phillips' is an incredible movie with talented actors and a plot so thrilling that I was literally shaking at times during the film. The suspense that heightened as the movie progressed certainly contributed to the success of this movie and the effect it leaves on the audience.Tom Hanks once again delivered an exceptional performance as the captain of the ship. I thought his performance particularly excelled at times when the thrill was extremely high, but also in the denouement of the movie, when he was being looked after by a doctor. I would like to name out the actors who played the role of the Somalian pirates, as they all deserve a standing ovation for their contributions to this incredible production: Barkhad Abdi, Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed, and Mahat M. Ali. Despite 'Captain Phillips' being the first movie they ever played in, these four actors delivered mind-blowing performances. Surprisingly, they knew each other very well before the movie as friends in Minneapolis, and I am really happy that they had the opportunity to co-star with each other in this movie. I do not think that anyone else would have been able to play the role that they pulled off magnificently. And to Barkhad Abdi, wherever you go from now on, you will always be the captain.What I really loved about this movie was the reflection of reality, as this was a story told by the real Captain Phillips. I feel comfortable watching a movie and knowing that what I see on screen is similar to the actual events. With that in mind, when I reflect on the movie, I am not only reflecting on what I saw on screen, but also on the real-life events. I felt that in the film, the Somalian pirates had a firm goal, which was the reason they decided to invade the ship in the first place. Throughout the film, I saw evidence of the existence of a warm heart that the pirates possessed (it was clearer in some than in others),and they were not as mean as their mission would suggest. However, whenever their goal of acquiring millions of dollars was threatened, they would react strongly.I am definitely surprised that this movie did not take home an Oscar this year, but not surprised at all that it was nominated for 6 Oscars and not surprised that Barkhad Abdi took home a BAFTA award either. I saw this movie twice, the second time just couple days later, and I even liked it more the second time than I did the first. I would highly recommend this movie. A must-watch thriller bound to stir emotions!",Null,0,1,13 April 2014
Public Enemies," Public Enemy #1
","Public Enemies is a great movie that brings to screen the story of John Dillinger, who was public enemy #1 during the Great Depression. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor as John Dillinger, and was also made to look quite alike in this film. He is perfect for this role, and as usual, his acting is so real.This movie shows that John Dillinger wasn't all for robbing banks and escaping prison. It shows that he had love in his life as well, which is shown through the character of Billie, played by Marion Cotillard. The plot in this movie is realistic and quite reflective to John Dillinger's real story.Public Enemies has action at times, and a lot of shooting. The theme of this movie is similar to that of the movie Bonnie and Clyde, who were two other criminals during the Great Depression. However, having watched both, I find that Public Enemies is much more entertaining and exciting to watch, and the quality of acting in this film surpasses that of Bonnie and Clyde.Overall, a great movie! Superb job! 8/10",Null,0,0,19 February 2012
Hot Fuzz," Action Thriller!
","The movie Hot Fuzz is definitely an action thriller. However, the movie begins with more comedy over action and ends off with action galore and guns firing everywhere. However, the direction manages to include comedy throughout the film, which just adds a wonderful aspect of entertainment to the movie. Simon Pegg delivers an amazing performance as Nicholas Angel, and his work partner Danny is a wonderful friend and a great comedian as well. Nicholas Angel is the ideal cop and would make for a perfect police officer in today's world. The movie hooked me up from beginning to end, and was very well-structured. I enjoyed the fast-moving action sequences and the camera running through different incidents at once in a super-quick pace. One thing I would recommend for this movie is more focus on the criminal(s) of the grisly crimes that take place, as opposed to merely trying to eliminate them. For instance, the movie could perhaps provide more details on who did what in the crimes and how they were planned out. Other than that, I would say this movie was quite amazing! I rate this movie an 8 out of 10, and I would recommend this movie to all action lovers.",Null,0,0,12 July 2012
Midnight in Paris," Beautiful Movie!
","This movie was a very nice film to enjoy on a Saturday night. If you're watching this movie at home, I would suggest closing the shutters and the lights in order to add to the experience of midnight in Paris. This movie was a pleasure to watch, and I enjoyed a lot about it. I think that overall it was well-made and the picture was very well done, with really beautiful scenery of Paris and Parisian customs and all of that kind of lifestyle. The script was also very nice, except I would recommend adding more emphasis on the moral of the movie, that life is not necessarily better elsewhere. The movie did touch upon that moral when Gil was talking to Adriana near the end of the film. I felt that the ending of the movie could have been completed more thoroughly than it was. However, other than that, the script was quite captivating, and though I expected it to be a little boring, it was not at all! The acting in this movie was gorgeous, especially Owen Wilson's, who really gave light to his character and made the film very enjoyable to watch. Excellent performance! Marion Cotillard was also great in this movie as Adriana. The other actors in this film also played their roles well and all contributed to the greatness of the movie as a whole.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie. Good job Woody Allen on a great movie, and same goes to all the stars in this film!",Null,0,0,25 March 2012
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," A Must-See Musical!
","Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street is an amazing movie adapted from the famous Broadway musical about the story of Benjamin Barker, a man who was unjustly accused and sent to jail for 15 years. When he returns, he learns that his wife, Lucy, poisoned herself to death and that the evil Judge Turpin has kidnapped his daughter Joanna. Seeking for revenge against the whole world,Benjamin Barker, now under the new name of Sweeney Todd, opens up a barber shop where he uses his razors to assassin all the people who sit down on the barber's chair. Meanwhile, a woman who used to work at a pie shop, Mrs. Lovett, is his assistant, using the dead bodies to make meat pies for her customers. By first reading such a plot, the story may seem really appalling and ruthless. However, the movie brings meaning to the world, and highlights the roles of family, unjustness, good and evil, and harm in society.In this movie, directed by the imagination of Tim Burton, also director of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice in Wonderland, two of my favourite movies, Johnny Depp plays the role of Benjamin Barker/Sweeney Todd, and Helena Bonham Carter plays the role of Mrs. Lovett. Alan Rickman also stars as the evil Judge Turpin. The acting in this movie is superb by all the stars. Johnny Depp delivers an amazing, incredible role as Sweeney Todd that drives the audience deep into the mind of Sweeney as he acts upon the people he encounters. I absolutely loved his performance! Helena Bonham Carter also delivered a stunning performance as Mrs. Lovett, and I love how she portrayed her character.The soundtrack in this movie was gorgeous; the songs were all powerful and carried meaning to them.Even though the movie was based on a musical, I feel that the ending was too tragic to be a perfect movie. Even if Sweeney Todd killed so many people, I didn't want him to die at the end of the film. I was hoping that perhaps he would change his perspective and turn on a new leaf. And to see Mrs. Lovett die as well when she was so loyal to Sweeney Todd was also not a pleasant ending. However, even though I would have preferred a better ending, the ending itself touches upon the different morals portrayed throughout the film.I would agree that the movie is a little too violent. However, based on the descriptions I read, I actually was expecting it to be worse, but after watching the film, I can say it was not as bad as I expected it to be. However, there are some gruesome scenes that maybe shouldn't have been portrayed in such gruesome detail.Overall, this was an amazing movie/musical adaptation! I absolutely loved it! 9/10!",Null,0,1,15 April 2012
Salt," Action Thriller!!!
","If you are looking for a movie with action, then you get action with SALT. This movie was very captivating and full of suspense. You never know when and where Salt is going to shoot or knock someone out. Was Evelyn Salt good or evil was a question that raced in my mind throughout most of the movie. Angelina Jolie performed excellently in her role as Salt, and kept consistency throughout her role in the film. Although the action sequences in this movie were quite unreal, such as jumping from a helicopter into the sea, or jumping from one truck to another and almost entirely unhurt, it was entertaining to see this world of fast-paced action on screen. Evelyn Salt's determined attitude also captivated my full attention during this movie. One woman whose determined attitude saved millions of lives was a message that left me thinking about the human race by the end of this movie. Overall, this was an incredible action-packed thriller that I would not think twice before deciding to give it a re-watch.",Null,3,5,29 January 2012
Revolutionary Road," A Wonderful, Passionate Movie!!!
","To me, Revolutionary Road is a movie that reflects upon the difficulties some couples face in their relationships with each other. In this film, even though at times the Wheelers expressed hatred to one another, I do not think that their love for each other disappeared; I think that it just got camouflaged in the many problems that the couple faced. This is evident in one of the fight scenes which leads to April running out into the woods, but Frank runs after her, showing that even though he said nasty words to her, he still loved her. Otherwise, he wouldn't have cared where April was or where she was running off to.Many of the scenes in this movie were emotional and sad to watch. The ending of Revolutionary Road was one such scene. One of the most powerful scene in this movie was seeing Frank running away from the hospital when April tragically passed away after trying to abort the child she was carrying for more than 12 weeks. Frank's running at that point symbolizes how much April meant to his life, and how her death was so emotionally traumatizing to him.As usual, Leornado DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are both incredible actors, and through their passionate acting, they bring to life the difficulties that the Wheelers face in their 1950s life. Both Leornado DiCaprio and Kate Winslet become so emotional at times through their acting, that myself as a member of the audience can almost feel the difficulties that they are having in their lives and in their relationship together. I believe that Sam Mendes really chose the ideal actors to play in this film, and not too many actors can act in the incredible way that Leornado and Kate performed in. Overall, I rated this movie a 9/10 because it was so real, so passionate, and an amazing movie!!!",Null,0,0,19 February 2012
Titanic," Best Movie Ever!!!
","I just recently watched this movie in 3D on the big screen, and I have no words to describe this film, other than AMAZING and BEST MOVIE EVER MADE! This movie was utterly incredible, and I loved it so much. Everything about this movie was worthwhile seeing. And honestly, the 3h 14min movie didn't even feel that long, because it was so enjoyable! It could have went on and on, and I wouldn't even have felt the time difference. Overall, this was an amazing movie. Leornado DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are both incredible stars, and their performance in this movie was beyond any other performances by any other actors. Without such wonderful actors, this movie would not have been what it turned out to be.The movie carries such inspiring meaning and I will never forget Jack's last lines in this film. I believe that everyone should forever hold true to those words. Overall, this movie is truly a passionate piece of art work! A huge congratulations to James Cameron and to all the people who worked towards producing such a gorgeous film. Truly worth anyone's time and money to watch! 10 out of 10! Best movie ever!",Null,3,7,8 April 2012
La Vie En Rose," La Mome
","La Vie en Rose is a great movie that portrays the life of singer Edith Piaf through her childhood and through the tragedies she faced around her as she grew up. The movie really gives life to the character of Edith, and I think that is especially achieved through Marion Cotillard, the actress playing Edith Piaf in the film. This is the best role I've seen from her, and perhaps one of the best roles from other female actresses. Her emotional acting is able to lead the audience of the movie through the difficult times that Edith felt in her life.The makeup was incredibly well done, as Marion Cotillard was made to look almost exactly like the real Edith Piaf. The makeup also was very well transitioned from Edith's early childhood years to her teenage years, and to adulthood.I also enjoyed the music in this movie, and I like the idea of for example, when Edith was going through a difficult time or a tragedy, in the background would be a song of hers that relates to what she is experiencing at the moment.Although I have stated many good comments about this film, it is a little depressing, though that is expected if you know the life of Edith Piaf. Overall, however, it was a really well-made movie with excellent acting from Marion Cotillard, and a powerful drama that brings to life the voice and heart of French singer Edith Piaf.",Null,2,3,10 March 2012
