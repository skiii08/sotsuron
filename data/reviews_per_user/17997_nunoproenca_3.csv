Alien 3," Fincher thinks we're fools
","Regardless of the many posts I've read regarding the way the eggs - there had to have been at least 3 - got onboard the ship, I don't recall seeing any explanation that covers all the possible plot holes.<ul><li>The Queen can lay eggs without her ovipositor?</li></ul>When Ripley shoots at it, you just see egg yolk coming out. The egg develops INSIDE the ovipositor. And again, you're talking about at least 3 eggs!<ul><li>Bishop brought the eggs?</li></ul>The eggs open when someone is nearby. They would have attacked Hicks in the shuttle.<ul><li>The eggs were not found before hypersleep?</li></ul>No, and they would not open unless someone approached them. Which is hard to do when you're in a cryo chamber.<ul><li>Facehuggers crawled into the shuttle?</li></ul>Without attacking Hicks? Or Ripley? Or Newt? And how exactly did the eggs open and they ran all the way up from the processing station to the shuttle?I cannot condone or forgive the existence of a movie which makes a mockery of the ending of two of my favorite films ever. It's as if Darth Vader came back from the dead with no explanation, in order to kill Solo, Leia and Chewbacca. The Aliens were creatures. Intelligent ones, sure. But not supernatural Freddy Kruger-like beings who are immortal. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is a bad joke.",1,3,7,13 December 2012
Man of Steel," Dimishing returns
","I am a huge fan of the Dark Knight and Iron Man movies. And I liked Snyder's work in 300 and The Watchmen. So I thought this could be a welcome addition to the superhero genre. My mistake. What is wrong with this movie? Well, first of all, Henry Cavill can't act his way out of a matchbox. You know something is wrong when the most convincing line your lead actor can utter is 'UAAAAARRRRGGGHHH'. Second, what could have been an epic and awesome battle scene gradually loses its impact after the 25th building collapses. Then it's just repetitive and annoying. Third, the 'big' lines ('KRYPTON HAD ITS CHANCE!!!') sound contrived as hell. Fourth, the end is so anti-climactic. A broken neck?? REALLY?????Positives? Well, the special effects are nonetheless good. And I could fall in love with Feora.",4,4,7,4 July 2013
Titanic," Too many things wrong
","I will not deny that the special effects and sinking ship drama (for the other passengers) are fantastic, but there are simply too many things in the remainder of the movie that tick me off, and prevent me from giving it a higher rating.The romance characters, dialogues and situations are way too cliché. The instant love at first sight scene? The 'She's not for you' advice? The way Kate Winslet changes the moment she sees the rich woman mistreating her daughter? The evil fiancée? The lively and dancing 3rd class people? It is just far too silly and contrived.There's also one thing that bothers me. Everyone is happy that Leo and Kate are reunited at the end. Well, she got married and had kids, didn't she? So, that means she probably spend several years with a husband. So...instead of the father of her children, she wants to spend eternity with a guy she met as a teenager for 5(!) days? I'd be royally mad off if I was the guy.",3,9,16,19 December 2012
