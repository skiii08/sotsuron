Casablanca," One of the greatest in Cinema
","Casablanca is nothing short of a masterpiece. The definition of a drama-romance film, breathtaking at times. A must for every serious film-addict, even if it's not in your genre of choice.I'm not going to reveal the plot for you or tear the movies content down piece by piece. I'm just saying, give this one a spin. Once you do that, chances are you will want to make a dance out of that spin & see it time after time after time again.",Null,0,0,14 April 2003
The Godfather: Part II," Didn't get it
","I was compelled by the storyline & performances therein but at the end of the movie I just didn't get it. It was to much a misch-masch of stuff & I just didn't get much out of it.Godfather 1 is the definition of a film, a true classic. This is a sequel with mixed-bag emotions. I think it's something of a let-down. Not a huge one, but yeah. It is a let-down.",Null,2,5,13 April 2003
