The Matrix," loved it
",they should remake that movie again. put some more fictions in it and some good martial arts. To me everything was perfect in this movie and hopefully one day we can have another matrix reloaded. imagine matrix become like hunger games that would be awesome to see every year or every two years we are having another matrix movie with the same exact actors. Im not talking about Kenny reeves of course some young actors that we have now should play matrix. Now i don't know what else to say in this because its seems like i have to write a lot more stuffs in this comment. the minimum of ten lines is just stupid to me to keep writing and writing,7,1,4,25 January 2017
