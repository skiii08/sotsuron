The Blair Witch Project," The Best
","This movie is one of the best movies of all time, the ending, is amazing but, if you don't watch the movie, and listen, you won't understand it. This is more than just a hyped summer horror movie, this is the best horror movie since The Evil Dead. Blair Witch was scary, realistic, and guess what is was original I plan on seeing this movie at least ten times while it is in the theatre, I suggest that if you like horror movie and like getting scared, You should do the same100% good A+ ***** 10-10",Null,1,1,30 July 1999
