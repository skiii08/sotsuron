Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awful and disappointing
","This movie was pathetic compared to the original three.  The ideas are there, they are simply not fleshed out and used the way they should be.  I think Lucas did better when he had an uncertain studio making sure that he drafted and redrafted the script.Also, to all the people that argue 'This is a kid's movie,' I say that is no excuse.First, I think the original star wars film appealed to viewers regardless of age.Second, the Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and Shrek are all 'kids movies,' yet these were much better written and executed than this disaster.",2,0,1,25 November 2001
Spider-Man," Good storytelling.
","This is primarily a response to Mr. Bunch's opinion.  As both a long time comic book fan as well as movie buff, I have to say I am tired of people that exalt style over substance.  Batman does not even come close to this movie.  In general, while Burton's films look good, they are primarily all style and no substance (with a couple exceptions such as Ed Wood and the Nightmare Before Chistmas).This movie actually had a STORY and a PLOT.  That it is not to say that I thought it was perfect. I agree that Dafoe's performance was a bit over the top and some of the dialog sounded like it might have come from a 60s comic. Further, some of the CGI did not come off perfectly and the laws of physics seemed to be ignored in a couple of cases (the cable car scene especially).
However, Raimi blows away Burton when it comes to telling a story.  Evil Dead II is an alltime classic.  Also, the Gift and the Quick and the Dead were both fine movies (though I don't think either was great).
Raimi is also good at characterization.  I don't see how anyone could knock Maguire's performance, or Dunst's for that matter.  They actually portrayed characters.  Keaton's acting in Batman was defined by his lack thereof. And I like Keaton.This movie is up there with the original Superman movie for all time great comic adaptations, and it is not as corny.",8,1,2,8 May 2002
