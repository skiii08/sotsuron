The Longest Yard," Clone Movie
","i will give this movie 1/10 just because i can't believe somebody can copy the almost exactly history of a film. i felt that i was looking the same Mean Machine(2001) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291341/, the only difference were that they change actors and the funny thing is that they still gave the football team name 'Mean Machine' and they play football instead soccer the weird thing is that nobody made any comment about it, well at least we can see a lot of famous actors, that's something, but i think Hollywood at least should change something between movies, because this movie is like and exactly clone of Vinnie Jones's movie",1,3,6,26 October 2006
