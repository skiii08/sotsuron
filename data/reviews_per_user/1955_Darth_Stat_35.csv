Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Happy Second Episode I.
","Well the most anticipated movie of all time turns 2 this weekend and nears the 2 and a half thousand reviews mark, possibly one of the most reviewed flicks on this database. Why exactly is that. Can it be that after 2 years of panning and protested hatered people are still talking about it.
Basically I think the movie lacks tension, it's only the action when it is happening that has you on the edge of your seat and even then only in identifiable points in the movie. The podrace is not to my taste, it does ok for exciting but is not up to classic standard. All the lightsabre action is pleasing to watch but not what it could have been and the movie relies all on it's astounding visual effects to be a good theatre experience, the effects are good but for entertainment there needs to more.
Compare it to say, it's recent weekend gross toppers original, The Mummy. Action, humour, chases, bad guys, fight scenes, aims, a single look-of-the-movie trademark color, identifiable character importance, it has a lot more pace and content for an adventure blockbuster, Darth Maul is the biggest draw card for Episode I. He is an active bad guy that rocks right around the clock, his goal is clear and not entirely simple and there is never a point when you do not believe he can achieve it, the way he finishes out the movie is a major disapointment and his lack of dialogue is also a let down. He is a character I would have liked to see developed.
And Qui Gon, he is the best developed character in the movie and his importance in the bigger picture is also identifyable. Obi Wans is aswell but he is really only a supporting character and I think the intention was to enjoy further development in the next movie. Jar Jar is there for the kids. It is not fair to complain about him on own behalf because he is not there for us to enjoy. He also has a background, a role and importance to the story. And you must all love the fact that his name is in the cast list for Episode II.In the next movie Count Dooku/Darth Tyranous, played by Christopher Lee (Count Dracula) and the now Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious will share the brains role so I wonder who will fill Darth Mauls shoes. I own Episode I and find it very re-watchable again and again but not up to the standard possible, my hopes rest with Episode II, it sounds much better. I still rate this one 8/10.and Sidious",8,0,1,16 May 2001
Ali," The Champ aint here!
","(IF YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE 'RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE' PORTION OF MUHAMMED'S LIFE AND HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE THEN CONSIDER THIS A SPOILER WARNING. Also if you plan on seeing the film then this would detract from the experience.)I am 100% in agreement with the Academy on this one. Smith's actual acting is fine, voights inhabitation of a news presenter I know nothing about is also sturdy but the movie as a work is extremely flawed.First up the other good points though. Alot of the ring action, as film drama is gut wrenching. I don't know if that is simply because Rocky is one of very few boxing movies I have seen though. All but the Rumble in the Jungle makes you sweat, the humour where present is successful aswell; but the rest of my review is griping.Firstly, the make or break element of the movie; sadly breaks it. Smith plays undaunted arrogance (with the exception of the crowning Sonny Liston win; quite a funny moment occurs) well but he was not PLAYING Muhammed Ali. What little I know of the man is from a knowledgable elder and the Oscar winning doco 'When We Were Kings'. You could see in much of the leadup (to the Rumble in the Jungle)in that doco that there was fear behind Ali's eyes. The man also seemed to have a semi-serious approach to much of what he said publically, he wasn't always 100% stern, there was a beautiful irony inherent, this does not come across. The casting of Smith is something I would expect to see in a spoof about Hollywood and how they popcorn everything up. Smith must have done next to no body-building for the part and it shows. Ali may not have been big for a heavyweight but he was and is certainly alot bigger (build wise) than Will Smith, I could never get past it just being Smith playing a role.None of what actually made the man a great boxer comes across, and the preparation subterfuge for the Rumble in the Jungle is ultimately removed, robbing the films climax of tension. It is, not too pointedly, spoken of in the doco that Ali spent sparring sessions preparing for rib punches and rope-a-doping, vital to his win. And little of the pessimism about the champs return comes across. Before the fight the documentary tells us that the minutes before Ali left the changeroom felt like a last supper. His supporters thought that he was going out to an inevitable loss, it was in that room that Ali's optimism and cheer brought morale up among them which would have been PERFECT for a hollywood movie. There is none of this in the movie, Mann likes that sort of stuff ('Heat')and yet he allowed its removal.We also don't learn very much at all about Ali as a person, and as a previous reviewer said it only covers a neat decade of his life, nothing of his Gold medal fiasco is in it, which is another major part of his career and public life (his medal in the 96 Atlanta Olympics is tied in with it). We also know nothing of his childhood or what his early ambitions were, what actually MADE him, all that supposedly 'corny' stuff that most biopics can't resist including. If you want an informative and tense telling of the famous George Foreman fight watch the documentary, and there is now a DVD with all the footage of his fights and interviews you could want.See this or don't see it, that quite honestly is good advice. Smith fans or fans of actors in general should find it a good troubleshoot experience. Three hours should never feel this shortcoming.7/10",Null,0,0,10 March 2002
Unbreakable," An unworthy Directorial follow-up to The Sixth Sense
","The director may have first demonstrated here that he has only one style of directing, it would be unfair to commit him to that just yet but this movie has exactly the same boredom and darkness feel to it that worked at first viewing with The Sixth Sense, only the content fails to keep hold of you for the duration. The depiction of the marriage comes off as half baked, it is clear to see that his attempts on the sports agent at the start were the directors attempt at bringing across some feeling of loss when she and the rest of the train passengers died soon after. The part where the doctor explains to Willis 'why he is looking at him like that' is a laughable way of mystifying the miracle that he survived, the movie gets to a mirky and unpleasant second base when he finally, in the last 1/2 hour follows that guy and rescues the kids. It does not explore any further his powers and Sam L. J's character gets does not reach what he thought was his destiny.A sequel could clean up some of the mess provided he ditches that distinctive monotone feel. I am surprised that Jackson wasn't nominated for his performance considering the competition, he really is a standout. I look forward to seeing the Directors next attempt, he has his work cut out for him I would say.",Null,0,0,16 May 2001
Spider-Man 2," No disappointing summer made this flick as great as in every way it is.
","If there is a list of ways you don't expect the sequel to an $800mil-grossing action-fantasy to start, then right up there near the top, perhaps around second or first, is seeing a superhero on pizza delivery. But after a brief reminder about Pete's crush and a heads-up that MJ didn't at the conclusion of the previous movie catch on to his dual identity crisis, that's exactly what we see. A bystander watches Parker disappear off into a sidestreet, pizzas in hand, and a moment later Spider-man emerges from the same alley with the same pizzas. The bystander's conclusion? 'Hey! He stole that guy's pizza!' The writing team are tipping their hat to the ground rule that once again no one will ever realise that Clark Kent and Superman are never in the same room at once. For the brief moments with Spidey swinging up there among the rooftops again we'll wonder if that was what we enjoyed most the first time.But then minutes later we're back in the cozy still-60s office of J. Jonah Jameson and the laughs are once again coming thick and fast. His secretary ducks in. 'Jonah, your wife's on line one, she says she lost your credit card.' Jonah booms gleefully back: 'Thanks for the good news!' Pete's soon arguing for more cash, saying things are tough at the moment. 'Awww,' Jonah replies with mock concern. 'Miss Brant,' he bellows out to his secretary, who immediately ducks in looking expectant: 'get me a violin!' We think no. Maybe this was what we enjoyed most the first time.But soon Pete's entering the door of his old home. 'Surprise!' come three voices in unison. The smiling faces of Harry, MJ and Aunt May are there. It's a major nostalgiac high, seeing them all again. MJ is dressed like a grownup now and Rosemary Harris has lost none of her charm. Harry has grown roughly three feet. The sullen, troubled youth is gone and we're beholding what looks like an action hero or a rock star. The clouds darken soon after as the tragedies of Uncle Ben and Norman Osborne are re-affirmed, both of these best friend's having lost a father. Especially with his remaining unrequited love for MJ still hanging over him, Spider-man is preventing Pete from being true in any of the most important relationships in his life. A whole movie of development awaits!!! Nope. Sorry Jonah, I wanna stay here for a while. Don't take it too hard if you find yourself feeling like that for the rest of the movie. The weirdest thing about being hooked within 15 minutes is that there isn't even a villain yet. But that soon enoughÂ… Apparently with part 1 they had tried to include the ambivalent scraper-scaling vixen Black Cat but discovered that they had so much story to get through with Goblin. With part 2 they tried the same thing. Doc Ock was slated as the ideal follow-up villain and once again they were going to get out the black lycra and bon bons but, you guessed it, again, too much story. Spidey 2 is a solid two hours. It's clear very early on that this movie is going to be both very busy and very entertaining for every second of that. You could say another tragic, science-gone-wrong villain was a safety measure but as Arad says, that personal connection Pete has with all of his enemy's is invaluable. There was little time for delay in the first flick but this time we get to explore these relationships and enjoy about 5 parts drama to 1 part action. That's the dynamite of this caper. Some of the set-pieces though are: a classic bank-robbery scene, enough wall-clinging acrobatics and punch-ups, a elevated train Spidey-Ock fight sequence, a token street-crime foiling or two and a classic emergence scene for the eight-limbed Doc Ock. A thought is that we may have just farewelled the best Spidey-villain yet, but by the end of the movie we're only anticipating the third chapter a whole lot more, though many might be a little ashamed for having survived all those years of Jane Austin and the soaps only to fall hard for this ensemble.With so much current fan-focus regarding Spidey 3 being on what villains it'll have, the true delight will be remembering on that grand day that the best moments of part 2 were the final ones, and they didn't involve a fight or a foe. Telling, could it be, that they signed Elizabeth 'Peggy Brant' Banks on so soon? Hopefully 3 will raise the bar yet again in drama, taking Pete to brand new places and not fumble in delivering generously on part II's numerous establishments and potentials. Given my choice I wouldn't have brought Venom into the first trilogy. To begin with he's a completely different universe, but more importantly he was part of a whole saga (minus the planet) without which he might hardly be Venom. The fact that he's a big enough crucible to justify an entire movie standalone would indeed make him a useful pillar in a movie that was very busy otherwise, but it would also make him a wasted potential (great choice of actor if word is right though - making the journalist convincing and interesting is more important than the demon Â– Rock and Diesel would have been bad ideas). It sounds like Manwolf is in too, certainly they'll need John to get Venom anyway. But how are they meant to carry Pete & MJ, Harry's tormented rise, John Jameson's affliction and the Eddie Brock backstory all in one movie? It shouldn't feel like a constant onslaught of developments like a certain recent third-chapter sci-fi. Space is premium is Spider-man flicks and the movie has to retain itself. They've established great drama as the attraction. I'm glad they wanted to take their time nutting this one out, but latest evidence indicates no limit to their capability.",Null,0,0,2 August 2005
Batman Returns," This Rosemarys Baby sequel lives up to the standard of the original!
","Nothing more than a B movie with an A budget, watching it now you can see a cartoony not comic style to it and an un-credible saturday morning serial feel. The story starts out with a Rosemary's Baby rip off and procedes to avoid other rip offs by taking unjustifiable turns.In one shot Batman is saying 'his parents....I hope he finds them' and one following minutes later he suddenly comes up with 'I think he knows who his parents are....there is something else' this is an obvious pretence at moving the story along. People have always tried to get darker with sequels, in this one, Tims way of doing so is to turn Batman into a mercenary, The Joker into a violent savage freak, and Vicki Vale into a sadistic lady of the evening.This movie just comes off as underwhelming, the best that can be said is that the performances are mostly excellent, Walken acts like he doesn't want to be there and I have seen him do more than credible work in the past. After looking at all of Burton's work you can see exactly how sick the guy really is, his best work was The Nightmare Before Christmas, but even in that you can see a bit of a derranged psychology.This movie lives up to the standard of it's original. Batman Forever captures the true heart of The Dark Knight, not the original, but the true. You could never see this movie and not lose sleep over it. See this movie if you are after a lighter toned 'The Crow'. 6.5/10",Null,0,0,20 May 2001
The Mummy," Indiana Jones and the Lost City of Haemunaptra
","This does borrow heavily from the Indiana Jones formula but the characters are not only likeable but memorable and the one liners are by far the best I've heard in years. Rick, Benney, Johnathan and even the chick Evelyn are all a scream and pleasure to watch follow this one through. It is hugely toungue in cheek, I believe that this is what is effecting alot of opinion around here, everyone, it does not take it's self anywhere near seriously. 'Kill the bad guy, rescue the damsel in distress, save the world' that sums it up perfectly. The action is a delight, the interactions of everybody, it is one huge pleasure feast, they have left behind all the corny fright stuff of the classics and made this a special effects and humour driven rollercoaster.  The add for the sequel looks like they may have left behind what was best about this one, it seems to be more serious and paced action stuff but so did the add for this original. This is one of the greatest adventure flicks ever made, do yourself a favour and see it. 10/10 for its perfection.",Null,2,2,25 March 2001
Chicken Run," Definitely for kids with adult accompaniment.
","This movie is a big disappointment. While the animation, now not as spectacular as before is good this movie never reaches great. It pretty much is just an extension of a Wallace and Grommit style show.While some of the gags are mature this does not transcend beyond the kid age range. Some jokes are old, some are just dumb, many are corny and none are subtle, they very obviously had a forum and plonked in all the chicken puns they could. Some things are a little too harsh to appeal to all ages, mainly decapitating a terrified duck. The prison camp idea is not really explored well, though it has a million nods to 'The Great Race'. It also explores all trodden territory, like choosing to make an effort to get free, learning to cooperate with people you dont like, and going back on a profession that you dont care about someone, the kids love that stuff but older people yawn at it. Braveheart comes into it, the jokes based on it come off the funniest. The vocals don't credit Mel very much, nor the rest of the cast. The most likeable character in it is not Mel but the major who is the organised military presence.Basically if you liked Wallace and Grommit or child jokes and ethics in a disney cartoon time length then this is your flick, if you are looking for a Toy Story 2 quality appeal fest dont bother, for what it is I suppose, 7/10.",Null,0,1,21 May 2001
X-Men," Falls short of X-Ellent.
","The movie here is very refined, there is less action than I hoped and less complications, it's just like a feature length translation of a cartoon episode but in the compilation only.Hugh Jackman in the lead role is a standout but more credit should be given to the two veterans Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart. After the dodgey turn of the Obi Wan role in spawn and the rather lacking performance of Kris Kristopherson in Blade it is great to see two such respectable actors as McKellan and Stewart commiting so much quality and belivability to something this trivial.The story is extremely concise but all round the performances make this more a character based work. It was great to see Park staying present in his off the wall job as toad (did you notice the pole move he did at the top of the elevator shaft, an evident reference to his previous and most famous film role as Darth Maul, he has 3 hits to his name now, though his casting as the headless horsemen can almost be taken as an insult. He does not get half the credit he deserves for his talent of mixing action and character.I wanted more Wolverine action, easily the best character of the series, I suppose the lack of fight scenes in general though made this more a kids experience and gave more light to the characters. I look forward to sequel, I suspect they did with this what was done with the Toy Story pair, have just enough of a good thing in the original to make the sequel twice as entertaining, I suspect they will toss in all the action scenes and enjoy greater success with Part II. The latest craze seems to be beating originals, M:I 2, Toy Story 2, Star Wars I, Hannibal and The Mummy Returns has already topped it's originals domestic tally and is showing strength overseas.X-Men deserves a 7.5/10",Null,0,0,27 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This thing is no improvement over Menace.
","Last time the promotional campaign for Menace was virtually free, I need not say why. Despite some wow-full returns many lost faith and were aghast that they could have been such sheep.But the money-men had another card to play, and play it they did. A masterful teaser trailer that inspired a huge degree of intrigue. 'It's all Obi Wan's fault - He's holding me BACK!' The teen audience they were targeting I have no doubt bought the Darth Vader as a brash and furious young Jedi Knight discovering great abilities in himself and romping with a gorgeous career and warrior-chick, but that is not the card I'm talking about. Word was 'leaked', like hell, that the new movie was a return to form, and for the most part McGregor was on side making Menace the fall-guy so that Clones could be the must-see rave of both critics and audiences alike. A script reviewer and a critic or two and some focus groups all gave it the thumbs up, but when my idol Steven Spielberg also enthused about the action phase of the new trilogy I took it for granted that Clones would deliver, the promise of Yoda going a round also was a pivot point.AND WHAT!!!! The love story in Clones is devoid of romance, the love dialogue is appalingly amateurish, and the score, which made Titanic's hug-n-kissing soar is pretty flat for this movie. You don't really care if they care and most of the time your cringing about Hayden's ill-moments. The pivotal scene of the movie is ruined because Lucas obviously had no idea how to handle it and Hayden was not up to the task. He's tried to get a bit too poetic about the Vader transformation, it's lead him into strange territory. The climactic duel does not compare to Menace's score-driven ride. No intriguing teen ground is covered, the story may hold through and does feel a bit Saturday-serialish but is mostly just extremely busy. Jango Fett may have a larger role but he does not hold a candle to the late Mr. Maul. There was not much dueling in any of the originals compared to Menace, doing the same here was a mistake. The jab-swish romp feels like it is over before it starts, you'll cheer Yoda but afterwards you'll remember the rest of the movie.Lee is good (is he ever not) but his scenes are not well written and the story so imperfectly transferred to screenplay. Co-Screenwriter Jonathan Hales (who did likewise for The Scorpion King) only added in some humour, the rest feels extremely Lucas. And any grand conceptions you had about seeing Jedi Knights at last in action and great number, can be ditched now. Sam LJ's combat is a little embarassing and the finale is such a choppily-edited everything-but-the-kitchen-sink job...Ill tidings are that Lucas is re-filming for and completely updating the classic trilogy, presumably for the DVD edition. Well he can print one less copy and I suspect more than one, leave those movies the hell alone! The story is told in six parts and you don't go back round chopping and changing each part to clean up any mess you make! They have been released in final form, TWICE! I let the SE trilogy slide because changes were minimal, enough is enough.The best man won. Spider-man delivers the thrills I hoped it would, Clones comes way short. Its not my biggest disappointment for the year though, I hand that trophy to 'Ali', which also had a kick-ass trailer. I have no faith that this trilogy will be considered as anything more than a taster for die-hards of the classics. Lucas can not possibly deliver in the next installment, even a master like Tolkien would be hard pressed and Lucas is not even a Dunce student to that guy. I'd like to thank him for his efforts, its been a bit of fun but SW recents can join my kinda-maybe-care list. I'm waiting on The Two Towers, and the Fellowship Extended Edition DVD, DAMN that is cinema!",Null,0,1,20 August 2002
10 Things I Hate About You," You can't fault this one, it just aint typical.
","When hiring this movie was first suggested I turned up my nose at it. I thought, another teenagers flick where the hottest guy in school has to appreciate a lesser unpopular chick etc etc etc. Since seeing it it has enterred my all time favourites list. Any old somebody can take the formula of The Taming of the Shrue and put it into a school yard, and any old somebody can avoid cle she's in the finer details, coming up with decent alternatives is the hard part, whatever they did here works like clockwork. I would easily give it the best teen flick mantle.Firstly, the acting is perfect, the roles are not overly demanding but Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger play this to perfection. The supporting cast is great aswell, there is not a soul that doesn't contribute to the perfection of it all. Realism is neither what they were really going for nor what makes the movie. The language and vocabulary of these kids is phenominal, words like, Vapid, Pensive, Hanus, Tempestuous, Miscreants. There are lots of words like these throughout the movie. It is the thing that does the most to enable adult enjoyment.For once they avoided the school bully theme, the bad guy in this is just a model who the chicks like and some of the guys hang with and alot of others just realise he is a fool. The recessive geek role is this time given alot more credibility, he is given the majority of the genuinely witty one liners and finds a soul mate for himself, instead of them just making it a joke that he stays a joke. There are a few parts you can really cheer in, you have to watch it to appreciate them. There is truly never a dull moment.
The best quote of the whole movie would have to be 'it's just an excuse for all the nerds at our school to rub up against each other to distract themselves from the pathetic emptiness of thier meaningless consumer driven lives' that pretty much sums up the purpose of teen parties these days. For once you actually identify with the 'bitch' role in this, both she and the guy that is falsely pursuing her take a backward step, usually when it comes time for the leading man to apolagise for his deceit you really cant believe him after they have focused for so long on his efforts, this time for some reason you do, it fits straight into the story. There is another half to that situation here aswell but I wont disclose, it is probably the best bit of the movie.And the last major point is that this time the father character is a hell of alot stronger than before, if that had been weak so would the rest of the movie have been, but he is not. He has a reason for being there and you identify with him aswell. It is clear to see they were making the characters all strong in thier own right and stronger than the actual story.To sum it all up the characters, story and acting are all perfect, adults can enjoy this one aswell, also because the main relationships are more stable and adult than the unpredictability of true teenage relationships, if they can be called such. So here is the count.Production Values 2/2, Acting 2/2, Quality and Meaning 1.5/2, Screenplay 2/2, Originality 1/2Anyone can get something from this movie and most can get alot. This is a must. For the movie it is I would give it 10 but going by the main qualities listed above which all movies can be measured by it would get8.5/10",Null,60,80,4 March 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Special Extended DVD Edition.
","The majority of my previous review covers the goods about this movie. It wreaks of ALOT of money very well spent, but also tells of a genuine understanding of what draws an audience into a movie. It remains the quintessential Adventure tale. I recap often on the prologue battle, the party, the Weathertop Nazgul biffo, Balins Tomb, the Bridge of Khazad Dum, and The Departure of Boromir and Anything Isenguard or Mordor. Full length I have seen the theatrical version 5 times at cinema, and more than 3 on DVD.Extended Edition.Four Discs all up. 2 for the movie and two for the Extras. One does not need to think of this movie as an alternate version, I do not. It can be seen as an alternative to a 'Deleted Scenes' option. While some extensions seem indispensible, some are jarring and unnecessary. To point examples, the Marshes chapter on Disc 1 with Aragorn and Frodo's exchange is great. The Statue of Aragorns mother scene is also a nice little expansion. But I really do prefer the theatrical versions' Shire sequence. The cut straight out of battles and woeful tidings and the rings damnation of Smeagol to a shot of our good looking young Hobbit hero in brilliant green pastures meeting with Gandalf works far better than a lengthy voiceover with footage, some funny some not quite so, of Hobbits in daily life. Likewise the Extension of 'The Council of Elrond' is a bit unsettling. It is something that features in the book but Gandalfs outburst is prompted better on page, it just seems un called-for in the movie. The extensions to all of the Moria territory (4 chapters) is interesting, though I did not appreciate the mention or pronunciation of 'Smeagol' (Smee-Gol). For people who have read the book, it is recomendable. For people who only enjoyed the initial version on a so-so level, it may test the faith somewhat. For people who found the initial cut interminable and uninteresting, this will prove torturous.Also, the fact that there is no handicap options (subtitles, re-dubs etc.) for the theatrical cut means that this inferior version is the only way for disabled readers or watchers to appreciate the movie (I am not 100% sure that this package has them either, I have not checked conclusively).
The special features, well think of it like this. Thier intent was to convey as much behind the scenes info as possible to the public. And so, two discs (The Appendices) take you through it step by step. A Doco about the Author, followed by 4 more Doco's on Disc 1. Reasonably informative yes. Then try to envisage 25 Headings like, The Fellowship, Saruman, Bilbo, Sauron etc each with dozens of images, photo/sketch/painting on the singular topic. They include some Animatics(computer mockups of a scene), storyboards, the scenes and comparisons for the two. That is only a crude breakdown of Disc 1's contents, much more awaits a viewer.Without trying to convey it all to you here, a wealth of knowledge, well presented, lies in the package. Alas we also have no commentary's for the shorter version meaning more than 2 hours of extra commentary time (over 4 commentary's) to labour through. But I have to admit, it feels like the commentary option was designed for this movie. This is definitely something even a Die Hard would have to OWN. It puts the Spider-man package to shame and indeed every other comparable package (Pearl Harbour) that has come before it. Here is definitely a great movie (reduced to good) with an excellent extras deal.Movie A-Extras A++",Null,0,0,24 November 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I am very disappointed! (in some comments I have read)
","There is the Lord of the Rings book, a masterpiece of storytelling and there is the movie trilogy. It comforts me that they have reviewed the entire book and tied up a few links in this one to the next two, re-working I think it's called. To name two that come to mind, Sarumans on-screen anti-environmental foolishness and the burial boat going over the waterfall, both were something brought to light only in the second novel, tying in two more characters respectively.Tom Bombadil. A reader doesn't mind a couple of chapters on father nature that don't relate to the rest of the story, viewer's are a different matter. Glorfindel bights the dust making way for Arwen in seeking thier love dimension to the story. They have also borrowed the first chapter of The Two Towers for the climax. The Wizards duel as well, audiences would not be satisfied with Gandalf just submitting at threat so they worked in a 'Willow'-ish Wizard fight which is quite good. And finally they keep us up to speed on Isenguard and Saruman, and introducing us to the Uruk Hai a little earlier. Non-readers will be pleased to know that the books get progressively shorter with 'Fellowship' the longest and 'Return' the shortest. I would expect that at the end of the year we will be viewing a 2.5 hr movie or there abouts.I have only two complaints. One, you can't really get into the action because the filming is so erratic, and two, Galadriel. Due to either directing or acting she comes off as pompous. The filming also does not do Blanchettes unique beauty justice in some shots. Thats the end of my list of complaints. I LOVED everything else, the vista's, the flawless effects the solid and at points inspiring performances this movie does indeed access all of the cinema pallete, the movie is charming, dazzling, thrilling and saddening. Look no further for the movie that The Phantom Menace never was.
I would also move J.R.R. Tolkien higher on George Lucas's 'borrowings' list, recapping on the book undermines my divotion to Star Wars a bit. From the Obi Wan and Gandalf parallels to the garbage monster scene and lots more. I saw TPM 6 times at the movies mainly because of the Lightsabre duel, I have seen this one 4 already and have no plans to stop there. I'm done with heirachy's too, opinion ones. This movie deserves to be above the Godfather in my opinion, no in Joe Blogs' opinion, yes in Bill Blogg's opinion, I mean who really cares. Everyone has a different agenda. The AFI somehow decided that Jurassic Park and Braveheart both deserved the scrap heap while Annie Hall and Unforgiven and countless others didn't, give me a break. I have my own favourites, they're welcome to thier own.This movie is 2001's best picture, Oscar winner or not. I would say regardless of who wins the BPO, this will snag the biggest tally. What really sucks is the hide of everyone who has made Harry Potter a 700 million mega hit while this sits rotting on a 67 million FIVE day opening weekend, hell 3 movies last year beat that in just THREE days, mind you it has beaten two of those already, a stayer not a sprinter I guess. But it's still like people are getting thier ticket listing botched or something, Potter is a dull CHILDS movie.Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring = 10/10",Null,0,0,8 January 2002
Pitch Black," The Best of it's kind since Aliens.
","What amazes me about this movie is that none of it's creators have much of a filmography. The Director has not done much that was great, G.I. Jane makes a statement about sexes obviously, Womens rights etc, and Waterworld is just one of a mob of Costner glorifiers. The writers are the ones you would least expect to be credited with this, they are veterans of trash like 'It Came From Outer Space', 'Nightmare On Elm Street 376', sorry it was the fourth that they catered for and 'The Fly 2'.The premise fits well with thier rep but the characters and the style are way above. Riddick is an elastic and artificially nocturnal crim, the other guy is a back staving mercenary and good old Caroline is a humane ships captain. Them and a few others are caught on a planet and must get a ship space-worthy as time and personnel numbers dwindle. Yeah that's been done, so has pretty much every avenue movies can take nowadays, but the relationships are what make this one soar. Riddick steals the show, he is just too cool for the others to have a hope. A kind of 'survival of the fittest' logic makes him tick but without even realising it her humanity starts to rub off on him. A by appearance respectable mercenary needs to get him off the planet alive to collect a bounty but Riddick is more than just formidable by appearance, he also has a keen, self-dependant and crafty mind at work, how long can the man who would cross him last.
Then to the Aliens setup. When getting thier bearings the team stumbles upon a couple of undesirable chamelion-like predators beneath the surface, surveying the remains of the previous tenants they start to realise what they are dealing with, the first bomshell comes when they realise that the planet is about to line up for an eclipse that could last from hours to weeks, the problem is that these predators one weakness is light and they are about to re-enter the hunting ground, the team could well be sliced in less time than the minimum duration of the eclipse. Theres plenty of thrillers out nowadays that you can dismiss on appearance, this isn't one. Vin Diesel is on the short road to stardom, this movie is why. You'll be happy to know all you fans that the director and Diesel are getting together for a follow up, dealing mainly with Riddick. I am astounded at the 6.6 rating this movie is on, I sense opinion changed after 'The Fast And The Furious' hit screens, lets work on flipping that.10/10",Null,3,5,15 October 2001

The Fast and the Furious," Loud Lavish and Likeable.
","In the Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze movie 'Point Break', A young cop goes undercover as the member of a team in order to root out some crims and things escalate when they move on the wrong gang and start to realise that the offenders are closer to home than realised. It comes down to a choice between loyalty to his cause or to his friendship. In this flashy, loud and heavy petrol head flick it is no different, infact there are more similarities between them than just in the basics. It is a step by step re-hash. If there was to be between them a re-watch choice it would be this one over and over again though. It is gripping, with solid performances and a unique and impressive look. This movie is easily the best car flick yet.A veteran of Pitch Black, Vin Deisel I would say is headed for action stardom. He's a similar character in both but it doesn't matter. Pitch black is an under-rated gem and this by legitimate critics reviews is a worthily rated gem. I think they deserve Sound Design and Cinematography oscar nominations for it, the Limp Bizkit overtures are the only thing really that could do them out of it, they have the worst rep on the globe which is why they are so successfull, the oldies who vote for the academy would hate that. Don't go past this one for the best teen flick this year and one of the best in years.8.5/10",Null,1,1,12 October 2001
Batman Begins," Hattrick.
","You could take that to mean the original two Batman flicks and Begins but I'm certainly talking about the 3 comic book-film sagas that have actually made it above water. 'Catwoman's, 'Punisher's, controversial 'Hulk's, etc give comic book movies a bad name justly or unjustly. 'Blade's, 'Hellboy's and 'Sin City's can subsist for costing less but the big, trans-labelled three are X-Men, Spider-man and Batman. If Superman Returns and The Flash make it next year then it'll be good to have DC back in the light for the Marvel era. RIP the Superman-Batman DC age, 1978 to 1997.I've changed my position on the original 4 Batmans since seeing Begins. Batman has to be dark, not an MTV merchandising hub. Keaton getting battered and tossed by villains is frustrating, there's the height question to irritate, but I like the darkness, laughs, noir, score, sadistic edge and tragic overtones of Burton that polarize it from otherwise rainbow superheroes. Batman Forever; interesting story, the best Batman portrayer, though unfortunate that Kilmer didn't put on enough muscle for the role, good score, animated performances. It holds up unto itself, but not alongside the others and especially Begins. Where is the credibility in two athletic young bachelor billionaires each scarred by an early family-loss co-existing in the tabloids with two gadget-rife, turbo-powered, militarily-vehicle, thug-slugging city avengers, one barely even under a mask, bearing remarkable resemblance? Robin out. Skip to Drake and Nightwing if totally necessary. Begins is realism.So Batman Begins didn't exactly wow with its gross, but that was completely predictable. Already the most enduring and arguably biggest comic book movie series, a lot of territory was covered and much of the Batman urgency was spent. Any fallout from the protested part 4, an agreeable renter but no challenge to its predecessors. The appropriate seriousness, subdued tones and discretion of the Begins trailer, not a kiddie puller and heeding to pre-suppositions. Probably above all, there was no popular villains. Scarecrow, though one of the originals, was a lurch from obscurity for the masses Â– those popularised in the 60s TV show that gave Batman such an edge with modern audiences were Burton or Schumackered. Lastly, there was the shot of that Bat-mask. People were never going to flock to see a mortal in blocky rubber as they had before Spider-man, Xavier's troop and all the rest of the super-powered lot had swung. At first. Initially, it was going to feel like a step back on some level.But that is the transcendental beauty of Batman Begins and Batman: the superhero that isn't super. He wasn't bitten by a radioactive spider, he was never hit by gamma or radiation, he never left the earth's surface. What he did was don the guise of the bat and struggle manfully against organised crime and equally scarred maniacs for love of a city that had plagued the world's nightmares since metropolises first began springing up. Every thud, every leap, every drop of blood was that of a man no more super than any of us. The mask was what was truly fantastical, an overpass to power, mystery and unrelenting justice. On one side of it was a dark and fearful legend, unnatural in the word of folk. On the other was a face from high society. The cave, the car, the hook, the belt, the batarang, were Batman's super powers; what made him a one-man army where the masses that a dark metropolis could throw at his lone cause might have overwhelmed. Bruce's journey to the point of that transformation is the excitement in precisely the same way his troubles retaining his sanity and humanity beneath the mantle are afterward.Begins signals his Detective Comics age, where a bit more sunlight is allowable with his movement in the real world. At the height of population there was the entire team of Batman, Robin, Alfred, Gordon, Nightwing, Oracle, Catwoman, Batman understudy Jean Paul/Azrael and others all fighting a global cause. After such a dense and exciting first chapter establishing Batman the hard work is done and we haven't even got to the real fun yet. Do I hear a green-haired maniac's demonic cackle? Bane awaits. It may not have 'Spider-man'-ed or even 'X-Men'-ed at the box office but they'd be idiots not to think they're sitting on a Matrix Reloaded opening with part two (and no more of that legacy). Shame about Holmes, her presence was welcome, the performance was solid, and I don't want this to be the beginning of yet another infuriating Bond tradition of changing women every movie. Fisher taking up the same role is one of the first things we'll forget about once we're watching a solid sequel, but otherwise, coming up with a satisfactory way to write Dawes out is the first hurdle. And in case they're wondering, yes, a certain brain-damaged horse rider does return in part II.NO TEAMUPS! The biggest fun is ahead. What we're dealing with is the clash of a psychotic shrink with the city's deadliest nutter. I don't want, and I suspect many second the motion, another wussy villain team-up in part 2, or a sidedish baddie. Joker is the villain intent on pushing Batman as close to the edge as possible, and he'll do anything to stop someone killing Batman because that would ruin his fun and his whole cause for being. The movie that it can be at best with yet another dark alliance isn't half what a three-way powerplay can be. Dynamite. NO TEAMUPS! Like the X-Mens and the superb Spider-man 2 they have left a number of threads to take up in the sequel. In Begins they don't get to explore the duality of Bruce Wayne and Batman, where one ends and the other begins. Joker is the tool invented for that very purpose. Great work.",Null,3,4,20 July 2005
Good Will Hunting," Really quite slick and cool.
","What I heard about this movie prior to seeing it sparked my interest more than usually happens, the Oscars didn't really have a lot of bearing but they helped, and what is more I am not disappointed with it.Matt Damon plays a young Indiana Jones (IJATLC) sort of character, he knows history like the back of his hand, he can spout poetry, titles, quotes and even entire sentences from a specific book as easy as his name. With the winning script they do their best to avoid most of the cle she's, they do not glorify what he can do very much, just enough to establish the extent of it, they make a lot of mention of previous cases of genius discovered in a strange place just so that your disbelief retreats a little, and they down play the whole teacher relationship details and leave the inevitable kids change to accepting the teacher to a single, clear and early point.
It manages to be attractive and entertaining but also with relevance to reality and people relationships. Wills trouble with accepting people does not come off as corny and unbelievable but one of a few prominent aspects that have front row seats. You really have to like the movie for it's rich entertainment status. One unsettling thing is the lack of conclusion to the ending but it is probably better that way, what was shown at the ending would make the difference between one category and another, it keeps the focus on the right parts of the movie.Williams never really reaches great in his performance, he basically just plays a recessive person and sincerely states some lines, compare his supporting performance to say, Christopher Walken in The Deer Hunter, there is a role with some content and depth, or, though I know this will cause trouble, Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator, just as Crowe brought some winning depth to a done time-and-again character so too did Phoenix, through tears, amusement, heartbreak and rage he constructed an in depth performance. Williams win to some extent confirms the history of the award though, how did John Geilgud for his one track comedy role in Arthur, or Don Ameche for a single teary scene in Cocoon or Sean Connery for playing a mature version of the same character he had always played win, it's a career award, Williams has had an entire career of comedy roles and been nominated three times previous, such a change in this role and the fact that it was time brought the win.Back on the movie, it really is cool, though not as impacting as Titanic it well deserved its nomination. This film gets a solid 8.5, it isn't 100% original so consequently can't take all the credit, but see this movie if you have not already, it is more than worth it.",Null,0,2,6 May 2001
Patton," Leading performance was excellent.
","Despite the dispicable things that Patton did and the ways he went about them I found myself half understanding why, and George C. Scott more than just plays out the role, he really makes every piece credible, I have never before seen someone convincingly talk about being a re-incarnation, it half left you wondering a bit with his description of the time and saying he could smell the battle, I would guess the dialogue was approximated from the testimony of the man with him.The movies attention to detail and conciderations on political, moral and war opinions make you wonder about every other great wartime hero. Many must have had faults some possibly even as bad or worse than Patton's but because some of his surfaced at the right times to make a big splash controversially this man got blown up into one of the most notorious leaders in history. At the point where he whacked the private over the head and cursed him I was wishing it was him to eat a bullet for his behaviour.There is nothing really to rate this down, entertainment value is not high but if it was it would detract from the films importance. It's one of the most enduring and informative biographies. To people not interested in the topic you may not sit this one through but for film watchers or people interested in wartime leadership or American history I highly recommend it.",Null,2,4,15 May 2001
From Dusk Till Dawn," This is not a cross over between B and A movies.
","I recently saw Full Tilt Boogie, a documentary on making this particular flick and it did not really shed any new light from seeing the movie itself. I can see from it that Academy Award winner Quentin Tarantino is a fowl mouthed and minded egotistical child not dissimilar to much of the crew but my opinion of him aside here goes.The idea that they strongly state is that you get to know the characters very well before the turning point of the story and then they start killing them off. That concept is not a bad one but that is the only thing separating this from B gore flick grade. The vampires look and act 100% fake not to mention putrid and sickening. The gore is completely off the wall and occasionally inconsistent and the plot has one major hole. That being that much could have been prevented if they had just applied a cross to the door, not gone out and hoped for the best. They try for a deeper character exploration with the Gheko brother and in actuality the relationship for the time it lasts is strong. The refencing of the bible and religion is either insulting or redeeming. A priest has lost not his faith in but his love for God and his savior Jesus, which he evidently gets back after Holy water is successfully made. I didn't actually see it coming but that is an objective view of a priests importance.Basically the makeup is terrible, the story is predominantly shoddy and the gore is unjustifiedly bad, how could they have ever hoped for a hit with this one.",Null,0,0,20 May 2001
Annie Hall," Neither entertaining nor a masterpiece of film making.
","The Academy Awards Broadcast in 1978 charted one of the top 3 Oscar tune-ins ever, and I've no doubt if Best Picture had been the first presented award of the night it would have also charted the largest and fastest viewers tune-out in history. Annie hall is no more than a dressed up romantic comedy, the only new twist even for the time was that he didn't get the girl. I am surprised that it took her that long to realise that he is a winging, inconsiderate, and negative little pessimist. He uses gags like the sub text communicating thoughts, and talking to people in the street like a roving reporter to hide the fact that otherwise he has a tiring, run-of-the-mill screenplay.He prattles on with 'meaning of life' drivel all through the movie which is another vain attempt to bring depth to this sickly uninteresting flick. One true highlight is seeing Jeff Goldblum make a one line appearance at the party towards the end. And the now notorious times when he narrates, talking to the camera that have been sent up numerous times since, he looks dead set like he is acting, he tries to assume a nervous air air but it comes off as a presumptive performance. I know it is tradition for academy members to nominate the lead actor in the flick you are voting Best Picture but in this case it is a great detraction from the credibility of the Academy. The movie is neither entertaining nor a masterpiece of film making. Handing it Best Picture over the entertainment giant Star Wars was beyond ridiculous. It really does just have nothing to recommend it.",Null,2,6,16 May 2001
The Mummy Returns," A sumptuous feast in the truest sense of the word.
","Like a Toy Story 2 complex, more of everything, they reference the original and a million other movies in no small way, through Terminator 2, to The Lost World, and an ending that borrows heavily from Star Wars Episode I. Everyone knows they got the energy from Indiana Jones for both movies but this one doesn't really rip off any particular part of the series. The acting is great, there is no woodenness or badly spoken lines, and every character gets a claim to fame. The biggest problem is that there is so much luscious digital that it leaves a pretty cartoony feel, I think perhaps they did go overboard with that effects work.The story is comprehensive and relentless, it just keeps on moving. They had to take the characters to the next level or it would not have been enough. In the words of Liam Neeson 'it's probably a bit too much to take in in one sitting, that's why you have to see it two and three times' he said that of Episode I, which I disagree with, EI was pretty cut and dried after one sitting but this twists and turns with maximum content all through.Basically the beginning leaves you dying for more and more. The Scorpion King and his army after many a battle, ending in a failed war campaign is exiled and as the sole survivor he makes a pact with the Coyote God Anubis, dirt simple, his soul in exchange for not dying of thirst. A bit of a Spawn type of arrangement. The god accepts and he leads the Army of Anubis Warriors and after all is conquered him and his army are put on the back burner for 3, 000 or so years.The exact details of how he and his army are raised and what determines when are a little hard to follow but basically, a week after Rick and Evelyn open the chest containing his bracelet he and his army will be out and about. Now theres a bad guy who wouldn't mind having the army lead against the world but the only problem is, in order to control the army you have to kill the Scorpion King, thats where Imhotep Aka, The Mummy (Arnold Vosloo) comes into it. Imhotep resurrected is the only being who could ever do so (or is he). So fossilised in an amber like substance (from the original) he gets shipped to London along with the baddy and his enterage in pursuit of the Oconnels who split with the Scorpion Kings bracelet. After a hell of a chase sequence from four mummies, courtusy of a resurrcted Imhotep the action heads back to Egypt for a million more fight scenes and chase sequences, mummies, mini-mummies, armed guards and thier Seti Bodyguard Descendant from the original who gets a much larger and cool part.To get a clear overview of this movie you have to see it more than once, which is not to say there isn't plenty to warrant doing so. This movie is rich with all the summer blockbuster goods and a record breaking weekend gross to prove it. It made nearly 70 million winter dollars by then but has only moved just past 80 since. I wish it all the best, this a worthy sequel to The Mummy and may just succeed where it failed, I would like to see it lop Hannibal off within another 5 weeks, a not unrealistic possibility, see this one, you'll definitely get your moneys worth.",Null,0,0,11 May 2001
Toy Story 2," The greatest Disney flick by far and a top of all-timer.
","One gets to thinking that they deliberately refined the original in order to have a superior sequel. It is hard to compare the entertainment value of the original to this one, it's the classic sequel thing certainly, more and better of everything, up the stakes and down slowness. This one is an absolute delight to watch from beginning to end, more humour, more action, more characters, more locations and it is really hard to fault.
This time it is Woody that goes missing so you get to see Buzz in all his glory hit the town with one-liners and gadgets galore. He's not alone though. Instead of having three locations to follow, Woody, Buzz and back home, they hop everyone on the band wagon and really explore the idea of living toys wandering around the streets, in buildings and elevators, air vents, cars, trucks, airports and air planes and they couldn't resist including my No. 2 hope for the sequel which is having two Buzz Lightyears about the place, my No. 1 hope they also carried out, having Buzz take on the previously mentioned Arch rival, Emperor Zerg, with some references throughout the movie to all the favourite box office hits, Star Wars to a huge extent, Jurassic Park, Forrest Gump and a heap more. It's a pretty evident crowd pleaser formula but entertainment is what these movies are all about. Since I got this one on video I havn't touched the original.You definitely will not be disappointed with this movie. I hardly had a Disney favourites heirachy untill this one, it's original was there at 1. And the critics and global audience agreed with us as this movie took its totally unexpected No. 3 of the year rank, beating out the Heartthrob adventure flick, The Mummy, the by account standardised Disney flick Tarzan and the lavishly effected Sunnies and leather Teen-flick The Matrix. That year was all about remakes and sequels was'nt it.

Titanic," Let's ditch our biases and be a bit fair!
","There is certainly alot of biases about this movie. The chicks worship Leo so he delivered a terrible performance. Its one of the 10 biggest ticket sellers in history so it must be a terrible and unjustified success. And on the other side, everyone loves it and so I must, the Academy loved it and so it must be one of the greatest movies of all time. Leo really didn't give alot to the movie but his presence did not detract, just the same as Kevin Costner in Dances With Wolves, he was just as wooden but for some strange reason he got nominated, he had about 1 and perhaps 2 different facial expressions but the movie soured as a masterpiece anyway. Titanic is one of the best theatre experiences, I never actually did see at the theatre but I saw twice on video, it is easy to imagine it, movies always are 100 times better on the big screen. Its becoming more and more rare now that people go with the crowd for the sake of it but occasionally we should try not to be so opinionated that we dont listen to anyone else. The Academy members were fresh out of the Theatres when the golden boy ballots arrived, the tactic is always a good one and had bearing here.Basically, James Cameron was 300 nautical miles from an original screenplay, and 882 feet from a historical tribute but the movie remains powerfull, a combination of the score, the vistas and general cinematography, the in your face presence of the movie and the usual 'dont let go' love story stuff pulled it off very well, it had me rivetted and I wouldn't mind one more viewing. Some of the blue screen shots are atroscious sure, and some of the digital effects leave me at a loss to understand why it won the award for them, Billy Zane and the supporting cast are all good, Winslet put in a good performance despite some of the previously mentioned laughable dialogue delivered to and by her. I reckon this movie holds interest alot better than many other epics, especially Gone With The Wind, Titanic needed its duration for the movies meaning and quality. I find it hard to believe that a ship crew would be riveted by some old ladies story about an in-cruise fling she had decades on decades ago, that was really corny.Just as a movie in my own opinion I'd give it 8.5, but by the constant cinema standards:Production values: 2/2, Quality and Meaning 1.5/2, Acting 2/2, Screenplay 1.5, Originality .5/27.5/10",Null,0,2,22 March 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," I personally loved it!
","I loved that shot where you saw him from behind, some of the lovers dialogue was a little corny but the duel shots were great. Christopher Lee looks cool and especially the army shot presumably of clones on the ramp, as well as the one where he is riding the speeder on Tatooine, that was cool as well, as for the bounty hunter shots, it was well worth 13.50. I suppose they added the bonus movie 'Harry Potter and the Cinematographer's Stone' to satisfy the non Star Wars fans, I didn't mind that too much really though.
It seemed no sooner was that old guy Dimpledell and that chick lighting lamps than I was waking up to a train heading away from a huge guy (Beorn from 'The Hobbit' I think he was). I must have been conscious some of the time I suppose though because I remember something about an evil black warrior who turns people to the dark side and seems to have a bit of Phantom of the Opera/and that 'open your mind' guy from Total Recall, complex. I suppose it's a comfort to know that the underground wizard teachers are as ditsy and incompetent favouritists as every-day ones and that the students are as snobby, stuck up and in short cle she-ish as unskilled writers and Disney have always renderred them, and the best news is that Gandalf found a place to settle down and share his knowledge, also as a part-time Santa Clause. I also remember a part of it where one kid pulls out a cloak, holds it infront of himself discovering that it makes him invisible and another kid says, 'I know what that is! thats an invisible cloak!' Harry must truly be a unique kid I would think, to walk through a wall to a magicians city, make a wand send books flying, find out he is bill gates' heir (or the equivalent), see a talking hat read his mind and then see a 20ft troll and still be wowing when tiny white butterflies appear out of nowhere.
Rowling does not really have a very fertile imagination. Harry Potter is an uninspiring two step equasion. Nobody could really believe that kids would remember any of the 'love' messages or care about them, what they remember is how to cast spells, use a wand, respond to authority, respond to danger, and respond to warning. Harry Potter has no sense of narrative or entertainment, and certainly none of originality. There are points that you hope it will go somewhere but at the same time you can't see it happening, and your fears are rewarded. 10 year olds minus would like this, I am mystified as to where the trans generationalism is. Studios basically don't care about our opinions, because most blockbusters now days seem to justify thier budget in two weeks or less, after that we can pretend all we like that our opinions matter.In all I would award an 8/10 I suppose, they have betrayed just enough to us but not too much about Episode II. See that trailer while Harry Potter remains in the cinemas, what I really like is that they perfectly picked thier movies, that trailer has been seen by 2 of the 3 biggest american audiences of 2001.",4,0,1,3 January 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," More 'Empire Strikes Back' than 'The Two Towers'.
","I saw this movie time 1. It washed over me and its two-tone look did not pack the razzle dazzle of X2 or Spider-man. I saw this time 2 and I realised the problem. Reloaded and Revolutions (the latter unseen) feel like one movie chopped in half. Expectation is its bane. Never in the Wachow-bros' media history (two quotations so far) have they claimed to be publishing a religious or philosophical gospel for the techno age in The Matrix trilogy. Critics and cultics have done all the talking for them, no doubt to the writers' regret.The ingenious thing about Reloaded is that the two brothers have not retreated further into the boundaries that they set up in the first one. Instead they have burst from them and at the two-thirds mark in the saga we are again wondering where the hell the next part will take us; in a good way. Their biggest achievement is making the audience member both wonder about the ongoing tale and care enough to find out. I always knew it lacked the kiddie appeal to beat Attack of the Clones in america, I was wrong about overseas but in the quality court it is the winner. Clones bores at numerous points and in the end offers no reward, Reloaded leaves many threads to be tied off in Revolutions. Agent Smith, Bane, and the grim future for Zion (the free humans) which seems unavoidable. And they tease the crap out of us with 'The Kid' who features in The Animatrix. What the hell is his story?The Animatrix comes highly recomended if you've seen this movie. But it wont spoil much if you havn't. Either way it expands the universe for you and gives answers that you may have been waiting on. But whatever the verdict on Reloaded, I guaruntee you its not what you expect. The Zion party is the simplest way of demonstrating the human spirit's worth even in the most dismal of circumstances.They have kept the sophistication of Part 1 and start to answer the question posed that may not have occurred to you before-hand. If Neo has all these fantasic abilities within the Matrix, what good does it do him in the real world? The oracle returns breifly to again direct him on his path. There is more fights as anyone with eyes would know but to my disappointment the Agent Smith battle royal comes early in the movie and alas they had nothing up their sleave to raise the bar in the climax. There are some novelty's that they tease us with like Vampires and Werewolves but those confrontations come in the second act and dont really get much air.I'm now primed for 'Finding Nemo' and Joel Silver (Matrix Producer) may have to eat his words; ('nobody can compete with us') Until Nemo came along though he appeared dead right. But you can quote me on this, The Hulk and Terminator 3 will not be competing in the $270 millions range which the summer gold medal will call for. They will be lucky to beat X2.If you liked the first Matrix enough to be strung along for another 5 months or so then Reloaded will do you good. Still, I will own the trilogy on DVD come summer next year. Moderate your expectation and wonder before watching 'the new matrix movie' what they can thrill you with and what would be incongruous to part I. Great stuff! Go see!",Null,0,0,18 June 2003
Rosemary's Baby," A non-gory B horror flick.
","They have flipped the Jesus Christ birth story. This time the devil selects a earthly woman to impregnate with HIS baby so that the kid can go on to fight for HIS cause. They brought the controversial idea into the modern day (1968) which increases the scare by half and used an underground society of aged pagans to set the situation up. Given this obvious 'Stephen King' type reversal the creativity ends.The Husband as audiences see half way through or earlier chooses a successfull career in the movies with the assistance of the group over a love for his wife a first born of his own, not to mention the ethics involved in knowingly bringing about the son of the hadies lord. When the idea was first conceived by the author of the book they knew they would get praise from the people who would not pan the daring concept. This flick was nominated for it's writing adaptation and the sour life-offputting performance of the head pagan lady won for her Supporting Role.This is maximum negative mind candy, the base idea for which is an obvious concept, neither profound nor moving and if you are willing to play along with it, it can be a little scary, the ending also is just anti-pleasant, I can see little justification for it. For a non-gory B flick I give it 7/10.",Null,0,0,21 May 2001
Ice Age," Not what I had hoped for.
","I'm afraid he may have gone overboard with this movie, in a backlash against Episode 1's reception. I've been following it on the unofficial news site and in the theatres. Too much digital, too much Lightsabring and its all anachronistic to the classic trilogy, it could still pack some good thrills though.Now about Ice Age. It doesn't belabour the hip humour like Monsters, Inc., that style I believe is wearing thin already, and after less than a decade. This movie recycles everything basically, Jar Jar included. It still packs some big laughs though I must admit. But other ones are skipped over so quick that there is no time to appreciate them, eg. 'there'll be plenty of time to play extinction later kids.' The story also at points is a bit borderline for it's target audience and after less than a month the movie as a whole starts to rot in the memory. The little dude with the wallnut is the most memorable thing but he gets such a harsh beating from the Coyote/Road Runner gags that you feel too sorry for him, it's extremely violent.So basically all that's left is the glory of the landscapes and vistas, which are of high note. At the time you forgive the movie for that, but there is not enough otherwise to recommend a second cinema viewing, and the cinema is the only place you'll really appreciate that redeeming factor. Besides that is pretty much all we get nowadays is astounding visuals. 'films', are fast retreating the onslaught of 'movies', and even movies are fleeing the advance of 'blockbusters'. If there is one thing cinema is not short of its technological breakthroughs.The very conclusion, though irrelivant to the core story is both unexpected and refreshingly novel. But this movie is not much chop, and easily forgettable. Watch Shrek or Toy Story 2 instead, and Disney is unlikely to put anything of that grade out again. You will all have noticed the amount cheap Disney '2' movies coming out, Cinerella, Peter Pan etc.6.5/10",Null,0,0,16 April 2002
The Sixth Sense," You cant sum it up in one line
","***************************SPOILERS************************************* IF YOU ARE READING THIS TO DESCIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO SEE THE MOVIE AND HAVE SOMEHOW NOT HEARD SPOILER DETAILS ALREADY THEN READ NO FURTHER. THIS MOVIE IS DESTROYED FAR MORE THAN MOST BY SUCH INFORMATION AND IT IS CONTAINED IN THIS REVIEW.All talk was about this movie by the movie watchers and anyone else who had ssen it and there is alot to talk about, it is possibly one of the best first-time experiences, but repeated viewings I believe really wear it thin.I will never know if I could have predicted the ending because it was destroyed for me weeks before I used the cinema entrance. The movie is definitely not run of the mill, more than standard quality but it is clear to see plot faults and severe borrowings in it.Have you ever thought about the idea of a modern day ghost walking around and not realising they were dead, what if Patrick Swayze had gone on longer after he had pursued the bad guy not realising he was dead, or the idea of a person being able to see them like Woopi Goldberg could hear them, how freaked out would you be growing up with that. These are some pretty good 'the drive home after the movies' discussions. How could Bruce Willis have gone on after the first night without realising it. Think about the living complications we all experience every day, things we take for granted. Where was he when his body was taken away in an ambulance, or better still at the funeral. And his employers, when they heard about his death how would he have got the file he was reading when he first saw the kid, he must have been issued it.They light-speeded over the 'they only see what they want to' didn't they, so if he moves around objects that dont really exist or are'nt really moving like the pen and paper as he was analysing the kid, or the tape recorder, where does the line get drawn, it was an extremely general statement, and if nobody else can see or here the ghosts then how the hell did he get a tape recording of the voice of the guy who didn't want to die, it was a great emotional and shock device but a major implausability in actual screenwriting. The second time I saw this at the movies a few of the holes surfaced to my vision, the third, on video they were as clear as daylight, and the fourth has certified me.And Cole spent half an hour talking to absolutely nobody while his mother was a dozen feet away in another room, why exactly would she say 'you've got 5 minutes' to Cole, we were meant to assume at the time that she was talking to Bruce but when the ending comes it just falsifies that part. And when Bruce Willis threw that rock at the jewelry store window, everybody stared, in ghost they had fun with that sort of thing but with the conjured up spirit world in this it once again is a major glitch for it. How could they have seen something that was not there.I actually think the director thought the movie was too dull at final cut and shot the new ending for interests sake, so it is either bad writing or bad editing.Production Values 2/2, Acting 2/2, Screenplay 0.5/2, Quality and Meaning 0.5/2, Originality, 1.5/2

The Matrix," Well worth seeing but not original.
","The story of this thing is more a rip off of Virtuosity, Star Wars, Hideaway and every other 'chosen one' flick. The dialogue is pretty corny as well, 'he is the one', the acting is fine for what the actors are given, Morpheas is laughable with all his oooh aaah knowledge and the way he comes up with extremely complicated answers to simple questions, how complicated is the matrix concept, all of humanity is plugged in to a giant computer that pulls a digital world over our eyes to use us as batteries, let me know when it gets complicated.Reeves does not do a bad job at all, he suits the role and he is never unbelievable in the digital world he has to act against, and nobody save Schwarzeneggar can wear sunnies and leather like he does. At the theatre this would have been one of the greatest experiences, I saw alot of movies at the theatre in 99 but this was not one of them unfortunately. Overall this really is not a bad movie for entertainment, it is very definitely a teen flick formula but it can work for other people as well. The effects dont really seem to dominate the movie, there is only 5 or 6 points where they are used to the max, and there is only 3 or 4 where that multicamera trick is used, the effects basically just help you to believe that there are two worlds.Getting plugged into a computer that makes you believe it is reality and having to rescue someone inside that and the possibility that being killed in the computer can kill you in reality are all Virtuosity, as for a messiah taking a young and unsuspecting boy off to train for the time when he must save the galaxy from a dominating empire I dont think I need to say where that formula has come before. You really aren't quite so analytical when your watching it.In short, the effects, the characters and acting and the story are all pretty good, and this a movie to note, it is not run of the mill, its also watchable more than once. Overall its worth seeing at least once so do yourself a favour.",Null,0,0,10 April 2001
Heat," All style no credibility.
","Everyone in this movie is Ultra-cool and Ultra Ultra-professional. Pacino as usual yells his way through the movie, Deniro as usual is an Ultra Ultra Cool Cop-killer just seeking a peaceful life in Big-time Crime and his buddies are semi ultra cool cop-killers just seeking a normal life in big-time crime and the chicks are the unfaithful mob who who keep our heroes at their most masculine.I could never get comfortable with Voights hair do, Deniros is extremely predictable, Pacino is the macho ultra-professional and over-divoted cop, Portmans does not have much luck with mortality or a punctual father (it was a delight to see her 30 seconds of celluloid anyway though), if they want to get into parental psychology issue they have to be a little less over-dramatic and a little more explanatory. Wane Grow and the kitchen boss we ofcourse hate and relish doing so. A grown man actually cries because he has to take out the trash and basically handle the gritty work in a kitchen, (people a lot younger and alot older have to put up with that crap for years) his wife ofcourse is the 2D figure that announces having pride in him.Pacino watches his own friends and comrades even and even colleagues he did not know get shot down, because of and BY Deniro but still manages to hold (SPOILERS RIGHT HERE NOW) his hand in dying moments, in some sign of professional courtisy. A beautiful but tragically lonely chick finds out that she is dating a murderer and criminal but for the sake of his 'love' chooses to aid his escape and even live out her days with him, another example of cheap emotion. My summary is all that need be said. If you want to see a style and then some comic book in play with some thrills and sweat revenge on the side then her you are but otherwise look elseware.6.5/10",Null,0,1,19 February 2002
Gladiator," No problems here, just dont ask for Saving Private Ryan
","This is a true epic, it's likenesses to Braveheart are forgivable since there are even more quite obvious avoidances to likening it to Braveheart, it's as though the movie skates the path in a field of nails. Russel's role is not as demanding as the one he should have won for, 99's the Insider but there is nothing lacking in his or anyone else's performance. What exactly do you look to rate a film by, Production values, Originality, Acting, Dramatic Quality, Meaning, it scores a 10 in all but all of these. The special effects are not to be faulted, grandeuresce is the word, seemless shots like the depiction of Oliver Reed who passed away during production, you cant pick what is real or what is not. The tigers can only be seen as real, I knew after seeing and reading a review that they were digital. The directing is seemless and the battle scene cinematography seems presented as part of the depiction, too many over-army shots would have you thinking 'Braveheart.' It is the most deservant for Best Picture, and with exactly the same noms that Ben-Hur was met with I cant see whay it should'nt win most of the others. As already stated, this is desrvant of the title epic, see it.9.5/10",Null,0,0,20 February 2001
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A superb sum up of the series, No. 1 in gross and quality.
","Easily the best of the series, this one could also more than easily be the original. The makers very obviously wanted to close the series with this one so they fixed it up with some finale aspects. What a brilliant idea for an opening sequence. Indy is a boy scout in 1910s and he comes across a dig site, a band of hired thieves has unearthed a cross made of gold and jewels affiliated with it's owner corinado. Firm in his belief that the artifact belongs in a museum he manages to nick the thing and races off under pursuit from the men and the chase moves onto a circus train. He uses a whip for the first time, gets the scar that remained, meets the man you will see an obvious resemblance to in Adult-Indy and more importantly as a losers prize from that very man he gets the hat that despite the nature of his endeavours he manages to hold on to presumably for the rest of his days, that particular little paradox is also commically referenced in the movie as it blows back up to him over the edge of a precipise. There is more history neatly and comically woven in aswell.In his search for the holy grail he once again combats the Nazis, joining him for some of the movie is a brotherhood sworn to the protection of the grails resting place, an idea ripped off by the inferior but still cool 99 flick 'The Mummy', who ever heard of descendants of any rulers bodyguards anyway. Theres some great punch ups chases and inventive history all through it eg, in his dealings with the Nazi's he at one point comes face to face with none other than the big cheese himself.Anyone who has not seen this movie is missing out on heaps, make it a next seen, it deserves no less than a 9. I still hope they do make a 4th edition, it would be nice to see Indy back in the charts, and to give the new generation a chance to see Indy at the theatre.",Null,0,0,7 May 2001
Back to the Future," The pinacle of Time Travel movies.
","This is one of the best flicks from the 80's, it is basically just family mind candy but it's charm is relentless and there is not another movie you can have more fun with, it's sequels come the closest.So what would happen if you could travel back in time and meet your parents, anyone seen time cop, they break the rule that they so strongly state, a single alteration in the time would probably cause a time and space melt down, though all scientific theory is completely hypathetical in this matter assumptions can be made. As for causing your parents not to meet at exactly the right time you would not exist regardless of wether they got together or not. But stuff like that if they got serious in the movie would make this from the No. 1 time travel movie to on a par with every other one.
No one has ever come up with a better time machine, that delorian with the gullwing doors is one I'd like to know even though the company went bust. The action, setting and especially the acting in these movies had to be perfect or they would have been a B grade mess, and since they were all perfect no more needs to be said.Spielberg really proved his nouse backing Zemekis' idea with this one, and Zemekis proved great directing skills which he was awarded for a decade later. It's a shame neither are very present today despite Zemekis' latest blockbuster What Lies Beneath, another pinacle-of-the-genre. Back To The Future deserves no less than a 10.",Null,0,1,17 May 2001
