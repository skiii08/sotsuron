The Blair Witch Project," difference between speical and great
","I think there is a difference between something being different and speical to something being great to watch. This movie is speical and different. Many things attempted in this film which was really unique and we should give credit to that. However, this does not mean that this movie is great to watch. It is hip to wear coke cans as your outfit, but it does not mean you will feel comfortable or necessary beautiful. So for being inventive, 7/10, for the plot and the film itself, 6/10.",Null,0,1,25 August 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Why I think this is a good movie...
","below are the reasons why I think this is a great movie...1) The movie is cleverly filmed. For example, a scene when the mother was packing her house, the camera moved a cm across per minute. And end product is a camera moving slowing from right to left while the character is in fast motion.2) Music did what it was meant to do, to push the viewers into a state of insanity and depression3) There are some really good scenes. The conversation Harry had with his mom when he visited her and found out she was taking those pills was very well done. 4) The acting was also very good. If not for the two young actor/actress, Ellen did an excellent job and yes, she should have won an award at the oscars.5) The film itself is about anti-drugs, but it is not just about that. It is about attachments to our own beliefs, sorrow and possessions.",9,1,2,11 May 2002
Requiem for a Dream," Not just a anti-drug message
","This movie is for those that likes to think after watching a movie or for those that likes to 'study' how the movie is filmed and edited.Many of the reviewers here mentioned that this movie is about anti-drugs. I agree. But I don't think that it is only about that. This movie is about addiction. Addiction to drugs. That is the common one. But there are also alot of addictions in the movie that is harder to find. Addictions to lifestyles, beliefs, society's pressure, happiness, depression, love, money....This movie is about how a person lacking control in ones own thought process. How one is the victim of circumstances. This movie is sad is not because the movie keep showing you people in depression and addiction to drugs, this movie is sad because it is pointing out a simple fact of life. We all think we have full control of our lives even when we don't. We are all victims in whatever degree in addictions to life, no matter if it is beliefs or pride or faith.",9,0,1,26 March 2002
The Ring," Don't even try to work it out...
","SpoilerI didn't want to see this movie in the cinema. But a friend insisted and I went. The first few minutes into the movie and I see how the movie was carried out, I knew that I will be in for a long boring sleep session. When the girls heard the phone rang and they were spooked to get it and later found out it was her parent, I was about to leave the cinema. The rest of the movie was just a thriller investigation of what 'the ring' is.
I have never feel so strong negatively in my opinions towards a movie before, but this is the first one. (Not even towards Eight Legged Freaks) I thought it was really a waste of my time and degrading my intelligence. The only good part of the movie was a few seconds near the end...but of course, the damage was done...it is infact a serious joke this movie is 7.9  HIGHER than The Birds and Rope by Hitchcock. Now that is very scary.",6,0,0,14 November 2002
Chinatown," mmm...
","Maybe it is because I am not in a 'particular' state of mind when I saw this film, or if it is because I shouldn't watch this film straight after 'the deer hunter', I didn't really click with this film. I don't really understand why Chinatown as a title is appropriate. Is the plot that exciting, isn't it just a typical crime story with a slight twist in the end? Jack's performance was good, but I am being very nice here since I would say his performance in 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest' out shadowed this many folds. I don't know, maybe it is my own fault, maybe you should never watch anything after the deer hunter.",Null,3,5,26 June 2002
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Always look on the bright side of life...
","I am not a particular great Pythan's fan since I have not seen any of their movies before. Some of the jokes are alittle out dated in today's standard. However, the ending is a classic. I was surprised how beautifully they managed to end this movie...and of course, always look on the bright side of life...",Null,0,2,21 July 2002
Fight Club, ,"This film is really great. Why is this film great? Well, not many films actually can play with your mind, and this one actually did just that.Just don't blink in the last few seconds of the film and you will see what maybe half a second picture of a penis. So what is so special about this penis? Well, it is a good wake up call to you and your buddies watching this film how much is actually covered over our eyes. And oh yeah, there are some good actors in it as well, but I forgot their names....not important. You just learn not to control everything all the time, just let go....

We Were Soldiers," Good, but its been done to death
","This movie is good. It is based on a true event. However, I really don't understand why they would want to produce another war movie. When I walked in and see this movie, I felt like watching a mixture of Saving Private Ryan, Thin Red Line, Black Hawke Down all at the same time. I guess they can't do anything about that...it is about war, so it must be about killing and dying. This movie, (individually) is good. The only thing that is letting me down is that this 'type' of movie had been done; once too many times. If they wanted to make another war movie, why not make it alittle different; in terms of perspective, or ways of filming or character development. The only war movie I mentioned above is any worth watching again is Thin Red Line. At least that movie attempts to do something different.",5,0,0,27 April 2002
Blade II," getting tiresome
","Possible Spoilers.It is hard for me to say if this is a good film or a bad film. It depends entirely on the viewer. But I personally am getting alittle tired of watching these type of films. They are the same again and again and again and again. Speical effects in this film is good but is no way outstanding. Computer generating sequences are well, just that. Even the Matrix 2 trailer looked better. But I guess you can't expect a classic everytime you walk in the cinema, so for what it is worth, it is just good entertainment.",5,1,3,15 July 2002
Taxi Driver," truely a great film...
","To be really honest, when I first saw this film, I didn't know what to think of it. There is something there, but just can't put my finger into what it actually is. When I watch it a second time, that is, straight after watching it the first time, I start to understand what and why the film is so great. It is kinda hard to explain it in a few words, but the movies done back in the 70s is alot different from the ones done nowadays. There is depth in this film which is not found in many modern films. For example, nowadays, if you want to film a overhead shot like in the last scene, we can simply use computer technology. But what they did was actually punch a big hole in the ceiling to put the camera! The camera work is done very nicely but you may miss out its brilliance if you do not know what to look for. For example, in the beginning when DeNiro was in the Taxi Company, the camera scan him watching on the right and it doesn't follow him but rather do a circle around the place and catches back with him when he leaves the door.
I must admit that this film will not be fully understood if you do not know the backgrounds. So I strongly suggest if you are fortunate enough to have a DVD of this film, watch the 'makings of', I am sure you will learn alot more.What truely stands out of course is Bobby. I really admire his dedication to his job. He doesn't just go in and act, he actually studies his role and spends alot of time praticing. He even got a taxi licence! How about that.The central ideology in this film is the theme of loniness. And even though the film is very bleak, the surprising result of it is a moral one. If many people can relate to this film, it means that you are not alone in being alone! So the great depression each of us faces each day is nothing speical, it is part of the human conditions.",9,0,0,19 June 2002
Forrest Gump," Intelligence
","One thing I wanted to get straight, the movie Forrest Gump is an intelligent film. Many of you will disagree, but that is because you are not seeing this film in the light of its full potential. I can name tons of scenes which trigger in one way or another a philosophical ideology. And I mean TONS!The oh so famous feather scene...The scene when Forrest is at Jenny's grave...The scene when Forrest just finished runningEven his name Forrest has a meaning.The movie itself holds the meaning that the measurment of success is not by intelligence and fame, it is by a simple notion of happiness. Forrest could be a million-air, but he is happy to mow the lawn for free.There are many people I talk to don't understand this film. The reason is because they can't relate to it.",9,1,4,10 May 2002
Fargo," I must have missed something...
","Spoilers.I must have missed the plot, I really can't see why this film is so good. The director did a few good films, so I have nothing against Coen. The genre of this film supposed to be a drama/thriller/dark comedy. But I personally didn't find the comedy that funny and the plot is alittle too common. I may have missed the point, I don't know.",Null,0,2,23 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Good but not excellent
","This movie is good. The special effects are outstanding. However, I felt that most people love this movie is because it is Lord of the Rings. That is, any clothes made by Country Road is bound to be expensive, any movies based on Lord of the Rings is bound to be good.The plot is too straightforward. In fact, I don't know if there is much of a plot at all. Some scenes are not very logical...I get the feeling that it is put there not because it will help the movie but because the director wanted to show off the special effects.So go and see this film if you love eye candy movies. But just make sure you switch off your brain and don't think too much about it afterwards or else you will find alot of problems with the movie.",1,4,10,28 March 2002
The Village," Its really scary, it is so bad, it is extremely scary...
","I don't know what is wrong all the reviewers. I also do not know what is wrong with Mr. Night. It seemed that he just gone from great with his Sixth Sense to bad to worst. Writing your own scripts and directing it is an excellent move, however, it does not mean it will always work out. In the later cases of Night's movies, it appeared that he rushed his scripts and did not take any care at all on examining his plot or characters. When you have characters explaining things near the end of the film to the audience and when the dialogs are said purely to explain something to us, we know there is something wrong. And when the plot had to be twisted so much in order to fit everything in and rendered it so twisted it became disfigured and disjointed, it is another bad sign.Mr. Night used to be compared with Mr. Hitchcock, I would dare say this comparison is getting a little too absurd. Intelligent scripts are not easy to come by and intelligent scripts with symbolic meanings are even harder to come by. If one is to argue the fact that this movie is also about the supression of a community through the usage of fear etc...I would have to conclude that you had watched very little old films of the great eras of Hithcocks and other great directors.",4,1,2,10 January 2005
The Shining," In some aspects, this film is a classic
","O.k., this is one of those films where I can't point my finger at why it is so good. Don't try to find logic or common sense in this film, sometimes things just happened without an explanation. Nor even try to find a plot, there ain't much of one. The thing that stands out of this film is the acting and the way it is presented. There were a few really well done scenes in the film and is used/sproofed by many other films. Sometimes the 'scary' music gets used once too many times and it does get alittle rediculous. The way the atmosphere and emotions created is excellent. The acting by Jack is outstanding, but I guess it is not surprising since he did star in 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest'.",Null,0,0,6 June 2002
American Beauty," done before...
","I don't really like to compare films. But I do feel that American Beauty is really a remake of the film Ordinary People directed by Reford. The only difference really would be that AB attempts to be a comedy also. But seriously, if you like this movie because of its acting/dramatic qualities, please watch Ordinary People.",6,0,0,17 September 2002
The Pianist," one too many
","spoilers. I do want to like this film. I have high hopes when I enter in the cinema after hearing so many good things about the film. But I can't help myself from thinking that this idea had been done once too many times. There are just too many films made about world war 2 and the Nazis.
I personally did not feel that the concept of the main character being a 'pianist' is very necessary to the plot structure, (they don't have a very close link), and also I felt that Brody did a good job, but I think Jack was better in schmidt. I did not really get into the film's emotional side, there were many graphic scenes, people are shot at close range, and people jumping out from buildings. As usual, we will see that the Germans are evil enemies and one of them will be nice just to prove the point that not all are bad; a plot devise also used too many times. Good film, if this is made few years ago, maybe it is better. I perfer Life is Beautiful more than this film.",Null,0,1,20 April 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," I don't understand...
","I really do not understand why so many find this movie to be so good. Is it because of the love scenes or is it the fighting scenes? I am from Hong Kong, and I had seen many HK films and I can tell you, the fighting scenes here are not groundbreaking. In fact, it is alittle silly. The only reason why this film got so many awards is because this is the first film that used HK filming techniques in Hollywood; the excess useage of wiring, swords etc...In terms of the love story, I don't know, there are many other films have a better love story...even Titanic can do better. Also, after watching the film, I did feel somewhat 'cheated' because Chow Yun Fat is always on the front cover, but his apperances in the film is not even close to a suporting role. #38 on the list? I don't think so. Watch more HK films and decide for yourself.",Null,0,1,29 May 2002
A Clockwork Orange," amazing...
","I remember I was somewhat younger then. A more mature friend told me that there was a great film on one of the arthouse cinema and I had no clue what the hell it was. I saw it. I thought it was strange and there was 'something' there but that was what I left it to be: weird.
Fast forward five years later, many things had changed. I took an interest in films and started watching many great films and I stummbled upon a director named Kubrick. I saw many of his other films by then and I was curious what I would think now about Clockwork Orange five years later from my first viewing.And I was glad that I watched it again because so many things had changed for me the second time round. Apart from all the directing, camera works etc..., what I loved most are the comments on certain issues. Most people had already commented that the film critizises on social choice and individual freedom, however, I think there is another side of the coin which some of us had missed; which makes this movie even more of a masterpiece. As I see it, Alex (or many of us for that matter), is a victim that holds little freedom. But not just from social limitations but also from nature. From the beginning I could see this 'animalistic' conditioning and the movie progresses to social conditionings and later towards the end back to nature conditionings. It is just like the 9th symthony.  EVEN IF SOCIETY SOMEHOW MANAGES TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM, WE STILL NEED PERMISSION FROM NATURE",7,0,0,6 May 2003
The Red Violin," Must be...
","Must be out my head not to write this earlier..but this had been my top 1 movie for a long time now. There isn't much to say because I wouldn't know where to start. The score in this film, wow, it still gives me goose pimples. 9/10",10,1,1,4 July 2002
The Red Violin," Second review...
","A previous interesting comment triggered me to write this and I hope that my humble opinions will help put more light in the interpretations of this movie. I apologize if I may offend anyone, I just feel that I need to give this movie a fair trial.This movie is unique in the fact that it really don't have a main character. Well, it does, but it involves an inanimate object; the red violin. And when you know, if a movie is character based, there will have to be 'attachments (added values/importance)' to this main character, similar to many other movies like The Godfathers 2 etc.but in this case, it is a violin. This movie is also unique in the fact that it has two 'central point' that tells the story; the auction and the tarot cards. In most cases there is only one or at all; like the bus stop in Forrest Gump.I agree in a certain degree that this movie is about antique collecting. But I will go as far as it is present in the movie but it is not by any means to be the sole purpose of the movie. (Like requiem for a dream is about only drug uses or pulp fiction is only about killing people) I agree, in the light of music's meaning, putting too much emphasis on a musical instrument is wrong. But in the light of a main character in a story, it is an inevitable step. But I would also suggest in my humble opinion, putting music on the emphasis on the musical instrument OR the musician is just as bad. To say music is the musician is like worshipping Mozart of his status and values and not his music. Music IS NOT the musician. One hand can't make a sound. No matter how good you are, you can't play the Hungarian Rhapsody on a out of tune piano. Music lives in the relationship between the two parties and it should not exist even in the realms of space nor time. It is the interpretation/understanding that is triggered within a subjective perceiver. Hence, it can never be truly spoken of nor discussed. So if this is the case, movies that promote musicians like `Mr. Holland's Opus' or `Amadeus' will all fall within this error. But of course, there are certain limitations to a movie and all movies have to base on a character whether if it is Forrest Gump or The Red Violin.This movie talks alittle about auctions of a number of antiques. But is it just about collecting them? What about the monks? Do you think they want the violin because they want to collect violins for their monetary values? If so, why get the same one that happens to be related to them? There must be more than just antique collecting.Is this just an object of history and not history itself. But wouldn't we not say that history is composed of objects/events (that is related to objects in the space-time)? It is the summation of these important events/objects that give history its meaning. The sum that makes up the whole; one can't talk about the whole without its sum. It is like trying to picture someone you love in the past. It is hard to picture that person out of context. You need to picture that person in context of something you have done/ shared the same event together.Did Sammuel steal the violin because he wants to rebel against capitalistic values? Do you think he did all that inorder to spike the society? (If you want this issue addressed, red violin may not be the best movie to go, try Fight Club).  Did you think that when the 17th Century violin maker used blood to paint an instrument from his beloved wife, he was thinking consciously, `ahh, this will be later of great value to both antique lovers and musicians and I will be rich, rich I say, RICH! Or do you think that he was just feeling pain and anger and love and hatred and emotions and things which logic and rationality that can't explain LIKE what music does to people. Don't analyze music; you can't. Once you start to analyze music, it no longer music but notes on a page.So what is this movie about? It is about a musical instrument, its history, and the relationship of it with the musicians throughout the course of its life. It survives longer than men, and so it may seem alittle ridiculous. But having in mind that this movie is not an account of facts but of storytelling. It also symbolses that comparing to love/music/beauty, men is minute.It does not matter how virtuous the little girl is that the father hands down the violin to, it does not matter. Nor do I think that the pleasure one finds in music or the meaning/emotions one find in music is not equal to what grade of piano you have hanging on your wall. To be able to understand the true meaning of opera does not entail you to be a fat lady. If one thinks about music parallel to skills or notation on a page, music is no more than an illusion.Is it just about music, no. But it is related to music as it is suggested in the relationship it has with all of its owners. The love and the meaning triggered by this violin is beyond words.  The symbol played by this inanimate object is a great one. It resemble freedom, love, greed, ownership, beauty and music; all entities in men. It is a pure neutral entity that will transform to whatever to the musician's subjective desired.I hope whoever is reading this will see both sides of the coin.",10,1,1,5 July 2002
Pulp Fiction," second time lucky...
","I saw this film the first time in a birthday party and I didn't understand it...well, I watched it again today and I finally can see why this film is so good. It is very intelligent/clever in terms of script layouts. Performances from the main actors are also very well done. And when you combine these two elements together you get a brillant film. The main contributing factor that shift this film from being just good to greatness is really Tarantino. It can get up to the level of memento, fight club and requiem for a dream. However, still a micro litre behind from  classics like taxi driver, godfather and citizen kane. I give it 8/10",Null,0,1,1 July 2002
Titanic," Rather strange...
","O.K., let me get something straight, I do not regard Titanic to be a masterpiece. However, considering that this movie rates 7.0 here in imdb and Lord of the Rings is third in imdb (last time I checked), there is something really wrong. Titanic is not as bad as many of the reviewers are trying to make it. The soundtrack is well done, the acting is good. At that particular time, the movie effects are also pretty good. The movie do appeal to the audience's emotions, mostly duing the second half of the movie. I do feel for the characters in the movie even if they are not that believable. Overall, I think this movie deserves 7.5/10. And besides, I think at least this movie is in the same level as LOTR, which is also worth a 7.1/10",Null,1,2,1 August 2002
Mystic River," script's expositional problems
","This movie is good, but it could have been better. Instead of 'showing' the problem, it was explain verbally to us. This produced an effect of detachment from the audience and the characters. Another issue I had was the dialogues sometimes were 'twisted' inorder to give expositions. What this means is, in their natural character self, they may not talk about something, but because it must be explained to the audience, the character was forced to 'explain' something which may seem out of context in the conversation.",Null,0,0,28 November 2003

","This is the first time I went in to see a film and I felt that I am too old for it. Not even when I saw Toy Story 2. Happy Potter I guess is not a bad movie, but I don't know why they somehow can manage to limit their target audience. I would prefer the first Harry Potter, at least it was all fresh and it is not as drained out. The problem this movie has is similar to many other sequals like Austin Powers, james bond, rocky... The sequal is the same as the first. However, those comedy movies like 'powers'  do not try to take itself seriously, this one does and that is what makes it unbearable.",6,0,0,28 November 2002

","I don't know...but I guess I am sorry for not agreeing with the general opinions about this film. I like it. It is a good film, but I don't seem to be able to see why it is so great. The story don't seem to give many 'arguments' as to why the black man was innocent. After the trial, I still don't know if the man is guilty or innocent. The movie is supposed to be about a discrimination trial. However, it is alittle short for the purpose it serves for the movie. However, the first half is not about that. It is pretty much a perspective from the children...it sort of made it a children's film. However, during the second half, the attention was shifted. I guess one can't make a movie entirely on a trial. But because of this spread of storyline, they couldn't touch deep enough of both of the things they wanted to say. There are also few scenes which I thought was not logical. It is a good movie. But I don't think it is a great movie.",7,3,8,26 May 2002

So many good words had been spoken about this movie, I just got to see it, even if it is 27 years later.If there are anyone out there, who is like me (very unlikely), still wondering if they should be bothered with this old film, let me say this;This film maybe old...but it really is worth watching. It is kind of hard for me to explain what is so good about this film. Some other people probably can do a better job. But there is a certain feeling; an appeal to an emotion. There is a very deep meaning to this film, even though it is hard to describe it in words. The ending of this movie is beyond words. They could not give this film a better ending. There are a few scenes which are very well done, not just from Jack, but from many of the supporting actors.

It tries so hard to be different and deep. And I guess what is its strength is also its weakness. The weakness is that it tries too hard. But you got to give them credit for trying. The ending of the movie reminds me too much of the bad version of the matrix.

Signs," Good or Bad
","SPOILERSThis movie tend to have extreme reviews...either it is excellent or it is just an average work. This is an average work because it is only about alien invasions and also there are a few 'illogical' holes in the plot. Those that thinks this film is great is probably because they see it more of an exercise to the meaning of faith and humanity. The reasons why I think this movie is excellent. Yes, if this movie is only about an alien invasion, this movie would be below average, but I do not think M. Night is trying to do only that.It is not by chance that the movie is named 'Signs'. It is not by chance that there are certain 'strange' signs incorporated in the movie. It is not by chance that there are inept dialogs and humour in the film. It is not by chance that Bo mentioned so specifically about 'dreams' three times (out of context in a normal conversation). It is not by chance that this movie has crop circles in it. YOu see, M. Night is playing with the viewers. Not only giving the characters in the movie 'signs' to play with their faith, he also did the same to us viewers. However, not everyone will see these signs and hence, miss out on a big portion of what the movie is about.",8,0,1,21 August 2002
Signs," Night makes this worth watching...
","Big Spoilers. Do not read if you haven't seen this movie.If this film was done by another director, we may not get the same result. Shyamalan appears to have alot of skils in terms of making these types of movies...building up tensions and story line. He uses 'silence' very well and certain scenes are very well done. (Like in a scene when every family members were standing there listening to the dog barking outside and suddenly there was yelping and silence. Replacing it is the sound of the clock ticking.) However, I must say that he is not very good (or is still in the process of perfecting the skill) in bringing across messages...He attempt to 'say' something deep in unbreakable and again in this film. 
The directing in this film alone is worth watching...plus some really well thought out dialogs and a good storyline (although the ending is alittle weak). These type of stories can only have two possible endings. Either there are aliens or it is all a hoax. If one chooses the alien path, one may fall into the problem of giving the story a shallow ending. The water concept was alittle silly (bringing the movie down to the line of Mars Attack). A movie which manages to overcome this story progression problem with flying colors is Contact.",8,0,1,15 August 2002
Heat," director vs script vs actors
","First there was Heat. Two of the best actors, Al and Robert in a movie that has a very normal (even close to boring) storyline. The story had been done to death and no great acting can save it. To make things worst, there are no (or not many) great camera work inorder to make it interesting to watch. Second came 'Sleepers'. We had one of the biggest all star casts but the storyline was too weak to allow the actors to do anything. The directing in this is alittle better but it is no GoodFellas. So my conclusion is that the most important thing is the script, then comes the directing and lastly the acting. Of course, the salaries for these guys are the opposite. Actors, Directors and script writers.",Null,0,0,23 September 2002
Goodfellas," great director at work...
","Possible Spoilers.It appears that Scorsese loves to film gangster movies, not only that, he loves to base his movies on character studies.This movie without Scorsese would had been great. Since we have great acting from Ray and Joe, (Joe was especially good but he did the exact same thing in Casino). Bobby in this film was up to his normal standard but it was obvious he didn't want to steal the show.However, the main key to the success of this movie is about the method that the story is presented. The way Scorsese told this story was speical. It can even be compared to the great camera works from Citizen Kane. There are so many different things to look out for in the movie, you have to see it twice or more. The first time you will just stick to the plot. The second time you have to look for all the camera angles! I am no movie critic, but there was that scene when Ray and Robert talking in coffe shop. The scene was filmed so that the foreground main character stays the same while the background (outside of window) gradually gets larger. And later near the end of the movie, Ray attempts to pull a 'Woody' stunt by talking straight to the camera. This movie really can't be watched as if it is a normal film like spiderman or star wars...it must be watched in the light of other greats like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull.",Null,0,0,6 August 2002
