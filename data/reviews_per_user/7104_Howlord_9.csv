Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Two Movies: The Lightest and the Darkest Star Wars Episode
","SPOILER ALERT!!!!!The Phantom Menace can be seen as two very different episodes in Star Wars. What is important to remember that as an episode, The Phantom Menace was never meant to stand alone.  If you want to see a cute kids movie, don't read the rest of my review, if you want to see the darkest chapter in the soon to be Star Wars Sextet keep reading.The Phantom Menace is quite simply the story of how Senator Palpatine/Darth Sidious/The Emperor destroys the Republic through careful con games.  As Darth Sidious, Palpatine causes the trade federation to attack Naboo, the planet he represents in the senate.  This attack puts his planet in a position of sympathy in the senate.  Palpatine, who has the complete trust of his queen, Amidala, manipulates her into calling for a vote of no confidence against the weak-willed and beaurocratically controlled Chancellor Valorum.  Filled with sympathy for a planet which has fallen into a status of Nazi-Like occupation, the senate not only removes Valorum, but elects Palpatine as the new chancellor.  Were this not enough, Palpatine throws the Jedi off his trail by using his colorful decoy Darth Maul.  The Jedi are so overwhelmed in finding out Maul's secrets, that they don;t even notice that the REAL Dark Lord of the Sith is in the same room.  It was chilling to see Palpatine tell Anakin that 'I will be watching your career with great interest.'  After watching Return of the Jedi, I felt that the Emperor was an incredibly evil character, the Phantom Menace made Palpatine seem as evil as his apprentice Vader seemed in the original movie.  The apparent nobility of Palpatine's motives to all in the movie made him that much more menacing.There are also many elements of tragedy in the movie, the foremost being the character of Qui-Gon Jinn.  Jinn, who was a little bit of a Jedi rebel wanted to prove that a Jedi could serve the greater good without adhering to the strict codes of the Jedi council.  It is the ultimate in tragedy that Jinn's final request is for Obi-Wan to train the boy who would become a great killer of Jedi.  The very innocence of Anakin in the film makes the tragedy even more apparent.  The little boy who seems to be so incredibly generous will become one of the greatest evils in the galaxy.  Amidala has allowed the republic and the future father of her children to fall into darkness, and she's too naive to recognize any of it.If you didn't like the movie, and read these comments, give it a second chance.  The movie is wonderful if viewed in its darkness as well as its light.",7,0,0,24 May 1999
Training Day," I was expecting much more
","I recently rented the DVD of this film after Denzel's Oscar win and hearing much positive buzz and when I finally sat down to watch it, I found myself at first enthralled, and later horribly dissappointed.Training Day started off as a promising look at what sort of justice is necessary for a narcotics cop to be effective with Ethan Hawke serving as a young and idealistic cop and Denzel Washington as a jaded cop who seems willing to perform questionable acts in the pursuit of justice.  And then we just get a straight up black vs. white (racially and idealogically) battle of good cop against hopelessly corrupt cop who has to be taken down.  I was expecting to have my views of justice challenged only to have them confirmed in an annoyingly simple manner.  Sure, the film was skillfully crafted.  The performances were great (though I still think Tom Wilkinson was robbed considering his great performance in 'In the Bedroom' and the fact that Denzel seems to be having a ball hamming it up in this part having done MUCH better work in earlier films), the direction energetic and the overall production was very solid and effectively gritty.  I just can't get over how the film degenerated into standard clich√©s.7 out of 10",7,1,11,23 April 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Very Good, but far from Great
","I saw Shakespeare in Love last night and I can't hide the fact that I very much enjoyed the movie.  The humor poking at Hollywood and the subtle foreshadowing to 'Twelth Night' were extremely well done.  I think the only problem with the film was that at times, it was just too dark.  When Shakespeare thought that he was responsible for the death of Christopher Marlowe, the movie seemed to lose its lightness, which is the film's greatest strength.  While it served its concept very well and it was well acted by all, especially Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, the movie just forgot too often that it was a clever, occasionally brilliant comedy.  I can't believe that it won best original screenplay at the Golden Globes over 'Truman Show.' I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.",6,2,4,6 February 1999
Apocalypse Now," Ebert was Right!!!
","As a Cinema Studies major, I'm forced to constantly rely on video tapes and DVDs to study movies I have to write about in more detail.  There are HUGE conveniences to these media: the ability to move forward and backwards within the film with ease, the low cost, the lack of a need to get myself a large screen and a projectionist, etc.  I've always been a big lover of watching movies on the big screen for the enhanced size of the image, thus making it easier to catch small nuances in shot composition, and because of the ever increasing awe of modern sound systems.  I don't think films like 'Black Hawk Down' would work without massive, multidirectional audio.  Well, Apocalypse Now Redux proved something further to me...  film projection makes everything just look better.  When I caught the Redux at an Oberlin Film Series screening, I was absolutely FLOORED by the depth and variety of color and light at work in this film.  I'll admit to not particularly liking some of the added scenes. The dialogue in the plantation sequence was VERY heavy-handed and not in the poetic manner of much of the dialogue in other parts of the film.  But the images... I was drawn into the film on the pure power of seeing film as a medium in its most powerful form.  From the opening explosions to the haunting sound of the Doors, to the scene of Martin Sheen rising from the mud, the film was as textured and palpable as a Van Gogh painting.  I've never once had any kind of illegal substance, let alone hallucinogens in my life, but I felt out of body watching this movie.  I was awestruck at the sheer power of a film's imagery.  Watching this film, I fell in love with movies again.  Thank you, Mr. Coppola.

Spider-Man," Thwip!
","Being a semi-retired comic fan, I highly anticipated this movie.  When it was first announced I was skeptical, but as I heard more I became excited. Sam 'Evil Dead' Raimi was the perfect director for the material.  Tobey Maguire seemed to be the perfect Parker and Willem Dafoe was near the top of my list for favorite candidates for the Green Goblin.  I became quite excited for it, but not TOO excited.
Did the movie meet me expectations?  Yes.  It was very good, but not fantastic.  The movie was very true to the comic with a few exceptions (no web shooters, skipping Gwen Stacey).  The acting was quite strong from everyone involved, especially James Franco who manages to make Harry an incredibly likable guy without much screen time.  The characters FELT like they did in the comic which was very important.  The effects were completely 'buyable' despite some complaints I've heard about them around the web. Danny Elfman's score, while not as good as his previous comic book efforts on 'Batman' was strong support, if not memorable.  The final fight sequence was also a little disappointingly a 'I beat you until you look beaten, you beat me until I look beaten' affair.  Given the level of style and the fact that these characters can soar through the air and all the agility at Spidey's disposal, this was a bit anticlimactic.One problem I had with the movie was the some of the dialogue, was REALLY awful.  Some of Mary Jane and Peter's lines to each other felt like pre-written gushy letters rather than lines that people are speaking at the spur of the moment.  Spidey didn't make as many witty comments as he did in the book either.  The highlight of the writing definitely has to be the way that Harry Osborn was written.  In some ways he was the most likable character in the movie, and if the movie series goes the same way as the comics do with his character, well I won't reveal what might happen for those who didn't read the comic in the early 1990s.  All in all a fun effort and a great success by Raimi and all involved.8/10",8,0,0,3 May 2002
Good Will Hunting," An Important Movie For Me Personally
","My opinion of this movie will never be objective, and I suppose that's a fact I'll simply have to deal with when addressing its detractors.  The fact is, for me, this movie came along at a time when I really needed a movie to help me center myself.  I was struggling in school and fighting depression when this movie came out, and, after I saw this film, I felt like I would be able to cope with my life more.  The fact is, the movie simply spoke to where I was in my life.  I was letting people down, struggling and failing to meet the expectations of others and expecting constant failure, setting my personal goals in life lower than they should have been, letting my cynicism and self-hatred get in the way of pursuing my goals. 
I just loved everything about this movie from the clever dialogue to the interesting compilation soundtrack between Elliot Smith and Danny Elfman. The acting was top notch feeling real and unstaged, thanks in no small part to the fact that Affleck and Damon didn't hold back with the dialogue choosing a real conversational manner over moviespeak.  Though I am nowhere as smart as Will, I can appreciate his struggle with his own feelings of self-doubt and Matt Damon managed to get those feelings across without overplaying his hand.  I suppose more than anything else, this movie convinced me to try again, and for that I will always be grateful.  It helped me get where I got today through its hopeful, yet true message.10/10",10,1,4,23 April 2002
Mission: Impossible," A Refreshingly Smart Summer Movie
","After seeing Mission: Impossible back in 1996, I couldn't stop singing the film's praises.  Here, finally was a film with some great set pieces and an incredibly complex plot to carry them.  Sure the film was lacking in character.  I didn't care, I was too busy trying to piece together the labrynthine series of double crosses and backstabs.  Apparently, a great many people thought the movie made no sense.  I find that to be a rather disturbing trend resonating from audiences who no longer wish to have their minds entertained as well as just their eyes.  This movie's plot is so well constructed that it likely takes more than one viewing to piece together completely.  The general impatience shown towards this film's narrative is a bad sign for the future of intelligent thrillers.  It's too bad too.  Here was a summer film that actually trusted its audience's intelligence, only to learn that its trust was misplaced.  9/10",9,2,5,23 April 2002
Shrek," Smug and Self Indulgent
","Maybe it's because I knew too much about what went on behind the making of this movie, or maybe it was the stale retread jokes, annoying characters or clich√© themes that we were supposed to believe to be fresh.  I just didn't think much of this movie.  The blasting of Disney by Katzenberg was too obvious for my taste, the character of Donkey really bothered me.  I like Eddie Murphy a lot more when he's live and doing crazy things like pretending to be 'Mr. White' on Saturday Night Live or making fun of some of the stranger aspects of Stardom in 'Bowfinger.'  If the movie is about not judging by appearances, why all the short jokes related to Farquad? Frankly, the only parts I found funny were John Lithgow's deliciously malicious villain bits, especially the joke about the gingerbread man. Otherwise this movie feels about as smugly self mocking as Charlie's Angels and far less sexy.

The Godfather," Great American Tragedy (SPOILERS)
","I suppose it's difficult to qualify exactly what formulates a tragedy.  Are tragedies about fate, disillusionment or death?  Are they about language? Must the plot adhere to a strict set of rules?  Must the climax come in the third act?  Well, my concept of a tragedy is when the flaws of one or more of its characters destroy a high goal.  In the case of the Godfather, this goal is the prevention of Michael's entry into the family business by making him a true American; the tragic flaw is Michael's inability to forego vengeance.Certainly many efforts are made to prevent Michael's tragic fate.  Michael himself seeks to evade becoming like his family.  When telling Kay about how his father released Johnny Fontaine from a band contract by making the band leader `an offer he couldn't refuse,' Michael says, `That's my family Kay, not me.'  While the rest of his family wears tuxedos at the wedding, Michael wears his dress uniform.  While his family talks about the drug business with Solozzo, Michael and Kay go shopping and go to the movies. 
By the time Michael saves his father in the hospital, it is already clear that Michael has no desire to be involved in the family business, but the attempt on his father's life is the first revelation of Michael's tragic flaw.  In the scene where Michael agrees to kill Solozzo and McClusky, Hagen tells Sonny that he is taking business matters personally.  When Michael agrees to kill them both, Sonny accuses him of the same.  Of course, a central irony of the Godfather is the fact that the family is the business, ties of blood and ties of money become inseparable.  Sonny's accusations are correct, Michael is taking the matter personally, the only major difference between Michael and Sonny is Michael's calculating patience.  This difference is painfully obvious by the end of the film.  Sonny dies because he carelessly charged after Carlo when he discovered that Connie was beaten after his initial death threat.  Michael waits for the perfect opportunity to have Carlo murdered, never allowing Carlo to suspect his motives.  After his betrayal, Tessio asks Tom Hagen to `tell Michael it was strictly business.'  Hagen replies that Michael knows.  Despite the fact that murdering Tessio and losing his knowledge of the Bronx is bad business, Michael has him killed.  This is further evidence that Michael is not acting out of his business interests, but his inability to forego vengeance.Kay is a very important figure in this tragedy, I say `figure' because to Michael, Kay as a person is irrelevant.  Kay's value to Michael is her lack of connection to his family.  She is from New Hampshire, so he most likely met her at Dartmouth (he went to college while his other brothers learned the family business). At the beginning of the film, Michael has Kay appear in his family photo.  He tells her everything about his family and while his family is planning, he is spending time with her notably shopping at the store `Best & Co.' and watching a movie about a nun.  These details are significant because Michael views Kay as a better sort of person than his family; he sees her as a figure of salvation.  When he returns from Italy and has entered the family business, Michael tells Kay that he has to marry her.  `The old way is finished.  Even my father knows that now.  In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.'  Michael sees Kay as a figure through which he will achieve that legitimacy.  When Kay asks Michael if he had Carlo killed Michael's reaction is the exact opposite of what he would have told her at the beginning of the film.  Instead of telling Kay everything and defying the old rule of never letting women know about the family business, Michael told her all of his family's stories willingly and with complete honesty.  In this scene, Michael reveals not only that he won't let Kay know about his affairs, but lies he finally agrees.  The final shot of the movie, the closing of the door as a wiping fade out is significant because it shows Kay's separation from Michael.  She has literally and figuratively been removed from him, salvation rejected.Easily the most telling scene on this film's tragedy is the scene in which Vito tells Michael that he `didn't want this' for him.  He tells Michael that he wanted him to be a Senator or a Governor.  This is interesting when compared to Michael's rationalization of his work to Kay in which he suggests that all men of power are the same.  Vito dies in the very next scene of natural causes, but with the knowledge that the son for whom he had such great hope had been damned. The scene immediately following the death of Vito is the baptism of Michael's nephew, which is brilliantly cross-cut with the murders of the heads of the five families and Mo Green is a sequence in which holy water is crosscut with blood, renunciation of Satan is juxtaposed with acts of murder and the sacred is connected to the vile.  Vito's way of doing things is finished.  Vito openly told the heads of the families that `I forego the vengeance on my son' and `I will not be the man to break the peace of this day.'  It is Michael who breaks the peace.  Vito was a reluctant Godfather who spend his life running `harmless vices' and declaring that `we're not murderers' when refusing to hit the men who assaulted Bonassera's daughter, ultimately has a cold, calculating man who rationalizes murder as his successor, defying all his hopes for the future.",10,1,3,23 April 2002
