Requiem for a Dream," Holy Smokes
","I have never seen a movie in here get so much of a reaction from so many people. I just saw his current film, The Garden, yesterday and my reaction was almost the same. I definitely came away feeling like I just had an out of body experience or something transcendental happen to me. I am now compelled by all of your comments to go get Requiem...I'll write back after I see it.Aronofsky as a film maker is along the line of Kubrick as far as the surrealism that seems to split your skull as his messages seeps in and fills your head with his thoughts.Thanx, Michael James",8,1,1,26 November 2006
Transformers," TWO WORDS..Oh My Gawd...
","Yeah, I know it was three words. But much like this fantasmagorical movie, you will definitely get more than you bargained for or paid for.There is something for everyone in this flick and all members of the human race will see themselves in at least one of the numerous characters. For a near 3 hour movie, nothing drags, every scene movies forward to the next and keeps you on the edge of the seat. My cool barometer, my 15 y/o daughter thought it was a shorter movie than Pirates which is roughly the same length.When an autobot gets his legs amputated, and he still rocks onward, I am sure every kid in a wheelchair feels like he wants to go kick some decepticon a$$. A the end of this movie the entire theater erupted in an impromptu raucous applause, the likes of which I have never seen in near 30 years of movie going.While it is rumored Transformers cost a whopping 155 million dollars, they will easily make it all back and then some. If a Transforer toy come out after this I for one will buy the damn thing..yup, and I'm 46 years young to boot.GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",10,7,12,6 July 2007
