Insidious: Chapter 2," Confusing or Confused
","Ok i admit it - i just didn't get this film. Maybe you need to have watched the first one recently but this just had so many characters, that i couldn't keep track of any of them. There are two guys, one is called 'specs', i have no idea what relationship they have to Josh. I think Josh is married to another woman (Elise?) and maybe his or her mother seems to have a key role. There's a baby and a boy, i'm not sure if both or just one of them belong to Josh and the woman. But then there are clips of two boys in a bedroom and i have no idea who the other kid is. There's an old bloke with a beard and i have no idea who he is, but he seems to like or work with 'specs'. There's a police interview which I can't even begin to explain, a lot of murders and someone called Parker, who again i have no idea how he fits into all this other than he was a patient at the hospital where the grandma used to work. Parkers mother seems have orchestrated the whole thing, they contact some spirits but i'm not sure if that's Parkers mother or Josh's mother or just some random spirit.Put it this way, the story, if there was one, is rubbish and could have been told with half the characters they used. I'm not a stupid person, i just didn't care enough about any of the characters. If there were different timelines then that would explain a lot but they keep doing that damn thing where the screen goes black and i'm not sure if they are re-appearing in another time, location, world or whatever. and i didn't care.",3,1,1,11 February 2020
It," Contender for laziest film of all time
","This is not really a film. It's: - a bunch of horror clich√©s (e.g. nobody seems to be able to run 10 meters without falling over) - a handful of sub-plots that go absolutely nowhere - 90's CGI - cringe worthy Americanism (e.g. friends cutting hands to bind a promise) - a mess of characters that don't develop, don't have anything unique about them and don't need to be in the filmI can only assume the people who liked this have all read the book and therefore knew the story going in, because the film is not going to explain any of the following: - what the clown is or why it is doing this or what his powers are - what relevance 27 years or the towns history has - why none of the adults seem to mind their children missing - why the police don't go in to the sewer - why the adults don't see what the children doYou could literally remove 70% of the characters and it would make absolutely no difference to the plot.Make no mistake, you may like the books and the screenplay (minus the CGI) is quite good, but this is a terrible film. If this film scared you then do yourself a favour and don't watch a legitimately scary film with an actual plot like the exorcist because you'll probably have a heart attack.",1,3,10,30 September 2017
Spectre," Paint by numbers
","This is a very average film. Best to watch on DVD and don't waste a trip to the cinema on it. The main reason is that there's no plot. Just random explosions, car chases and special effects linked by a tedious logic that occupies about 5% of the film duration. The camera work is pretty horrible in places, it goes all shaky as it follows Bond running through tunnels making you feel sea sick. Give it a rest guys, it's not paranormal activity. Looks it's not a bad film, it's just not a very good film. There was a lot of hype about it and frankly some of the 10 star reviews on here are suspicious. If you've got an IQ over 70 then there's nothing about the plot that you'll find clever. It should make a brilliant video game though, to be honest it's a lot like Goldeneye in that respect, but Goldeneye was better. That's 2 hits and 2 misses for DC...",4,10,31,31 October 2015
