Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," insult
","That movie was an insult to my intelligence, you wanna make slap stick humour fine but do it with freaking decency.Want to make a point fine then make a documentary instead.i can understand why some view this as funny.. it has its laughs but it gets dragged out into infinity with as much finesse as a cow in a ballerina dress..and all the time you sit there watching it, it just gets worse and worse. if you should do anything you should watch the first 25min then walk out.Then you would have gotten the general idea of the movie and you wouldn't end up sick to your stomach over its idiotic gags.",4,7,35,3 November 2006
Troy," Super human stupidity.
","i felt thru the movie that whatever Brat Pitts character did. he did just because he wanted it to be so, he is made into a super being.They might as well call it Superman ( insert number ) instead. the whole movie evolves around him, let me put some depth into that...No in actual time on the clock he isn't a typical main character.Focus is there on the other characters in the movie .. BUT they seem to be just fill for Archy ( Brat ).Bana,s character the only one i liked really in this movie, is reduced to a comic sidekick..when he had the potential to be somuch more..All in all this isn't Oscar material in my book... you never ever have that inner feeling ( man this is good ), Braveheart, Gladiator set in a old setting are both much more fulfilling to watch, and has better acting.Thumbs up .. Bana Thumbs down .. Brat Pitt Thumbs down .. pretty boy Orlando ( paper thin character ) Thumbs down to everyone except Brat pitts officer.. and the father of Orlando / Bana actually ..Just my 2 Cents ...a score around 50% of 100%",4,0,3,8 June 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Seen before!
","This is just yet another movie about war, i guess it was very reak for them to hold that bridge but for me, personally i think the plot was very flawed. The use of a lot of carnage was meant well i guess but ended up looking like Army of darkness for the first hour then switched to being a walk in a bombed out land. I dont think that Tom Hanks was worth it in this movie, hate to say it but this is just not his type of movie. he is too ^neat^ for it.",5,1,2,16 August 2000
