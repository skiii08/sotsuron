The Blair Witch Project," One word: creepy
","This movie was one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Without a doubt. Halloween would be number 1, but the Blair Witch would be an obvious number 2. I was shaking in my seat throughout the entire movie. I found myself wanting to run to the car after the movie and unable to get sleep when I went to bed. Forget about Friday the 13th and Sleepaway Camp, after watching this movie, I never want to go camping again.",8,1,1,2 August 1999
