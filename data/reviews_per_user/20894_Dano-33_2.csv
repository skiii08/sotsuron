Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Lives Up to Expectations
","When a friend of mine got tickets to the most recent Star Wars adventure, I wasn't THAT excited.  I'm not a huge fan of the series, but don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the first three, it's just that I wasn't planning on waiting 5 weeks for a ticket, ya know? What awaited me in the theatre was one of the most breathtaking films I had seen in years.  The special effects may look 'too' animated during the previews, but once you're in the theatre, it looks more realistic than the originals. Some of the dialogue was stupid, and that's about the only negative criticism I can think of.  I wonder if the dialogue and the voice were meant to be so 'corny'?  I found myself laughing at characters left and right, and I'm not sure if I was supposed to.  Never-the-less, Phantom Menace is a great film and I highly recommend it.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
Alexander," Let me add to the disgust
","This film qualifies as a Category 3 Disaster: I want my money back, I want my time back, and I want my memory of this film completely erased from my brain.Everything mentioned as of yet is true. I too, fell asleep during the battle scene for crying out loud, and couldn't for the life of me empathize with any of the characters. The accents didn't make sense, the conquests were not given any directive or purpose, the dialogue was melodramatic and overly Shakespearian, the story was told like a high school lecture that we all would've doodled sketches through, if we were lucky enough to be outside of a dark movie theater with better lighting. There has been some controversy over the gay/bi-sexual claims, but even if we admit that it was all ambiguous, the movie is so bad, those questions will presumably drift off into oblivion, when nobody bothers to pay their hard-earned cash to sit through it. Yes, the impression is that Alexander was more interested in men than women (for whatever reason), and yes, that might be the only interesting thing in the movie, but save your time and money and read about Alexander in the Encyclopedia.Oliver Stone is one of the Top 5 filmmakers of all time, but this junk..errr...I mean 'film' is going to make me rethink that claim.",4,0,1,26 November 2004
