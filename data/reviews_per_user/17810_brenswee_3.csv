The Lobster," Very strange... But I enjoyed!
",I can say for certain that you will never have seen a movie like this before. Some of the dialogue is quite funny and very unexpected. The characters are all so very odd.Ashley Jensen and Olivia Colman do a lot with so little. This is the kind of movie I might ordinarily have turned off within 20 minutes but all the very familiar faces amongst the cast made it an intriguing watch.,7,1,2,19 October 2019
Pacific Rim," If you like action flicks then you'll probably enjoy
",I don't dislike action but this was a whole lotta nothing. I must admit I did decide to watch it because I like the director and maybe that raised the expectations for me.It's just noise though and some aggressive guys essentially doing 'privates' measuring contests.,4,0,0,18 October 2019
Woman in Gold," This movie will make you FEEL
","I've just watched Woman in Gold for the second time and it has hit me harder than it did the first time. The final sequence, for me, is heart-wrenching and joyful, somehow all at the same time.What comes before it is a exceptionally interesting fight for justice. Helen Mirren can always be relied upon and this is no exception. It's really nice to see Ryan Reynolds in serious drama and he succeeds with aplomb.A movie for the ages.",9,1,1,14 April 2019
