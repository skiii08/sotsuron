Hereditary," One of the better ones of recent years
","Now look, how many 'horrorfilms' have come out in recent years that were just bad? So many flicks are made purely for money, and most of them are only aimed at light hearted teenagers. Don't even get me started on the PG-13 horrormovies... With Hereditary, I can say that finally we have ourselves a cast and crew who were really trying to give us something legitimately scary and disturbing. However just because someone wants it, that doesn't mean it actually happens in the same way. I am VERY pleased to tell you that Hereditary for the most part REALLY delivers as a class horrormovie.Unlike most 'horrormovies' that have come out recently, this one actually has a good story with interesting characters, a good narative and another purpose besides making a lot of money. During the whole movie there's this very unsettling atmosphere, with some very good scares and a truly disturbing finale. The acting is also very good, especially the protagonist really shines in this movie. Now I do have to say that the pacing isn't always as good as it should be. The whole movie in general has a pretty medium to slow pace. It really takes its time to set up the characters and story (which is good!), however it takes too long before the plot really kicks in. The horrorgenre is (of course) paranormal activity, because that's the only genre they can make apparently, but it takes a really long time before the paranormal activity is introduced. Given there are some tense scenes and unexpected twists here and there, but the movie isn't really about those things, it's about the characters and how they deal with the situation. As a filmlover this was really nice to see, but people who only go to see these movies for the scares and don't really care about a good story will be dissapointed I think. About those scares...FINALLY a horrormovie that doesn't rely on jumpscares, FINALLY!Guys, this is definitely a horrormovie to check out. It has been given an immense amount of popularity, but it's for a reason. It has a good story, well written characters, some very good scares that actually work and the acting is splendid! The pacing is a bit slow and the plot really takes its time to get introduced, but that is all forgiven for a very tense and scary finale that kind of reminded me of the finale from The Vvitch (2015). It's not THE scariest film out there, but it's definitely one of the best of recent years.
I give it a solid 7.7/10",8,0,2,26 August 2018
Captain Marvel," It's fine
","Let's start off by saying that I went into this movie with the lowest of the low expectations. I was fully aware of all the controversy and I absolutely can't stand it when politics interfere way too much with film. I sat down with two of my best friends in a pretty packed theatre aaand...it's honestly fine. Just fine. All three of us had to agree that it was way better than we thought and we can't hate a movie for reasons that actually have nothing to do with the movie itself right?Let's start with the positives: Brie Larson is fine, she's not great, nor is she terrible, she's just fine as Captain Marvel. Nick Fury is very entertaining and definitely a fun presence. The acting is good, the comedy often works, although it often doesn't and some characters are really weak and feel very forced. It's hard to talk about the villains in the movie without reaching spoilers, but I can say that the Skrulls' story was a lot deeper than I had expected and that was really nice to see. The visual effects are pretty much perfect, excpet maybe for a couple of scenes and the pacing overall is decent.Okay now the bad stuff: Let's kick this off by saying what exactly everyone is saying: this movie isn't special. It pretty much is as ordinary as you can get and if this movie indeed is supposed to be the feminist masterpiece so many people want...sorry but it really doesn't set a good example. Captain Marvel herself is also not really that compelling, yes she does get some emotional scenes, but apart from that she litteraly is on top of things from start to finish, which doesn't automatically mean she's a good character. The final showdown starts off promising but it ends very lame and some things are just waaay to predicatble. The little callbacks are fun at times, but sometimes also a little bit too much and last but not least, the mid-credits scene was actually pretty lame ( I never thought I'd say that).Guys in the end, Captain Marvel is a perfectly watchable movie. It's lightyears away from the hit that was Infinity War, but it's also not on the same lows as The Incredible Hulk and Thor. It's not very memorable and you will probably forget about it, but it's entertaining enough for you to have a good time.I give it a 6.5/10",6,1,2,10 March 2019
Deadpool 2," Less is more
","Let's start by saying that I loved the first Deadpool when it came out in theatres! I went to watch it with a whole bunch of friends and laughed more times than I could count. After seeing it a few more times, and of course also as a result of growing up, I could say that some things about the film where a little childish maybe (the overdose of sexual humor) but it was still a fun and original movie none the less! So naturally I was excited for the second one...and beyond all expectations...I really didn't like it that much.Let's start off positive, pretty much all the characters are great. Ryan Reynolds is great as Deadpool, Colossus is a fun presence as well as Cable and Domino are two very nice additions to this universe. There's one big twist somewhere in the middle that I LOVED, the action is very well done, the acting is good, the movie has a great tempo behind it and last but not least, the credits scenes are hilarious!So what happened? Well let's start by saying that it tries way too much at being as good as the first one. The method of narration is pretty much exactly the same, so it comes of as repetitive. The humor is once again good, but there are WAY too many times that it just doesn't work. I usualy don't mind pop culture references when they're done well, but here they just come out of nowhere and don't always fit in the moment. Another thing about the humor that didn't always work is that way too much of it is in your face. There's a scene where one person continiously says that a certain power of another person is absolutely useless while cette person is actually demonstrating to us that that power isn't useless. It was way too obvious what they where trying to do and I didn't find it funny.
The character of Cable is very cool and played well, but his introduction in this movie is extremely rushed, it almost felt like a bad Terminator movie at times, but luckily his character did improve. Another thing is the character of Firefist who is extremely inconsistent. This person changes his mind constantly during the movie that I found it very difficult to care for him, and the fact that this person plays a major part in the movie isn't that good.This movie was a mixed bag for me.
The action is great, the cinematography is very good, most of the acting is good, there are some very fun references and a good portion of the humor is well done.
On the other hand it does try way too hard at being like the first one, it feels very rushed at times, some characters are pretty difficult to follow and the other half of the humor is either way too much in your face or it just doesn't fit in the moment.It's a fun movie to go and see with your friends on a Saturday night, but nothing more.
I give it a 6.7/10.",7,1,2,20 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I couldn't even tell you what the movie is about...
","This movie feels like 5 hours cramped into 2,5 hours. There is so much exposition and set up needed to even remotely explain what on earth is going on. I get that a final chapter should be fast-paced. It should be the epic conclusion where everything ends. But there's a difference between being fast-paced and rushed, and this movie is very much rushed. After it ends, you feel like it didn't even deliver half of what it should have done. Some characters are disposed off so abruptly and the whole finale was without any sense of tension, not to mention a huge anti-climax concerning the villain. The plot armor is just out of this world, it feels like all our characters have god-mode on for the entire runtime. Not to mention that the villain's army is beaten in the most easy and effortless way. I hate to say this, but for me, this is the season 8 of Star Wars...",6,5,13,19 December 2019
Bird Box," Nothing special
","I watched this movie with my girlfriend the other day. What's better than a good horrormovie we thought? Since Birdbox was getting a lot of buzz and it was on Netflix, naturally we decided to watch it. Now I had to really strengthen myself to not start talking about all the flaws that I saw (talking about an awkward date).On first notice I would say that this movie is a mix of 'A Quiet Place' and 'The Happening'. The first one is actually a really good thriller, the second one...yeah not so much, so it was pretty weird. Is it as good as all the Facebook messages were saying which we kept seeing the past months? No, definitely not. Is it one of the worst horrormovies ever made? No. It's actually a perfect movie if you are with a bunch of friends, or your girlfriend, and you just want to have an easy-going thrillride.If your movie starts with a monologue of a seriously overacting Sandra Bullock, I was holding my breath because I was preparing myself for 2 hours of just plain bad stuff. At the end, it actually wasn't as bad as I presumed.The good stuff: The idea of being blindfolded the entire time is a good idea, although it does feel like a copy of 'A Quiet Place', but just a little bit different if you know what I'm saying. The acting is fine, not great, just fine. There's nothing really memorable about the techniques used, it's all pretty standard, not bad, just basic. There are some pretty good intense scenes near the end of the film that did surprise me a little bit, but since the movie is 2 hours long, 3 good scenes isn't really enough.That's what my main issue is with the movie: It's just so basic. There's nothing memorable about it. The plot is something we've all seen before, just remixed a little bit. The characters are all basic and stereotypical. One character, who gratefully isn't in the movie that much, was really unbearingly annoying (SPOILER: This girl's first line is: 'I'm a cop!' Then 5 minutes later she has sex with some random junkie we don't even know and then 15 minutes later she drives off with that junkie together with all of the food our main characters had gathered. Yeah nice cop you are.). The climax isn't really a climax, it at least doesn't feel like it, it feels more like a quick action scene that ends within 1 minute. The movie also feels a little bit too long, once we get the point and we are all caught up, the movie reaches it's final destination, but then it decides to add a whole other 'scary' scene, and it really felt unnecessary.Bird Box is not a great film, I would even doubt to say that it's a good film. It's the definition of a standard, basic thriller with nothing special about it, that's just good for having a fun time with your friends and some beer.I'm giving it a well-deserved 6/10",6,0,2,3 February 2019
