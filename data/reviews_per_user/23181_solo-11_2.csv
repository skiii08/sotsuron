The Sound of Music," It's so light-hearted you could fly
","I think it's a really happy-to-watch musical. The songs are timeless classics. The children are regular charmers. Julie Andrews has the comic element and Plummer has the enchanting eyes. Some events may be too good to be true, but it really makes one very happy when watching it, not that it's silly or slapstick, but that it's very simple and finds its way to the child in your heart.There are biblical and historical backgrounds too, though not the primary elements in the film, which may be why people see it as a weak storyline. I feel that it could have been better if the political details were introduced right in the first place, not until the very last part. However that would have made the film somewhat heavy at first. If the German troops marched into the opening, I guess I wouldn't have stayed to watch it when I was a child.The Sound of Music is a timeless classic for the whole family. Learn the songs and sing to brighten your day!",8,4,12,17 October 1998
Life Is Beautiful," Laughed, but it was not funny
","Although I could not understand a word of Italian or German, and the subtitles were either missing or inaccurate, LIB is more about relationships than it is about war. The trust of the boy for his father (you think he didn't suspect?), the love of the father for the boy that makes him try to make everything appear beautiful for his son, the passion between the couple....The first half of the film was pure fun -- Guido pulling all sorts of tricks to surprise his Princess Dora. Soon, their son came along and from then, it wasn't funny anymore, though there was humour injected.Most people who watched this film would laugh along, with the idea of it being a comedy. That is only the surface.8/10",8,0,1,6 April 1999
