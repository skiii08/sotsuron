Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Huh?
","Let me get this straight...I wait 16 years for another 'Star Wars' film, and I get 1 1/2 Hours of Jar-Jar??  Sheesh!!  Ok, let's get rollin' here...  2 Jedi Knights are sent to help a Queen save her world from high taxes, and end up finding a young boy who has The Force.  Well, aside from being a Paper-Thin plot, many of the characters seem as if they were written by an idiot.  Darth Maul is BY FAR the single most interesting character in the entire film, and we only get ONE LINE OF DIALOG, and 10 minutes of screen time.  Samuel L. Jackson, one of the great actors working today, is on the screen for approximately the same amount of time, also.  So I get stuck watching a half-wit, half-written, no-brainer character like Jar-Jar for most of the film??  God, save me from bad plot LOOPHOLES and moronic dialog!!  Even Ewan and Liam seemed like they didn't even want to be there...and any director that can suck all the charisma out of Ewan obviously needs to go back to film school.Now for the parts I liked (Yes, there are some).  I loved the Light Saber Battles with Maul.  Yes, he died in a totally STUPID way, but the fights were EXCELLENT.  The Pod Race was exciting, and fun, too.  The CGI. is top notch, as expected, and was high-octane, and just ROCKIN'.  Also, there is a Light Saber battle in the beginning of the film, where Ewan and Liam wipe out a whole plethora of battle droids...Pretty Darn Cool!!  All the action sequences in this movie are well done, and exciting!  For THAT, I applaud. As for the writing, the character development (don't even get me started), the PLOT development...well, there are more disappointments than a room full of Roland Emmerich films.  Lucas, hire the Wachowski Brothers to make the next 'Star Wars' film...THAT WOULD KICK BUTT...and that's the damndest bottom line, I ever BOTTOM LINED!!!  **1/2 out of 5.",Null,0,1,17 July 1999

","Before I begin, I would like to clear up something...I don't particularly think Bruce Willis is a Great Actor...he makes great, fun, and very entertaining films, but his acting has never been great (save 'Pulp Fiction'), at least until now.  James Cole (Willis) is from one of Terry Gilliam's horrifying future images, where the only remaining people on the planet live underground to avoid the plague that has wiped out most of the population.  He is sent back in time to discover a cure for this virus, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeline Stowe), and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), and the race for the future has begun.  With great acting from Pitt, Willis, and Stowe this story comes alive with terrifying realism, and frightening visions of the future of the human race....not to mention the finely developed romance between Railly, and Cole which is authenticly done, as opposed to a cheesy goo-goo film fling.  Gilliam's eye for detail, and his vision of futuristic horrors is crystal clear, as always, and takes the viewer into a realm of planetary biological terrorism that stares down at us like a Queen Alien in her hive.",Null,0,0,1 January 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," So much F-Word, Joe Pesci couldn't keep up
","With a message as strong as the power of Satan, this film blows the entire film-industry out of the water with it's WAY-OVER-THE-EDGE lude, crude, and tattooed humor.  About 4 friends in a small little red-neck town, and the repercussions upon their viewing of a 'Rated R' film, this movie blasts us in the face with the message of HOW POORLY PARENTS ARE RAISING THEIR CHILDREN.  Nonetheless, this film is the most offensive film I have ever seen, period.  Even I was offended...  Now THAT is a feat of film making skill par excellence!  Major props to the Parker/Stone tag-team of death for morally offending me for the first time EVER in a movie.  Wow!!  Anyway, this film is finely crafted...  The writing is great, the jokes are INSANE, and there is NO HOLDS BARRED here, making this the most DARING film I can remember seeing.  Y'know what the best part is, it REALLY peeves-off all the prudes in a MAJOR WAY!!  I LOVE THAT!!  Up yours, bozos!!  'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut' Rocks the boat harder than all, and will make your Parents cry (for realizing what a crappy job most parents do).  Brace yourself for Melvin?  Hell NO!  Brace yourself for CARTMAN...and that's the damndest bottom line, I ever BOTTOM LINED!!!!",Null,0,0,24 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," The Big F-You
","As a fan of the television program 'South Park', I entered the theater to see this film well aware of what I was in for...little did I know, though. Within the first 5 minutes of the film, I heard the 'F' word more times than Joe Pesci has ever said it.  Right from the git-go, this movie grabs you, and throttles you with it's WAY-OVER-THE-EDGE humor.  The Parker/Stone team have pushed the envelope farther than any other film makers in recent memory...  It's just mind-blowing.The basic plot of the film is the four boys go to see the 'Terence & Philip' Movie, and upon viewing it, begin to curse, causing their parents to flip out.  Now we all know that the message of this film is 'PARENTS, IT'S UP TO YOU TO DO A GOOD JOB!!  STOP BLAMING THE MEDIA!!'  Well, nonetheless, I have NEVER laughed so hard at a movie.  Vulgar?  Yes.  Insane?  Yes.  Wild, obnoxious use of four letter words??  Yes, Yes, and Hell Yeah!!!  This is a 'Frickin'' hysterical movie, performed, and directed to demented perfection. My throat hurt for 2 days after seeing this movie from laffin' so much. I laughed, I cried, I HURLED!   ****1/2 out of 5.",Null,0,0,17 July 1999
Blade," Layin' the Smack down on Bloodsuckers
","As a fan of High-Octane, low-intelligence, through-the-roof violence, I will say that this film (starring the charismatic Wesley Snipes) kicks it up a notch...in fact, maybe 2 or 3 notches.  Now, you can't go to see this movie and expect Oscar Caliber performances...you'll be damn lucky to get a believable line at all, but that's not the point.  The point to this movie is Abuse Factor, and, believe me, it delivers.  Wesley plays the cult comic book character Blade, whose mother was raped, and presumably killed by a vampire (in the comic, it's Dracula, in this it's Steve Dorff).  Anyway, to make a long story short, Wes is pretty upset about that, and dedicates his life to, what else, whoopin' Vampire booty.  There is so much booty-whoopin' in this film, I didn't know which way was up!  I think they should have called it 'Vampire Butt Whoopin' with Wes'.  Now as far as the acting goes, Wesley plays Blade almost perfectly from the comic...a big, mean, low dialog, Vampire Killer.  Kristofferson plays Wes' mentor, and is quite convincing as a freaky kind of 'wise master' himself.  The plot is pretty cut-and-dry, and I'll give 3 guesses to who wins at the end.....Nonetheless, this movie totally ROCKS, and there's LOTS of gore, for all you Horror Buffs...This is a fast paced action/horror extravaganza that'll leave you breathless at the intensity...just be warned, this ain't no 'Dawson's Creek with Fangs'...I mean, um, 'Buffy'...",Null,0,1,3 January 1999
Face_Off," I want to take his face...OFF
","Let me get this straight...good acting, AND a good plot in an ACTION MOVIE?!?!?  I couldn't believe it when I saw it, but 'tis true...this is a Hollywood Action Movie with good acting and a good plot...unreal.  I like this film a great deal...not as much as 'The Killer' (one of John Woo's earlier films from Hong Kong), but it is definitely a great, fun, and VERY entertaining film, with more than enough shoot outs/explosions/coolness to keep even the most Attention Span Impared person bonded to their seat with intensity, and over-the-top action.  Cage as the bad guy is beyond cool, then as a good guy he is great.  Travolta as a good guy is excellent, then as a bad guy he is as cool as Cage...perfect casting, and John Woo's direction make this a rockin' show....Should've been called 'Kick/Ass'.",Null,0,0,1 January 1999
Pi," 1+1=2
","I'll be the first to admit that I am NO mathematical genius.  I do well at math, and science, but a Brain Surgeon I am not.  Yet, I seem to fully understand this movie, as thick as the plot gets at times, I follow it into its dark oblivion.  I will say, for the record, that Sean Gullette did an excellent job playing this mildly deranged, plagued by headaches/nosebleeds math wiz that can seemingly figure out the mysteries of the universe in his head.  I loved the black and white filming, and the plot was over-the-top, which I respect in a world of Roland Emmerichs, and Dean Devlins.  This film gives you plenty to think about, and a lot more to stew on as the wonders unfold before your very eyes.",Null,0,0,18 December 1998
Pulp Fiction," Rockin' the World
","Just Brilliant.  The Acting, plot, screenplay, directing, cinematography, dialog, and everything about this film just ROCKS.  The dialog is probably the real attraction for this film, because it is SO WELL WRITTEN that it is almost like you're just watching 2 people chat about things...Be it Sam & John, John & Uma, Bruce & Ving, or Bruce & Maria, every line in this film is instantly recognizable, and completely memorable.  the Acting is awesome, everyone looks so natural in their parts that it is completely believable that John is a Hitman, Bruce a Boxer, or Ving a Mob Boss.  The way everyone acts flows smoothly, and the Chemistry of the people involved is a once in a lifetime kind of scenario.  It appears to me as, almost, a documentary on this group of people, and their lives...Absolutely the best film I have seen in MANY YEARS.",Null,0,0,13 December 1998
