Miracle," Really Terrific Movie
","I remember watching the tape delayed broadcast of the USA-USSR medal game in 1980.  I'm not a movie critic and can't tell you about all the cinematic subtleties but I know this: I thought this was a really great movie.  It is fast paced, dramatic, humerous, and nostalgic.  I'm always impressed when I watch a movie where I know how it's going to end, like this one and Apollo 13 for example, and it's still suspensful.  I think this movie is a must see.",10,0,0,19 February 2004
