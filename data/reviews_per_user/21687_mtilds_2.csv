The Ring," You'll Yell, You'll Scream, You'll never see your money again.
","What a joke.  This film was so bad, I had to jumped into another theatre just to get my money back.  The very plot of the film should be enough to keep people away.  ' You watch a video and 7 days later, you die.'  This sounds like a reject script from the X-files.   None of the character seem believable or real.   The scene where the women is screaming but you hear a buzzing sound was probably their film instructor who saw one of their student films.  They should have sent everyone who made this film back to film school 101 and sue their teachers for every having graduated them.",Null,0,0,4 October 2002
