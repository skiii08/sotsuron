Spartacus," my favorite movie of all time
","No movie has ever spoken more eloquently about freedom, courage, integrity, honor and love than this one.  The acting is from all involved is superb, but it's the message that makes this a most profoundly moving film. Gladiator (circa 2000) is an epigone.",10,5,8,13 June 2002
