The Blair Witch Project," Did I see the right movie?
","First of all, let me say I DID enjoy this movie.  It was very clever, well acted, and quite creepy at times.  That said, I don't think I have ever looked so forward to a movie and been so disappointed. I can't believe that this was the movie that everyone has said is the scariest movie ever made, they are still having nightmares, can't walk in the woods in broad daylight, etc. I went expecting to be scared out of my wits. I made my husband go with me, I was so scared beforehand. (I am actually scared quite easily.) There was no need--I could've watched this alone, at midnight.  Like I said, I did like the movie.  I just don't understand what is supposed to be so terrifying about it. It was a really clever concept and was actually quite enjoyable.  And mind you, the things in the trees, the bundles of sticks, and the end (although very ambiguous)were really creepy. But people actually think this is scarier than 'The Exorcist'?  Please.  I will recommend it to my friends but I will tell them not to take a change of underwear.  They won't need it.",7,1,1,19 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," If you don't like the show, don't see it!
","I am a 36-year-old mother of 2 and I love 'South Park', the tv show. I had heard and read a lot about how the movie wasn't as funny because the words weren't bleeped like they are in the show. WRONG! I found this movie utterly hilarious. I laughed practically the whole time I was watching it. I became more disbelieving with every scene that Trey and Matt got away with this stuff! (Bravo for them that they did.) I had the captions on my tv because I always have a hard time understanding Cartman on the show, so I got to understand every word to 'Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat B****'. I couldn't believe all the stars that were poked fun at! (I was about to die during the Winona Ryder ping-pong ball scene until it showed that she had a paddle.)This movie is so clever--you're laughing even when you know you shouldn't be--such as all the scenes in Hell with Satan and Saddam. I couldn't help but wonder, has anyone told Saddam Hussein about this movie? I would think he would find his portrayal a reason for biological warfare against the US, seeing as how he's such a lunatic. Like I said before, if you don't like the show, you will NOT like the movie. Be warned! But I saw it 5 days ago and I am still walking around my house humming 'Shut your f****** face, Uncle f*****'. What a catchy tune! I really liked the storyline (if you can call it that) with Kenny floating up to heaven at the end. I actually said, 'Awww...'. If you're a 'South Park' fan, by all means, see this movie.",8,0,0,28 November 1999
Being John Malkovich," Interesting premise, but...
","Well, tonight I finally watched this much-talked-about film that I have been dying to see, and I am disappointed to say...I was slightly disappointed. I love John Malkovich in anything, and Catherine Keener is one of my favorite character actresses. But the first hour of the movie was sooo ploddingly slow, I was itching to turn it off. I'm glad I didn't because it got much better in the last hour. (I realize a lot of the posts here say the opposite, that the first hour was better, but I beg to differ. To each his own, I guess). I myself enjoyed the in-jokes with Charlie Sheen, Sean Penn, etc. John Malkovich himself was great, as usual, and though John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener were good, too, I still don't see the need for Catherine's Oscar nomination. It was an excellent idea and some of the bits were great--the trip Cameron and Catherine took through Malkovich's subconscious (you have to wonder if those were real experiences of his youth!) was suberb, and the flashback that Elijah the chimp had to the jungle and his parents being tied up was very good and touching, as well.The end could have been tied up a little bit better, i.e., where was the portal to enter Emily's head? All in all it was entertaining but there could have been a little more to hold my attention in the first half. It was thought-provoking, but they could have done more with the concept instead of focusing on that bizarre love triangle.",5,1,2,25 June 2000
Reservoir Dogs," It's no Pulp Fiction...
","Yuck!  I saw this after I had seen (and absolutely LOVED) 'Pulp Fiction', thinking I might enjoy this too.  God, was I wrong! It was long, boring, and had barely any of the comic touches that made PF so great.  Like many other people have said, I can't to this day hear 'Stuck in the Middle With You' without thinking of that hideous ear scene.  In PF, you were actually on Vincent's and Jules' sides even though they were criminals killing every other person they came across.  Not so here for me!  I don't like Michael Madsen to this day in anything else I see him in because I can't get Mr. Blonde out of my head.  The scene where they got their names was clever, ('Why do I have to be Mr. Pink?') but other than that, I found no redeeming value in this movie.",2,6,14,21 July 1999
Pulp Fiction," One of the finest movies ever made!
","I've decided that there are two types of people in this world:  people who get 'Pulp Fiction', and people who don't.  I feel very sorry for the people who don't! This is one of the funniest, most enjoyable two hours I've ever spent in a theater.  I went into it halfway expecting not to like it, and I came out a rabid fan.  Samuel L. Jackson is the finest actor in film today, and this movie is responsible for putting him on the map.  Not to mention jump-starting the career of John Travolta! Sure, there's lots of violence and profanity--but that's what makes the movie!  I'm not one of those die-hard Tarantino fans either. (I hated 'Reservoir Dogs'.  Ugh!) My other favorite movie, along with this one, is 'When Harry Met Sally'! How's that for diversity? I don't understand how anyone could NOT like this movie. It's been imitated many times since, but when it came out it was very different than anything else that had been done. If you find it hard to follow the first time, watch it again.  You'll understand the back-and-forth-in-time concept then. Every performance in it was great--and it has many lines that will be quoted for years to come.  I could've done without Ving Rhames' rape scene, but other than that, it was perfect. 5 out of 5 stars!",10,0,0,21 July 1999
Titanic," Most overrated movie since the invention of film
",I cannot believe this movie won the Best Picture Oscar. I could've written a better script. The romance between Rose and Jack was totally unbelievable. We were supposed to believe that she was going to give up her spot in the lifeboat for this guy she met the day before? Please. The only redeeming value was the actual footage of the Titanic underwater. When the movie was over I couldn't have cared less about one person on that flippin' boat. Billy Zane's character was so overdone I kept expecting him to twirl a mustache and laugh maniacally. I saw an afternoon tv movie on Lifetime about Titanic that was better than this.,Null,3,5,11 August 1999
When Harry Met Sally...," If it were any more true-to-life, it'd be a documentary
","This happens to be my favorite movie of all time.  It is SO realistic. Almost everyone has been in the position of Harry and Sally at one time or another, and it's true--men and women CAN'T be friends.  No matter what anyone says, 'the sex thing always gets in the way'.  This movie probably has more quotable lines than any other.  It is just delightful and far above all the other romantic comedies that have come out since it debuted. The whole cast is just great. Carrie Fisher is hilarious! I wish I had a dollar for every time my friends and I have said, 'You're right, you're right, I know you're right'.Billy Crystal is who Meg Ryan has the most chemistry with, not Tom Hanks!",10,0,1,19 July 1999
The Truman Show," Way overrated
","I cannot believe all the hype surrounding this movie.  After I saw it, I sat there dumbfounded, thinking, this is what everyone thinks is so great?  It was a good idea but so slow and boring with such an anticlimactic ending that I almost fell asleep!  And of course Jim Carrey took every opportunity to make stupid faces even in a dramatic role. It was totally unbelievable and took forever to get to the end. I thought it was incredibly silly and would not recommend it to anyone.",3,4,10,19 July 1999
The Wedding Singer," Much better than I expected!
","I went into this movie expecting it to just be a way of killing a couple of hours during a rainy day on vacation at the beach. I was very pleasantly surprised! I thought it was very funny and the references to the 80's were hilarious. I graduated from college in '84 so I could really appreciate it. They had the hair, the clothes, the pop-culture references all down pat. The music was great also! Glenn, Julia's fiance, was a perfect parody of guys I knew in the 80's who were bitten by the 'Miami Vice' bug. It was hilarious when the door to his car opened and the theme from 'Miami Vice' burst out. He was such a pig, you knew she wouldn't end up with him. Christine Taylor's character, Holly, was a dead ringer for some girls I went to college with also. Her wardrobe was perfect! Drew Barrymore was a doll as Julia and I never thought Adam Sandler could play anything besides a numbskull (although he's funny at that too). They made a very cute couple and I am a sucker for happy endings. I am embarrassed to say the little song he sang to her at the end brought tears to my eyes! All in all, a very enjoyable way to pass time. I think this is Adam Sandler's best effort to date. And a bit of trivia--did anyone notice that the girl who played Linda, the one who left Robbie (Adam) at the altar, was the same girl who played Chloe (the hot chick from the Xerox place, as she was referred to), who Ross slept with when he and Rachel 'were on a break' on Friends?",10,0,1,10 November 1999
