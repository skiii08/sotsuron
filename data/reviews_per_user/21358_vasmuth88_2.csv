The Avengers," Review from a normal viewer
","I am neither a marvel fan nor hater. I even like some of their worse films like the spiderman series but I also disliked popular ones like thor. I like their movies more when they take themselves to serious. When I first watched the avengers it was on an airplane so beautiful rendered CGI and effects weren't influencing me through the small screen so it was mostly watching the story for me and I really think its marvels worst. Loki taking over the earth, Shield corporations, super heroes on pms emotions and obscure aliens. Even worse were superfluous characters like the black widow. It was just a huge mess of sci fi and super hero clichés. So why do I give it a 5? A mediochre rating? Because it had good acting, some funny scenes and when watched on a huge screen is pretty. It makes little sense but it entertains. I would say for people who cant stand unlogical stories this would propably rate much lower (My sister hated it e.g.) and for marvel fans its just nice fanservice.",5,2,7,25 January 2015
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Surprisingly entertaining movie-A fan review
","First of all I am really a fan of the hobbit book. Have read it at least 5 times in my life and probably will continue to do so in the future. The first hobbit movie was pleasant but in my opinion the 2nd one was very bad. Pacing issues and completely new story. Everything from the book was changed so it fitted (I am sorry to say so) Peter Jacksons very small perception of causality and fun (at least theatrical perception, I don't know him in person). Because of the groundwork of the 2nd movie this one had no chance to follow the source material even one bit. The new story was a mess and had almost no connection to the book anymore. Many dialogues got me almost bursting out laughing. So much cliché and dumbed down talking. Then I realised suddenly that I was really enjoying the movie. It was a free for all in middle earth. Imagine a rather silly fight focused anime mixed with shakespearean moments. It was awesome for the most parts. In a particular sad scene Bilbo acted completely like a toon character. The fight scene before was straight out of a looney tunes short story and the dwarfs went 100% warhammer meets scots. If you are a fan of quiet moments, slow pacing and want a movie true to tolkiens legacy this one is pretty bad but as an action flip it really gave me a lot to enjoy. Delightfully cheesy from a director who went out to give us a compilation from all his clichés while mocking them himself. Only thing that bothered me was the really well written end. It was very very good and reminiscent of the best the lord of the rings had to offer. It was breathtaking and had very well slow emotional moments. This did not fit the tone of the movie and made me wish more of the movie would be that way. Movie was enjoyable B-Movie Action spin of off Lord of the Rings but the ending was truly magnificent. I would actually be happy to see the hobbit interpreted again with a mor serious tone so you can choose what you prefer. Another small complaint is that the movie clearly is cut in a few parts which definitely need the extended cuts. Some scenes were extremely rushed.",7,1,4,15 December 2014
