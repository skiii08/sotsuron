The Avengers," My favorite one
","In fact, there is no need to comment on this film and everything done is perfect. It should be congratulated that film's director and writer. The film came up to my expectations totally. Cast of the film consists of my favorite actor and actress whose name are Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson. A negative thing about film, the beginning of the film is a bit boring, because scenes in the film take place in a ship I guess which made me a bit bored. But the scenes which was taking place in city is very fantastic and realistic which made me very excited.After watching it, immediately I examine avengers om IMDb in terms of its budget, gross and vote. I saw that its gross is approaching one million dollars and also its rate is 8.7 and absolutely it deserves that.The another thing which impresses me is unbelievable scenes. They are really really perfect and still have a bearing upon this film. Also the extra-terrestrials who are coming other planet is very realistic.Especially, character of hulk is very funny and attractive. To sum up,but for beginning of the film, rest of the film is very great and thanks director and cast for presenting such a fantastic film.",10,2,7,24 May 2012
50_50," It could be masterpiece but it could not, I think.
","This film could be one of the masterpiece film If the director showed ultimate attention, I guess. Because the process of being cancer and process of getting over the cancer consisted of simple scenes. Transition of these scenes could be a bit long and challenging. I mean, the process of the getting over the cancer became abrupt. But it does not mean that this film can not be watched and I just want to determine simple scenes.The plot of the film is very excellent and impressive and situation of man is miserable which made me upset while watching it.The character Katherine contributes on extra value to the film. Eventually,there is someone who is eager to help to Adam but for Adam's family. Therefore, I think, she played an important role in the film. I understand from the film that family is indispensable part of the people. Adam's boyfriend is just thinking of making love with girls rather than thinking of Adam I guess. Also his girlfriend takes him for a ride and it is very bad situation for someone being cancer. To sum up, plot of the film is tremendous but for scenes which I said and cast of the film is suitable for films. Thanks director for presenting such a amazing movie.",Null,0,0,24 May 2012
