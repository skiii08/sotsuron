Vertigo," Mesmerizing Masterpiece
","VERTIGO is absolutely one of the very best films I've ever seen--a mesmerizing masterpiece about obsession that has the power to haunt its viewers for years to come. After seeing it, years later whole sequences will revive in the memory. Hitchcock also brilliantly explores the very nature of reality, and seems to ask the question, 'Do we ever truly know anyone?' Kim Novak and James Stewart are both brilliant in the film.VERTIGO is also one of the most aesthetically beautiful movies ever made.",10,2,4,5 April 2001
Chinatown," A Film Noir Masterpiece
",CHINATOWN is a film noir masterpiece that gets better in repeated viewings and with the passing years. It ranks right behind Vertigo as the greatest mystery film.The performances of Nicholson and Dunnaway are complex and remarkable.,10,1,3,5 April 2001
Brokeback Mountain," Powerful Story of Living in the Closet
","I can see the flaws in this movie as well as the virtues. I don't think the love story between Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger is particularly tender, the scoped sweep of the years is at times much too fast. So, how come the movie haunts me for weeks each time I see it? Well, I think the final scenes which revolve around closets (literally), and symbolize the internalized homophobia and shame that Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) has felt all through these years, show why his love for Jack Twist (Gyllenhall) can never be tender nor continuing (as opposed to just sporadic.) It also explains why the brilliant Ang Lee shows us the those shirts in Ennis' closet and the picture postcard of the beautiful Brokeback Mountain, and then contrasts Ennis' dismal house trailer and the flat , dull view of the countryside from his bedroom window. Such is life in the closet-- the only life some gay men are allowed by many in the rather flat society as a whole. I love this brilliant, bleak masterpiece.",Null,17,19,27 April 2007
Gone with the Wind," GWTW : Still great after all these years
","I have seen this classic epic romance countless times-- and, though long, it still holds up to repeated viewings. First of all, there is the attention to detail in the sets, art direction, and costumes. Secondly, the story is truly memorable with characters that have become immortalized, and even a part of American popular culture, such as Scarlett O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Mammy, and Prissy. Thirdly, the acting is truly excellent! In a wonderful cast, Vivien Leigh must be singled out for special praise. Scarlett O'Hara was probably the most sought after movie part in history-- and it went to an unknown British actress! The casting was a risk. Considering the chaos the was the actual filming of GWTW--changing directors three times-- the artistry of the picture must be credited to David O Selznick, the producer, and to Vivien Leigh for her determined, willful, charming ,manipulating,selfish, but decent Southern Belle who is the very definition of a survivor. What a marvelous performance!!",10,1,1,30 April 2007
Lincoln," File 13,
","I love the movies-- our American art form-- but I'm afraid the last 15 or so years have been dismal! I just saw Lincoln-- and what a bore! 2 1/2 hours of boring, inaccurate talk, talk, talk!! Anyone who tells you differently either is lying, politically correct, or worshiping at the pagan altar of Abe Lincoln ( who was really a tyrant and a war criminal who killed 600,000 people and fought a total war against noncombatants over economics and against the Jeffersonian principle of the right of sovereignty and self-determination--and not- not about slavery! Lincoln was a racist, and despite publicity to the contrary, never freed one slave!) And while I'm at it, Spielberg is a bad director-- manipulative and sentimental and Tony Kushner is a bad writer-- manipulative and political. In this movie the music is too subdued, the cinematography is too dark, the art direction is too drab and the acting is too mediocre. Even Daniel Day Lewis' extolled performance is merely just--OK-- and not the masterpiece we have been told to expect. And that's the truth. Can you handle the truth?If you want to see a good biopic watch Lawrence of Arabia. If you want to see good acting watch A Streetcar Named Desire. If you want to see good directing watch The Graduate. If you want to hear good dialog watch The Apartment. If you want to see a good Civil War picture watch Gone with the Wind. If you want an interesting plot watch Chinatown. If you want to know the truth about dishonest Abe read The Real Lincoln by Thomas Di Lorenzo. Alas, American movies, and American culture are, I fear, in a spiraling decline.",1,27,55,26 March 2013
Some Like It Hot," 'We're the new Girls! Brand new!'
","This is the funniest movie ever made! Billy Wilder was a genius who could do the acid-serious drama (DOUBLE INDEMNITY, SUNSET BOULEVARD, ACE IN THE HOLE, THE LOST WEEKEND), the romantic comedy-drama (THE APARTMENT, SABRINA), light comedy (THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH and SOME LIKE IT HOT.) What a talent! English was his second language , and yet some of his movie language has become part of the American vernacular. In SLIH , We have the hilarious last line ('Nobody's perfect!') plus several other gems (OSGOOD: 'Bass fiddle! Do you use a bow, or do you pluck it?' DAPHNE/JERRY:'Most of the time I slap it!' OSGOOD:'You must be quite a girl!' DAPHNE/JERRY: 'Wanna bet?') and (SUGAR:'Diamonds! They must be worth their weight in gold!') Jack Lemmon is flat-out hilarious in SLIH, and so is Marilyn Monroe-- this is her best performance! I have seen this classic farce hundreds of times, and it's still fresh, funny, and wonderful!",10,1,1,4 May 2007
The Sixth Sense," WOW! Let me see that again!
","To me this film ranks right up there with The Innocents as one of the very best ghost stories ever made. The surprise ending really IS a surprise, and works even better on multiple viewings. I think that this film really is about the profound human need for communication, connection, and most of all for compassion. The Sixth Sense transcends its genre, as do most classics, and I do think that this one is going to a classic. Bruce Willis proves once again that he can act, despite what his detractors would have us believe. Haley Joel Osment-- in one of the truly great child performances-- is wonderful. Bravo! This film should have won the Oscar instead of American Beauty.",10,2,3,6 March 2001
