Iron Man 3," Objective & Unbiased review or Iron Man 3 No Spoilers
","Just saw it a couple days ago so i'll give you my thoughts about the movie, i am a comic book fan of Iron Man but i will try to give an unbiased, objective opinions on the movie . And again don't worry NO Spoilers!!!! So if u like me have been checking out early reviews of iron man 3 you would have noticed the reviews have largely been positive with some mixed ones, and that's how i think this movie will fair on the long run. Most people will love it & many might never accept it for what it is!! I'll start by listing out the Pros & Cons. PROS >>Really cool action movie with unique & creative action sequences. every cent of 200 mil was well spent. >>RDJ is awesome as ever, effortlessly carries the movie ! he charismatically plays a superhero suffering from what i thought was PTSD symptoms. >>The movie smoothly handles a superhero questioning his life & life's work without taking itself way too seriously ** Cough...cough.... Dark Knight** >>Wit & Humor is great tony stark is still the wise cracking billionaire everyone loves & many other funny moments. >>Good all round supporting cast Ben Kingsley,Gwyn Paltrow,Guy Pearce ,Jon Favreau all do a good job although Guy Pearce stands out. >>Shane Black Directing it was a good call. This one feels much different than the previous two movies and i mean that in a good way CONS >>'Mandarin' soon to probably become the source of endless debates among fans !! I remember reading an early review that said Mandarin is perhaps the most intelligent screen adaptation of a Villon since the joker!! this got me seriously pumped up for the movie & after seeing the movie i just don't know what to make of it! This will divide the audience, that's for sure. General audience won't mind the direction they took. But fan reaction will range from Disappointment to all out Nerd Rage!!!! BUT Mandarin is to Iron Man what Joker is to Batman..........Just Saying >>'Maya Hansen' starts out great, very interesting opening but everything just leads to a predictable & abrupt end. >>'Extremis' again an audience divider. regular audience will be cool with it, but fans will be screaming out loud 'No Way that's Extremis'>>Has somewhat of a 'Dark Knight Rises' feel to it!.....(PS not in a good way) seems really great at first but the more you think about it many things don't make sense >>Doesn't really kick off Phase 2 in a way the first movie of phase 2 should 'No talking Raccoons here' Verdict All that being said i still had a great time with it! as long as you don't compare it to Avengers and see the movie for what it is you should be able to enjoy the movie 8.5/10",9,1,10,28 April 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Pros & Cons of AoU..Honest Synopsis *No Spoilers*
","One of the biggest challenge this movie has to overcome is hype! where the only acceptable review for fans is 'This is the Best Superhero Movie ever made'So after reading so many threads trying to convince everyone this is the worst Marvel movie ever made i was little bit skeptical walking into the theater but i ended up walking out pretty Happy.Not to say the movie doesn't have any problems but then again no movie is without!this is my NO SPOILER list of Pros & Cons of the movie.CONS:Exposition, strangely enough most Sci-Fi movies have a little too much exposition but AoU really needed some exposition in many scenes.Without spoiling Ultron & Vision needed a little more explaining although i get the feeling this may be by design.Humour I really love Whedon's humour this movie genuinely had me laughing at most jokes, but a couple of times i felt like they could have been tones down.Nick Fury Deus ex machina again after seeing the latest AoS feel like this might be explained as well.Pacing: Some argued the pacing of the first movie felt slow in the middle this one is way too fast throughout, they could have slowed down a couple time & extend the runtime by a few more minutes.Super Nerdy not really a con, i personally love that but i can see how average moviegoers might not get it and this being the 12th movie it relies on you to know some of the backstory.PROS:Avengers! everything that worked in the first movie team dynamic, one lines & character moments are awesome and still feel freshUltron, Yes he is a good villain!!!! he could have been fleshed out a little more but he has the cunningness of Loki & Raw physical power of Winter Soldier.Vision, the less said about Vision the better but i get the feeling he will go on to be one of the more memorable Avenger.MCU: Happy to see this is not an isolated incident on earth like Iron Man 3 this has deep & far reaching ties into the MCUACTION: watch in 2D this movie has some of the best action choreography in a superhero movie,most notably Opening,Hulkbuster & climax So these are the short list of PROS & CONS off the top of my head i really enjoyed the movie, its a lot better the second time another stellar addition to MCU.",10,15,32,1 May 2015
