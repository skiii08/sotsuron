The Blair Witch Project," Disappointment.
","I'm sorry folks, but this movie disappointed me. I went in trying to suspend my disbelief, to watch it as if it actually was the recovered tapes of the three film students etc. etc., but to no avail. I understand that it's not fair to judge BWP on the same basis as other films, even other horror films; I still believe it was way overhyped, and failed to deliver.
At no point during the film did I (or anyone in the theater, for that matter) scream, gasp, or express any hint of being scared. The ending was interesting and rather unnerving, I'll admit, and the whole idea of doing a cinema verite horror flick was original, but overall this was a disappointment. Thumbs down.",1,1,3,1 August 1999
