Sucker Punch," Truly Bad
","I am not a graphic novel reader, so can't compare this film too the novels, but I am an avid film watcher & having seen Snyder's other films, 300, Watchmen & Dawn Of The Dead, went into this film with reasonable expectations. Confident that I would be entertained by a CGI driven action fantasy with (I hoped) a half decent plot! Sadly Sucker Punch doesn't deliver on any level, the plot is too long winded & flimsy, the CGI nothing overtly original & the acting is way below par, I hope Scott Glenn wasn't hoping this would improve his career. Carla Gugino shone best in this film in my honest opinion, but I've seen her act better than this, so can only assume that she realised just how bad it was going too be & didn't give it her all.Do yourself a favour, go watch wallpaper grow, but don't waste over 100 minutes of your life watching this!",3,6,14,26 April 2011
