The Ring," Be affraid of a bad director?
","I have seen the japanese Ring and was very very happy to learn that an american version was to be made. After waiting for a while it went up in theaters and I was one of the first to see it. The Movie was completely totally unsatisfying to a point that I hated the movie because of the way it totally missed the effect of the original, with the same premise and material, but with a bigger budget. AFter seeing the movie I decided to vote on it and not place a comment. But, to nuanciate my opionion I write this piece. I noticed that the guy who was the director also directed Mouse Hunt and, even worse, the Mexican.But.... I see that the Pirates of the Carribean has a pretty high rating and Geoffrey Rush I start to wonder if these 3 movies are just coincidence and that mr. Verbinski will make me forget this attempt to be scarier than Japanese.",Null,0,1,19 July 2003
