3:10 to Yuma," Wrecked by ending
","I haven't seen a western in ages and I've really enjoyed Christian Bale's work over the years so I thought I'd give this a try.Overall the acting was pretty good. Bale's character was an atypical protagonist and had more layers than in a typical Hollywood film. Crowe was pretty charismatic, even tho I can only stand to see him once every 5 years. Ben Foster as Crowe's right hand man was also pretty cool. Between him and Javier Bardem in No Country For Old Men (tho Javier edges Ben out by a couple notches) it's been a good year for western baddies. Peter Fonda and Alan Tudyk were also great. Nicely turned with some real nuances.So for most of it I would say it's pretty good - not great but more than serviceable. Great films break barriers and set new rules so serviceable is still pretty fun.Then Crowe goes 'Disney' (unconvincing change of heart whilst strangling Bale) and I couldn't really focus on the rest of the movie because I realized that the bottom had just dropped out. OK, Bale tells him a sob story about how pathetic he is and then Crowe stops killing him. That I can believe. But then when they suddenly become 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' buddies, leaping over rooftops, even shooting his own gang...Holy Bat-cows Batman you've lost me. I even went to the IMDb board and there are some good posts about how Crowe's character wanted to throwaway this life of crime, and admittedly there are several scenes which could be interpreted that way, but the way it was directed or acted it just didn't ring true at his final 'apotheosis'. A good film doesn't require you to sift through scenes looking for possible explanations. I mean in a mystery film sure, but based on the swelling score I don't believe Ben Wade's change of heart was meant to be a source of David Lynch-ian conjecture and reconstruction. There are other plot holes as well, especially Peter Fonda riding a horse after being gut-shot and when a Gatling gun barely makes an impact on horse mounted bandits - but that's Hollywood and I can forgive heroic hyperbole for the sake of plot. But that last bit really sunk this one for me. I don't know how the original story went but it almost would have been more interesting if Ben Wade had been accidentally winged by the $200 mercenary town folk, Charlie goes ballistic on the townspeople, Wade then shoots Charlie out of indignation, then escapes while Christian Bale rubs his throat (living for another day). Okay I guess that could use some work too, but at least I could swallow that more than what ended up on film.",5,5,10,20 February 2008
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Extremely well crafted but without vision.
","What a divisive film. First there was the pile-on to praise it as the greatest thing since ESB, then almost 24 hrs later a massive backlash (imdb, various comment threads) accusing it of overly stealing/honoring the original trilogy ('Darth Plagiarious' - LOL!). I personally have been swinging back and forth, not sure if this is a Mad Max Max Fury Road or a Superman Returns. Perhaps on a 2nd viewing I will enjoy it more after adjusting expectations. Or I may start counting homage shots. The Screen Junkies people don't even need to make an Honest Trailer for this one, it just writes itself.I suppose time will tell, but I think this film was CRAFTED excellently (I laughed, I cried), and Rey was a great addition to the cast of characters. At the same time I miss George Lucas' sweeping vision and predilection for invention. It's immediately gratifying to see the X-Wings of old, but then I realize that that's all there is. It would have been nice to see SOME new ship designs. I suppose in a perfect world Kasdan and Arndt would have worked over Lucas' plot and Kirschner would have lived to direct it. I've never been impressed with Abrams, all of his films seem to be highly derivative of a 'classic' film predecessor. In other words, Ep VII is to IV what ST:Into Darkness was to WrathOK (except the spaceships and actors are the same).SPOILERISH BELOW The plot issues being debated all have some merit I think. Rey becomes amazingly powerful and skilled much too quickly. If this were a pilot for a 12 episode miniseries, then I could accept these open-ended questions. But for a film? This is probably a symptom of the current trend of writing movies with franchise marketing driving the narrative. Sequels are nothing new - James Bond, Zatoichi, Godzilla, etc... But at least each entry in those franchises could stand on their own as a movie. This film clearly ends on a 'TV cliffhanger', much more so than ESB. I guess since the future films are already in pre-production these films COULD be considered as literal 'Episodes', but it did seem like a bit of bait and switch (especially considering that the 1st trailer had more Luke than the entire actual film). I am curious to see how the next film turns out. But if Finn gets frozen in carbonite and Rey has to face Kylo Ren in a 'city in the sky'...then I'm out. Luke will be Yoda, that's already been pretty much telegraphed...",5,10,16,21 December 2015
