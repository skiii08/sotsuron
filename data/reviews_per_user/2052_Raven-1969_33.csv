The Lobster," Rule-keepers are the Best Killers
","There are those who love rules. However, they mostly want others to live by them, not themselves. This is the premise of The Lobster where bizarre rules reign. Among them is a rule that if a spouse dies, then another spouse must be chosen - in a controlled environment and among slim pickings - within 40 days. Failure results in being turned into an animal of your choice. Of course there are exceptions. If you kill someone, you get an extra day. In such an Alice in Wonderland type atmosphere it is only the keepers of such insane rules who thrive.These rule-keepers rarely have a heart or any empathy for others. Rather, they are the best killers. Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John Reilly play characters that are caught up in this nightmare. I loved the theme of the story and the characters, yet I thought it was disjointed, awkward and too far-fetched even for me (a lover of such Kafkaesque settings). I may not have been in the right frame of mind going into the film or as convinced, as those at Cannes who gave it a jury prize, that the characters are motivated by fear. A very imaginative and interesting film overall despite the shortcomings. TSeen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.",7,3,10,8 November 2015
The Death of Stalin," Stalin would be loving it!
","Stalin would be loving it. In 1953 when he is found flat on his back and comatose, Stalin's corrupt, butt-kissing underlings cause chaos and terror with their plotting and scheming to replace him. Nightmares make more sense. Purges sweep away the unwise and unlucky, army and security forces vie for the upper hand, prison doors open and close, executions take place in broad daylight and back stabbing rules the day. This is political satire at its best.History, humor, brilliant quotes and somber visions about the past, present and future combine for a fantastic film. Truth is stranger than fiction, and one of the wonderful aspects of this film is how much the political trickery cuts to the bone. Vasily Stalin (the dictator's vodka guzzling son) gets on the podium, for instance, and military jets streak across the sky and drown out his speech. A planned distraction? Of course. Stunts like this could happen anywhere and are happening everywhere. The film rings true. It is an eye-opening and fabulous glimpse of the political underworld. This is how people get killed or locked away, when their stories don't fit. The actors are amazingly good, especially Jeffrey Tambor as Malenkov, Steve Buscemi as Khrushchev and Jason Isaacs as Zhukov. If you like politics and history as much as I do, you will love this. The film is in English and a variety of accents. This device (the various accents) heightens the aspect of chaos and confusion.

The Big Lebowski," Time and Place for Everyone; Even the Dude
","Intruders break into the modest Los Angeles apartment of Jeff 'the Dude' Lebowski. He is roughed up, money is demanded of him that he does not have, his head is unceremoniously swirled in the toilet and the toughs threaten to return, but they have the wrong Lebowski! This simple case of mistaken identity leads to a comedy of errors involving a kidnapping, a million-dollar ransom, Jesus in a purple bowling suit, a duffel bag full of dirty undies, an attack ferret and even a spicy bowling themed dream sequence. The Dude is inept, lazy and hopeless, but there is a time and place for everyone. He is in way over his head, yet so is everyone else.
 
20 years after its release and the film still one of my all-time favorites. It was my first Coen brothers film. Their brilliance and originality is instantly recognizable. The story and characters are full of delightful depth and details, the writing is witty and consistently dazzling, there is never a dull moment, and on top of everything it is really, really funny. At times I could hardly breath I was laughing so hard. Among such moments is the confrontation with the ferret, the parking lot skirmish heart attack and the bowling rants and taunts of Jesus.
 
Finding balance is one thing the Coen brothers excel at. Each character has offsetting strengths and weaknesses, every setting is shown in wondrous light as well as the shadows, and nothing is beyond reproach. No one and nothing is put on a pedestal, or trashed without a fair fight. The casting of Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro is brilliant. The Coens have such amazing insight into the American character; rich and poor, country and city, women and men, and cultured or not. They cut across boundaries, religions, philosophies, regions and political persuasions, and they do it seamlessly and randomly as a tumbling tumbleweed and as unlikely as a bowling alley prophet!",10,1,4,8 March 2018
Fight Club," Lose Everything to Do Anything
","A restless and troubled man subscribes to the idea that 'the things you own end up owning you.' He finds liberation in letting go of fear, consumerism, rules and other forms of control. Pain has a way of focusing the mind, letting the chips fall where they may, and it becomes something that he craves. With like-minded individuals he creates underground 'fight clubs' where anger and depression melt away with severe beatings, increasingly extreme violence and virtual anarchy. By losing everything we are free to do anything. This is the mantra until he finds something he wants to hang onto.Fight Club is a shocking, quirky, raw, innovative and twisted thriller. It is well-crafted and fortunately I didn't figure out the drift of the storyline until the end. The film is more exhilarating for that. Fight Club is full of thoughtful quotes and inventive camera-work that provide pleasing depth. So do the performances of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter. While it is awkward at times and stretches belief, stranger things have happened in real life.",8,0,1,17 October 2019
Akira," When Power Goes to the Head
","In an off-limits area of new Tokyo and the aftermath of World War III, a secret government project known as Akira is unraveling and a freakish stage of evolution is occurring. Rival motorcycle gangs, military special forces units, scientists, rebels and odd kids with supernatural powers, are among the groups clashing. Orders are to kill what cannot be controlled, yet few are in control of themselves. Into the void steps motorcycle gang leader Kaneda, a noble outlaw in the tradition of Mad Max, Motoko Kusanagi and Han Solo, to attempt to tie up loose ends.
 
This timeless, complex and thrilling animation masterpiece is as action packed as it is food for the brain. It is a typical Japanese dish; the artistry, attention to detail and manner in which it is prepared and served are as important as the taste. No corners are cut. To look away, even for a moment, means missing an essential part of the multi-faceted story. Akira is delicious for eyes, ears, brain and heart alike. After 30 years it aged well.
 
Akira revolves around questions of balance; those who absorb power without thought or principle, and those too cowardly to act. Decisions are made for those who do not make them on their own. The only foolish questions are those that are unasked.For a deeper experience, listen to the film in Japanese.",9,0,1,4 July 2018
Shakespeare in Love," Filling in the Blanks; Life of Shakespeare
","In London of 1593 an ambitious and talented young poet, Will, needs inspiration, characters, plot and muse for the romance he is writing. He finds everything and more in the shape of Viola, a mysterious and beautiful noblewoman in search of adventure, poetry and love. Viola, in turn, finds what she seeks in Will. When a jealous rival for Viola's affections, writers block, mistaken identities, a theater owner with a large debt to pay, and the Queen of England threaten to thwart the two lovers, Will begins to make up the story - what we now know as Romeo and Juliet - as things go along. Fact and fiction then combine, and it is hard to tell one from the other in this 'misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms, feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, and still-waking sleep.' (Romeo and Juliet)Shakespeare in Love ingeniously and indelicately adds touches of humanity, humor, intrigue and, of course, romance to the often stale and very limited facts that are known about Shakespeare's life and the history of Romeo and Juliet. In making Shakespeare fresh and interesting to a wider audience, and reading between the lines, the film won seven Academy Awards including best picture, actress, supporting actress, writing, music, art/set decoration and costume design. I loved all the nods to Shakespeare's actual work and true history. Gwyneth Paltrow, vivacious and charming, fits the character of Viola perfectly. Judi Dench plays the role of the sharp, caustic and quick-witted Queen Elizabeth equally well. Other A list actors include Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Tom Wilkinson, Colin Firth, Ben Affleck and Rupert Everett. It baffles the mind that this achieved an 'R' rating!",8,1,1,3 December 2018
The Secret in Their Eyes," To Fear and To Love
","A train departs a station in 1974 and two lovers, Irene and Benjamin, part before they come together. 'Te mo' is to fear and 'te amo' is to love. Love and fear at the same moment. This multi-layered, rich, brutal and beautiful film revolves around this dichotomy in many ways.Decades after the train left the station, Benjamin is unhappily retired from a prosecutor's office. He does not like what he sees in the mirror. An unsolved case, a savage rape and murder, weighs heavily on his mind, as does Irene. Benjamin and Irene worked on the case together and as it unraveled, so did they. So with more purposes than one, Benjamin resumes investigating the murder. New discoveries and different perspectives instill hope in Benjamin for solving the mysteries and memories that haunt him. People may change but their passions don't.The justice system is not clean or simple in any country, and this brilliant film reveals how complex and ugly it can be. The Secret in Their Eyes seamlessly combines multiple genres including crime thriller, romance and drama. There is appealing depth to the story, characters, themes, acting and photography. The characters, for example, are not one dimensional. They are vulnerable, make mistakes, regret choices and, in sum, are fully human. Themes revolve around memories, justice, love, vengeance and more. Soledad Villamil (Irene) and Ricardo Darín (Benjamin) perform amazingly well together. The chemistry is palpable. The film won the Academy Award for best foreign language film.",9,1,1,14 August 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," Enter Magical Realm
","It is a dream, and it is not a dream. Two girls, Satsuki and younger sister Mei, move with their father to a country home to be closer to their sick mother. The girls discover a magical realm full of playful, mischievous and child-like spirits. When their mother appears to be in deeper trouble, Satsuki and Mei set off on their own to see what they can do to help.Prepare for deep immersion in Japanese culture, together with its surreal magic, humor and charm! Combine this with the vivid imagination, wit, playfulness and vibrant artistic detail of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, and discover a film experience that will transport you to a parallel universe of fantastic sounds, colors and emotions. Enter mysterious forest shrines, dance in the moonlight, listen to the eerie chirp of cicadas and distinct calls from Japanese kites (hawks). See the camphor trees in all their shades, admire the wildflowers and the sky full of stars, and enjoy frequent baths and magical spells. The artistic detail of the animation is amazing to behold, even as early as thirty years ago; light and shadows in multiple layers and forms, reflections and glare in glass, translucent water, drifting clouds, the glow of twilight, astonishing sunrises and sunsets, complex angles of the sunlight, rainfall that mimics the real thing in sight and sound, a rich diversity of dragonflies and butterflies, and even multiple shades to the paint on the wall.Contrary to European culture, a haunted house (a sub-theme of the film) is not necessarily a bad or scary thing. Japanese spirits and demons are good or bad, or more often both, depending on the circumstances. Please listen to the film in Japanese, as the fastidious Miyazaki takes great care to choose the perfect voices. Plus it is rewarding to learn some Japanese (konichiwa! moshi, moshi!) The filmmakers must have spent time observing kids to know and reveal their antics so well. Released by Studio Ghibli at the same time as Grave of Fireflies.",10,0,0,19 April 2018
Juno," Snarky Serious!
","When Juno, a single and pregnant teenager, announces that she is 'losing faith in humanity,' her long-suffering father asks if she can narrow it down a little. This scene, as serious and poignant as it is funny and charming, provides a glimpse of the tone and tenor of the film throughout. Everyone, even a convenience store clerk, has something snarky to say. Tense situations are disarmed by humor and sympathy.Juno is obviously not ready to be a mother, yet she handles her situation with inherent panache and a curious blend of independence, optimism, sarcasm and diligence. In searching for a well-off and decent couple who will provide a good home for her baby, Juno displays more maturity than most adults. The childish antics of her elders and the serious nature of her situation cause Juno to do some serious soul searching along with attempting to discover someone who loves her for who she really is.Ten years after the release of Juno and it is still original, cute and exceedingly snarky. The untraditional plot and dialogue are refreshing. Ellen Page (Juno) carries not only a baby, but the film as well. She is a natural for such a role and perfectly cast. Michael Cera, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are wonderful in their supporting roles. I wonder how much their future success depended on their roles here? Depth and nuance (beyond being snarky), however, are lacking. There should be plain English subtitles for the language of other generations, young and old (ha, ha)! Maybe the wait is another ten years for such an app.",8,5,6,2 December 2017
Don Jon," refreshing and absorbing
","Barbara has one rule. Don't lie. OK she has a few other rules that Jon Martello Jr., much to the amazement of those who know him, tries to live up to. His love of porn and a deeply libertarian lifestyle of course threaten to interfere with Barbara's vision. Both Barbara and Jon desire to put their partner in a box that they've built for themselves. This raucous, independent and truly funny satire of tough and sweet talking, sexually supercharged New Jersey hypocrites is a refreshing and absorbing debut by new director Joseph Gordon-Levitt. 'The larger conversation here,' Scarlett Johansson told the media in Toronto, 'is about expectations in relationships . . . and how men and women objectify one another and how this applies to intimacy too. . . there are healthy ways to enjoy pornography for couples.'

Begin Again," innovative, insightful, visionary, perceptive
","Dumped, broke, fired, punched, dreams crushed, drunk, estranged from loved ones, no place to stay, cheated on, alienated and/or alone, the main characters of this film, Greta and Dan, are both extremely down on their luck. Yet these two who wear their hearts on their sleeves and bring life to those around them, in their own unusual ways, encounter each other by chance. They begin to work their odd magic on each other. From the innovative, insightful, visionary, perceptive and independent director of 'Once,' a film I enjoyed immensely, I was again – much as I tried to resist high expectations - transported to a romantic, musical, surreal realm. The alluring pulse of the music, beautiful scenes from the streets of New York, the unexpected twists and turns of the story, the evident chemistry between Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo, interesting dialogue, and naturalistic shots that provided the feeling that I was a part of the film rather than merely watching it, delighted and charmed me to no end. This film is more than a musical, emotions are communicated through songs that come from the hearts of the characters. Keira and Mark are astounding. Keira breaks up with her boyfriend in a look, and pulls it off. A film for the humble and supportive people who, when they fall down, have others who take the opportunity to pile more troubles upon them.

American Beauty," American Beauty impacted my life
","Middle-aged Lester has an epiphany about his dull life, and in the 20 years after American Beauty's release it seems Hollywood experienced one as well. This gritty, stylish and irreverent film is a shift from previous decades and the typical way that major studios do business.Lester experiences a series of shocks that he surprisingly takes in stride; fired from his job, cuckolded by his wife Carolyn, taunted by his teen daughter Jane, and more. Fantasy comes to the rescue for him in the form of Jane's friend Angela. While his world and the people around him crumble, Lester aims to live up to Angela's positive impressions of him and prove it is never too late to get it back.American Beauty impacted my life. After seeing it with my then wife Jennifer in 1999 in Arlington, Virginia, I vowed not to find myself in Lester's situation. It influenced me to be a park ranger even though it is 'McDonalds work' to her.Though many of the characters in American Beauty act trapped, some such as Lester begin to realize that it is useless to try to live as others think or demand you ought to live. When they cast aside the pressure and control they are greeted with hostility. 'You can't go around doing whatever you feel like,' says one of the manipulators, 'there are rules in life.' But there is also so much beauty in the world, and Lester and those like him vow to immerse themselves in it.American Beauty is an intriguing and artful portrait of suburban dysfunction and a middle-class underworld, but also inspiration for rising above circumstances. Compelling film techniques include falling flower petals, spotlighting, fantasy sequences, jarring music, mist, slow-motion, and more. Kevin Spacey(Lester) and Annette Bening (Carolyn) are perfectly cast. The film earned 25 times its estimated production cost ($350 billion, which is 120 times the entire budget of the agency I work for, the National Park Service). By non-Hollywood standards the film still is somewhat tame and I wish the film makers had been even more daring.",9,2,3,18 September 2019
Ratatouille," Best Film of Pixar Studios; Tenth Anniversary
","A badly orchestrated kiss, rats improvising with the menu in a five star Parisian restaurant, and a young man deservedly slapped for not paying attention to the woman spilling her heart to him. Ten years after the release of Ratatouille and such moments are still laugh- out-loud funny. This clever and indelible animated film won a wide audience even among the notoriously fastidious French. It won a spot in their hearts, as well as my own, for its humor combined with amazing insight into the Paris restaurant underworld, the whimsical and witty portrayal of the human and rat relationship, and realistic and empathetic depiction of the struggle of artists in a world often unkind to such spirits.Remy, a young rat with a highly developed sense of taste and smell, is half pulled by his culinary talents and half pushed by bizarre circumstances, into the high culture of French cuisine. He is inspired by the great and popular Chef Gusteau who encourages creativity, daring, artistry and – of course - the savoring of delicious food and wine. Remy meets a hapless yet kind-hearted human, Linguini, who both compensates for what Remy lacks (human form and companionship) and triggers fears about the dangers of humanity. Remy and Linguini are pulled together into alternating currents of light and darkness that threaten to drown them and set them free. The cherished beliefs and legacy of Chef Gusteau hang in the balance as the unlikely rat and human duo battle vicious food critics, health inspectors, scheming profiteers, the fickle and capricious whims of consumers as well as love, and even family (Remy's Dad demands that his son stick close to the nest and avoid humans at all costs). The worst adversary for Remy and Linguini is the truths they hide within and from themselves. They both prefer to keep secrets which, they've come to believe, also keep the peace. Ratatouille surprises and delights not merely in its compelling storyline, but also in uncovering the secret lives of chefs. The audience gets a schooling in the art of cutting vegetables, the importance of clean work stations and getting first pick of the produce, listening for the proper crunch of bread and understanding the kitchen hierarchy, among other things. Viewers are treated to an inside look at the restaurant industry where the words of respected critics rule the day for good or ill, artistry faces off against uniformity, workers combine in unwieldy and fragile teams, and there is immense pressure to sell-out in one form or another. From its success in portraying these bits of French culture, it is clear Pixar did not neglect its responsibility to conduct research and observe the industries. The complex, charming and intriguing characters of the film are paired well with complementary voice actors. This is especially the case with Peter O'Toole who provides the imposing and authoritative voice of food critic Anton Ego. Ratatouille is not predictable, rather it is full of delightful twists, turns and kernels of wisdom scattered everywhere.The premise of Ratatouille is that anyone can cook. This should not be taken to mean that everyone should cook, but that a great cook can come from anywhere. This is also true with film. Great films come from anywhere. Look far and wide among different genres and nations of the world, for obscure or hidden gems. Dare to discover new talent and perspectives, as in this spectacular animated film that many relegate to the exclusive realm of kids. Looking back to childhood brings wisdom, as Anton Ego understands. I never tire of seeing this film. Along with the Incredibles, this is among the best of the Pixar studio.",10,0,0,25 June 2017
Legends of the Fall," Love triangles too many to count!
","A remote Montana ranch with three varied and opinionated brothers and their dad virtually explodes in testosterone when a pretty young woman lands in their midst. The love triangles are too many to count, but most of them revolve around the wild, black sheep, moody, rule and heart-breaking brother Tristan (Brad Pitt).Watching the film in 1994 at Union Station of Washington DC with my girlfriend Carolyn, we were delighted by the urban audience. Unlike the suburban audiences we were used to, this one - composed primarily of young black women, did not hold back on expressing their emotions. There was a lot of squealing from this segment of the audience during the sex scene.According to one critic Legends of the Fall is a 'cheesy melodrama with too much crying.' While the film did contain a lot of unfortunate events and obligatory tears, there is more depth to the film than this. For one thing, the cast of Aidan Quinn (Alfred), Anthony Hopkins (dad), Julia Ormond (Susannah), Pitt (Tristan) and Bart the Bear (bear), was captivating and fun to watch. The location is gorgeous and so is the cinematography. I also enjoyed the intriguing storylines, the captivating drama and wondering about how the love triangles would play out. Legends of the Fall is based on a novel by Jim Harrison. The story is set in the early part of the last century.",8,0,1,24 December 2019
No Country for Old Men," Brilliant Game of Cat and Mouse
","'You can't help but wonder how the old timers would operate in these times,' narrates Sheriff Ed in thick and alluring southwestern drawl. We soon find out exactly what he means by 'these times.' Llewelyn is hunting in a remote and arid grassland, stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and manages to get away with a bundle of cash. While Llewelyn covers his tracks, keeps his mouth shut and is smart, tough and resourceful, he may not be prepared for what is coming for him in the form of tracker Anton Chigurh. A person without empathy is more dangerous than a coward, and Chigurh is cold, cruel, relentless and methodical. He figures out not just where people are, but where they will be. As Chigurh pursues Llewelyn, others are close behind including Sheriff Ed, a drug cartel, other trackers and Llewelyn's girlfriend, only a few of whom are cut out for this game of cat and mouse.Ten years after the release of the film and it is well understood how it made or sealed the careers of Javier Bardem (Chigurh), Josh Brolin (Llewelyn), Tommy Lee Jones (Ed) and not least of all the Coens who are some of the best directors in the business. Here the Coens are firing on all cylinders. The film is complex, thrilling and multi-layered. It is full of great lines. Its occasional extreme brutality is offset with wit, charm and humor. Adding to the compelling characters are amazing performances by Jones, Bardem and Brolin. They are perfectly cast. The voice of Jones alone is authentic and enthralling. Bardem is truly chilling. He speaks, moves and acts like a ghost. There are beautiful shots of the southwestern landscape in the morning light and intriguing close-ups of the characters. There is delight even in little details; a coin flip, a drink of milk, a cat and the banter of minor characters. Such attention to detail is a mark of the brilliance of the Coens. The film is set in the 1970s and is based on a story by Cormac McCarthy. This is one of my favorite films (top 20) of all time.",10,5,6,5 November 2017
Climax," Raw, Colorful, Sexually Charged and Spellbinding
","Sangria spiked with LSD causes a party of already supercharged young Paris dancers to spin into violent, sexually charged and deadly chaos. Based on a real event. All the raw energy, random aggression and explicit passion that Noe is known for. 'You despised I Stand Alone, you hated Irreversible, you loathed Enter the Void, you cursed Love,' declares one of the film teasers 'now try Climax.' Personally, I love Gaspar Noe. There is nothing quite like his films. Art is supposed to take you out of yourself, and Noe certainly makes this possible.The choreography is exquisite, mesmerizing and precise. Everyone is moving, and the scenes flow into each other as if it was one long continuous take. The photography is colorful and spellbinding. I was pleased that the cinematographer from Enter the Void (which is one of my favorite films) joined with Gaspar again. The dancers are remarkable for their talent, clothing (or lack thereof), fitness and freestyle movements. The camera goes above, close-up and spins round them, mimicking and enhancing their movements and energy. Members of the cast that are not professionals were culled from Paris night clubs and YouTube. The hypnotic, pulse quickening beats come from Cerrone, MARRS and Aphex Twin.

Legend," Volatile, Capricious, Impulsive, Real-life U.K. Gangsters
","When your mother wears all black to your wedding, you may be marrying the wrong person. Identical twins Reggie and Ronnie Kray rise up in the London underworld of the 1960s. The film is based on a true story. Ronnie is a loose cannon, passive/aggressive, volatile, capricious, impulsive and gay gangster. His greatest strength is also his most obvious weakness in that he speaks the truth and lets his feelings be known, just a bit too bluntly. Reggie is the more restrained and practical one, yet he also has a temper. It isn't a good idea to get either brother angry at you. When their tempers combine or collide, you'd better run.The film is narrated by Frances, Reggie's girlfriend. Tom Hardy performs as both Reggie and Ronnie. I love taking a look at the underworlds of any culture. The characters and settings are fascinating and all the more wonderful because they are real. English to English subtitles are needed however. Tom Hardy was amazing, yet he was overacting. There was too much emphasis placed on him when the other themes, stories and characters needed more attention.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," an enemy of an enemy is a friend
","At first glance Lisbeth and Mikael have nothing in common. The former is a shady tattooed young hacker with an explosive temper and the latter is a nerdy traditional journalist and family man with a penchant for jogging in the woods to ease a troubled mind. Despite their differences, Lisbeth and Mikael collide in more ways than one. As Mikael investigates an unsolved murder perpetrated 40 years ago in a remote northern town, he quickly wades in over his head. Lisbeth's skillset could be helpful to Mikael, but since cooperation isn't her style he had better hope there is truth to the old saying; an enemy of an enemy is a friend.Produced at a mere $13 million, the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo became a worldwide sensation which returned ten times that amount. It did a number of things right including turning the crime thriller genre on its head, frequent role reversals, unpredictability, compelling characters that hit rock bottom and claw their way back, casting the talented Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth, and more. There is depth without pretentiousness. Old school thrills come in modern packaging. Nothing is as it seems ('fair is foul and foul is fair, hover through the fog and filthy air,' - Macbeth). Intriguing themes include trusting instincts, redemption and determining the appropriate punishment for evil deeds. There are flashes of disturbing and brutal violence and rape.For the Brits it was the best film NOT in the English language. The Swedish version of the film is more authentic and realistic than the latter Hollywood adaptation. For one thing, Michael Nyqvist is more vulnerable and believable as Mikael than strapping Daniel Craig. The Hollywood version, despite such drawbacks, is still worthwhile as it includes interesting plot twists and is very stylish. The film is based on the novel by Stieg Larsson.",9,0,1,28 February 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," Tragically Beautiful
","A testament to the power of stories and animation artistry to move us about the horror and contagion of war and human indifference, and - just as strongly - the value of life.Incendiary bombs rain down on a Japanese city in a later stage of World War II, obliterating the home and town, and killing the mother, of young Seita and his little sister Setsuko. With their father in the navy and faraway, the pair travels with a few scavenged possessions to an aunt's house in the country. The aunt is mean, selfish and manipulative, so Seita and Setsuko - tired of the constant shaming - take their chances alone on the outskirts of town. There with the forest, ocean, meager savings, vegies pilfered from surrounding farmland, a can of fruit drops and the fireflies, they hope to stay positive and survive. The film is poignantly narrated by the ghost of Seita, who is lying in a train station near death at the beginning of the story. We follow the ghost to understand how he reached this point and see what happened to Setsuko. The narration does not spare details about wartime terrors; black rain in the aftermath of widespread incendiary burning, charred bodies and human indifference to suffering. Mercifully uplifting moments are likewise detailed; the strong bond between brother and sister, refuges of happiness and beauty amid the devastation, swimming in the sunlight dappled ocean and a sky full of fireflies. North American animation usually does not delve into such serious subjects, so it is especially hard-hitting. The film is based on a short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, but also the writer/director's own life experience. As a boy Takahata was almost killed during an air raid and fled from home with his sister. Takahata, co-founder of Studio Ghibli, died on April 5. Besides its dark aspects, the film inspires us to treasure moments with those we love, appreciate the beautiful things around us, and care for the less fortunate.",10,1,2,19 April 2018
The Artist," Technically a foreign film (hint; this one!) has won 'best picture' before
","George is a famous and widely adored actor in the silent-film era of the 1920s. He gives one of his fans, Peppy, a moment in the spotlight and it unexpectedly creates a path for her into stardom. As Peppy rises, George falls. He does not adjust to changing circumstances or new technology, and the advent of sound in film leaves him broke and alone. Peppy is the last person that still has faith in George and she reaches out to him, but he may be too far gone.Shot in black and white and virtually without the sound of anyone's voice, this alluring, unconventional and heartwarming film surprises and delights. Jean Dujardin (George), Berenice Bejo (Peppy), James Cromwell, John Goodman and Uggie (Jack Russell terrier), reveal the power of communicating without speaking. The Artist is a true gem. My girlfriend and I saw it before it was widely released. It felt then like the film was going to be as heartwarming for others as it was for us. Winner of five Oscars including best picture. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.I love Parasite and am overjoyed that it won best picture, especially because it is a foreign and independent film, but technically at least one foreign film won an Oscar for best picture before Parasite, right?! Hardly anyone talked in The Artist, so it really can't be said that it is an English language film. Perhaps it was not considered a foreign film because the setting was in California? In any case, The Artist is an amazing and daring film. It is daring because there are virtually no voices and is a throw-back to another era.",10,2,3,29 March 2020
Groundhog Day," 25th Anniversary!
","The day depends on how you look at it. This truth really sinks in for celebrity weather reporter Phil Connors in returning to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover Groundhog Day. Oddly enough, he wakes each morning at the same time and place as the morning before and, unlike everyone else, retains memories from the proceeding day. At first Phil, selfish and shallow, utilizes the new-found knowledge to take advantage of others; stealing the hearts of beautiful women and bags of money. Telling people what they want to hear, of which he has uncanny knowledge, works like a charm. This is until he attempts to woo Rita, the network producer. Phil works relentlessly to get into her head and appear to like everything she likes; French poetry, the piano, acting spontaneously, ice cream and kids, yet Rita is not so easily deceived. No matter what he does, she sees right through him. To win Rita's heart, Phil must change his own.In the 25 years since this film was released it has found a place in the American psyche. This feel good combination of comedy, fantasy and romance currently ranks #233, five places ahead of Jaws, on the widely used film database IMDb. This popularity has much to do with the film's valuable lessons regarding self-awareness and sincerity, and with the appealing star power of Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell (both are excellent here). Despite its simplicity and awful B-movie quality beginning, the film attains unexpected heights in spite of itself. This mirrors the path taken by the main character as well as the film's 25 year rise in cultural esteem. This was the first time I watched the film. Michael Shannon makes a surprising appearance.",8,1,1,24 January 2018
Sicario," Knife Cuts Both Ways
","'Nothing will make sense to your American eyes,' Kate Macer is told as she prepares to cross into Mexico with intelligence agency co- workers as well as mercenaries. Despite her ample intellect, fitness, good heart and sufficient experience, she begins to think this statement may be true. Explosions become implosions. Inflicted wounds cut just as deeply inside. On her 'team', the mercenaries may be more trustworthy. The people who sent Kate in harm's way, for reasons known only to themselves, may be no different from those who kill at will, and with impunity. In fact they may be worse.The film, nearly as good as its brilliant and brutal sister - Incendies, reveals the dark underworld and raw truths of the cross- border drug trade. There is profound depth here. Explosions are not merely physically happening on screen, they occur in the characters, in the twists and turns of the story and in shattering the preconceptions of viewers. It is a world where violence knows no distinction between the guilty and the innocent. It is one that will never be stopped by force. It is remarkable that any nation even tries. Emily Blunt, Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin enhance the story with wonderful performances. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival 2015.",10,3,8,8 November 2015
Pulp Fiction," play with matches and you get burned
","You may also be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams. Perhaps both. The very lucky and the very unlucky characters of Pulp Fiction experience such a roller coaster ride in the underworld of Southern California.Uncomfortable silences, philosophical hit men, foot massages, bible verses (Ezekiel 25:17), gourmet burgers, dance contests, furious vengeance, forgetful girlfriends, fixed boxing matches, pigs with personality and expensive milkshakes combine in this zany, violent, surprising, enthralling and quotable film. It is one of my favorites.One of the best things about Pulp Fiction is the intriguing and realistic conversations between characters. The banter is as natural, funny and fantastic as the characters themselves. It is like I was plopped right into real-life discussions. The soundtrack is wonderful too. It is as offbeat and eccentric as the film itself. Pulp Fiction helped my Brazilian friend Luiz Lourenço, who watched it with me, to learn English and - of course - experience a proper introduction to American culture. Samuel Jackson, Uma Thurman, John Travolta (for once in his life), Bruce Willis, Christopher Walken and Harvey Keitel are fantastic here. I had such a good time when I first watched it that I wished it wouldn't end.",10,0,1,14 October 2019
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Only the Smartest (or Dumbest) Survive!
","Stupidity can be a saving grace, for such an unfortunate state of mind causes the unexpected to happen (wisdom and foolishness are much alike, for both are indifferent to the opinions of the world). In the violent, testosterone laden underworld of London several unhinged, inexperienced and desperate characters tempt fate in this manner. They pool their resources and talents in the hope of winning a high stakes poker game. Of course, it does not go as planned and they find themselves at the mercy of thugs, bounty hunters, loan sharks, mobsters and other assorted wankers. Multiple people converge on a single target, and the smartest - or dumbest - will emerge from the fray.Guy Ritchie has a pulse on the dark humor, snarky characters and viciousness of the London underworld and it is fascinating and thrilling to behold. This low-budget first film brought him fame and comparisons to Tarantino. Insults fly as much as bullets. The soundtrack, including the Stone Roses, is quite good. I saw the film twice and liked it better the first time. Perhaps Ritchie films are losing the initial quirkiness and uniqueness that gave them luster? For Americans to try to get a grip on British English, subtitles are essential.",8,0,0,5 August 2018
The Shape of Water," Thrilling, Touching and Surreal Exploration of the Heart; Both Human and Monster
","To be seen and desired for who we truly are; it is the passionate wish of many. For Elisa, an unassuming and kind-hearted maid in a 1960s era government lab, this wish is granted in an unusual way. Virtually invisible and isolated, yet content in her little bubble, Elisa is lured from this comfort zone as she witnesses the arrival of a strange, monstrous sea creature in the lab. Despite warnings to keep her distance, Elisa sympathizes with the suffering creature. It is in chains and tortured by Strickland, a sadistic and violent government agent. This wild creature is impulsive. It responds to aggression with the same, and to kindness with kindness. As the cruelty of Strickland escalates, Elisa decides she must act to save the creature. Friendly and opposing forces emerge from unlikely places to help or hinder her. Love and light hinge on the erratic hearts of monsters and humans alike.This thrilling, touching and surreal film explores the many forms and aspects of monsters. The worst monster of them all is the human heart, and yet it is also the most kind and beautiful. The film offers apt encouragement to speak up and act when others are in trouble and in pain. In this world of rising fascists who peddle hatred and opposition to science, art, sympathy and basically to all humanity, such encouragement is sorely needed.With expressive eyes and strong empathy, Sally Hawkins is amazing and mesmerizing in her portrayal of Elisa. Michael Shannon is perfectly cast as the crude, cruel, sarcastic and controlling Strickland. In Strickland's sinful, selfish and negative world, the monster is better off dead. The supporting cast is wonderful. The film is full of depth and splendor. The Southern United States is the setting, yet the film was shot in Toronto. The theater that appears prominently on screen is the very same theater (the Elgin) in which I saw the film at the Toronto International Film Festival. I went into the theater with high hopes and was not disappointed.",10,67,137,23 September 2017
There Will Be Blood," Drilling in Human Hearts and Oil Fields
","Oil derricks in flames, ruthless and vicious human beings and spilled blood combine in the California oil fields of a hundred years ago. Daniel Plainfield, a self-made and hard-driving oil baron, and Eli Sunday, an unscrupulous and manipulative preacher, confront and antagonize each other over the course of decades. Both are unstable and hollow souls who expect and bring out the worst in others. Greed and avarice causes them to drill into human hearts as much as the vast oil fields in which they toil. Plainfield and Sunday clash in surprising and brutal ways until one of them discovers the limits to how deep a drill can go.Upton Sinclair, the author of the story on which this film is based, is likely turning in his grave in the realization that things have gone downhill since his time. 100 years ago when someone was accidentally clocked by a drill rig, Plainfield could dump the body in a tar pit and be done with them. These days Plainfield could strike again and not even need the cover of night to get rid of the body, just a Twitter account.The film is exquisite, impressive and ornate on many levels, especially the acting and cinematography. It racked up two Oscar wins for Daniel Day-Lewis' acting and for the cinematography, and it was nominated for six more. Daniel Day-Lewis is at his wicked best in portraying Plainfield. The cinematography is amazing for its startling beauty, composition and colors, oil derricks bursting into flames in the night for example, as well as the intriguing way it frames the characters. The photography tells an enthralling story beyond words and sound. The period clothing and elaborate sets are fascinating to behold. Such attention to detail makes even scenes of business negotiations appear alluring. The film is long, but because it is so good you don't notice the passage of time. An eerie yet intriguing soundtrack goes hand in hand with the disturbing characters, heartless actions and frequent severe beatings.",10,2,3,6 December 2017
The Wrestler," Craving the Roar of the Crowd
","The roar of the crowd is something that pro wrestler Randy 'the Ram' craves, but decades past his prime, it is not nearly enough to pay the bills. Evicted from a trailer home, working long hours at a grocery deli counter, alienated from relatives and addicted to expensive and lethal cocktails of synthetic hormones, pain killers, alcohol and blow, Randy has one foot in the grave. When the inevitable heart attack finally comes, the Ram is warned to avoid any strenuous activity. Remarkably, Randy takes in stride what to him should be a death sentence. He sets his mind up to make amends with his estranged daughter, woo the woman of his dreams (a kind-hearted stripper in denial), and give up the sport he loves. As the Ram, Randy endures severe beatings, razor blade cuts and staple gun wounds all over his body, among lesser evils, but the real world just might be tougher than this.A killer story, career-resurrecting performance by Mickey Rourke, and amazing support by Marisa Tomei (Randy's love interest), help make this film one of the most beloved sports films of all time. What happens to the Ram is as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking, for Randy is charming and likeable even as he wallows in well-deserved pain and ignominy. The film is colorful and beautiful in form, it flows well from one scene to the next, and each of the characters is recognizable, relevant, balanced, unpredictable and, unlike many sports films, closer to the all too human truth.",9,2,3,19 December 2018
Arrival," Stars Align, Enthralling and Memorable
","Alien spacecraft suddenly appear and hover menacingly over twelve locations around the world. A team near a spaceship in Montana composed of the U.S. military, scientists, other experts and, of course, ever helpful politicians, attempts to determine what the aliens want. Linguistics expert Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is part of the Montana team. It soon becomes apparent that the aliens are an extremely advanced culture and that they have a message for humanity. Whether that message is hostile or friendly, or can even be understood, is a matter of debate among countries and individuals. One loose cannon could bring an end to humanity.Villeneuve is one of my favorite directors. His film Incendies, one of the best I have ever seen, is a hard hitting and masterful piece on the tension between hate and empathy, force and choice, control and liberty. In Arrival, Villeneuve applies his signature style to the genre of science fiction.Arrival challenges the notion that advances in technology are always better than the fundamentals. This enthralling and potent film combines star power with amazing graphics, a gripping story, wonderful themes, a memorable conclusion, intriguing sound, compelling dialogue and of course a great director. All the stars align. There are fantastic twists and turns and, as always with Villeneuve, our perceptions are altered. In watching Arrival it is helpful to have an open mind and to suspend beliefs. Seen at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival.",10,4,12,22 October 2016
The Iron Giant," You Are Who You Choose to Be
","You are who you choose to be. Some sort of rocket falls from space along the Maine coast in 1957. A gigantic robot emerges and cuts a swath through the boreal forest on the way to a small town. It could be a weapon of the Soviets, a monster, an alien invader bent on destroying the earth, and more. When the iron giant encounters in its path a nine-year-old boy, Hogarth, it displays gentleness, keen intelligence and the innocence of a child. Hogarth is not the only one, of course, who knows about the robot. A fearful, negative and self-centered government agent attempts to corner the iron giant and triggers some adverse and alarming reactions. As the US Army responds, the robot and boy have only each other to turn to.While this animated feature is simple and straightforward in appearance, it carries a profound and touching message. There are many people who want you to live in a box they built for themselves, full of fear and negativity, yet we should decide for ourselves who we want to be. Even Superman or Superwoman are not out of reach, as the Iron Giant reveals. Brad Bird, one of the inspirations behind the rising Pixar Studio, reveals in this film why he is worth a damn. The film has depth, heart, soul and humor.",8,0,1,4 August 2019
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Whimsical & Charming
","Mr. Fox promises to settle down and help raise a family, but it conflicts with the truth he is trying to tell Mrs. Fox about himself. The truth is that a fox cannot be happy without a chicken in its teeth. A fox courts danger, hunts prey, outsmarts other predators and has thrilling adventures. This is what a fox is good at. The promise and truth collide as Mr. Fox returns to the wild, carefree days of youth. Worse yet, a trio of vengeful farmers threaten to wipe out an entire community of animals to catch a fox. The animals look to their individual strengths and differences in order to survive.This whimsical, charming and brilliant stop-motion feature is delightful from beginning to end. Each frame is a treasure in terms of artistry, revelations of human (and wild animal) nature, intriguing themes and characters, wry humor, compelling stories and more. There is more going on than appears on the surface. The conflicts are as interesting and revealing as the resolutions. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson give voice and life to Roald Dahl's characters. 'It is always more fun,' says a wiser fox 'when we did it together.'",9,0,0,4 December 2019
Son of Saul," At once awful and beautiful
","The Sonderkommando, the 'bearers of secrets,' work between the living and the dead in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Saul Auslander is one among them. He carries bodies, washes blood from gas chamber floors and shepherds the living into flames. He is cold as death himself. Yet something snaps inside him and awakens his heart. Despite being gassed and discarded beneath a heap of bodies, a boy briefly clings to life. Saul, roused to some kind of higher purpose, attempts superhuman feats in order for a Kaddish, a proper funeral rite, to be performed so this boy might have eternal life.At once awful and beautiful. The Holocaust is portrayed in an atypical manner that is up-close and revealing in all its terror and malevolence, yet at the same time the plot and characters are inscrutable and mysterious as the human heart. Camera angles heighten the intensity and impact of the film. The camera is often face to face with Saul. It follows him around the camp, as he collects belongings from the dead, into groves of poplars to attempt an escape and to the river to shovel away the ashes. The adept acting, editing, directing, story and scenes kept me on the edge of my seat during the length of the film. Winner of the Grand Prix at Cannes and at this very moment won an Oscar for best foreign language film.",9,4,10,28 February 2016
Gladiator," Maximus, Maximus, . . !!
","There is always something left to fight. We survive if we stay together. A naturally talented, tough and good man from Roman times - a general and gladiator - fights in the service of this notion.Roman general Maximus has everything going for him. A long campaign is coming to a victorious end, the emperor adores him like a son, and he is returning home to his wife and boy. However, the emperor has one more task in mind for Maximus. The trustworthy and widely revered general is tapped to fight corruption in the capital. The plan quickly goes awry when the emperor's preternaturally ambitious and demented son Commodus seizes power by foul play and condemns Maximus to death. Through talent and luck the general eludes an untimely demise, but his family and fortunes do not. The severely wounded and destitute Maximus is captured by slavers and sent to die a second time in the gladiator arena. With a thirst for revenge fueling him, Maximus works to reinvent himself, reclaim his inherent power, and resume the epic battle with Commodus for the heart of Rome and its people.Gladiator brings the Roman empire as well as the art of storytelling alive. Right out of the gate Gladiator held me in thrall with its eerily entrancing melody and realistic, flashy battle scene. The story and themes of Gladiator are immensely satisfying. It is hard to believe a world leader had no empathy and cared more for their ambition and image than for people, but it happened! The characters, sequences and costumes are authentic and extraordinary. The characters are cast so well with Russell Crowe (a man's man as Maximus), Joaquin Phoenix (truly bonkers, unempathetic and frightening as Commodus, who can forget his terrifying line 'am I not merciful?!'), Connie Nielsen (intoxicating Lucilla, a master political strategist, sister to Commodus and love interest for Maximus), and others including Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. With seamless transitions and organization, great writing, experienced direction, resplendent photography, innovative techniques, and captivating action scenes, Gladiator fires on all cylinders. Except I wish it was darker and more daring than its PG rating standard. The fascinating models of Rome combined with dazzling special effects made me feel like I was flying over the ancient city like a modern drone. Encouraged by the film, I went to Rome, toured the colosseum and explored some of its many amazing stories from history and the present.Haters point out that Gladiator takes many liberties with the historical truth, but the film gets the essentials right. If I see a bird in the wild, I do like to know facts about it, but more important is seeing and understanding the bird's character, realizing its beauty, and viewing the bird in the context of larger truths. While keeping with the true flavor to the era, Gladiator - as any good story does - makes us care for more important things than the design of someone's sandals or the exact words they uttered.Are you not entertained?! Apparently, we were. Gladiator won five academy awards for best picture, actor, costumes, sound and effects. Join the chant with the 50,000 and the Roman elite in the gladiator ring 'Maximus, Maximus, Maximus!'",10,0,1,5 May 2020
Princess Mononoke," We cannot change fate, but we can rise to meet it.
","Something is wrong. A shapeless rage and powerful demon appears on the outskirts of a small village. Animals as well as humans are poisoned and cursed at its touch. Ashitaka, a perceptive and valiant young man and peacemaker who is wise beyond his years, recognizes that this demon is blinded by its own agony. He attempts to quiet its rage and direct the sinister power away from the village. Despite his efforts and care to avoid the demon, and his success at saving the village, Ashitaka is touched by the curse. The village oracle encourages him to journey with unclouded eyes and open mind to the source of the demon's rage - a distant forest - where Ashitaka may be able to find a way to lift the curse. The journey takes Ashitaka to an ironworks encroaching on the forest, where people, animals and demons are at war with each other, and with themselves. As Ashitaka looks for a way to lift the curse and keep from harm, he uncovers secrets of the place and characters. This includes a mysterious and beautiful young princess allied with the wolves; Mononoke.Twenty years ago, in Georgetown, a Japanese embassy sponsored advertisement of the film caught my eye. I encouraged my fiancé to come. It was our first Miyazaki film and I was stunned by its insight, wisdom, artistry and beauty. It touched on some of my basic beliefs about human nature, love and the environment. A recent trip to Japan and the remote island of Yakushima (used as a model for scenes in the film) deepened my appreciation for Princess Mononoke.The artistic beauty is timeless and dazzling to the senses. Mist rises from the mountains and ancient forests of gigantic cedars. Rainstorms, shadows, clouds and rivers appear to rush over you as they pass on screen. The landscape character is revealed in the variable light of the sun and moon. The incredible attention to detail is evident in eyes that sparkle in the night, light and ripples on water, wind on grass, haunting bird songs, different shades of stone, the flash of gunpowder and a night sky filled with stars.There is incredible complexity to the characters; female and male, animal and human, earth and supernatural. This complexity is heightened by immersion in the Japanese culture wherein spirits and demons take human or animal form, or something in between - or even beyond - both. Twenty years ago, I ruminated about my fiancé and wondered what characteristics she shared with the fascinatingly intricate, attractive, stylish and spirited female characters. Mononoke and Lady Eboshi, both willful, fearless and independent, deftly navigate the male oriented world. The two are separated by belief. Eboshi is realistic. 'We have more to fear from ourselves than from demons or monsters,' she wisely maintains. Mononoke is idealistic about the forest and, of course, wolves. Ashitaka, the peacemaker, is respectful and observant of others. He has the admirable ability to see through the eyes of strangers and understand how they feel. Tough and vulnerable at the same time, he helps others and shrugs off aggression.There are so many bits of wisdom scattered throughout the film and in surprising places. One important and recurring theme is the precarious balance of the natural world and our relationships to others. We are connected to the environment and others in all we do, and this film underscores this point. Destruction and violence just create more hatred. The film pushes us to be non-judgmental and hopeful like Ashitaka. New life is always on the threshold and within reach, if we allow it. We may not know what form it takes, but we must leave space for it to grow. We are alive, and we have each other. The film dialogue is delightfully intricate and unpredictable. The competing interests, changing circumstances and shifting balances of life are skillfully portrayed. We cannot change fate, but we can rise to meet it.The story is based in a time when Japan, 150 years ago, was suddenly transforming from the ancient ways, to iron, gunpowder and other technologies and beliefs. Listening to the film in Japanese, with English subtitles, adds another wonderful dimension to the film. One of my favorite films ever.",10,1,1,25 June 2017
