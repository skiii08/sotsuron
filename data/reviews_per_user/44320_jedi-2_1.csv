Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," THE BEST FILM OF THE 20TH CENTURY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I am one of the biggest fans of Star Wars.  I really mean it, Star Wars can do no wrong, in any way, shape or form.  The Phantom Menace is by far the biggest and best in the series so far.  It is an important film in the series for it sets up the events in the next five films of the series, and it pulls this off wonderfully.  Contrary to popular opinion, the story is not weak, in fact it is the strongest so far.  Finally, we get a little background in the origin of the Force and of how the Jedi are chosen. There is political corruption, even though non die hard fans will miss this plot point.  This is a film for the fans, not the critics or people who only give Star Wars a passing gaze.  The effects, while in abundance, do not distract from the story and the action.  The digital characters are in a word, amazing.  You really feel that Jar Jar and Watto are right there with the human characters.  The only loose link is Jake Lloyd.  While he does pull off the role of idealistic 9 year old boy quite well, his deliverance of some of the dialogue (Yipee!!) leaves much to be desired.  He is to this installment what Mark Hamill was to the original films.  But if you're only concern is the acting, go watch a Jane Austin movie.  This film was fantastic.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
