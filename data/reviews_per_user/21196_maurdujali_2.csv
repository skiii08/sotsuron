Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Fusing Fiction and a real life historical figure is amazing, great work.
","I definitely enjoyed it. To fuse fiction and History is ingenuity... the creators and their artistry is great, they put hard work into this. It is all worth it.It keeps viewers thinking...and at the edge of their seats! The civil war as a backdrop is educating. A bit heart wrenching as well. A great piece.",6,0,1,11 April 2017
Ip Man," A Reveting film about Martial Arts, A history of two Iconic Men stunningly---retold
","The story telling set in China, gives the viewer a Glimpse of Chinese Culture and Kung Fu a Nostalgic trip along the streets of China. Spine tingling with the appearance of the Young Bruce Lee, makes a Martial Arts fan sigh. An educational film for Martial Arts practitioners, and Actors. The film is Enigmatic.",9,0,0,12 April 2017
