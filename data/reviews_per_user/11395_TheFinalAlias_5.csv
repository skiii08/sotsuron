The Blair Witch Project," If only negative ratings were possible.....
","As anyone who has read my reviews for any length of time knows, I don't kiss ass when it comes to independent films. If it's a good film; I rate it accordingly, if it's a bad film; I do likewise. However....It's become one of my pet peeves that indie film fans demand that EVERY independent film be called nothing short of a masterpiece no matter how mundane it is, no compromise. It's this mentality that has resulted in my extreme dislike of indie films and their fans and filmmakers. Honestly; just because something was made without studio assistance and/or interference DOES NOT automatically make it a masterpiece, any more than having the hot new centerfold of-the-month makes the next Michael Bay film an Oscar contender. Yet, still the indie zombies insist that it does, supposedly this mentality comes from resenting Hollywood's excesses, such as taking away artistic control, bloated budgets, inattention to casting appropriate actors in favor of popular ones, and worst of all; annoying marketing campaigns. What BS.Indie films are guilty of many hypocrisies; but attacking marketing campaigns is their biggest; as endless marketing hype(along with pure stupidity)is the only reason anyone would have seen this clunker I'm currently reviewing.I can recall, quite vividly; the endless pop-up ads, the fan sites; official and(supposedly)unofficial, magazine articles, TV. specials, the merchandise, the relentless TV. commercials. Whew. The people who complain about the 'Dark Knight's marketing campaign just plain weren't ALIVE to not know the extent of this films marketing(which makes sense; since 99.9% of all the negative TDK reviews I've seen couldn't have been written by someone older than 5 or 8). TDK had NOTHING on this film's relentless marketing campaign.Trashing Hollywood for over hyping their products, then doing the same: that's the definition of hypocrisy. That alone would be justification enough to dislike TBWP and it's indie film moron cult and to call them hypocritical and give the film a 1 rating, even if it was a good movie, even if I had liked it.The fact that it also sucked as a film anyway just justifies my rating.The common defense is that this is some brilliant 'art-film' which introduced the concept of not showing the monster and leaving it to the imagination. BS. Val Lewton did the same thing a thousand times better during the '40's, with films which are classics of the genre: 'Cat People', 'The Seventh Victim'. etc. and in 1963; probably the best of all 'unseen' horror films; Robert Wise(a disciple of Lewton)'s 'The Haunting' was released; to borrow an indie film fan phrase: it PWNED 'Blair Witch'. All classics, all achieving their suspense without showing the monster. All before this film.But indie fans ignore all this; they claim those movies don't count because they are old and in black & white. Typical response from them, no respect for older film.As for the 'story' of this film and it's qualities; I wouldn't even give it a D if it was a student film. The device of not showing the monster comes off less as an artistic choice and more an excuse to film nothing but a couple of dumb-asses running around and passing it off as a film. I'll admit it's clever, heck, even Lewton originally adopted the device out of necessity, but he did it mostly because he recognized it's dramatic potential in the face of several alternatives. For the record, it is also a complete and utter rip-off of a much better film called 'The Last Broadcast', the difference being that there is a survivor. Really, otherwise it's the same damn thing, and it's the indie film fans who call Hollywood unoriginal(If only I could use the eye-roll emoticon).The story also sucks, 'Cannibal Holocaust' did the 'found footage' thing much better. The 'acting' is also awful; it's so forced you wonder if the witch is a legitimate legend even in the context of the story. The praise for characterization is true, though. I definitely felt something about the characters: I wanted all 3 of them dead within a minute. And even if, pray tell, the device of not showing the monster WAS original, or had been used well; does it REALLY matter if it's an awful film otherwise? Nope. At best, it just revives a long-dead gimmick.And for all the people who say it must be good because so many people thought it was real, let me ask you something: Have you ever heard the phrase 'Idiots will believe anything'? Grow up and watch some atmospheric, 'unseen' horror films that are actually good. This is no different than your usual incredibly stupid, vapid Hollywood slasher flick with annoying teenage victims, only without a slasher and not made by Hollywood, but still incredibly stupid , vapid and filled with annoying teenage victims.~",1,99,188,20 April 2009
Public Enemies," Extraordinary entertainment, but don't expect historical accuracy.
","If there's one thing I'm sick of, it's unwarranted hatred of the US. and it's art. But for once, I have to agree with the country's detractors overseas; for there is one accusation they often level at American cinema that is entirely true; and that is the American media's torrid, passionate, on & off love affair with Crime and the People who Commit It.It's true. We turn our criminals into celebrities, and our lawmen likewise. The film I am now reviewing 'Public Enemies' is just one in a long line of films focusing on the lives of criminals, and I suspect, is going to be one of the most hotly debated in years to come.A common accusation that is made against this film is that it glorifies crime; but surprisingly, that is only half-true. Yes, it is clear that the criminals are the 'heroes' of the story, and that our sympathies should lie with them. This is apparent in the very first scene; when the camera zeros in on prison inmates marching solemnly like men in a concentration camp, with very gestapo like guards standing around menacingly. It could easily be a scene from a Holocaust flick. The subsequent escape is certainly made out to be thrilling, heroic and to look ingenious in it's execution.Yet, the film doesn't make the actual ROBBERIES of protagonist John Dillinger(Johnny Depp) out to be heroic, they are not stylized, and a scene where Dillinger threatens a clerk with ending up either a 'Live coward or a Dead hero' if he does not withdraw the money from a vault could just as easily be taken from a film where Dillinger was portrayed as the villain. So, to put it mildly, the film may glamorize criminals, but it does not do the same for their crimes. And thankfully, it doesn't make the police hunting Dillinger any more sympathetic. That approach is a sign that the film has one thing, guts: Criminals or Law Enforcers; the film emphasizes that both 'jobs' are a brutal and bloody business, this comes out best in a comparison between the ruthless George 'Baby Face' Nelson, and a brutal officer who beats Dillinger's woman.As a film itself, the film makes up for it's historical inaccuracy(which still is enough to make me detract 2 stars since this is based off of real occurrences where real people died)by being easily the most entertaining film in years. Now I may have seen the film with only two men in the audience(One of them an apparent Bum who also shows up in my 'Delgo' review), but we all thoroughly, visibly enjoyed it. The film doesn't rely on any crap like sepia tones to make the film look 'old', and most of the performances are great. It goes without saying that Depp gives the best performance in the film, but I'd also like to point out that it's easily his best performance in years. Dillinger has to be the most likable criminal in a film I've seen since the days of Cagney.The most controversial performance, however, is from Christian Bale as Melvin Purviss. For as much flack as Bale takes; he gives what could be the most meticulously crafted performance of his career when Purviss could have been a pale imitation of Bruce Wayne. He genuinely is so convincing that I did not see Bale in the role at all; I saw Purviss. His performance is the embodiment of brilliant understatement. He successfully imitates every aspect of Purviss from existing footage so well that Purviss's FAMILY has even praised him for the role(Which should be the final word on the performance, period.). His imitation of Purviss's faltering, stilted accent may not seem as entertaining as Depp's velvet voice, but it is a PERFORMANCE, no question. And the limited screen time he and Depp have together, is nothing short of electric. I mentioned how everyone in the theater made their enjoyment clear, but everyone was in dead silence during the brief confrontation. Such a pity they did not have more screen time. Those small scenes have me convinced that Depp is the only choice for playing the Joker in a future Batman film. The ability for a scene to have such power with such little dialog just demands it. And as with all great performances of lawmen who are the antagonists in a film with criminal heroes(Tommy Lee Jones in 'the Fugitive', Patrick Allen in 'Captain Clegg'), one would not mind seeing him as the protagonist in his own film.All of the other actors range from good to decent, and are all convincing, and even if much of the dialog delivery is bad, it's delivered with force, which shows that at least everyone involved TRIED, and that's more than I can say for a lot of films these days.So disregard the historical inaccuracy, bad reviews, and go and enjoy a highly entertaining, if flawed film. It's certainly the best crime epic in recent years.~",8,9,15,20 July 2009
Drag Me to Hell," A fairly decent return to the genre, but don't believe the hype....
","While certainly making up for the horrible botch that was 'Spiderman 3', Sam Raimi's return to the genre really cannot compete with his earlier horror films; the 'Evil Dead' trilogy and arguably 'Darkman'. This is not however, for reasons you may think.The most common complaint is that the film's PG-13 rating is what ruins it's impact, but this isn't necessarily true, as the rating's system seems to have treated Raimi fairly liberally in piling on the gore and guts. The flaws of the film simply come from shakiness on Raimi's part in returning to the genre which made him famous.For one thing, the film relies too much on 'jump' sequences and 'buses' which kill suspense. Clearly, a film called 'Drag me to Hell' is not going to be a masterpiece of subtlety and what 'subtle horror' originator Val Lewton called 'The Power of Suggestion'(Sorry, 'Blair Witch' idiots, it was Lewton who beat your stupid movie to the punch by 5 decades by just suggesting the monster.), but it just makes the film weak when the big scares are finally packed on, and this is not because of ratings restraint; as the monsters and possession scenes are quite heavy-handed. It's just that they lose so much impact. To put it simply; the film just doesn't know when to stop when it should.Speaking of Val Lewton, this film owes a considerable debt, plot-wise to a film made by his greatest pupil; Jacque Tourneur. The film in question is 'Night/Curse of the Demon'(1957), an adaption of an M.R. James story 'Casting the Runes'. This film even includes several homages to that film in a spectacular séance sequence, and even ends at a train station like the original. Anyone who has seen 'Curse' will find themselves all too familiar with the story, but, hey, it's better than a remake.The film also succeeds at giving it's characters believable motivations and flaws that makes them seem genuine in spite of the occasionally weak dialog. Even the villain has believable motivations without becoming sympathetic. The film also looks great, eschewing the 'Se7en'-inspired look so overused in modern horror films. Raimi's trademark insane camera angles also create some memorable scenes, particularly when the heroine begins contemplating giving a cursed object to escape her curse by drumming her fingers in a manner similar to that of the Hag who cursed her; who is introduced drumming her fingers. As if she's becoming as bad as the hag was. Great symbolism. The acting is also good. Lead's Alison Lohman and Justin Long both have a befuddled look that makes it all the more believable. The Seer character's are also great.The film also has a good amount of humor in it, if nothing on the scale of the 'Evil Dead' films, nothing laugh out loud funny, but wryly amusing in a gross-out sort-of-way. There's also a scene guaranteed to offend animal lovers everywhere. The final 'Confrontation' in a graveyard should delight every horror fan. And the ending, while predictable, is amazingly effective.It may not be saying much, but this is easily one of the best horror films in a LOOOONG time. With Raimi back on track, the results for his future films(and for the genre) will certainly be worth seeing. Enjoy.~",7,8,16,29 May 2009
A Clockwork Orange," A black comedy so black some will not see the comedy....
","I find it bizarre how so many great films from spat upon genres like horror and costumed heroes receive such vitriol from critics who enjoy BAD films in those categories but despise good ones, alway's their pathetic answer is the same: 'OMG The 'BATMAN & ROBIN' IZ BETTER DEN The 'DARK KNIGHT' BEKUZ IT DUZNT TAEK ITSELF SERIOUSLY LOL!' I fail to understand that argument. It's fine for a director to have a sense of humor and not be obnoxious about his craft, but there's a difference between having fun and not giving any effort by goofing off. Would you give some lazy student who sleeps through class who always comes in high and writes 'F- you' on a test as an answer an A+ because he doesn't take school seriously? If you give bad films like 'Batman & Robin' good ratings over 'The Dark Knight' because they 'Aren't serious' you are essentially doing the same thing. This filthy minded Liberal mentality has infected all aspects of film, with many excellent directors taking flack for the serious thematic content in their films.Chief among these persecuted directors is the once-vaunted Stanley Kubrick, whose name is now used by these indie film fans and liberal canker sores as slang for 'pretentious' or 'overrated' or 'Taking himself too seriously'(one truly bizarre troll who sees the untalented Jason Friedberg as superior to Kubrick who I insulted sent me a string of hate mail telling me to orally pleasure him for weeks, that sums up the level of maturity of these people). What these disgusting people forget, however, is Kubrick's amazing range. He has directed romantic films, horror films, science fiction films, period melodramas, war films, but also comedies. Not only is he responsible for the famous comedy/satire 'Dr. Strangelove'(Which I will review along with another, more blatant comedy I feel is a spiritual descendant of 'Strangelove'), he has also infused even his grimmest films with humor('Full metal Jacket' has lots of black comedy in the suffering of 'Gomer Pyle' and in the Drill Seargent's over-the-top insults, and the famous 'Here's Johnny' sequence in 'The Shining'), but 'A Clockwork Orange' is perhaps his most biting speculative satire, and like I said, it's so grim many will fail to see the comedy.The plot is simple, an obnoxious but intellectual young gang leader named Alex(Malcom McDowell in what is easily his best performance)commits the vilest of deeds, is betrayed by his cronies who are sick of his tyranny, and volunteers for a reformative treatment which makes things worse than before. And it encompasses all spectrum's of comedy, from slapstick, sexual innuendo, irony and social satire. The wonky imagery, along with it's bizarre but blatant sexual overtones, ridiculous outfits and classical music score smacks not of a Kubrick film, but a Ken Russel film on drugs. Alex isn't really that different than cartoon character's like Woody Woodpecker, Bugs Bunny, and in some cases Mickey Mouse, or silent comedians like Chaplin's Tramp. He antagonizes people in a stylized manner, makes a bunch of dumb cracks then suffers last minute. There's a big difference, though. Here, we SEE and FEEL him pay for his crimes, and are forced to consider what we as an audience have accepted and voyeuristicly participated in, and makes us feel guilty. If that was Kubrick's only purpose, the film would still be a masterpiece, but it's just his secondary purpose.He explores just what happens when Alex is subjected to a 'cure' that will rob him of his violent impulses. It does rob him of his negative impulses, but it fails to make him 'good' so much as unresponsive, even when he needs those impulses. It also stops him from engaging in the only loves in his life that AREN'T destructive; his love of 'Ludwig Van', his neglected and manipulated, but still beloved parents and his pet snake(Symbolically representing his now circumcised manhood). For all of his crimes, his suffering is genuinely heartbreaking, AND WE STILL FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT, since Alex is a character that we should have no reason to feel sorry for, but do anyway. One minute we are forced to be disgusted with liking him, then disgusted that we ever hated him. Brilliant, manipulative, but brilliant.Beyond that, the film poses the disturbing question about 'reform' programs: If it is unjust to rob someone as disgusting and deserving of punishment as Alex of his free will, then how much worse is it to subject lesser criminals or the mentally ill to such treatment? In real life, those lesser criminals or the mentally ill would be subjected to such treatment, and someone like Alex wouldn't get the chance, thus meaning that the truly innocent suffer even MORE undeservedly than the guilty. And then there's the implication that it all comes undone and that Alex returns to his old ways. So that means that in real life, lesser criminals would suffer FOR NOTHING.What a brilliant question to pose: If the guilty don't deserve it, who does? It's all a balancing act, social commentary, satire, horror, humor, but Kubrick makes it all work, and doesn't 'Take himself too seriously' for a second of it, unless you consider a rape scored to 'Singin' in the Rain' and women eager for an orgy sucking on phallic-shaped lollipops to be reverent and conservative and stuffy.Try and make a film as rich as that, 'Care-free filmmakers'. I dare you.~",9,16,28,11 July 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Pretty damn good for what it is.
","I had mixed feelings about this one, but wouldn't you know it? I liked it. Sometimes great fictional characters deserve a revamp. I'm not saying go and do some 'hip' revamp of every famous fictional character, like say, make Captain Ahab into some bad-ass space marine with a cybernetic leg who fights alien whales in space or something like that, but sometimes reinterpretations can work. I can safely say that 'Sherlock Holmes' is one of them.Here, the roles of Watson & Holmes are reversed. Traditionally, Holmes is a no-nonsense, nearly emotionless man who ruthlessly conforms, and demands conformity despite his many eccentricities, while Dr. Watson is a warm, emotional reader/audience identification figure who, despite his intelligence, comes off as an idiot compared to the brilliant Holmes and frequently makes the mistake of simply being human. Here, Holmes is the audience identification figure who makes mistakes, gives into his emotions(sexual and otherwise)and is looked on as a fish-out-of-water, while Watson is a stuffy, conservative man trying to lead a normal life who takes things way too seriously. It's an interesting twist, and thankfully obeys the golden rule of revamps: It does not in any way destroy the essential integrity of the characters. One could even say this version fleshes them out a bit. Robert Downey Jr. is an odd choice to play Holmes, but he handles the role well. My only complaint is that he never gets to wear Holmes's famous Inverness cape and deerstalker hat, although I'm sure this was an intentional move on the filmmakers part.There are however, several flaws in the film's setup. For what is supposed to be an introduction, the film already feels like the umpteenth entry in a series, and makes the audience feel as if they missed a previous installment. This could be seen as either a good or a bad thing. Holmes and his supporting cast is so well-known that treating them as typical character archetypes(buddy cops, obnoxious boss, heroine on the wrong side of the law, depraved nobleman, hulking henchman, unseen criminal mastermind)keeps them from becoming caricatures, but it also keeps them from feeling like real, multi-faceted characters unique to their world; One could easily rewrite the film to be about James Bond or Batman. That is the film's biggest flaw, but it was easily overlook-able. And considering how stupidly most modern film-goers react to more complex and introspective characterizations(Christ, look at the bad reception 'Tropic Thunder', 'The Dark Knight', and 'Watchmen' got for their bizarre, satirical, nontraditional, or deconstructive looks at stereotypical characters), maybe this is a good thing.I also have to give the film props for it's sets and atmosphere. The setting really does feel like Victorian London in all it's filthy, poverty-stricken glory. I also liked the old-fashioned look of some of the gadgetry, and the huge French henchman was pretty cool. For some reason, his big ears, crooked nose and grimacing brow remind me of Rondo Hatton as 'The Creeper', a supporting villain from the 1944 Universal Sherlock Holmes film 'Pearl of Death'. If that was an intentional reference, nice touch.'Holmes' isn't perfect, but as an introduction to the character for a new generation, I have to say that it's the best I could have hoped for.~",8,8,17,29 December 2009
