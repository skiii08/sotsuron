Come and See," Best War Film Ever Made
","Come and See is what I would like to describe as a complete cinematic experience. Klimov has made a movie where every one of your senses is incorporated. You literally feel as if you are the character of Floyra. This film has you experience the true shock and horror through Floyra as he discovers the reality of war. And in the moments where you tell yourself that this is just a movie, in an attempt to make yourself feel more comfortable about what you are seeing, Klimov has a way of reminding you that this is real. For Klimov, as someone who lived through the war himself, this was a movie that he needed to make. I believe that any film maker that is so passionate about a film being made, along with Klimov's unbelievable talent as a film maker, makes this film even more outstanding.",10,1,1,17 December 2011
