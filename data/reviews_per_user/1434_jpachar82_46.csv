The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," If we burn, you burn
","'This is the start of how it all ends. They used to shout my name, now they whisper it. I'm speeding up and this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart.' The war has begun, the rebellion has started, the fire is ignited, the Mockingjay lives. Katniss Everdeen, the girl from District 12 survives the arena, unbeknowest to the Capitol and President Snow. Now she must fight and fight she must. But all is still not right. She now has to rescue the one she loves and he is being held captive and tortured by Snow and used as a weapon to get the rebels to cease fire and relinquish their rights as rightful citizens of Panem, according to President Snow.This movie defied all odds. Since 2008, our eyes were opened to the girl from District 12, and then she caught fire and now she is the rebel leader who will bring down the Capitol and their wicked ways.I was one of the select few who saw this movie as part of a marathon leading up to this movie. I was stunned and floored. Nothing will ever compare to this movie. The song that leads this movie is a perfect match to spark that yellow flicker beat.The cast and the crew – you were heartbreakingly incredible – Jennifer Lawrence, you stun us every time you grace the screen; Josh Hutcherson, you gave the best performance to date – Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Julianne Moore – you are my favorite, but the prize would have to go to the game maker on this one, Phillip Seymour Hoffman – you are the definition of the cinema, you have given your best performances from Capote to The Talented Mr. Ripley to Doubt to Catching through Mockingjay, Part 2 – this is one is for you.Thank you Suzanne Collins for allowing us to dive in to your world of this Utopian universe. You have given us something to believe in and this ourselves and to spark that flame in our hearts.Now, what will happen to Peeta? What will Katniss do? Will President Snow live or be executed for his crimes? All these and questions and more will be answered in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 on November 20, 2015.",10,26,65,21 November 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Return to the High Seas
","Eight years ago we were introduced to a scallywag, a pirate of sorts, a pirate by trade – Captain Jack Sparrow. Who would have thought that a big-time attraction from Disneyland & Disney World could spark a dynamite in the hearts of moviegoers? Gore Verbinski took that risk and the torch was passed down to a man who directed musicals and what not – Rob Marshall. Well, I say, way to go Rob. You have done the crew a very BIG debt of gratitude. You took the reins and you shook them hard to make this movie the best of the 4. The cast – Geoffrey Rush, Ian McShane (thank you for portraying Blackbeard the way it was supposed to be played), the beautiful and talented Penelope Cruz and most importantly the man who needs no introduction the man who played Edward Scissorhands, the man who played Willy Wonka, the 21 Jump Street actor from all those years ago to a rising star and a beloved actor – the incredible Johnny Depp. From the story line, to the special effects, to the great music (Hans Zimmer, again you have proved your worth.) I give this movie a resounding and magnifying ARRRRRGGGGH!!!!! (a 10).",10,1,2,20 May 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," 4 years spanning
","On November 21, 2008, we were introduced to a whole new world of the supernatural – vampires and the occasional love between a vampire and a mortal. Then the real battle began on November 20, 2009, when the were-wolves came out of the bag, literally and the ever-so-much killing spree of a notorious vampire who was determined to kill the mortal for beheading her mate. Then on June 30, 2010, that same vampire – Victoria, created an army to wipe the Cullen clan off the face of the earth and the supernatural world, but in the end death would meet her in the afterlife as she herself becomes ash and dust. Now we come to November 18, 2011, where the epic battle between what is right and what will be will come to an epic end in Part 1 of the 2-part phenomenal and mesmerizing conclusion to the story of a love that will last into eternity. It all started with a longing, and it will end in happiness. To the creator – Stephanie Meyer, thank you so much for an incredible journey of love, passion and heart – you have given us something that we can cherish for the rest of our lives.",10,7,20,18 November 2011
Iron Man 3," An Adventurous Continuation(retracted)
","In 2008, we were re-introduced to a comic book that we grew up as kids reading – Iron Man. But this time, an epic adventure that gave us a lesson in identity. An identity of sorts, an identity of personal growth. But the enemy was within the ranks of the inner circle – a friend betrays a friend. In 2010, that identity continues but in a whole new way, the billionaire playboy Tony Stark continues his quest to rid the world of evil and mass destruction. But the enemy grows – and there is only one way to destroy it – an enemy from the Russian federation, an enemy with a grudge.In 2013 – it all comes to an epic conclusion – as we see in this final installment in this franchise – we see our hero as he faces something more terrifying than Obadiah Stane, more menacing than Whiplash, a firey Mandarin – this is no ordinary villain it brings out the worst in our hero and yet he begins to unravel before our eyes. What's next for our hero? Will he be back? Or is this the endThis trilogy could not happen without the greatest actor of our generation – an actor who brought us to our knees in WonderBoys and created chemistry with Ally McBeal – Robert Downey, Jr. And an actress who loves to country croon and scream – Gwyneth Paltrow. To the villains – Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, Sir Ben Kingsley & Guy Pearce, - could there be more evil for Iron Man to fight? The 2 directors that brought all the drama, romance and yea – the sense of adventure – Jon Favreau and Shane Black, does Shane Black return or will Jon Favreau helm the 4th installment? All we know is that there is an..IRON MAN 4 in the works.THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,26,44,4 May 2013
Captain Marvel," Mistaken Identity
","Identity erased. Mistaken Identity. Superhuman identity. Or should I say - superhero identity. Yes, you heard it here folks, a super human hero identity. So what would you do if you were taken into another world and have your human identity erased completely and given a new identity? You would probably flip out. That is v what happened to Carol Danvers.Created in December of 1967 and (possibly born in March of 1968), Carol Danvers a.k.a. Captain Marvel or Mar-Vell has to come to terms with who she really is and save both not only the earth but a race of aliens from the very people that, Marvel thought were her own family. Now, I will say this - Brie Larson- rocked the main title role to the letter. I have never heard of Captain Marvel until I heard they were making this movie.Something else though, at the very beginning of the movie, the regular characters were not in the original scroll through, someone very special was in that place, with all the cameos and all the hours of writing comics over the last several centuries- Stan Lee - has given us so many characters that we can all relate to.Going back to the movie, Anna Bolden and Ryan Fleck did a super human job in the director chair. They both defied the odds and gave us something that we can long for: an identity that we can all relate to. From Brie Larson to the most ever beautiful amazing Annette Bening, to the ever busy and talented Jude Law and with a cast of people, this movie has given us all an identity that we can live for.So, 2 questions remain, if you have not seen the mid-credits scene and post-credit scenes then you will need to stop reading this review because this movie sets up where Avengers: Infinity War ends and the last of the Marvel movies comes to an end with Avengers: Endgame begins. Oh, and um, how did they get their hands on the Tesseract? We shall see",10,6,17,27 April 2019
Iron Man 2," I think not!!!
","The old saying goes that when people retire, they don't come back head strong. I disapprove very strongly whoever said that. When Iron Man come on the scene in 2008 as a remake of the original comic book, I said it wouldn't last. I was completely, out-of-my-freaking-mind, THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!!! I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!",9,2,2,11 December 2010
The Hunger Games," May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor
","'May the odds be ever in your favor.' The Hunger Games is not just a movie of action and romance – it is a movie about survival of the fittest. The Hunger Games is about who can outwit the others. The Hunger Games is about finding your true self. But how can one find their self in a brutal attempt to please the one nation that created the games – The Capitol and the ruthless dictator of all time President Snow (played brilliantly by Donald Sutherland).With an all-star cast, directed by Gary Ross – who brought us Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, interwove the world that Suzanne Collins created. From Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) to Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) to Gale (Liam Hemsworth) to Cinna (Lenny Kravtiz), this movie defied all odds.I have nothing negative to say about this movie, it was a movie that will stand up against one other movie this year. A movie of a test of time standing still for one immortal girl, one immortal boy and clan that will have to meet their end in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2.But for The Hunger Games, thank you Suzanne for sharing your world with us. Thank you Gary Ross for your excellence in movie making. And thank you to the cast – you outshone and maybe just maybe in Catching Fire we will see more of your brilliant work.",10,6,22,23 March 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Plunging into Darkness
","We last left our friends on the USS Enterprise with peace and tranquility on board and on earth back in 2009 – but now all is not well in the galaxies and everything is not right in Star Fleet. There is a traitor amongst them – a traitor that holds a grudge, a traitor full of clout and darkness, a traitor that leaps for joy at the sight of death and destruction. John Harrison a.k.a. Khan is not your typical villain he is a villain full of surprises and leaves you on the edge of your seat thirsty for more destruction as he attempts to end Star Fleet as we know it. We are left wondering at every turn what Captain James T. Kirk (Pine) would do as well as his First Officer Spock (Quinto). We are left with questions what will become of our villain.Sowhat will become of our heroes from Star Fleet? Is there another adventure for them? Will Khan seek revenge? Those are questions what will be answered until we meet again. To Boldly Go Where No One Has Gone Before.",10,7,18,19 May 2013
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," The Sands of Time
","What can be said about Jake Gyllenhaal in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time – just one word – INCREDIBLE. Since his Brokeback days, Gyllenhaal is a man of many talents – he does his own stunt work. In this movie, Jake Gyllenhaal, best friend and brother to the late great Heath Ledger, lives up to his name. With an incredible cast Sir Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina and the director who brought us Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire Mike Newell, this movie beats all other Walt Disney films by a landslide. Hoping for some more action from Jake, this movie is his best work to date.I give this movie 10 stars",6,1,3,11 December 2010
Thor: Ragnarok," The Thunder Rolls
","Welcome to the new and approved Asgard, or as I like to call it: The Revenge of an Angry Sibling. Let's rewind back to 2011 when we were first introduced to the God of Thunder. Thor, the crown prince of Asgard, has a sibling rivalry with his brother Loki over the rights to the throne and the birthright to become better brothers. You know the saying, 'All that ends well, ends well.' Not in this case 'Not all that ends well, doesn't end well.' Then we come to 2013, when all hope was almost seen as lost. When the dark forces of a foe that they thought was almost diminished, got stronger through a black mass that almost destroyed what Thor almost hold dear to his heart.Now we come to the mother of all, the impending doom of Asgard when someone from the past comes back unbeknownst to Thor and Loki – a woman from the past seeks revenge on the city and all that Thor and Loki could do to save their city is to, well, I'm not going to spoil it, but I will say this Hela, played beautifully and menacing by the talented Oscar winner Cate Blanchett, did an incredible job.Ragnarok was awesome. It was adventurous, dangerous, comedic. I thoroughly enjoyed. Stay tuned though because this movie is vital to the upcoming next Avengers movie. Not saying anymore.",10,11,23,6 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Third Times the Charm
","How many Spider-Mans can you get to climb the wall and save New York City? Apparently 3. With the original 3 movies with Tobey Maguire putting on the web slinging red and blue costume to save New York City from the evil threat of corporate America, those were pretty good. And then there was Andrew Garfield – battling an electric man and a crazed lizard dude who both were wanting more power. And now, certified fresh from Rotten Tomatoes, Tom Holland is the new friendly neighborhood Spider-Man in Homecoming. Dealing with a threat bigger and badder than ever. Michael Keaton does an incredible job portraying a mechanical flying bird stealing from none other than Tony Stark and the Avengers. Let's rewind a bit, we were introduced to Spider-Man towards the middle of Captain America: Civil War when a battle was looming between the Avengers and the Captain and his team because of a threat to expose the existence of the superheroes for what they truly are. Now let's come back to this movie, leading an all-star cast Tom Holland is the new face of the web-slinging, crime fighting superhero who has to come to terms of his identity and how to save humanity and New York City. I wonder what's going to happen next in the new chapter of the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.",10,66,127,11 July 2017
Suicide Squad," DC Mayhem
","Confusion. Chaos. Mayhem. Destruction. Words that describe the worst sort of criminals. Criminals of mastermind. Criminals who love to make chaos go boom. These criminals have one thing on their mind – destroy. The criminality of destruction is only but of the mind, but it has its consequences. For the suicide squad, led by the government operative Amanda Waller (played beautifully by the wonderful talented Viola Davis) she leads an all-star cast of villains to help save the city that is under siege by an evil force from another time and another place. From Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Agbaje) – this team of criminals along with the King of laughter, the Clown Prince (played by the beautiful talented Jared Leto) The Joker – this team is out not for revenge, but for redemption at a second chance with society. This movie wrecked havoc by the critics, won DC fans over with just the message of teamwork and unity. Suicide Squad will go down in DC Comics as the talked about movie of Summer 2016",10,0,6,15 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Hydra Lives
","The Germans have invaded the United States of America, but with our people. I guess that is how I want to start this review, but one can only tell. Last time we left our hero, he was in cryo-freeze for over 70 years and then S.H.I.E.L.D came and found Captain America a.k.a. Steve Rogers. Then much to Fury's surprise the company had been ambushed by the same evil that they thought they got rid ofHYDRA. But through the unlikely of sources, Alexander Pierce (played wonderfully by the greatest actors of all time Robert Redford) – for you see the Red Skull a.k.a Schidmit was just the birth and now the past has come to haunt.But it all began when Bucky fell through the wintrier snow of the Alps and Doctor Zola found him and made him into a killing machine and wiped all of his memories, including the memories of his best friend. I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I will say this – the war against Hydra has only begun and nowwell I'll let you decide that for yourself.This movie was the best that Marvel has ever done all thanks to the creator, the master mind behind of all these movies and comic books – Mr. Stan Lee – personally, you are my hero and you are our Captain – thank you for bringing your world to ours.",10,1,2,5 April 2014
Justice League," The Powers That Be
","Superman is dead! Like the old saying goes 'you can't keep a good man down.' With the help of Bruce Wayne, brings an elite squad of superheroes to stop an alien force taking over the world. With the help of Barry Allen/The Flash, Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, Victor Stone/Cyborg, Arthur Curry/Aquaman - they help Bruce revitalize a broken superhero by bring Clark Kent back to life. 
 In bringing Superman back to life, it took the entire team to work together to bring back the superhero that we have loved and hold most dear over the last few centuries. But it took more than that to stop Steppenwolf from bringing chaos to earth. 
 I loved this movie more than you could ever imagine. Zach Snyder is the best in the business. When I first saw Justice League, I was thinking how could they bring an elite team of superheroes together to fight the outer world enemies that threaten the course of humanity? But they pulled it off without a hitch. I can't wait to see what they are going to do with another Justice League. Maybe, just maybe add to the team",10,1,3,24 April 2018
Man of Steel," The Year of the Red Blue Blur
","Or as I like to call it – 6 Decades of Superman. It all started back in the late 30s but his name was just Superboy, then as the years and decades progressed this great phenomenon became the truth, the justice and the American way. Superman has graced our lives and hearts for 75 years ever since that one comic book hit the newsstands back in 1938 and now with digitally enhanced supersonic strength and digitally mastered special effects, we begin to hope again.This movie has outshone every facet of this superhero's life from the very first appearance on television with George Reeves to the incomparable Christopher Reeve then it went onto Dean Cain then television did it right again with Tom Welling then it went good with Brandon Routh and now the red and the blue returns for a new chapter with Henry Cavill as he joins this elite squad of the red blue blur. Everything about Man of Steel, was perfectly done and at the helm of it all Zack Snyder, who brought us Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen, Legends of the Guardians, Sucker Punch and now Man of Steel. And right beside him was the Batman Trilogy director Chris Nolan – excellent and superb job well done. The graphics, the CGI, the effects both sound and special – were out of this world.Speaking 'out of this world', I am reminded of what Jor-El once told his son Kal-El, 'Krypton lives inside of you wherever you go.' Superman a.k.a. Clark Kent will live inside all of us from now and into eternity. RIP = George Reeves (1959), and Christopher Reeves (2004)",10,0,0,14 June 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," 10 Years In the Making
","Ten years ago, we were introduced to a young boy who had extraordinary magical powers and his destiny was to destroy the one thing he feared the most - death. In 2001, The Sorcerer's Stone (Philosopher's Stone) showed us what true friendship meant. In 2002, The Chamber of Secrets showed us courage and bravery. In 2004, The Prisoner of Azkaban showed us it takes faith to trust. In 2005, The Goblet of Fire showed us, not only skill, but a test of power. In 2007, The Order of the Phoenix showed us to open our minds and to 'not to tell lies.' In 2009, The Half-Blood Prince showed us not linger too much on the past.But in 2010 & 2011, a due to the finish will determine to have the ultimate power - the power of love. Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows - Part 1 will leave a mark, not a physical mark, but a mark of urgency, a mark that is not seen - a mark to feel, a mark of love. I loved this movie. I have to say a very BIG THANK YOU to the one person who poured blood, sweat & tears into every word written on the pages of magic - J.K. Rowling. Thank you for giving us 10 wonderful years of magic.I give this movie a mere perfect score of 100 - for everything from the special effects to the incredible to the incredible artistry to the breathtaking scenery. The 3 stars - Dan, Rupert & Emma - we will miss you and we look forward to upcoming projects from you.This movie met every expectation that I had from reading the book. To close, I am a firm believer in finding my true destiny and Harry Potter helped me to find it.",10,2,4,26 November 2010
Divergent," One Choice Can Transform You
","The United States of America is not what we once knew – the nation was split and the government was run out by factions – 5 to be exact: Abnegation, Amity, Candor, Dauntless and Erudite. With everyone in these factions it was going to be a peaceful world until one day one girl, one test result can change the way our minds can change who we are – Divergent! One faction the Erudite comes in and destroys the peaceful nation by catapulting a ruthless attempt to rid the world of Divergents and the overrule the government so they can get their way with the leadership of one woman – Jeanine Matthews (played beautifully by Kate Winslet.) I don't want to spoil the rest of the movie for the people who have not seen the movie but I will say this – this movie was lacking in some places where things were left unsaid, action was left out and things were changed up a bit.This movie was an awesome way of letting dive into a young writers mind of how she sees the world, Veronica Roth who at the time was 23 when she wrote this book. The book was action packed and so was the movie, matter of fact the movie was incredible. The cast ranging from Shailene Woodley to Theo James to the wonderful Ashley Judd and Zoe Kravitz (yes that is Lenny's daughter!) to the villainous Kate Winslet.But the question remains is: Which faction will you choose? Let's hope Insurgent delivers.",9,15,45,22 March 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man," Red, Blue and the 4th
","We first saw Peter Parker, the kid who became the iconic hero of all time, back in 2002 when Tobey Maguire made him famous – but this goes all the way back, not just in yesteryear but during the comic book days. In 1963, The Amazing Spider Man hit the bookstores and comic strips, but now a days, we all need a hero.Peter Parker, (played by new-comer Andrew Garfield) was a troubled young man from the beginning, his parents leaving him behind with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May (played brilliantly by the greatest actor and actress of our time Martin Sheen and Sally Field). During his adolescence, Peter was faced with bullies and the occasional spider bite. But it was not your usual spider bite, a radioactive spider with mutations beyond our capability.But when things get a little green, Dr. Curt Conners (played by Rhys Ifans, who brought us Xenophilius Lovegood in Harry Potter 7 Part 1), all he ever wanted was to make the human race understand the importance of being treated like reptiles – lizards to say the least.What an incredible timing to bring this movie before the independence of our country. What an incredible movie that Mark Webb brought us. I know Sam Raimi would be very proud, but Mark you, my friend out-done Sam in every way. The cast was brilliant, the story was awesome, the effects perfection.If I was Spider Man, the one thing that I would love to do – the web slinging. I would like to fly like Spider Man so that I can save everyone and be the hero of the Red and Blue.",10,7,18,3 July 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Past into Future
","The last time we left our friends all was right in the world, well with one exception, there was a mad man on the loose killing humans for the cause of the mutants. Now we come to the future or should I say the past or should I say the future. Matthew Vaughn did a great job with First Class, but Bryan Singer – OMG OMG this movie has given us more Intel than we thought we would ever have.The past has come into the future, or so to speak to stop an unthinkable demise. I don't want to reveal too, too much for those that have not seen this movie, but I will say thisPatrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry – you brought the past into the future – you guys are the epitome of great acting. To the newbies – James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence (J-Law), Nicholas Hoult, and a slew of new mutants – everything was just superb in every single way.The movie defines what we should be in our future, not define us what we were once in the past. Let's not look to the past, but to the future. Thank you Bryan Singer for reminding us that it's not about the past, but the future.",10,1,3,23 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Against All Odds (So to Speak)
","War – It's kind of funny (but not really) how the word 'war' pops up and everyone gets a little on the fidgety side. It's like something is wrong every time when war strikes and all hell breaks loose. That's in our world. That's in our society. But we don't live in the fantasy mind of Stan Lee. We were taught that war or violence, for that matter, solves anything. (Yes, this is how I wanted to start out with this review.) In 2011, we were introduced to a young man who lived in Brooklyn with nothing more than the shirt on his back – Steve Rogers. All he wanted to do was to fight the bad guy. He got his shot when he was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. to become the first superhuman fighting machine, to bring down a ruthless enemy who was plotting an evil that could break the mold of extinction.In 2014, (just 3 years later), Captain America was synonymous, in the very sense of the word in the hearts and minds of every American. That same evil that he fought as The First Avenger, has now infiltrated the government of the United States of America and corrupting the world system.In 2016, we thought we got rid of Hydra, but we were dead wrong. The very existence of the organization was to wipe out the world so they can take over and plot against the Avengers. Over the course of a few years' time, Hydra has stopped at nothing to plot against the existence of mankind. In Captain America: Civil War, we see two sets of teams – the government team vs. the heroes. I am not going to say too much about this movie except this – WOW!!!! That's the word I am looking for. Led by an all star-studded cast – Chris Evans and Robert Downey, Jr. lead a cast of incredible talent that could make the world think twice of waging war against one another. It was all because of a little brainwash. (Oops, said too much already).Joe Johnston who started all of this was just the beginning, but when the Russo brothers (Anthony and Joe) took over – well let's just say that they took this series to a whole new level.Now, if you have not seen this new movie, then I will not spoil it for you, but I will say this stay a little after, because there is a post-credits scene that you do not want to miss.All-in-all, Captain America: Civil War exploded! And it will continue to explode.",10,7,16,6 May 2016

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," : A Evil Arises in Middle Earth
","When we last left our compatriots, they were on their way to reclaim the Lonely Mountains from an evil fierce dragon – Smaug. Peter Jackson, the man who brought us the Lord of the Rings trilogy, gave us another thrill seeking adventure that led us down to the lair of a dragon so fierce that hot molten metal could not contain it. But a greater evil arises – darkness has begun across Middle Earth and the quest for the ONE RING has begun. And the ultimate destroyer has yet to be seen as we hear in that famous quote: 'One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.'Big props has to go to the duo villain of the story, Smaug & the Necromancer (Benedict Cumberbatch), again you have proved your worth as the villain of the story. I saw this movie in IMAX and it was incredible. I can't wait 'til the last installment in 2014.",10,3,9,17 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Return to Middle Earth
","It's been 9 years since we left Middle Earth, but we never knew that we would ever return to the land of enchantment – the land of dwarfs, elves, wizards and even the littlest of people – hobbits. As the intro to the movie shows us, it shows us what will be and then tells the story of a young, but naive hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He never knew of an adventure until a certain wizard showed up at his doorstep.But as the movie goes on, we are re-introduced to familiar faces – Elrond, Galadriel, Saurman, and the ultimate villain of the entire series – the 'precious', the conniving Gollum. All he wants is to live with the one thing that anyone could ever ask for – a long life of misery.It does not surprise me that Peter Jackson has revisited Middle Earth. It is a place of magic, a place of enchantment. We are just so intertwined into what was originally written by Tolkien and the magic of Jackson – it just makes you want to visit as often as you want.The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is the biggest movie of 2012 and what a way to end 2012. I can't wait to see what the next 2 installments will bring.",10,5,15,14 December 2012

Aladdin," 3 Wishes Again
","27 years ago, in an unknown land with unknown magical powers lived a street rat by the name of Aladdin graced the movie screens in a new imagining and animated way all thanks the to the creator and master of the big and little screen that gave us all something to live for: Walt Disney and a man that made us laugh for a billion reasons - Robin Williams.
Now let's fast-forward to 2019, under the direction of Guy Ritchie, a new and innovative way of seeing the world in a whole new way, we travel back to Agrabah to catch a glimpse of this live action take of the classic story that we so dearly loved in 1992.
With the passing of the late great Robin Williams, who voiced the blue friend that granted 3 wishes to the user of the lamp, Will Smith, I have to hand him his props, he made this believer proud that there is no end to life when it comes to living for the future, you can't put wishes to life, you need to live life abundantly. But with this remake of the classic, it will stand the test of time in the vault of the greatest magical world of Walt Disney.
With an incredible cast comes the greatest soundtrack of singers who lent their voices to classic songs like Friend Like Me and A Whole New World, this movie will go in Disney history as one of the greatest story of all time: finding love in magical places and finding your place in the world.",10,0,1,1 October 2019
The Lion King," The King Roars Again
","It has been 25 years since the animated version of this Walt Disney classic. No one would have thought or imagined that you could even that anything like this could ever happen. The Circle of Life is something that is not only special but is the heart and soul of every believer that watches something so spectacular that your jaw just drops, or your heart just melts because of the music and the scenery. But it all comes down to 2 words: Hakuna Matata.
Jon Favreau did, not just an amazing job, but an incredible job, reimaging the beauty of what was done 25 years ago in that little-known movie called The Lion King. With an all-star cast that was beautifully casted and crafted - from Donald Glover to the ever-funny man Seth Rogen to the conniving and evil Chiwetel Ejiofor to the beautifully talented Queen of R&B and Hip-Hop BeyoncÃ© - I could go on, but I will stop there.
I loved everything about this movie and the soundtrack is to die for. From the original songs to new songs that we will come to love, both movie and soundtrack will go down in Disney history as the biggest blockbuster of the last century.",10,2,4,1 October 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Yo Ho, Yo Ho – A Pirates Life for Me.Again
","14 years ago, in 2003, the Pirates of the Caribbean Franchise, based on the attraction at both Walt Disney World in Florida and Walt Disneyland in California, came up with the idea to make a movie about a rogue pirate and the adventures he takes to defeat the deadliest of people to save the high seas of being at risk of extinction and the life of the pirate hanging in the balance of ever ceasing to exist. Gore Verbinski took that risk with The Curse of the Black Pearl and he continued to make this the swashbuckling, awesome ride of a lifetime. With Johnny Depp at the helm of these projects, this franchise has gained more and more attention than any of Depp's other films combined. With this fifth installment to the Pirate franchise, and all of these movies connect to each other tell the story of how the high seas can be a dangerous, slippery ride. Yes, you heard me correctly all 5 of these movies connect, 'How?' you may ask, well you are going to have to learn that by yourself. Because these lips are tied shut, so to speak. But Dead Men Tell No Tales, is the beginning of the end and to be a great time to set sail on the seas again.",Null,1,3,11 July 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," The End of the World
","The end of the world. That is probably not what you wanted to hear, but it is coming and it is true, just not in the shape or form of a mutant destroying the world. The tag line is: only the strong will survive. But who are the strongest. Nothing is short of the strong-willed human being or mutant for that matter. When we left our friends/heroes, they were all divided and went their separate ways (Days of Future Past) and the beginning started for some. But then the unthinkable happened – the end of the world. I don't want to spoil this review for the people who have not seen it, but I will say this everything this movie stood for and stands for will ultimately come out in the wash. Leading an all-star cast, James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender give extraordinary performances. With this the second movie of Summer 2016, this movie will stand the test of time. It was beyond incredible. It was earth shattering. I know what you may be thinking. Not really, because unlike Charles Xavier, I can't read minds. But the future is bright for the X-Men Franchise all the thanks for that goes to a brilliant director who lead the all-star cast and thousands upon millions of crew members and fans alike to stand up for what they believe in. Bryan Singer, you are an incredible director, you made it easy for us believers to embrace the strongest in us. Our world may be coming to an end, but not the end for the X-Men. Thank you, Bryan for your tenacity and for your blood, sweat and tears. So, for those of you who did see the movie, the post-credits scene – something is about to happen – I believe that there will be another one, another X-Men, do you?",10,7,17,27 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A Web Slinging Sequel
","As Peter Parker (Garfield) a.k.a Spider-Man is living his life footloose and fancy free, New York City is at peace once again. But something evil is lurking beneath the waters or should I say electricity. As we see our hero balancing life and staying away from the girl he loves, he is forced to make a choice between the one that he loves and the city that needs him the most.On the other side of things, an old friend comes back into Peter's life, Harry Osborn (DeHaan), whose father has just died of an incurable disease (which by the way is untreatable) and apparently genetic and it has gotten Harry as well. I don't want to spoil the movie for those of you who have not seen it yet, but I would bet my money on a third installment.This movie defied all odds against the original 2nd movie – no thanks goes to Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Alfred Molina – Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Dane DeHaan, Jamie Foxx, Paul Giamatti – and the incomparable and talented Sally Field gave the performance of their lives. This movie will go down in Marvel History as one of the greatest super hero movies of the 21st century.",10,8,23,5 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Next to the Last
","When I heard that Disney was taking over LucasFilm - the thought that crossed my mind was: How are they going to continue the canon (storyline) of the biggest franchise in American Cinematic History? I answered that question myself: In one word: INCREDIBLE! Not the word that comes to mind when you have been a Star Wars fan for almost nearly a century and a half. 
 You know there is a little big of the light and the dark side in every one, but when you really think about it - it is so surreal to really fathom at the thought that this could be the last great franchise in cinematic history. I would have to say that, without a shadow of a doubt, that no matter where we are or what we are doing, Star Wars will live in all of us until we meet our destiny. 
 The Last Jedi raises too many emotions to really even write about due to the fact that we lost someone extremely special to us. Carrie Fisher, was by far the greatest actress of the last few centuries and even decades. Her legacy and her name will never be forgotten even if and when Star Wars is no more. So I guess, this is more of a tribute than a movie review, because in so many words you can't even describe how this movie has moved and touched all of us. 
 I mean, come on, there is no way, that I could even begin to describe how The Last Jedi was, in so few words, incredible and amazing. But I know for a fact, that J.J. Abrams is going to do a hell of a job incorporating the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy and the new trilogy and tie everything together for Episode IX (9). 
 I have loved every minute of this franchise. To be quite honest, I was not a fan in the very beginning, but a good friend of mine got me hooked, and now I am hooked for life.",10,5,40,25 April 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel's Best
","A tree trunk that says 3 words, a lady with a regrettable past, a raccoon with an attitude and a guy who has a chip on his shoulder, and a kid whose past haunts him to become a hero. Guardians of the Galaxy is one of Marvel's best movies to date. Yes, I am giving one of the biggest franchises a compliment. This movie was really cool.The cast in this movie was just superb – Chris Pratt, to the lovely Zoe Saldana, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close – this cast was the best ever assembled since The Avengers. Racing across the galaxy to save the inhabitants of a planet from the tyrannical reign of Ronan (Lee Pace). We see that Ronan is after an orb to gain powers that any human could not contain it – or they die. But with the power in Ronan, it makes him more powerful and undefeatable. But with teamwork and a little faith, from the Guardians – Ronan is defeated.This movie was pretty awesome – I would have to say. All in all, I can pretty much say that I'm anxious to seeing the second movie in 2017.",10,4,12,4 August 2014
Clash of the Titans," The gods have spoken
","The power of the three gods – Zeus, Poseidon, Hades – have ruled the skies, the waters and the underworld for more than 3,000 years, now it's time for Hades to come out of hiding and reclaim Mount Olympus as his own. What Hades does not know is that there is a demi-god, Perseus, Zeus's son, and he will be the one to stop Uncle Hades from destroying mankind. Louis Leterrier directs an all-star cast from Avatar's Sam Worthington to Harry Potter's Ralph Fiennes to Liam Neeson, this movie proves its worth among the race of man. Clash of the Titans proves that it is worthy of Oscar buzz as well. This movie reclaims the gods have spoken and it's time to re-own Mount Olympus and the race of man.",9,2,5,11 December 2010
Alice in Wonderland," The Return of the Depp/Burton Team
","Stepping through a hole in a tree trunk just makes you want to travel back to a magical place where cats smile, animals talk, an evil red queen, a serene white queen and a hatter who is mad. The team of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have done it again. Since their Edward Scissorhands day, these two gentlemen have been inseparable. This movie really brings out Depp to a whole new level and character. There is one thing that this movie did not lack – precision & laughter. Burton has done an exceedingly tremendous job. So, overall, I give this movie a smile and an ace. What will both Burton & Depp think of next? Can these two be inseparable? I can't wait to see what's next for this team.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Forever
","We live in a world full of fantasy – fantasy that we can't explain sometimes. Everything has a purpose, everything has its place, everything has a forever. This is one forever that will last into the next life. It amazes me that 5 years ago in 2008 we were introduced to a whole new world that was created by a 35 year old writer who told a story of a mortal human being who was drawn into a world of vampires and were-wolves.Nobody knew that it would end up with a sad-happy ending. We were mesmerized by the way that these movies and books that have melted (literally) into our hearts. It's like we live in this world that I described a second ago full of make-believe, but for The Twilight Saga – it was so real. The Saga has been ingrained into our souls and left a chilling (so to speak) mark.As I was sitting there watching the movie, I was shocked by the way each part of it was so breathtaking. Each scene was so impactful. The books and the movies have made a mark in us that no other franchise has left in us – The Twilight Saga, will and always be a part of our lives for many years, decades and centuries to come no matter how old we are.Stephanie, thank you so much for your hard work and for sharing with us the story of our lives. To the many directors – Catherine Hardwicke, Chris Weitz, David Slade and Bill Condon – thank you for giving the vision to see Stephanie's work come alive. To Melissa Rosenberg – girl, you rock – your words are Stephanie's words, thank you for the craft that you have. To the composers – Carter Burwell, Alexandre Desplat, Howard Shore – you guys are the epitome of the Saga – thank for the music and for bringing artists like Linkin Park, Muse, Metric, Bruno Mars and Green Day on board.The last thing I do want to say before I close this great Saga Review – to the 3 people who gave us an enchanting vampire – Robert Pattinson – to the mortal who loved a vampire who he is and becoming the immortal that we loved – Kristen Stewart – and to the brown-nosed werewolf who gives his heart and soul – Taylor Lautner – you guys are what The Twilight Saga is about. So.Let's Start With Forever.",10,8,25,16 November 2012
Beauty and the Beast," Tale as Old as Time
","La Belle et la Bete – in English, and in our time, translates to Beauty and the Beast – started as a traditional French fairy tale, then in 1991, the imaginary mind of Walt Disney transformed the classic fairy tale into a full length animated movie and now 26 years later that old French fairy tale is now a live action film telling that old tale in a new time. From the cast of the beautiful Emma Watson (Harry Potter Series) to the gorgeously talented Audra McDonald to the ever-witty Josh Gad and then there was Gaston (Luke Evans). The characters have lived on in the hearts of believers for almost 277 years since that little French fairy tale came into existence. This new and innovative way of telling an old story in a new and inventive time has lived on over the centuries and decades. I know that, without a shadow of a doubt, that this old but classic love story will forever be in the hearts and the minds of the believers, it's not an old tale any more, it's a new way of believing in the impossible, it's about believing in the heart.",10,3,9,11 July 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Into the GalaxyAgain
","Based on fictional space faring superheroes, this new installment to the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, follows a group of superheroes who go into the far reaches of the galaxy to defeat big bad enemies who want to take over the galaxy and the universe. In 2014, we were introduced to Star Lord (Peter Quill) (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) – this band of misfits were formed to protect the galaxy at all costs. Now a new threat has emerged, but in the unlikely person who would ever want to destroy the galaxy but also to bring his son in on the family business (OOPS! Have I said too much already.) With this all-star cast including Oscar Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actor winner Kurt Russell – this movie will keep you on your toes, literally. With all these Marvel movies, tying into together and the post and mid credit scenes, this movie is extremely important to the future of the galaxy, but I will save that for you to decide.",10,10,15,11 July 2017
Thor," The God of Thunder
","Open up the heavens and let the thunder come, because Thor will unleash his wrath upon the planets and the galaxy. I really wasn't supposed to see this movie, but I'm glad I did because it was pretty awesome. I actually learned something: don't mess with the god of thunder. Chris Hemsworth played the title role beautifully, Natalie Portman, she's great in any movie, but the wonderful Sir Anthony Hopkins – no one can compare to him, he is a god among men.Kenneth Branagh, 9 years ago played Professor Lockhart in Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets, did an excellent in the director's chair of Thor. I don't know what else to say about this movie, but it was really good and I was on the edge of my seat waiting for thunder to strike. As they say, thunder strikes twice in the same place.",9,2,5,6 May 2011
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The End of the Beginning
","We may have seen one end of the story, but the story is far from over. For most of us Middle Earth fans, it's quite an adventure to see things from the eyes of a hobbit, but what does it look like from the eyes of the villain? Now that we have seen through one hobbit, it's time that we see from the rest of the story. These three movies set up for what is to come. We are told of ONE RING. We are told of the All-Seeing Eye that looks over Middle Earth ready to devour it. But there is something hidden in the darkness that is ready to pounce on its prey.On September 21, 1937, J.R.R. Tolkien penned the great novel that we see today portrayed in movie form. His intentions were of faith, belief, values and the Cross. Tolkien was a Roman Catholic – he believed in right from wrong, death and life, good and evil. That is what he based his writings on. And that is what these movies portray. Not only was Tolkien a Christian but he converted his best friend, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia, C.S. Lewis. But that has nothing to do with this movie.At the helm of these great movies, the magic of Peter Jackson comes to life. Mr. Jackson has brought countless tales of hobbits, orcs, wizards and all creatures alike and also he brought a deity so terrible that even we crinch when we say his name, Sauron, better known to us as Satan. Every bit of these movies, every bit of the books has something to do with the Christian faith. But it doesn't stop there. Like the title says, the end of the beginning. Jesus said in Revelation 22:13, 'I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.' So you see this movie, this story may have something to do with movie cinematography, production, and makeup, but ultimately The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings will stand the test of time, not only throughout the literature, but ultimately throughout our lives until we finally meet our Mithrandir, Jesus Christ.",10,7,15,31 December 2014
Wonder Woman," The Iconic Female Superhero
","Created by American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston, this iconic female superhero embraces history and time, literally. Born and raised by Greek gods and her mother on the island of Themyscira, Diana, the daughter of Hippolyta, was born to defeat the world's greatest enemies spanning all the way back to the dawn of the age. Let's fast forward several centuries to 1975, when Wonder Woman made her television debut with an American actress who made her famous spanning over three seasons â€“ Lynda Carter. Ms. Carter gave the character the utmost power and respect any woman figure could give a female character. Now in the hands of a newcomer, whom we were introduced to in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice â€“ Gal Godot. This iconic superhero has spanned over the centuries and now as we watch this power of a woman come alongside with Brue Wayne to defeat more of the world's enemies. Wonder Woman will no doubt in my mind become the hero that all of us need, not just women, but children and men alike - the power to tell the truth and the power of submission and the power of identity.",10,14,31,11 July 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," Holy! Epic! Batman!
","Billionaire Bruce Wayne once said, 'I am moreit's what you do that defines you.' The question is: what defines us all? The fire has risen and that fire has been put out, but not yet though. One thing still remains: Is there a future for the billionaire playboy? Enough about playboys, let's chat about how we got here.In 2005, we were re-introduced to a boy who fell down a well and we saw what frightened him the most – bats. But he overcame that fear and struck fear into the hearts of those that knew the very existence of fear. Fighting against the mob, Batman took down the biggest crime lords of Gotham City – Carmine Falcone and gave the Scarecrow a taste of his own medicine.But in 2008, the war was not over, not even by a landslide. As Bruce Wayne was having battles of his own, Batman was posed as a threat to the city and plus a mastermind of theatricality, a brain as the size of a laughing matter, brought a new taste in life – SLAUGHTER WAS THE BEST MEDICINE! The Joker (RIP Heath!), portrayed one of the darkest villains of all time as he brought down upon the city and the new DA Harvey Dent and gave the word 'light' a new name.Now we come to 2012, no one expected this to come to a conclusion, we thought we were in it for the long haul. Let's just say it was bittersweet and a whole lot of punches and back breaking. The ultimate villain, Bane, gave violence a new name. A name that was synonymous unlike any other. But Bane was not working alone. An arch-enemy came back to finish a job but through someone else. And the black was faded and billionaire was living his life and moving on. But wait something red approaches, something that will fly red colors – is it a red monster, is it a red wagon, no it is a RED ROBIN.For 8 years, the mastermind of Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathon gave Batman a new look and took the story to a whole new level. Thank you for teaching us that it is what we do that defines us. Christian Bale – you gave us an icon to live up to, you taught us to live for ourselves. Thank you. From Cillian Murphy to Tom Wilkinson to the late Heath Ledger to Aaron Eckhart to Tom Hardy to Anne Hathaway to Marion Cotillard – you guys defined evil. Thank you.Batman will live in our hearts for years to come.",10,4,11,20 July 2012
Black Panther," A Black Cat Prowls
","Created by Marvel creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in July of 1966, Black Panther was born in the Silver Age of Comic Book history becoming the first African American Marvel Superhero. With the creation of Black Panther, the black cat became a huge phenomenon in comic history that it made a feature film in 2018, with an unknown person playing the title roll by the name of Chadwick Boseman. 
 In the furriest of details, this movie has gained such momentum in the box office that it literally broke the box office within the first weekend. But let's get back to Wakanda. The birth place of the black prowler. We first met T'Challa, Black Panther, in Captain America: Civil War, when the Cap and Iron Man were on opposite sides of the government spectrum dueling for the survival of the Avengers. 
 Now we come to Wakanda and history of the way T'Challa became the prowler known as Black Panther. Now, I'm not going to sit here and spill out any details, but I will have to say that this movie has out beat all the other Marvel movies by far and to date. 
 I know that, without a shadow of a doubt, literally the shadows, that this movie will continue to go down in comic book history as the greatest superhero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, all thanks to the director Ryan Coogler. As Kendrick Lamar swiftly puts it in the title track for the movie, 'This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars approach you, all the stars approach you, all the stars approach you. This may be the night that my dreams might let me know. All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer.'",10,2,5,2 May 2018
Thor: The Dark World," The Light at the End of a Dark World
","When we left our friends in Asgard, all was right in the 9 realms after Loki was thrown into an abyss for his selfish ways and almost destroyed everything the Asgardians hold most dear. But it has been 2 years since Jane Foster and Thor parted ways and now they are reunited because of a darkness that shrouds over Jane's inner body as she infects a most powerful and deadly weapon that could not only destroy her but the entire 9 realms – it takes a vicious monster Malekith (played wonderfully by Christopher Eccleston) to destroy all of the races in the universe to converge it all in darkness. But it takes Thor (Hemsworth) along with Foster (Portman) and Loki (Hiddleston) to save the day. But what we don't know may surprise us – that the Tesseract, the Aether, so close together creates something more deadly than what they could ever even think that could happen to the fate of the entire universe. This movie was excellent and I am looking forward to seeing what is next for our mighty god of thunder.",10,5,10,8 November 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Prophecy Fulfilled
","'The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approachesBorn to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month diesand the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows notand either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.' It was over 10 years ago, we were introduced to a young boy who unlike any other boy thought that he was a normal 11 year old kid. But he wasn't normal – he was a wizard and that's how the boy Harry Potter melted the hearts of readers and moviegoers. The creator of this great epic phenomenon, gave us what we had foresaw – Harry Potter was and is and will always be a part of our lives. For you see, it was at the hand of a young writer by the name J.K. Rowling that gave us something to live for.I have been a true fan of this movement for 10 years and I can honestly say, that I am extremely proud to be a true Harry Potter fan. I could not have asked for more. I read the books and I have the movies, if anything that I have gained from both is that Harry Potter will always live within me and the fans that have graced the books and the movies. Tonight as I was watching the movie, I was thinking the entire 2 hours, how one boy at the age of 17, give so much of his life to save the world from annihilation.The prophecy is true when it says 'but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not' that power was and will always be the love of his parents and his friends. Thank you, Harry Potter for teaching us what it means to live a life of love and you have given us something to live for – a life full of hope and joy. Thank you, J.K. Rowling for allowing us to dive in your world of magic into the pages of Hogwarts and teaching us that magic lives within us. As Dumbledore says 'help will always be given to those who need it the most.' And one big THANK YOU to Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint – for allowing us to watch you grow up into fine young men and woman – we wish you the best in the future, we will be seeing you again and again.",10,0,2,15 July 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Rebellion Begins
","The aim, the stare, the fire, the start of the destruction of Panem is growing dimmer and weaker by the minute, by the hour – all because one girl, one simple but head-strong girl – who thought she was saving herself along with the boy next door, but all she did was defied the very existence of survival, defied the very existence living. We are now on the verge of the strongest revolts against the Capitol. We are about to embark the end of the beginning. The Hunger Games were just games but the Quarter Quell outdid every aspect of the way we saw the original games. But we are about see the awakening unfold between a ruthless dictator in President Snow and a girl, 'the girl on fire', but this war goes beyond them – it goes all the way back to surviving freedom. The cast was on the A – game – Jennifer Lawrence (J-Law) in one word – INCREDIBLE!!!! Josh Hutcherson – insanely incredible. Liam Hemsworth – freaking awesome. The rest of the cast and crew, you guys were really awesome, but the props has to go to my favorite 2 actors – the antagonist Donald Sutherland, you are the epitome of evil – you are an incredible actor; and Phillip Seymour Hoffman – kudos goes to you, you brought the position of game maker to a whole new level. Suzanne Collins – you are an incredible author, you gave us something to believe in and for that we thank you for allowing us to dive into your world. Thank you. Francis Lawrence – you are an incredible director and I can't wait to see what you have planned for Parts 1 & 2 of Mockingjay.",10,1,28,22 November 2013

They are what we call great entertainment. I have to give props to the greatest iconic director of all time – Steven Spielberg and the genius behind the Transformers Trilogy – Michael Bay. There is no one in the nation that can outdo these 2 gentleman. The cast was incredible from the boy who started the phenomenon – Shia Labouef to the newcomer girlfriend, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The third movie was in one word – INCREDIBLE!!! I give Transformers a 8; I give Revenge of the Fall a 9; but I give Dark of the Moon a 10.",10,3,6,30 June 2011
