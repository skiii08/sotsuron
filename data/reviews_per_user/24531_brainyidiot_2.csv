National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride
","National Treasure: Book of Secrets is the kind of high adventure movie that succeeds in keeping you on the edge of your seat while Nick Cage and company follow a sort of secular New World Da Vinci Code by following one clue after another up until the exciting climax. Seems like Cage's family is linked to the Lincoln assassination so he sets out to prove it untrue. His nemesis played by the always reliable Ed Harris is ominously following him for reasons of his own. The lovely Diane Kruger is back but this time they're estranged-but as in all formula flicks we already can figure out the outcome of that plot twist. It's a plus that Helen Mirren is along as John Voight's long ago ex and Cage's mother and it turns out she has a talent of her own as an expert on ancient carvings that proves useful in Cage's quest. Unfortunately, Harvet Keitel only has a few scenes as does Bruce Greenwood as the President. But it all amounts to a good popcorn movie the whole family can enjoy. Oh yeah, Ty Burrell makes a likable sidekick computer geek with tricks of his own. Is it far fetched? Sure, but it works as entertainment.",7,0,2,25 December 2007
Hot Fuzz," Happiness is Hot Fuzz!
","Despite it's awful title, Hot Fuzz is an unexpected thrill ride of a buddy flick. Everything about the movie works--from the fine acting all around, to the crisp direction, sharp dialog, and inventive editing, this sleeper hit is bound to become a cult classic in the vein of Local Hero. It's a tale about a transfered city cop out of his element in a country village where a gallery of quirky characters aren't what they seem. A series of deaths has the new cop in town figuring out that there must be some kind of conspiracy. The townsfolk are pleasant enough but something isn't quite right. Why are people dying from odd accidents? What are the motives for what is going on? Finely crafted action scenes and original story leaves the viewer wanting more. Hot Fuzz rocks!",9,1,3,18 June 2007
