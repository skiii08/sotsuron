Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Probably one of the worst movie I have ever seen
","It made me physically sick to think about why someone would make such a horrible movie.I know a lot of you like it. But if you look at it from any single point of view, it is a terrible movie. I had to leave the theater and went to see Catch a Fire.If you haven't seen it, do not. All it does is make fun of Jews. Only mentally retarded people will laugh at it. In all honesty, there were two funny parts. But I only laughed for a few seconds for one, and the other was just a smile.Go watch a good comedy like Snatch or Shuan of the Dead.",1,22,51,3 November 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," Not The Usual Suspects good, but good
","This movie is a movie all about the ending. When I was watching it through, I was weirded out by the lame dialogue. Instead of just talking, they would dance around what they had to say and then about 50 seconds later, they would say it.The acting was great, but Lucy Liu or whoever was annoying. She never shut up. The directing was great, it always somewhat confused you, but wouldn't make you have to replay the scene in your head to understand it. Unless, of course, you are stupid or the president.The music was OK, nothing that would top John Williams, but it fit. The plot was sweet, but like i said before, the dialogue had some holes that needed to be filled in.But in the end, you just are forced into liking the movie. The right amount of people die, and the entire story of the past and present fit together like clockwork.So I'd say that it is probably the best movie this year so far, and to definitely see it.",9,0,5,9 April 2006
United 93," This movie could be about 10 times better
","OK OK, I saw this movie in the theater a while ago and I just got around to spreading my opinions. I'd probably give this a 3/10 There are many reasons that this movie was lackluster at best. 1. It didn't tell any backgrounds of the people that died. If this was dedicated to the people who died on the flight, then it should have told about them. I know the director was trying to get the message across that these people were just random, every day people, but I already know that. What I want to know is who these people were. I want to know why they didn't deserve their fate. I wanted to cry at the end, but tears never came. 2. The movie was not done well. They had a pretty large budget for this movie, but used small amounts of it... They pretty much needed one set: The Plane. Aside from the end, there were no cool shots (the way it ends was cool) 3. But the ending could have been better. I know it is clich√©d, but if they could have fit a few news reports in, it would have made it more moving I think. 4. The crowd I saw it with sucked... Everyone started cheering when they slit the terrorist's throat. If you clapped when this happened, you are probably going to hell. It is still a person. 5. It is too soon to make money off the tragedy. That is just lame... they should have let people in for free or like give 100% of the money made to charities or something. That's as bad as Mel capitalizing off of Christ in The Passion. 6. Everyone knew what was going to happen, and it is meaningless to see. The director doesn't do anything different or really cool... and since the plot is already given, it is like watching a special news report, but a little more interesting. If you haven't seen it, I'd suggest just downloading it off bit torrent to not pay corporations to make a meaningless film to make money off a tragedy. I pray to god that WTC is better.",3,6,21,8 August 2006
Deja Vu," Great movie, probably second or third best this year
","Tony Scott and Denzel do it again. If you did not like Man on Fire's cinematography, not much has changed. I loved it. He is a great director and a great editor. Many of the shots made my jaw drop and eyes widen. They were incredible.The plot was perfect. Everything that doesn't make sense in the beginning is fully explained later. It is incredible and makes you smile when you realize that you are seeing what happened.Now, the biggest complaint is that it is not physically possible. But this is a movie. I mean, it is OK for ten-story apes to exist, but once something scientific doesn't fully seem possible, the movie gets a D. Trust me on this, this movie is great. I am very very glad I went to see it.Do not miss it.",9,0,2,2 December 2006
The Matrix Revolutions," Wow, the W. Brothers destroyed a good thing
","Everyone can agree that the Matrix was amazing, not only because of the sweet CGI effects, but because of its philosophical plot.Honestly, when I saw the first one, I loved it. But what they did with he plot ruined the expirence.The main plot is about the agents taking over the Matrix, taking control. Honestly, it has been a while since I have seen this, so bare with me if I miss out on some of it.Anyways, what they did wrong was create an idea of a coup de tat in a world that has not been explained nearly enough. Instead of answering questions, they created new ones.Then there is the whole machines vs. humans, which is just cheesy. The machines easily out numbered the humans.Then finally, there is the whole new understanding of 'the one.' Honestly, I could care less why he existed. Seems to be an anomaly (wow, spelling) in the Matrix. But him being a mistake doesn't explain why the agents are trying to take over. And they say that Neo must die in order to save everybody (cuz there were more than one 'one'). All of that is lame, I'm sorry.And the whole fight in the absent street in the rain was cool, but really not ground breaking.OK, I didn't want a huge war, I didn't want an attempt on a coup de tat, I didn't want to find out why he is the one.I'd rather them have to destroy the matrix by pulling a plug or something.Please, if you have not seen any of the Matrix movies... watch the first one only. You will be happy. Seeing the sequels makes the first way worse.",5,0,2,6 July 2006
The Lion King," How is this not on the top 250?
","I just watched the Lion King for the 30-something time. It's been a few years, and I have gotten way more into film since the last viewing. Therefore, I noticed how amazing this movie is.The Lion King is the basic story of MacBeth (with a few differences, but same basic plot line)... A greedy man kills the king to take power. The deceased King's son seeks revenge after years of living on the lam.The cinematic aspects of the film amaze me. The intro is among the greatest in any movie, animated or live action. The death scene nearly made me cry, and I knew what was going to happen, and I am an 18 year old male. And the ending, with the rain and all the animals and the song... I will not even try to recreate the experience with words... you have to see it.In my opinion, no one should dislike this movie... it is a classic. It has probably the best music of any Disney move, save Fantasia. It is a little childish at times, but it is always interesting and never fails to keep your attention.Unless you hate animation with a passion, you will at least like this movie. A movie every movie fan should not just see, but own.10/10",10,0,0,12 August 2006
