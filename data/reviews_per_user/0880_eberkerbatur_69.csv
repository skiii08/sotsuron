","Actually, I didn't like baseball movies much, but I watched more films about the field.and I didn't like it very much this time out of the field, behind all the events, coaches, managers were the subject of so I think I like this movie.I love movies like this,true story.our main character billy beane and his assistant peter are trying to make their way to a bad way with brand new teams, but with other teams it's impossible to cope with normal roadsbecause they don't have the money they need to see the biggest problem as money and they want to do something about it and they are applying to a new technique that no one has tried before.figure,data,SCIENCE.

Blade Runner 2049," Great visual effect,wonderful sound mixed and old blade runner not forgotten
","Perfect universe I didn't remember much recently, did I have such a good guess about how the world will be in the future.
I think the film tells us the best of the future, maybe there are a few movies I did not watch but I think the blade runner is the best
I also remembered that there were altered carbon array of the netflix construction I liked it.once filmed old film is not forgotten,I thought it would be a very different topic, but it was much more relevant to the old film,
it was very touching to me.
of course I would love to see in Rachel but this could not be the subject,If you watch this movie without watching the first movie, I think you can not understand.
I'm fond of this style as it is not very fluent in the slow music selections of the old blade runner-style transitions,but people who didn't know the blade runner could find it a bit boring.
images gorgeous effects wonderful already won the best visual effect in the academy,
he was nominated for oscar best sound mixed but he could not compete with dunkirk.
I like the film in general, if you look at the audience and the ratings,also received 81 points from the criticism, this is very good only at the box office did not catch the expected success more than I would expectI would recommend to anyone recently watched the best movie but first watch the Blade Runner (1982).",9,2,13,31 January 2019
First Man," I think we found first ACADEMY NOMINEE
","I would like to say that this is the best movie I have watched this year.I already guessed that it would be great to hear damien chazelle and ryan gosling.met my expectations was a fine biography example.
it gave me every sense of lifeBy the way, I felt like listening to La la Land music and it made me happy because I love la la land.I watched a movie with a friend at the cinema and when we came out we both think that this film will be oscar candidate.
i would recommend to everyone that it was a super movie as i wrote in the same titleI gave eight points to the movie because the transitions were very fast and I was a little annoyed in some minutes.",8,1,4,23 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," WOWWW I cant talk brains is out
","10 CLOVERFIELD LANE science fiction golden child jj abrams again super idea and a great movie.
I first saw this cool start-up movie cloverfield in 2008 and then I learned that it was a serial, and there were a total of 3 movies linked to each other with small details.After this movie I will watch the movie cloverfield paradox.Now let's go movie. Michelle, the heroine's lover we see fighting and collecting things and going to one place but we never find out where it goes We're constantly confused throughout the movie but we take almost all the answers we just do not know where Michelle went,
I think it would be nice to have information about it.
then we open our eyes in a shelter, I do not know how many hours have been left unconscious.Was it during the movie that it was invasive or not?Like Howard is bad or good.There's a constant dilemma throughout the film that can amaze you anytime A great movie full of surprises.There may already be some question marks on the entire cloverfield series that have never been squeezed into a wonderful mystery bunker that is a completely different mystery.It's a bit confusing in the final stages and it sounds a bit absurd to me, but the movie is really nice.",9,1,2,17 August 2018
The Ring," Not horror movie more like mystery
","The ring is actually not exactly a horror movie, but more like a thriller and mystery type.I like the subject very much,wondering what will happen every minute.
generally horror films do not have such scenarios
Other films in this style are often intended to scare but this movie we watched a woman trying to unravel the mystery of samara
I have not fully understood the mystery of the cassette, but I am sure this will be clarified in the following films.(Gore Verbinski is a good director)",6,0,0,16 March 2019

","I watched the movie for the second time and really enjoyed it was very nice.
I can guarantee you will definitely cry an incredible emotional movie.
Actresses were great especially Mian's grandfather playing player was very good.love, sadness, happiness you feel each emotion separately.only some visual effects were bad because, was a low budget movie but i liked it very muchthe most beautiful side of the film was the songs used very well,
It was impressive,
I think most of the songs for this film were songs of the film.",8,0,0,29 October 2018

Darkest Hour," I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.
","Movie winston churchill tells about his life in WWII.The film tells us about the political events during the war.
it seems to be a heavy film, but I must admit that it is very grippingEven if you don't like churchill before you can have some sympathy after this movie.Because Gary Oldman won the academy award for this role.
My favorite point of darkest hour is the conversations in the cabinet and then you into the political universe are really entering you into the world.
you don't feel like you're in WWII because it hardly shows the pitch.but certainly immersive a wonderful film academy also already approved it.
After the movie Winston Churchill was very curious about his life to learn the detail that will surely follow a documentary.",9,0,1,29 September 2018
Captain Marvel," Good movie above my expectations (7.6)
","I've read a few bad reviews before watching captain marvel and got into the movie thinking it was too bad but actually I think it was very successful
a bit bad in other marvel movies, but it was still a movie that locked the audience on the screen and I think the subject is much better than the other marvel movies I would say above average for this movie.
It was just bad that captain marvel was so strong and couldn't show this power literally,but I guess this movie is probably the sequel marvel was just a single film project although the film makes a good money",8,5,7,25 October 2019
Iron Man 2," I didn't like it too much (6.7)
","I think it wasn't better than the first movie, I think it couldn't show much improvement, I can say even worse but as a result, a delightful movie, some battle scenes were ridiculous and a few unnecessary scenes. Actually, I did not like the action scenes in the movie very much, but it may be in my watching almost 5-6 times.I started the marvel series from the beginning and it is going on at an average level, for now, acting great, that's what makes this movie beautiful.
Apart from that, it is sufficient in terms of beautiful effects compared to 2010.",7,0,0,21 May 2020
Passengers," 88 years is too long for two people.
","Passengers, two great players to meet for the first time in a project together, I think.I like a lot of space movies these days.actually the film proceeded a little heavy but this is very normal.Because most of the time there is not much action Two people can wait on a big ship how much action can wait but sometimes I get bored.I did not understand the actions on the last scenes I could not fully understand the difficulty on the ship and a person can wear such a heat even if the outer space dress did not make sense to me the last scenes I found absurd but overall I liked it was good.
I already like the movies about the passage of this time. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted to get as badly as the films of the genre wanted, finally the movie was nice.",8,2,2,27 September 2018
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," an interesting story to watch (6.5)
","A movie of average quality that I watch many times and enjoy every time I watch it story engaging mystical subject. I think this kind of movie should be watched in the cinema.
cast team very well chosen I think all actors fit well with the characters also successful in acting.
effects compared to 2010 beautiful already spent a lot of money on the film.
I have some uncomfortable issues one of the slow-motion scenes are trying to slow motion in some battle scenes may be nice though 2-3 times but it bothered me too often I'm not very happy with the battle scenes but it was still beautiful.
also, the scenario is a bit simple.
A movie I would recommend if you plan to have fun in your spare time",7,0,0,11 January 2020
Spider-Man 2," I believe There is a hero in all of us (8.2)
","It was a bit better than the first movie, actually, my favorite movie in this series, because it's more than Spiderman's heroism,human side and in fact, we're watching Peter Parker's life in this movie my favorite part is whether it's a normal life or a spiderman that's the choice finally making the right decision.
I think the best villian Doctor Oktopus I like the movie",8,3,4,29 July 2019

Chicken Run," FREEDOM
","I was very common and popular in the years when I saw an animation stop motion technique that I watched in my childhood and I was very afraid of the owners of the chicken farm.it's a film that changes my life partly because I've never had a eat chicken in my life, and I'm so disgusted, and I think this film is effective in this. Has a beautiful story.an animation in which we can always be monitored.
just so far i didn't get to enjoy it until i was a little bored old years.but the story of chickens never give up for the freedom of escape is a lesson for everyone. I think it is a film that needs to be watched all the time.",8,0,0,21 September 2018
Aquaman," Best visual effect movie by this year
","This is my favorite movie in the dc cinematic universe.I liked the movie wonder woman, but I think this movie was better.
I had already guessed that this film would be beautiful beacuse the director James Wan and I was very curious.
I guess it was the best visual effect of this year as I wrote in the title.
I think the cast team was chosen very well and the acting was great.
I liked the battle scenes a lot,it was a nice,i would recommend to everyone.",8,2,6,27 January 2019

I like how Sandman story intersects with the uncle BenI think I can say the best movie in this series, even my favorite spiderman movie I think",8,2,6,27 August 2019
Midnight in Paris," The Golden Age
","A great movie that i've seen many times and never tired of watching.
Woody Allen's imagination really surprises you.
Time passes in the film are not noticed I noticed a little late when I first watched.
The film shows us Paris at 3 different times.(2010,1920,1890)
The messages given in the film were very meaningful,especially that every person enjoys living in the past and wants to live in the past and in fact, I was impressed by the fact that we were not happy in the present.

Cloverfield," I do not like Found Footage
","I first found that footage films generally do not go well, but to be honest the fact that the movie makes it very real is really happening and I feel like I'm watching it on YouTube.
The events in this film are quite realistic except for a few scenes and the deaths of some of the characters seem to have passed very easily I did not react too much to say that I found artificially there but this film was a very different scenario had a really great scenario open mouth
although obviously movie did not like whether I liked this movie at the end, but as I said it was absolutely realistic that I probably planned it, but I do not know a good movie, but I do not know whether

Margot Robbie and Allison Janney oscara nomination(Allison Janney win) this movie was nice and I wanted to watch for a while,but as a result I can say that did not come out as expected.Obviously I didn't even like it at all.I had a very dramatic life story that I didn't know about Tonya Harding's life before watching the film,and I thought that if it were actually transferred with a more emotional film, this story would hold much more.Now that the comment is a little more like how funny I say.The characters in the intermittent conversation with the camera, for example bothered me.
yes i do not like the film, but margot robbie academy prize is deserved to be nominated,in the same way, allison janney deserved to win.",5,0,1,26 November 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Plenty of Comedy alongside Adventure and Mystery (8.3)
","I think it was a nice movie, it was very realistic compared to an animated movie.
It is obvious that much money was spent, the quality was top level.
A nice job comes out when the popular cartoon of the '90s is shot again in this quality.The subject and the story were beautiful, I just did not like the end, I thought they would reach the great treasure, but they decided to hide it in the next movie.
9 years have passed, but I hope the sequel will come and I will be eagerly waiting.
I was surprised that there was no Oscar nomination.",8,0,0,24 April 2020

I think it was a delightful movie.A lovely Christmas film.We wanted to watch the Christmas movie and we thought the best choice was this movie.Frankly, I didn't regret to tell you the Christmas magic in a very good way
It was a great Christmas gift from the eyes of the children, and in some minutes you are getting a little bored, unless you are a child.
the film is a little shorter though I think it would be nice to have a nice animated film",8,0,1,29 December 2018
Suicide Squad," not like in the trailer
","The movie trailer had become very popular and my expectation was obviously very high and the movies I wanted to watch were among the most wanted,
but I've had frustration after watching the movie.I'm a huge joker fan and I like joker character at the cinema but I didn't like the joker in this movie.I like Jared Leto his a good actor but he could not play the joker character well I hope they do not continue with it.
it wasn't a nice movie , it's never been a movie about the superheroes' enemies gathering and fighting another evil.So this movie was very curious.I didn't like the scenes of the film, some scenes didn't like what I could say very ridiculous.",4,0,0,30 November 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," great movie thanks to everyone DESERVE THE ACADEMY
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri I found this name to be ridiculous and long when I first heard it, but I did not realize that I did not watch the movie yet, but when I first heard the movie, I already announced the Oscar nomination and there were many beautiful comments I knew it was quite popular so I watched this movie while watching it and knew it would be already beautiful and it was nice and successful than I expected3 billboards I was very interested in the movie went very well I actually admired the most favorite event scenario about this movie in one word is quite intelligent and unusual scenario that the movie is so beautifully combined with the name of movie that it is not not to be not admirable.the acting are not only the leading actors but they have already proven themselves in the oscard I have admired the acting roles of the side roles so everyone has done the work very well that we have to thank everyone passing through in this movie.I think that the oscar winner should be the ladybird before I watch this movie but I can not decide right now I appreciate both of you equally great movie thanks.",9,0,2,11 September 2018
Corpse Bride," A GREAT ANIMATION WITH EMOTION
","I have been watching the corpse bride for many years, but I have not had time.I watched most of the movies shot with the stop motion technique and it is definitely a technique I like, I like it.one of the directors who makes it the best in the world, and even the best director, tim burton is also my favorite director, director Edward Scissorhands' also is my favorite movie.The world of Tim Burton is very different from gloomy gloomy but very beautiful when you enter the world that you are very impressed with it.The corpse bride was a very emotional and meaningful film and you hardly keep yourself from crying, and at the same time you were laughing .a very beautiful film has already written itself into cult films already, and you will enjoy it very much.",9,0,0,11 September 2018
Bird Box," before watching the movie read the book
","I read the book of bird box and I liked it very much and I've finished about a week or something.
I was hoping to hear that this film was filmed later and then heard that it was filmed.Sandra bullockda starring me more but even for that time I thought Sandra Bullock was a little big in this role.
When I watched the film, I saw it change a bit as usual.The movie takes 2 hours and it's hard to fit a big book in 2 hours.So in my opinion if I actually had a series rather than making movies I think it would be more like and really cool.Had a very long and immersive story for the film.In fact, a universe like TWD does more people in the world.or if it would be 3 series, but this would be risky in terms of viewing.
I did not love the film because I read the book but someone not reading the book maybe like this film.I don't find it bad again but it wasn't very good. So they could transfer this perfect scenario to the longer-term audience, and we would be in this universe for longer.
If we go to acting, the majority is good, I just want to say.
Trevante Rhodes didn't like the acting of among them was the most amateur
Sandra Bullock was old for this role",7,1,3,2 January 2019
Justice League," Sorry I wish the film is beatiful but not only visuel effect good
","It was a bad movie that was really below my expectations
Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman are the first time we see the introductory film and we need the know them a little.
The first 40 minutes of the movie actually started beautiful I think was successful but the real problem starts after that.Strong enemy it the first justice league movie even that unite all the world(amazon,atlantis.human and gods) can defat the enemy but the this time only six super hero can defat easily.I think this is the biggest reason that makes the movie ugly bad scenario
We watched the battle scenes decorated with visual effects of super heroes that we know for 2 hours.in fact, you could get a super movie from six great superheroes.",6,0,12,1 March 2019
Man of Steel," so much action but nice
","I don't know if there's ever been a film about Superman's history, his planet and his family.That's what I liked most about this movie.it just bothered some times I had so much war scene I didn't expect to have so much action,could have been less than his was good.
Superman is very well chosen I like a superman,at the same time as the body of this man Superman liked you say.",8,2,4,28 September 2018

Dangal," Highest Grossing Indian Movies of All-Time
","I love the Aamir Khan movie 3 idiots was great,this movie has become very popular everyone enjoyed but somehow I didn't like it much.
I seperated movie in two part part1and part2 Ilike part1 beacuse the difficulties of life in India were about the injustices of women and the struggle of a father to change it.The first part of the film was the classic aamir khan style that was giving amazing messages that was really cool but when we got to the part 2, girls grew up and the film was no longer an indian film and turned into a sports film.I'm not a man who loves sports movies, so maybe I didn't like it and I don't like wrestling not interesting.I'm pretty bored in the second part of the movie but this is a real,powerful story makes movie is wonderful, already received positive feedback from viewers.I can only say it's not exactly my style
Aamir Khan acting was now a separate level.",7,0,0,29 January 2019
We're the Millers," average movie,don't recommend this
","I've seen this film many times and I've always said I'll watch it later,
I thought the movie was a good comedy because my expectations were very high because the players were very high quality and the players I loved,but after watching the film was below my expectations.firstly I would like a comedy film to make you laugh, but I've laughed a lot during the movie, some of the good jokes were really funny but there were a few shortages of them.The general issue was initially attracted to me, and I even liked it, but then there was some nonsense I think the script doesn't connect well, even for a comedy movie.In general it is an average movie you can watch a day when you have free time but I don't recommend it very much.",6,2,4,14 October 2018
Silver Linings Playbook," Nice Movie to Watch (8.5)
","Another great movie from David O. Russell they often use the same lead actors(Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Robert De Niro) the cast was great and the cast was good and it was beautifully reflected in this movie.The subject is beautiful, different story, scenario strong interesting at the same time funny and sometimes emotional and romantic as in every film that reflects the style of the director, we see confusion and strange family relationships within the family. Joy movie is very similar in terms of family relations I like your style.Just the end of the movie seemed a little simple to me it felt like they finished quickly. Maybe they should have given Nikki more time. We could only see the words she said in her ear it was a short scene that the name in the whole movie
I think it could have been a good enough movie.",8,1,1,28 January 2020
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Classic Story but a Very Different Concept (5.4)
","Classic story but a very different concept I liked this concept, it was more action, more enjoyable but the movie is not good simple and the visual effects are bad the scenario also sucks especially towards the end.The action scenes were very choppy so it shows that it's not good some action scenes are ridiculous, if a better job emerged in this concept, I'm sure the sequel would come.The acting was not a problem either, the casting team was successful and the environment created was good and draws you into the movie but the movie couldn't continue as it started, it got very simple towards the end and it made me uncomfortable.
I think it's not a good movie, it's simple but it is watched",5,1,1,3 February 2020
Spider-Man," With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility (8.1)
","The most beautiful film in the Spiderman series maybe because it's the first time I love it so much or because I watched it as a kid but I think this is the most successful film.
Although it was shot in 2002, it was both emotional and funny and immersive
of course the effects were bad because it was shot in 2002, but it doesn't matter if there is a good scenario,also acting very good quality and Toby is best Spiderman",8,0,1,18 July 2019
Dunkirk," Among the top 5 war movies
","Inspired by a true story.I've watched a lot of war movies before and dunkirk is definitely one of the top 5 war movies that really impressed me.Why is it so ridiculous or bad for me in the movie why the frenches stay behind when the English get away.
it is said to be very wrong there are more than 300.000 troops there rather than being open target on the beach is a little better than resistance.
this is not like movie criticism. If it is so in history, of course they can not change it, but it hurts me to hunt into clear target.
the movie goes on at different time intervals and shows us the events with different eyes, for example we see the fall of a plane both in the eyes of the pilot and also in the eyes of the person using the boat below.war scenes, and even the entire backdrop of the movie, the music that was playing was beautiful, it was full of thrill hits, the battle scenes were pretty realistic, you feel like in the war and you witness those difficulties.the war is so bad we once again saw it.I do not know if they are English loves or hate I obviously did not know that they would leave the frenches but in the last stages they helped the soldiers of the people to emigrate them to save them from the beach.
My favorite scene is Kenneth Branagh saying It is home and the appearance of the boats on the horizon,I can watch this scene many times.our french child, so gibson was freed from all accusations that he was very sorry for his death, but having a very good heart caused his death.
the scenes of battle planes deserve to be nominated until the end of a truly oscar's movie that needs to be appreciated.If he had won, nobody said he did not deserve it.a movie that has already been shot on a beautiful story
BRAVO.",9,0,3,18 August 2018
Ratatouille," Everyone can cook
","Brad Bird and his team have done a tremendous job, and the incredible family movie is so beautiful.After 3 years, he filmed this film and it's a great job
I love this sentence Everybody can cook Everybody can make it all That's enough that you can never believe and never see yourself as a beautiful message Even a rat that is seen as a dirty can be a perfect cook
I was disturbed by the fact that the rat's brother was so overpriced that there were so many sudden movements in the kitchen, and every minute I got the feeling that something would be overturned and obviously I was very uncomfortable
it is the sudden movements of our main character, but it makes me very happy that even the hardest person of criticism on the final scene is softened with a tremendous meal. Yes, I am bored sometimes, but I like it.",9,0,0,27 July 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Less Peter Parker more Spiderman (7.7)
","Much different from the first 3 film series it is again about how Peter is a spiderman but with a different concept.Firstly the effects have been much better, player choices I can say right but I still think that Tobey Maguire is a better Peter Parker maybe not a better spiderman, but peter parker reflected his life wellIn the first 3 films Peter Parker saw more of his life was further processed In this film, the action scenes are more and the adventures of the spiderman more processed.",8,1,2,16 January 2020

","Inside out you know nothing about movie when you look at just the name without knowing anything strange but beautiful,it makes you wonder.
I watched this comment the second time I watched after winning the oscar prize for this movie.
the first word to say about the movie is a super idea that people are entering into the brain, memories and their perfect emotions that control them.
Happiness,Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust can not live without them, filmin is trying to tell us all together
a wonderful message to everyone, not just children, everyoneeeefrankly I am very satisfied with the inside out BRAVO",9,3,7,13 August 2018

","Again is a very nice Liam Neeson movie. If you guess who usually makes such films while watching the script, if the scenario is not good. I watched this movie with my family and we could not have guessed who the bad guy was. 
Thrill has not even fallen for a moment, the director is always doing these kinds of movies and really mastering it 
Liam Neeson and Jaume Collet-Serra have always liked the movies they have made together, and neither is it so bad, nor is it very nice to have a moderate viewing pleasure

It Follows," not as beautiful as exaggerated I didn't even like it (4.3)
","When I first saw the film, the criticism and the high score raised my expectations. I thought this movie was really good.First of all, it's a horror movie, and first, it has to scare the audience and he certainly didn't make it. I never understood the subject anyway I mean, I couldn't focus on what year the film went through. There were so many unexplained events that I had a hard time focusing on the film never expected such a complicated movie. The scores are so overrated I don't like it so does not deserve high scores.If we go to the events that I like in the film, that the spiritual being comes directly to you and no one else sees it. I liked the idea of looking directly at you but the movie was not nice.",4,1,1,12 January 2020

Throughout the film, you can predict the turn of a job at home, but you can not predict exactly what it is.yes it will be absolutely dangerous something is sure to happen but it is hard to guess what it is,what it is,what it isObviously I could not figure it out at the end of the idea that people would get into their brains surprised me, I thought more simple things like slaves and rose did not expect it to be in this job, it was a question that I thought was good and surprised me
In general I really like the filmin topic, I won the academy prize in the best screenplay category I must say that you absolutely deserve it I could say a better film than this one because I do not call the film bad but it just might be better I like the film in general I just found the final scene a bit nasty was a bit simple
I could not have liked Chris's things very easily, and I could not have liked that kind of scenes.",8,0,2,10 August 2018
Aladdin," Far below my expectations Princess Jasmine(Naomi Scott) so beautiful (5.3)
","Aladdin made a box office much better than expected and suddenly caught everyone's attention,it was already a highly anticipated film,even the production company didn't expect it to make that much money,It was a film that I was very curious about and my expectations were too much, but it was below my expectations.
Actually i dont like director guy ritchie at all especially after his last film arthur, I think you couldn't get big budget movies but not so he has directed Aladdin.
A remarkable story that the film could have been much nicer already has a certain audience,I think too much gin is the lead role The story is not processed beautifully I think it could be better briefly.Princess jasmini (naomi scott) has been a very good choice, it was really great and the role was incredibly affordable",5,1,2,22 October 2019
The Incredibles," This is my childhood
","This movie is very important to me in the first movie I watched the movie then I was 7 years old I went with my mother. I can not look at it very objectively, but my score is 10 and I will always have a very precious place in my life",10,1,1,23 July 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Pleasant to watch, weak story but I like it (7.5)
","First of all, it was a pleasant film, although it received a lot of bad reviews I think we can say a good movie. Much better in terms of visual effects compared to the previous spiderman series, of course, the reason for this is the difference in years.If we look at the beginning of the film briefly I liked the first plane scene in the first film they continued the subject.
later battle scenes visual effects according to the first film did not develop much in terms of, in fact, the biggest difference of amazing spiderman we watched too many spiderman, but I didn't see much of peter parker's own life so I think the first three Spiderman movies more beautiful than this series.
just focus on the action and forget the Peter Parker I felt like Peter Parker was just investigating his family.I didn't like the bad character it should be used another bad character in my opinion instead of Electro.
Harry Osborn was also a very short battle scene as the goblin came to the last scene of the film, and it seems to me that they wanted to keep it in the sequel, just like they had a preview and we don't enough see harry and peter friendship.They've skipped too many topics and focused more on the action instead I think they could have done better than the first series.",8,2,2,16 January 2020
Coco," one of the best movies i've seen (9.8)
","I don't remember an animated film that impressed me so much really nice to make me cry every time the story, the subject is very strong and great songs both make people happy and sad.Deserved to be one of the 5 best animated movies I've seen the audience also received great reviews and good results at the box office what can I say also won the oscar in the best animation category is tremendously good.",10,0,0,16 January 2020
Clash of the Titans," Bad movie but a good story(5.4)
","I think the effects are actually good compared to the year,there is a good story a scenario that everyone is interested in but too much confusion with such a beautiful story, I think a better film could be made.
a movie you won't get bored watching action packed also adventurous but insufficient , the worst part is that the final scene is ridiculous, unnecessary and short.",5,2,2,12 September 2019
A Bug's Life," Beatiful movie Credit scene was spectacular
","Was a beautiful animated film.I watched this movie always came to mind ANTZ movie.I think it was released a month ago(ANTZ)of course while watching bugs life compared with antz movie.The story is the same both of which tell the life of the ants there is an ant in the colony that is different from the other ants and this ant is excluded from the other members are excluded.I've seen this film 3-4 times compared to 98 years I think the graphics are quite successful already in this style films always enjoy the audience.A group of grasshopper gangs and the antz when unity get rid of most beatiful part of the film that grasshopper gangs they know it and fear it.At the end of the film has a great credit scene in my favorite part of the film, I put this behind the scenes images I think this super idea I love the end of the film was a beautiful film.",8,2,2,20 March 2019
Sinister," Like the ring movie same subject but little different
","Firstly what do you expect from a horror movie?The answer is scary you.I think that it succeeds.
Frankly I'm scared, but the points as low as the reason why other horror movies I find a little more absurd.Let's explain that the main event in our movie children,
this creature is effective when you watch the same as in the ring movies but whoever watches this time comes home and only affects the children in that house.Same like the ring movie just a little over played.
I actually like it, but it's ridiculous that the children actually did the murders, as we learned at the end of the film.Some events it is absolutely impossible that the kids can not.it was an average movie, but as I said at the beginning, it managed to scare me.",6,0,0,15 January 2019
3 Idiots," WATCH BEFORE DIE
","Let me tell you that before you watch this movie you think it's just a funny movie but it's definitely not.I cried at least 5 times throughout the film, this is not a funny movie,I think you can't watch it crying.
also I really like my score 10 a movie that should be watched in schools all over the world.
I would recommend to anyone a super movie that comes to the top of the opinion of the best Indian movies",10,0,1,15 November 2018
Beauty and the Beast," not very good but a enjoyable enough movie (7.6)
","I think it's a great adaptation of a tale, cast team correctly chosen, I just did not fit Dan Stevens the role of beats.
A story that will always be watched with interest has been transferred without changing too much, the acting is great. Of course, it could be done better but the costumes, places, visual effects were all good.
It was made more musically which gives people a different joy but maybe a little less.I like it is not very good but nice enough",8,0,0,6 April 2020
Some Like It Hot," Watch to be happy:)))
","I watched this film at the age of 14-15, I liked it very much and wanted to watch it again and it was as nice as I remember.
I think we laughed so much that almost everyone would be happy to watch this movie.Jack Lemmon fascinates you with his acting really he plays the role and makes us feel it was one of the best acting I've seenMy favorite and most laughing scene was the dance scene of jack lemmon and Joe E.Brown duo,is probably one of the best scenes in the history of cinema.would definitely recommend to everyone.wonderful movie a masterpiece.but of course there are some bad aspects of ridiculous scenes, but you don't wear them too much.",9,0,0,17 December 2018
Thor," I continue the Marvel series and Thor is a different pleasure (7.2)
","Thor is a mystical god and watching his story gives it a separate pleasure because the subject is interesting we travel to different universes and planets. It is more enjoyable to watch than other Marvel films.I think the visual effects were successful, the subject was nice, but the action is not enough.
There are ridiculous scenes and it sounded like total integrity could not be achieved, I would have expected the end of the movie better.
Still good and enjoyable.",7,0,0,30 May 2020
The Shape of Water," Good Movie but not the Oscar
","I think it's a super movie as I said in the title. It's got a great story. The acting is even great, but I do not think it's the shape of water among the nine movies that are nominated for the best film this year.
Guillermo del Toro has officially created a new world, which again has beautiful backgrounds as in every movie.
I liked the Crimson Peak movie before that but I could not show success in the same way.I am very pleased that Guillermo del Toro has succeeded in this film, which is a favorite of almost every film.Now let's just say that I'm not really a super movie but I did not give a lot of information about the creature and I could not understand some places for example, what is this creature, what is the place, how it got in and how it got caught. 
Why all the people behaved close to the elisa while torturing him and he did not see him as a monster
the super powers of creation could do a lot of things, but I could not understand some of the details about it, so I finally remember how Elisa eventually turned into something like that and the scar was on the other side.but the movie really took me to a whole new world. It was so beautiful that it was like I was really living if I was not in a movie. Finally I like the movie very much but I do not think it is good enough to win the best movie award.",8,2,4,12 August 2018
The Wolf of Wall Street," SELL ME THIS PEN
","Found the beginning of the film a little mixed.ok the stock market world is in a very fast and mixed world, I tried to reflect it in the film but it came to me too complicated yet.
I couldn't focus very well on some scenes.The only negative idea for the movie is that it has to be complicated in all its exceptions that have been transferred to the audience as well as everything else should be very well selected not only the very best players in the background but each player has done his job very well in the background.When I watched the film, I didn't know it was from a real story or even a real person.
I would like to say without saying a lot of the film is very nice I was already nominated for the academy award at the same time the imdb 250 has succeeded in entering the list, ie, both critics and audiences have managed to take the note was nice.",8,1,3,4 October 2018
It Chapter Two," The First Movie was much more better (7.2)
","I didn't like it in the first movie, but the accumulation scenes have increased and definitely, the quality has also increased so there is an increase in money spent on film.Did not enjoy the first movie, perhaps because of the growth of children and the change of the cast I couldn't adapt to the film again after years I could have liked it if children continued it is not bad now but below my expectation, although the cast is very good.",7,0,1,20 January 2020
Wonder Woman," Best DC Movie but bad visual effects
","Dc film series continues to improve itself every day.I think they will be able to reach the marvel level.
actually Wonder Woman was a less budgeted film than other dc movies,the visual effects of the film were bad, of course because of the low budget,I didn't find the film's visual effects enough, but it was a nice superhero movie.I like the film to pass in time of world war,there wasn't much action, so there was no big war.Last scene contained really good messages and was very emotional.I wish I would continue the movie at the same time, but I think we will return to the present, at least Batman will participate in the film.But the main reason why so much appreciation is collected is that I think the universe that is different and that it is really a world war.I like this movie most among the dc movies,it would be a super movie if they were spending so much money.At the beginning of the film was passed too quickly to pass the subject just wanted to tell the life of a little wonder woman, but could be more beautiful.",8,3,4,25 February 2019
The Croods," Follow The Light (8.2)
","A great animated film that I was not bored even though I watched it many times.
I wanted the sequel to come after 7 years when they passed they decided to make the sequel it's a little late but even the movie is coming is enough because there is a beautiful story, a wide world suitable to continue new adventures.
There may even be another movie after the second film I think it watched without boring.Both fun and action at times funny a movie that's almost beautiful enough to cry in some scenes.
Father and daughter relationship worked wonderfully There were a lot of ridiculous events, but this is a animation film shouldn't be too stuck.",8,0,0,9 February 2020
Iron Man," The Beginning of Everything (7.4)
","The beginning of the legendary marvel series, Iron Man has been a superhero as big as Batman and Superman in the past 12 years and of course, RDJ has a big effect on this.If we were to film, the effects were good compared to 2008. I liked the script too, Jon Favreau is now a proven director.
It was a totally beautiful movie, the bad character was chosen well, and the beautiful acting is a great movie, the action is over, which didn't bother me, I like it.",7,0,0,4 February 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," I think it was a nice movie
","I didn't understand why so many bad comments were coming, so it wasn't a very good movie but it didn't deserve so bad reviews.DC started a new series in the first film(Man Of Steel) about the Superman , which was the second film while Batman V Superman, although it was actually a bit of a batman-weighted film, at least giving it an impression.
I like the movie, I like the batman, maybe I like this movie so I like it.but frankly the scenes script all came to me beautiful,I didn't like the last battle scene thats itI also liked the fact that the death of the superman added an emotional atmosphere to the film.",8,9,11,15 October 2018
Blade Runner," Created Universe is a Wonderful
","I want to say first thing about this movie,I like the universe I created.In 1982 I would never wait for a successful job like this,a wonderful universe with limited resources created us to tell the future in a very beautiful way.I think the movie could be little more fast than better.I think the movie could be little more fast.didn't bother me but could tighten viewers who didn't know the blade runner movie.
if I had to talk about acting, I think it was all great,old players are really different.I've always enjoyed it throughout the film but there were some flaws in it, too,in 1982, I attributed the lack of resources",8,1,1,15 January 2019
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," annoying me about the film narrating and speed but still good (7.1)
","I've seen it for years before watching this movie, and I thought I'd have to watch it one day at a time. After all, a Woody Allen film and the cast interested me very well especially film go through Barcelona and Woody Allen may be the director introducing perhaps the best of cities.I think if we go to the movie I was disturbed by someone telling the film if someone tells the film, I find it difficult to get into the world of film, and in movies like these, getting into the film is very important to get the characters exactly. Of course, the rapid flow of time forced the film too fast transitions.
other than that the film was nice, of course, Woody Allen is not the best film but beautiful",7,0,0,13 January 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," a little silly according to the first film
","I want to compare with the first movie.I think it was worse than the first film,it became more popular,earned more money, but I think the first movie was much nicer.Firstly this movie was a bit silly, especially some scenes were irrational.I love john wick movie I enjoyed the continuation of the series and I look forward to a big third film.I'm sure this will be better than this movie.In general terms john wick love the universe he created with mafias.
a very different world has been created for us and we are entering that world for 2 hours.Keanu Reeves playing the role exactly as it should be.He is very well handled by the sense of revenge he is going to make us wonder until the end of the film allows us to stay connected to the end and find the bad man to serve his fine.I have very positive thoughts about john wick in general and it should definitely continue the series but this movie was bad and ridiculous compared to the first film.",7,0,1,26 January 2019
Annihilation," Interesting movie,great director,worth the watch (8.1)
","Alex Garland previous film ex machina it was very nice and I was looking forward
to your next movies and the second film annhilation actually met my expectation
but it was no better than ex machina.
it was a very different movie Alex Garland's head is really hard to understand this guy is in a very different size then i can't imagine how the next film will be but great.
If we go to the film at the beginning of the film still can not understand Kane show up,five women come into the glow they all have their own reasons so far everything is good but It is not known what a complete complexity it is.
We already knew from the very beginning that only lena would be survive from glare we just watched how other women would die, and it seems to me that they all died in a ridiculous and meaningless way.
I watched in excitement every minute that locked me on the screen, wondered what would happen and answered the biggest question
it would be even better if it was just a few details",8,2,4,18 October 2019
Incredibles 2," First movie came out I am 7 years old and now 21 years old
","Incredibles is my first movie watched in cinema.When I watched the first film, I was 7 years old, and now I'm 21 years old and I am interpreting this movie.When people think of a little Incredibles always in my place I will never forget these movies never forget first.I thought after the first film that it was about the war with the mole, but I think they found a better evil character.I just think Bob is a bit behind according to the first film,so my favourite character is bob can't see him fighting more in this movie.It was more a film on elastic girl,I wish I could see Bob more so I'd love to see him fighting,I didn't really understand the Jack Jack thing, too, when the superheroes were more than just baby, or is it just for jack jack.
I think it was a great movie",9,1,1,30 March 2019
Me Before You," Definitely read the book (6.7)
","Adapting a book to a movie is really hard work but wasn't bad in this movie, missed some events and even some of the main characters like his sister it wasn't bad anyway, but again, it's hard to adapt a book to a movie.I could not get the emotions I got from the book from the movie. I was not upset in the same way but it was enjoyable to enter music and of course the places were magnificent, it was chosen better than I imagined.
it was a pleasant movie, however, the best work place choices made by the movie.",7,0,0,15 June 2020
