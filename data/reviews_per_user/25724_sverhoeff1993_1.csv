Resident Evil: Afterlife," If you liked the previous films, don't watch this one
","Loved the first resident evil films, absolutely loathe this one. The only thought that went through my head during this film is, 'Why...?' Literally everything that happens, does so completely randomly, with no explanation whatsoever. The special effects are preposterous and fake. You can see the green screens; the fire of a gun nozzle which is focused on in the first shot, magically disappears in the second shot; the shadows of the animated doors weren't even rendered. There is no proper plot and no character development of any kind. This film, if you praise it enough to even call it that, is an embarrassment for the film industry and blasphemy for the resident evil saga. Then again, a film based on a game based on a film is a ridiculous in the first place...",1,0,2,22 December 2010
