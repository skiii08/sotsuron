Blade Runner 2049," NOT a mindless action movie
","Make no mistake, there IS plenty o' action in this movie... but it's not one mindless crazy scene after another. OK, bad to good - the worst thing I could say is that sometimes the dramatic pauses are a little too long. It can be a little long winded. Then again, sometimes the pauses, tho too slow, allow you to see the full scope of the 'stage'. WOW!
 Now on to the good! The plot is poignant and deep. Would humans bicker and kill one another when there is no work to be done and everyone is well fed. Would we fight one another for power when there is nothing to gain but power itself?
 This movie deals with every modern problem we have with society as a whole. Ay... it'll make you look in the mirror before it's done.
 It's also visually fantastic.",9,1,8,28 July 2018
