Insidious: Chapter 2," No Sleep Lost
","To be fair, some people will love this film. Its not for everyone and if you were even the slightest bit disappointment in the first I would waste your time. It is mild and a gradual plot.The suspension is variable but is aided by a dramatic score.The initial back story is a elaborate, but ensures it is not essential to watch the prequel first. The plot is predictable with characters making obvious statements of where the plot is going. It was not needed and would of been more suspenseful without. I thought some of the characters where poorly developed, and their attempts of funny one liners distracted and interrupted the theme.The climax gave us a glimpse into of the potential of this film with a dramatic fight scene, too little too late unfortunately. The film concluding with foresight into the sequel. Another one to miss I Think.",4,2,3,30 January 2014
Sinister," Terrible film, not worth watching.
","I rented this movie after being recommended. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this movie in the slightest. The movie lacked suspense and was very predictable. Character development was overlooked, the characters relationships were unrealistic and after 15 minutes I was left not caring about their well being. The child actors were terrible and the wife's accent was distracting and not explained.The attempted horror elements were cheap and boring. The shocks and pop ups of the villain/villains, accompanied by a bland score, were obvious and unsatisfactory. Plot points introduced through were not finalized. Overall the structure and delivery of 'Sinister' is horrific and not the way intended by producers. This movie isn't even worth watching for laugh factor.",1,22,45,5 September 2013
