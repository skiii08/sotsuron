Blade Runner 2049," One of the worst sequels ever
","This is actually not a sequel of Blade Runner, this is just a boring streched story about androids ('replicants') packed into something that was supposed to copy the visuals and the atmosphere of the first movie. But director Denis Villeneuve is not at the level of a Ridley Scott, he is far away from his league and it is visible in every shot. Nor a script is worth mentioning because the whole story of this movie can be summarized in just half an hour of normal video. Everything is predictable, boring and deliberately slowed down to the maximum, as if the director made this for himself and not the wide audience. Compared to this misery, the first Blade Runner
is a masterpiece in which Harrison Ford (opposed to a rather unconvincing, pretentious Gosling) carries a film that still looks like a superb artwork with unmistakable atmosphere, scene and music, linked to an interesting story. So I'm pretty disappointed with this movie because I really did expect a much, much more. Gave it 4 stars just because of old Ford and that famous title. But this should be called 'Bored to the death'. Wish I didn't spent that 2 and half hours watching this.",4,1,3,6 January 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The worst movie of 2014
","I have to admit that probably never looked more boring blockbuster of this. Stretched to the pain, the enforced acting, empty dialogues, in two hours absolutely nothing worth mentioning, aside from the great James Howard's song sung by Jennifer Lawrence (The Hanging Tree). Unfortunately, I was expecting a lot more after the first two episodes, although we all should be clear when they changed the original decision to extend the trilogy in four parts. The horror of this desperately poor screenplay could not be mended nor sound actors. Hollywood seems to run out of steam... This garbage was never meant to be taken and company should pay back the money to people and even compensate them for mental anguish and lost time watching this disaster. Big thumb down! (and ready rotten tomatoes)",1,21,30,21 February 2015
Fury," Poor copy of Stallone's Expendables
","The first part of the film is excellent, in the style of the best war films, to the second part turned into a grotesque version of the already grotesque Rambo. SPOILERS FROM NOW ON! --Especially in the last half hour reminds me of some kind of parody in which the main character (Pitt) like Rambo stands alone for a machine gun and shoot the waves of evil enemies, he kills them over fifty; Alone against all - Johnny Rambo. And while he is wounded, hit with bullets, he shoots, does not stop courageously shooting till the last bullet/breath ... then hit with ten wounds fall back into the tank and sacrifice for the guy who stayed last. Of course, after explosion of two grenades inside the tank, Pitt's body is untouched?? To make things even funnier, in one of the last scenes German soldier looked our last survivor shining in his eyes with LED lamp ... I mean - WTF? I could not believe that someone could direct something this stupid and sell it under serious movie about the war. Very insane, but mostly nothing new in American cinema, which is more and more stupid. Unfortunately, although the film has a lot of promises, eventually in the end turned into a bad copy of Stallone's Expendables.",6,0,4,16 January 2015
This Is the End," This is the... most idiotic movie
","This is totally disaster. Comedy? Yeah, maybe for stupid American teenagers. For the rest of us, this movie is so stupid, so boring that I'm asking myself am I crazy or stupid when I watched it...His only rival in this genre 'moronic movie for moronic generation' may be Hangover...I wonder which idiot gave the budget for this or maybe this nonsense still selling (more dumber world)?Nowadays we have a bunch of nonsense called 'comedy' - a bunch of bizarre perversion, bare buttocks, penis erect, heads and limbs torn, blood and excrement, drugs and the like ... but no story, no dialogs, no subtle humor... I said too much, this does not even deserve toilet paper.",1,12,27,22 September 2013
The Hateful Eight," One of the worst Tarantino's movies
","I watched almost all his movies, but this ... this is difficult even to call the film. This was merely recycling old themes and sentences from Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction and virtually all his other works and putting it in almost two motionless scenes. Blah, blah, blah, shoot, blah, blah, blah, waiting for something, but nothing, blah, blah, shoot, blah again, shoot, hectoliters of blood, guts, and again - stupid, arrogant, tedious sentences about raping and killing. If not from a notorious Tarantino, this would just be easy to call a complete garbage and crap that steals almost 3 hours of your life. The main story is so many times told, and indeed it was tedious to watch and listen to all these stupid and boring dialogues (absolutely unnecessary!) for almost 3 hours. To finale: Tarantino's usual ranting massacre and descriptions of homosexual rape. It seems to me that Tarantino himself has a nasty psychological problems that heals through his films. Thumbs down. Hard to decide which is worst - Inglorious Basterds or this... What really bother me is Tarantino's immaturity. Although he is almost 53, he still makes shallow movies without any deeper analysis of characters and events. Something like those stupid kung fu movies which he adores.",2,6,12,24 April 2016
Interstellar," How stupid they think we are?
","Thanks to good critics and media hype I've decided to get rid off of 3 hours of my life. Sadly, most of the movie I was bored. Story is so shallow and predictable - in very beginning I concluded that her's father is writing those messages (every average sci-fi reader knows some theories of black-hole), and movie has some serious intellectual and emotional issues.First of all, Matthew McC. is solid actor, but he isn't charismatic as Al Pacino or even Tom Cruise. He is always the same. Same face, same grimaces, same tone. And now... he is flying in a spaceship through the whole space and boarding space station without problems after 10 or 15 years of inactivity... are you serious?? How stupid you think we are? And cryogenic sleep - they are immediately ready to go after it and jumping around like jolly rabbits?All characters aren't written well. They are very plane and somewhat emotionally distracted. At the end - Matthew is coming after the greatest achievement in human history, I repeat: greatest achievement in human history - but nobody even look at him..??? HALLOOOOOO???All in all, it would be a lot better movie if they cut bullshits, and give us more 'space-feeling' (something like those in Space Odyssey or Gravity), sound and vision, and turn actors in real human beings.Purposely, I didn't talk about some scientific imperfections, because we don't know much about anything. Even serious scientists changing their mind every few weeks, from ordinary things to black hole, they aren't sure in almost anything. Maybe it is stupid premise that man from the future is sending coordinates to go in space, although he at first said himself not to go? But hey, this is just a movie. So, I will not bother you with things that may or may not be scientific true and are in writers domain. But sadly, I must recognize that even after FORTYSIX YEARS Hollywood isn't capable of producing so massive, magnificent and intellectually thrilling space-movie as Kubrick's Space Odyssey was!Yeah, good old Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke... made it in 1969, and that masterpiece is still immense!Shame on you, greedy Hollywood bastards.Thumb down.",6,4,7,6 April 2015
Lucy," Nothing specially, just Besson
","Luc Besson with this film continues its tradition of female heroine, a super woman that easily kill dozens of men with guns. Luc is not a great director but we can not deny him a sort of charm which all his films have - as to have a signature, you just know that the director is Besson. This is light mixture of Matrix and 2001 O.i.S., not bad but not good either. Scarlett in this film played solidly, but we must admit without those of her sexy lips half of the film would not be good. All in all, a fun movie that will entertain in less than an hour and a half, and those younger or less intelligent left in doubt what are they actually watching. Although the film itself has a lot of voids and familiar Besson's visual images, Freeman and Johansson make this movie interesting. As for the end of the film, the message is: live your life, it is worth and the only thing that actually makes it valuable, paradoxically, is time. So take the time and the knowledge that you have, grow and enjoy in life. But remember - without our human feelings, without love we are monsters.",6,1,4,6 January 2015
