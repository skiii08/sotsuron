Blade Runner 2049," This movie is such a conundrum.
","The reason I say that is, after really thinking about the movie afterwards, I really don't think there is any one thing that could have done better. I truly believe that in all the segments, they made the right choices on how to film the scenes. The major problem is though, thats what the movie really feels like, A collection of Scenes. And no matter how perfect they are, just a string of scenes does not a great movie make. Then there is the story. I would say the movie is brutally honest to the topics it's trying to portray. And that point is all about lacking emotion. And thus, the entire movie, lacks emotion and feelings to it. Every time there is a glimmer of hope, you think he may have a 'breakthrough' of feeling, they pulled it away. Making you just feel dis-heartened. Other Major issue is it's linearity; There is nothing unexpected, and no deviation to sub stories or sub plots to the movie. Its just dead ahead one scene to the next, following the single and only thread. Really kills any drama steals the life out of you, if you are hoping for just one thing unexpected to happen. Well, it doesn't. There is a reason no one likes Linear games, where there are no options, and movies are the same way. 
Even the ending is a giant let down I think. Throughout the movie, your rooting for the robots to overcome themselves, and evolve. And it never happens. Its just one giant disappointment.
<ul><li>So for visuals sake, and masterful work on the look of the scenes, I would say pretty flawless. </li><li>The emotions the movie make you feel&gt;? Are as empty as the emotions of the replicates. Either the Perfect job of making the audience feel heartless and emotionless, or a failure of a movie. Personally, i want to love a movie, not have something that makes me feel emotionally drained completely. Thanks.</li></ul>",5,4,8,6 March 2018
