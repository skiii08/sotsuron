50 First Dates," Horrible start, but give it a chance
","My wife and I were thinking of walking out after about half an hour, but we're glad we didn't. This movie started out horrible, suddenly got much funnier and more interesting, and ended up being a nice romantic comedy.I guess the term to describe this movie is 'wildly uneven'.",7,0,0,14 February 2004
Signs," Overdramatic, not scary, and full of holes (spoilers)
","The actors in this movie seem to have been told that the whole movie rested on every line of dialogue. I don't think I've ever seen another movie with such overdramatic acting.For example, SFC Cunningham was nothing but a parody of a military guy in an old horror film. If this film was meant to be taken seriously, (and I think it was), then that character was just a horrible disruption of whatever mood the director was trying to set. That happened over and over.
So many acts by the characters didn't make any sense! Merrill went up from the basement to check the house, and even though there was an axe handy, he went up empty handed! Also, the aliens are smart enough to get here, but not smart enough to bring raincoats? Come on...The style of the movie was too much like Hitchcock - right down to some of the music, and while I was startled a couple of times, but I was never scared. I was really disappointed in this movie.",4,1,1,1 September 2002
