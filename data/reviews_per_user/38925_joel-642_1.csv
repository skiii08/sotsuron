The Legend of Bagger Vance," Inspiring story could have had a better lead actor
","A truly inspiring story about a talented golfer battling his past demons. Will Smith is on top of his game with this performance as the mythical figure 'Bagger Vance' who poses as Rannulph Junuhs (Damon) caddy. Matt Damons golf and acting skills are what prevent me from giving this movie a much higher grade. I need this main character to retain some golf skill to at least make his character believable on the introductory level and Damon fails right off the bat during the first ball hitting scene. Joel Gretsch's abilities as a golfer (Bobby Jones)and actor would have been better suited to take over this lead role and make it a truly believable story.(But Damon packs them in the house) As far as golf stories it ranks among the tops of all time. Pitting two of the games legends, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen against an unlikely but heralded local opponent, Rannulph Junuh. Charlize Theron, I believe, is at her peak of starlet beauty in this movie. She overpowers the screen with a presence of only the biggest stars of Hollywood past. If you can overlook Damon's performance, this movie will leave you with a feeling of inspiration and satisfaction.Will Smith(inspiring), Charlize Theron(stunning beauty), Joel Gretsch (believable and charming), Matt Damon (forgetful and wrongly cast)",8,1,3,5 February 2009
