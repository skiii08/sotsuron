Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phantom Menace Review
","I just saw Episode 1 (Luscasfilm employee screening).  Let me tell you, it is worth the 16 year wait.  The critics are (once again) wrong.I am not a Star Wars fanatic.  I loved the trilogy, but am not a crazy man about them.  Speaking as a movie fan, there is plenty to love about Phantom Menace - Lots of action, mystery, fun, explosions, saber fights, good guys, bad guys, duplicitous guys, deception, betrayal, and lots of anticipation for Episodes 2 and 3 to see what happens next.  It is a sign of a good movie when you care enough to WANT to know what happens in the sequel.And don't be concerned about the negative reviews about the acting.  There is no embarrassment, no horrible miscasts.  I loved Neeson and McGregor, and I thought Portman did a fabulous job.  In fact, I liked her acting and her character more than Lea.  Nobody is gonna see this movie without falling a little bit in love with her.In short, it stands up well with 4,5 and 6.  In terms of pacing and temperament, it reminded more of Empire than anything else.  This movie is quite good, and you all have something real special to look forward to.  I myself will see it again real soon - hard to catch a lot of the details seeing it just once, and we all know the beauty in these films is in the detail.Star Wars fans and fanatics - we should all be proud!",9,0,0,15 May 1999
