In Bruges," Unusual Crime Drama
",This action drama centers around three characters from a criminal organisation. Two hit men and their boss become involved in a situation that creates unusual circumstances and outcomes. The relationship between the characters are complex and change continually throughout the movie. The movie is also set in a town in Belgium which creates a different setting and environment from the main characters own experience.

Many of the characters are quirky giving the movie a slight art house appeal. They acting is great which allows the usual characters to be believable in the situations at hand.

Blade Runner," Classic Science Fiction Thriller
",One of the all time classic science fiction thrillers. The essential idea surrounds the development of humanoids who become a threat to society. The story develops around a 'Blade Runner' who is assigned to stop this threat. The movie then brilliantly blurs the difference between the humanoids and humans. This is achieved by showing relationships between the humanoids and humans. Also the extreme difficulty of detecting the humanoids and their high level of human function further confuses the issues of what is to be human. Many ethical questions are presented especially with the shoot to kill on sight no questions asked elimination of the humanoids by the authorities. The movie also looks at the development of the humanoids in terms of human emotion and their potential to be fully human. An extremely thought provoking movie especially in terms of what it is to be human or not. Again one of the greatest science fiction movie.,8,0,2,11 May 2018
