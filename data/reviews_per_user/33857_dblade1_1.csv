Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," got rid of Bloom and Knightley but still not enough
","The movie is much like its predecessors. It is full of awkward comedy, many clichés and it has overlength.The cast is great. Depp was always a great actor and in this movie, he has proved it. Some of the awkward comedy was really... awkward, but with his performance, it was forgivable. Cruz is amazing as well. She plays her role so well, it blows my mind. She is like a pirate women should be. The other cast from the previous movies are much the same they were. However, the biggest disappointment was the villain Black Beard. He was so boring. There are so many questions without answers about this character. He seems like a bad guy but i am totally not buying it from his appearance. But thumbs up to those mermaids, they looked freaking awesome. I like the fact that they completely changed the way people think of mermaids and turned them into aquatic vampires. big plus there.returning to the story, it has many plot holes and 'action-movie-clichés'. First part, i am not a fan of people using their guns as a bat, and no i don't mean that flying screeching animals. That just makes no sense if they just hit people with those guns. Worst is the fact that the soldiers are stupid, they whether watch Sparrow escape or 6 of them get caught by Sparrow just running through them. The other thing are those unnecessary scenes. There are so many of them and they really don't have any point. They are just lengthen the long movie.So, if you give a damn, for me this movie wasn't so good as Pirates 1. But to be honest, even though i didn't love 2 and 3 as much as 1, but i liked them. I had a good time watching them. I am probably not going to watch those again, but i enjoyed them. So i rate the 4th Pirates movie like 2+3, 7 points out of 10 are more than enough.thanks for reading and i apologize for grammar mistakes, i am not a native English writer nor speaker.",7,0,1,26 May 2011
