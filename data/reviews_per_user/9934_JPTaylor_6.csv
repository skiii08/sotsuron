Casablanca," What more can be said?
","While not a perfect film, Casablanca achieves what few other films have.  It completely immerses the viewer in the era and the atmosphere, offering a journey to the ever distant (yet all too close) world of Casablanca, Morocco during World War II.  It is the hope of thousands (if not millions) of refugees, yet for so many who live there it is a prison - a last, impossibly difficult gate to freedom from the war-torn European countryside.In Casablanca is a night club, Rick's.  It's a self-indulgent gambling, music and drinking joint that's a parody of the American dream in a foreign land.  The piano rings with Sam's melodious delivery of universal themes of love, pain, and cheer.  Below the surface is a circle of intrigue - few tell of their allegiance to the Allied cause, and yet fewer live to spread the word.  Rick Blaine, the owner of the club, walks the fine line of neutrality.Humphrey Bogart, in his portrayal of Rick, is no longer a character but an American icon.  Many of his lines can be quoted, verbatim, by people who have never even seen this film.  His cynical, callous, chain-smoking personality is a mask to hide emotion and protect himself from pain  this is clearly an archetype for countless characters since.  His key philosophy is 'I stick my neck out for nobody.'  Thus, the ultimate struggle of the film is not a frenzied firefight with Nazis or a an elaborate chase scene, but one man's struggle to define himself.Many of the other characters in the film are equally interesting - Casablanca is a film of choices. Ilsa is a French dame who must decide between the man who will never forgive her and the man who needs her more than anyone else.  Victor Lazlo, the leader of an underground resistance movement in Czechoslovakia, must make a choice between his love, and his sense of honor.  Captain Renault is a Vichy officer who must choose between serving the winning side or his own true loyalty.Casablanca is deserving of its near-universal and prolific praise.  It is a film of memorable characters and lines, filled with subtlety and complexity. Once it grips ahold of the viewer, it never lets go.  Aside from a bit of over-acting and some characters somewhat lacking in depth, it is a triumph of cinema.",9,0,1,29 April 2004
Citizen Kane," Deserving of its praise.
","'Citizen Kane' is a film I find truly graceful.  The story is portrayed so elegantly, so subtle and yet simple at the same time.  Its message is not earth-shattering or prophetic - instead, all elements of the film are focused on the small, yet significant story of one man's search for love.The movie follows the life of Charles Foster Kane.  It tells the story of his acquisition of his first newspaper and his rise to power, as well as his slow decay.  But the film is not focused on events, or particular happenings.  Each story aspect is a tool to develop and explore the character of Kane and his journey as a man locked into his own palace.The film's main theme, around which all aspects of the film revolve, can be summed up by the character Leland, college friend of Kane, after Kane's death:  'All here really wanted in life was love'. Ever he needs and demands love, but ever he shoves it away in his search.  Although he is, in the public eye, a bold and charming figure, he is in reality a broken and bitter man attempting to replace his loss with public adoration and material wealth.The meaning of the word 'rosebud' to which the many reporters are searching, I will not reveal here (despite its listing on IMDb as one of the most known movie spoilers of all time according to a recent poll), but I will say that its meaning is simple and yet explains further the theme of the film.  The fact that it is explained to the audience but not to the cast is more tribute to the solitary nature of Kane.'Citizen Kane' is not a movie you can watch passively.  To get a full appreciation of the film you must take in each shot as an individual piece. There is a wealth of subtle symbolism pervading the film, portraying visually the emotions and conflicts of the characters that cannot always be read on their faces, while not detracting from the basic necessities of the story.  Instead, its symbolism is focused in reality.
Consider, for example, a scene depicting Kane, campaigning for an election. Here Kane is seen alone at a podium, a small figure against he backdrop of yet another depiction of Kane - a larger-than-life, intense being, nearly omniscient in his realm.  Yet it is simple to ignore this scene without watching it critically - the backdrop is simply a campaign marketing tool, masking its true purpose, which is to contrast Kane the man with Kane the world-famous tycoon.  Yet this is one of the more obvious examples of symbolism in the film.Yet the film is not perfect.  I found the introductory and concluding scenes of the film rather self-indulgent and clumsy in its symbolism when compared the beautiful and subtle cinematography throughout the rest of the film. It is exaggerated and simple.  Also, I am at a loss as to the meaning of a bird squawking extremely loudly in the middle of a conversation - it is extremely loud and disorienting, although I'm sure it has a purpose.'Citizen Kane' is among the most critically acclaimed films of all time, and for good reason.  The film tells a complex tale that does not cheat the audience through cheap characters or stale storytelling.  It is easily one of the greatest films I have ever seen.",10,3,4,17 November 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A multi-layered black comedy
","Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove' is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen.  Not only is it absolutely brilliant in terms of comedy alone, but it communicates something through its precise satire that most comedies wouldn't dare to contemplate. I am sure that many who saw the film in its first release completely missed its rather negative undertones regarding U.S. policy - and, in fact, it has enough pure entertainment value to be worth seeing anyway.  Yet Kubrick's work is filled with innuendo and subtle insults that may bypass the viewer initally, but once they are noticed are undoubtable.The movie's theme is the nuclear arms race of the Cold War.  General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has ordered a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, without authorization.  After hearing of the news, a prominent general has the unenviable task of explaining to the president in an emergency meeting why World War III is about to begin, and why there is little hope of stopping it.  Eventually a Soviet Union representative informs the U.S. that the Soviet Union has created a Doomsday weapon, programmed to immediately launch a nuclear holocaust that would destroy the world if even one nuclear warhead touches Soviet soil.  The idea is that the Doomsday weapon is completely irrational and irreversibly devoted to its task, thus eliminating any threat by the U.S., as any rational being would not engage in an attack that would destroy the world.  Unfortunately, the attack was launched mere days before the USSR was planning to announce the Doomsday weapon.The actors in this film do not so much play characters as they play characterizations - each character has little depth, as far as personality goes, but represents a satirical element.  Here we see George C. Scott, extremely entertaining in his portrayal of General Turgidson, particularly with his lengthy conversation with the president.  He maintains a distinct even-tempered boyishness throughout the film - ever-passionate about politics, but rather easygoing about everything else, leading to some brilliant comedic dialogue, which will not be revealed here.  Peter Sellers is also amazingly funny, particularly in his role as President - his one-sided telephone conversation with the Soviet Premier is very clever, with perfect comedic timing.  His performance as Dr. Strangelove, a German nuclear physicist, is amusing, although I found the character less interesting than the others, probably because of the more exaggerated personality.The entire film is told in a rather laid-back manner, at least as far as the characters' reactions to the imminent apocalypse at hand.  The characters are perhaps slightly indignant but not outwardly terrified, which contrasts excellently against the earth-shattering power of atomic weapons.  However, they remain doggedly determined to outwit the communists, or at least have slightly more survivors.  This anti-red fervor perpetuates itself throughout the film.Ultimately Kubrick's film is striking and multi-layered - probably remembered as a simple comedy by some, and remembered as a sharp satire of U.S. foreign policy to others.  Regardless, Dr. Strangelove is undoubtedly an excellent film.",9,1,2,12 March 2004
Some Like It Hot," One of the greatest, most insane screwball comedy ever to grace theaters.
","Some Like It Hot is not an incredibly artistic, graceful film with deeply significant themes of love and sacrifice - it's a screwball comedy.  Yet it is remembered as one of the greatest screwball comedies ever to hit theaters.  It is completely over-the-top, filled with unlikely situations, bizarre coincidences and quirky characters.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, playing Joe and Jerry, two down-and-out musicians looking for work in Chicago just before the stock market crash of 1929 that would shove America - and the world - into the Great Depression. The two witness a killing by Al Capone's goons - part of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre - and desperately try to escape to where they will never be found.  Without giving away any details, they find themselves in the midst of a rather precarious situation (today, perhaps a comedy cliché - not so then), involving deception, unrequited love, and relationships with a startling number of combinations of genders.There is a great dynamic between the characters of Lemmon and Curtis.  They are in constant competition to win the heart of Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a rebellious and decidedly naïve woman who has completely given up on men who are not rich enough to own a yacht.  Lemmon and Curtis are constantly bickering and wanting revenge, yet they are forced to cooperate lest they give away their secret to the onlookers.  Their story gets convoluted the point where it is difficult to remember which is which, with the story's extremely tight pace and the many twists along the way.One cannot say enough about the about the brilliant comedic acting seen here.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are funny not merely because of their dialogue, but because of their wild energy.  They slip in and out of roles before they even realize what they're doing, going from complacent to angry to scared witless without missing a beat.  Joe E. Brown is sure to get under your skin as Osgood Fielding III.  And Marilyn Monroe - well, she mostly shows a lot of cleavage.Ultimately 'Some Like it Hot' is a tightly compressed batch of hilarity. There is a reason why it is listed as the American Film Institute's #1 comedy (although this reviewer doesn't entirely agree with that claim). Modern movie-goers shouldn't be turned off by its black-and-white nature; it puts modern buddy comedies to shame.",9,5,8,18 April 2004
Rear Window," It's Hitchcock. What else do you need to know?
","Rear Window, one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous and revered pictures, along with others such as Psycho and Vertigo.  Although the film starts out with a rather slow and meandering pace, it ultimately has the viewer intensely interested.Its plot  is simple - it's the kind of movie that could be explained to someone in a sentence or two, probably eliciting a 'Hey, that does sound like a good idea for a movieÂ…' response.  Jimmy Stewart plays L B. Jeffries, a photographer with a broken leg.  Normally a man of action, looking for adventure, Jeffries is now relegated to sitting in front of his window in his wheelchair for hours at a time.  With little else to entertain him aside from the ever-beautiful Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) and his generously advice-giving nurse Stella(Thelma Ritter), Jeffries looks out the window. And watches.  And watchesÂ…The cast, while good, is not really the memorable part of this movie.  Jimmy Stewart is, well, Jimmy Stewart.  Grace Kelly is a great supporting actress that performs excellently with what could have been a bland role.  And Thelma Ritter provides the comic relief, convincing as lovably quirky with a straightforward and gruesome sense of logic.The film succeeds largely because of it's theme.  It taps into the universal human fear of the unexpected return glance - we spend the entire film praying that it wasn't Jimmy Stewart any given stranger was looking at. This works because the entire film is centered on the lead character's point of view.  For almost the entire movie, we never see a camera angle outside of a single apartment - a feat that gives the characters and the audience a feeling of safety that makes the climax all the more suspenseful. This could not have been accomplished without the film's brilliant cinematography.  The movie effortlessly pulls off extremely complicated panoramas, letting us see the entire neighborhood, with all its quirky details, before revealing that this is all seen from the perspective of a single apartment.The suspense that results is excellent.  Hitchcock has the ability to make a silent phone call more terrifying than anyone else could make the deepest circle of Hell - he seems to possess a brilliant sense of timing and of the audience's reactions.  While it is more of a mystery than a thriller or horror, Hitchcock still manages to manipulate the audience's breath.While the movie was amazing technically and thematically, some might find it to be too slow-paced and unfocused.  For example, I was not particularly interested in the romance that was seemingly inserted into the movie to fulfill some Hollywood checklist.  And without going into specifics, there were a few places in the movie that seemed rather ridiculous.  Still, Hitchcock's masterful control of suspense and its overall intelligence ultimately outweigh any complaints.",8,1,4,29 February 2004
The Godfather," A precise and flowing work
","Mario Puzo's The Godfather is a landmark of cinema.  The three-hour film is the result of an incredibly precise brand of filmmaking.  Despite the fact that the story spans a number of years and thousands of miles, there is a clear, very natural progression throughout the film (with the exception of a subplot or two).  The characters are complex and varied, each playing a specific role that contributes to the story.  The film does admirably well in keeping the story relatively coherent, despite its complexity.In the film, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a powerful crime family in New York.  He arranges killings and is involved in illegal gambling rings, among other things.  Yet to those who love him, he is known as a man of reason and justice.  He is the Godfather - a title of respect and endearment.  Many seek him out for his blessing, his advice  or a favor.  Despite the fact that he is, essentially, a murderer, the movie does an excellent job of making the audience respect him; the deaths he arranges are always justified in some manner to the audience.  They men killed are either other criminals - usually involved in narcotics and other crimes somewhat worse than the Corleones' - or are corrupt in some way, a danger to 'the family' and probably murderers themselves.Vito's family has a hierarchical power structure.  At the top is the first-born, Santino 'Sonny' Corleone (James Caan), hot-headed and vengeful, with a lust for power - he is inverse of the collected and methodical Vito. Then there is Fredo (John Cazale), the ambitious but ultimately incompetent son who is more interested in women and booze than the family business. Finally there is Michael (Al Pacino) - the youngest son who is clearly the central character throughout the film.Michael is a young World War II veteran who wants no part in his father's business.  His signature line is 'That's my family, Kay it's not me.'  He respects his father more than any other man, but he wants to live a different line.  He is a dynamic, fully-realized character that is absolutely convincing.  He is also a very different character at the end of the film - but in a way that is completely consistent with his personality.The film has an excellent pace.  There is an ebb and flow - the film begins rather slowly, then picks up the pace, and rises to the climax of the first act - and then the pace slows once more, only to build up suspense again to a final climax, in which all loose ends are neatly tied.  Never is the audience bored - the story keeps a tight grip on the viewer, ensuring that they wonder as to the fates of the characters even in the slowest parts - a remarkable accomplishment in of itself.The Godfather is a excellent film in every sense of the word - technically, aesthetically, in terms of story and characters, themes and music. It immerses the audience in a completely different - yet perhaps altogether to familiar - world.  It is a classic that is - and will be - rooted in film history.",10,0,2,21 May 2004
