The Hangover," Saw it with the parents AND...
","I came into this movie with absolutely no idea what it was about, no expectations, no clue who was in it. I came out wanting to see it again. And again. And again. I found this comedy a refreshing take on an old idea: bachelor party. I began rolling my eyes when the movie begun with the flashback of the wedding day. But, much to my relief, the plot played out wonderfully, taking me on a fast-paced, funny two-hour ride. It didn't drag, it didn't dwell. It savored those funny moments and moved on. Props to the director.I highly recommend this to everyone, especially those hesitant to seeing it (all my girls). It's not too raunchy (but at the same time still is) and is funny in all the right ways. Be prepared to fall in love with this flick :)",9,2,4,15 June 2009
Twilight," Where 's the Vision?
","Okay, just got out of theatre and let me begin by saying I am a high school girl who went in a big group of friends. I have read all the books and was just interested in seeing how they adapted the story to film (1), and also how well the film by itself as just a movie (2).1) Adaptation: almost spot on. In essence, the movie stuck close to the book and probably pleased the series fanatics as far as storyline. The part of the adaptation that I felt was off was the casting, as many people have commented on. The movie didn't feel: intimate, romantic, fairytale-like, whirlwind, passionate, etc. Aka all the adjectives that describe the books and make them so popular. The characters for the most part 'looked' the role, but not all of them carried it out. Robert was dashingly handsome (although, not what I pictured in my mind), and it seemed like he had a good chance of taking the role to the next level. Unfortunately, I think I would like him better if he just froze with his Ray-Bans on in his suit...because that would be more entertaining than the way he delivered his lines. Bella was another big problem. Kristen perfectly looked the role but she came out being cold instead of passionate, unemotional instead of head-over-heels lusting after this guy.2)As a movie I can say this honestly stunk. :( It moved along choppily, the film editing was all wrong, the soundtrack was wack, and the acting was just not there. Apart from knowing and loving these characters, if you have not read the book you will be asking yourself why there is a 90 minute movie focused on these characters. The build-up, turning point, climax, and resolution were all weak. It is never a good sign when the sold out theatre is laughing at all the wrong times. One to point out would have to be Edward's 'constipation' reaction when he first sees Bella. I know that the reaction is hard to convey on film but..come on.So there it is. Love the books. From page to film this was a wasted opportunity. The intention was there but the vision was not.",3,51,85,21 November 2008
