It," Decent Amount of Nightmare Fuel
","As a non-reader of the book and a non-viewer of the previous theatrical version of IT, I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect. And yet, it somehow was exactly what I expected. The positives of IT- For a child of the 80's, this film is filled to the brim with nostalgia. The settings were perfect for the time period. Movie signs, posters in kid's bedrooms, and clothing were all enjoyably accurate. The bright spot of the show are the childhood bonds developed smartly on screen between this rag tag group of 'losers'. The characters are real, have depth, and it was easy to feel an emotional connection. The file does a good job of flipping between sentimental coming-of-age flick to scare your pants off horror in the blink of an eye. The movie had plenty of laughs and fulfilled one of my major requirements for being able to enjoy a horror- I knew when it was time to be scared and knew when it was time to not. Nothing's more stressful to me than seeing a horror movie that is non-stop anxiety about a jump-out moment. IT is very easy to enjoy during the 'happy' times, and almost always lets you know when it's time to hunker down in your seat for some nightmare fuel. Visually beautiful, well directed and shot, and of course plenty of white knuckle scary clown scenes. Sophia Lillis was an unknown to me and her performance stole the show.The negatives of IT- IT falls into the same trap as most horror movies of trying to resolve a scatterbrained plot line whilst scaring the crap out of its audience. I felt like if I had read the book I'd have been greatly disappointed in the effort to explain the history of why what was happening was happening. Sure the kids discover some things along the way, but at no point whatsoever was the subject of WHY this was happening ever breached. In typical horror fashion, main characters make decisions that no rational human being would ever make, and every adult or figure of authority is either oblivious or absent. The humor was good for a while, but Finn Wolfhard's character (Richie) was basically there only for comic relief and was a bit overdone.Overall I had a good time watching IT. The entire theater was engaged and made it a fun experience. 6/10",6,5,11,13 September 2017
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," 'Not Gay'
","Scenes in this movie had me laughing harder than I've laughed in a long time. Other scenes fell way short. In its entirety, it is worth it to wade through some jokes that missed the mark to enjoy some spot on satire and comedic excellence.The parts that shine in the movie are the songs. Not Gay had me rolling. The portrayal of how pop culture latches itself onto the social issues of the day, regardless of personal beliefs is hilariously accurate.Samberg shows an amazing ability to be a self-absorbed prick and yet somehow still likable. Too often comedies will sacrifice the laughs to try and draw up a meaningful conclusion to the story, but this movie accomplishes both without sacrificing either.Surprisingly enjoyable. 8/10",7,0,1,30 August 2017
