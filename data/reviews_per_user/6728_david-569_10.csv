Ford v Ferrari," Terrific cinema..
","Cinema. Great cinema. Where to start? I guess, the starting line... the production aspect, top top top shelf. Stepping into every shot. Feeling the feel of the late 50s and 60s. The feel. Great start. Script, writing, story.. terrific. Performances. Stellar. So excellent when the director, direction, turns the actor loose. Everyone presents top shelf performances. Damon and Bale, great. The players, Caitriona Balfe and Christian Bale, would like to have seen more there. Who steals every scene though is Noah Jupe as Peter Miles. It is simply a great 2+ hours of cinema. One of the few times am compelled to rewatch the film.",10,1,3,29 January 2020
Black Swan," I Don't Get It
","How to fill up 10 lines to say, I don't get it.The ratings this film has received. Why? It flat did not work.Realism? Forget it.Surrealism? I've seen far better. Think A Beautiful Mind that weaves the descent into darkness.The storyline? Confused and a rehash at best. And predictable as hell.If you want to see a real story with real emotions and real moments surrounded by surreal affects... watch The Red Shoes.As far as this flick goes, I do not understand why people are so enamored with mediocrity, which this is.The only reason I gave it a 2 is that they got the movie made. Other than that, Oscar? Hardly.",2,2,3,31 January 2012
A Star Is Born," Realness
","The most real thing in the movide was Lady Gaga. Very much appreciated her realness. Mr Cooper, Meh. Story, slightly better than Meh. No need to 'method act' the voice. Punchy exposition of the story. Points made. Discomforting metaphors expressed. Got it. But must return to Lady Gaga. Realness. Couldn't take your eyes off of her which makes sense given she is Lady Gaga. Was not partial to the direction, directing. Punchy. And have to further say.. couldn't take your eyes off of her from the first moment. A star wasn't born in the movie. She stole the whole thing because did I mention.. she is Lady Gaga. Found it most excellent that for a performer who is about theatre... did I mention she is most real in this film.",6,0,2,8 July 2019
Fury," It takes a lot to get me revolted....
","Once in awhile one sees a movie where you want to tell Hollywood that all of the people involved, the director, the writers, the actors, the producers... everyone... needs a time out from making movies for like 5 or 10 years because what you just saw was atrocious. Fury is worse than that. Do not ever allow David Ayer to make a movie again. This flick is an insult to the senses, the sensibilities, the everything. What character development? What plot? What... aw, I could go on but why? As someone else said, what's the point? This easily had to be the worse war movie I have ever laid eyes on. I ended up skipping ahead on the remote control, it was that bad. One of the worst insult to the senses were the scenes with the women. Absolutely pointless. Scripts, scenes, lines, are intended to advance the story. It was an absolute black hole of uselessness. Those scenes with women were not only useless, they were reviling. Yeah yea, the fog of war, high emotions, youth (tho these 'commercial actors' were in their 30s and 40s when tankers in WWII were fer crissakes, 20s) not only were 100% of the men offensive, the scenes served absolutely zero purpose in creating advancement of, oh right, what story. In terms of character development, Pitt was a empty can of nothing. Why in bloody hell was the direction to just sit there like nothing is going on? I found these scenes to be vacuous and insulting. Created not a scintilla of emotional attachment to any of the characters. I could wax on with analysis about those scenes but, why. They were an insult to... there were an insult. The fighting scene at the end has been examined ad naseum... also an insult to everything a thinking, person, aware person would know. Pauses from githing for emotional responses. Completely opposite of the rest of the movie. I cannot express enough how I found this movie revolting. What lingers in my mind were seeing seeing previews where the 'commercial actors', and I use that term derisively as there are actors, then there are commerical actors which are a dime a dozen of which this is the latter... but remember the promos where these people were going on about how proud they were to get thumbs up from real tankers from WWII. I have news for you commercial actor kiddies... these men were likely thrilled to be recognized by Hollywood. This movie is pure and simple crap. Red Tails was a bad movie. This exceeds that movie by magnitudes. An insult to moviegoers, to WWI vets, to vets everywhere, to what the hell.. to the Waffen SS. Do not give any money to the director for any more way efforts. Do NOT do it. I have not been this reviled by a movie in a long, long time. This one did it.",1,9,15,31 December 2015
American Hustle," Campy is good
","Perhaps the more entertaining thing about offering a review on this is reacting to other reviews.Phrases like 'Didn't like it', 'Self indulgent mediocrity', 'No plot, no acting, no drama, no fun', 'don't bother', 'hustle, hustle, hustle', 'Over-hyped, Under-developed, Over-acted, & Under-performed'... and so on.To the naysayer negatatory nancys who found this flick vacuous.... I firstly say, It Is A Movie. Movies can be entertaining. This movie was entertaining. Very much so. It is a campy movie. It is a self indulgent campy movie. It is a self centered self indulgent campy movie. It is a narcissistic self centered self indulgent campy movie. I could keep going, but stated simply... it succeeds on these and many other fronts.

Mega kudos on the actors and their choices.Kids, this is a fun flick. Fun and entertaining. It evokes ideas and emotions on levels. A view of the 70s. Corruption. Male v female dynamics.Am in no way comparing this to Shakespeare execept in one aspect. If you do not think this is your cup of tea, sit still, relax, and let the thing happen. One can dial in to the dialogue and the ideas if one just sits still and let's it happen. I was ready to not like this, but by sitting still, like Shakespeare, and letting the words flow... the ideas and entertainment began to make sense and I dialed in. I give many props to the writing, props to the driection, props to the actors and their choices.

Dunkirk," Nawp... unremarkable.
","Was not thrilled by it.   Should have listened to my gut... that when thou dost protest too much, as in the over amplification of commercials, buzz, pronouncements of grandness, etc... something is amiss.  It was.   Too many clever tricks.  Writing was pedantic.  As historical events being explained during what should have been just normal conversational exchange.  Flashbacks were way too clever-ly exploited.  Too much cleverness.   This epic story did not leave one feeling one was experiencing expanse. This extraordinary historical event that could have changed the world was made, small.  Characters were not really allowed to develop.  Exposition was the ticket, but due to the unevenness of the writing, as in people don't talk like that, it didn't work.  For me at least.  The whole thing had a sense of blocky-ness... as in film this sequence here, film that sequence there... never had a sense of flow.And the overuse of rah rah historical clichés was that, overused.  If you're going to go for it, go for it. Vamp up a cliché. I don't know how many times 'home' was used... but fer crissakes, it has to be a build up and culmination of a moment. It never was, each time. Where there should have been moments that swelled up to the sense of grandeur, they were more like deflated balloons.  I was in particular wanting to see the much touted scenes and representations of the Hurricanes and Spitfires.  A lot was made about how this was filmed using different techniques than before.  Yawn.  It would have been far better to utilize real footage of aerial combat.   The air combat was less than interesting.  In large part due to the breaking up of the exposition due to flashbacks.  The expanse of for instance the Heinkel aircraft doing its attack was so unrhythmic, it created far more distraction to flow of those moments in the film. So the aerial scenes were a let down for sure.And methinks I just nailed what bothered me the most. Felt the writing was poor. But more so felt the sequencing of the scenes jerky, bothersome. One never got the full sense of a scene, and event, because the whole movie attempted to tie itself together through over-cleverness of sequences. Made it very hard to get fully engaged.A snarky way of saying... I was mostly bored trying to let the flow, flow. There was little flow. The direction attempted to make the story metaphorical. Story flow or metaphor... both failed.The only character was a father who brought his pleasure boat into the fray.  He was the only one with real moments.  Everything else was unremarkable.  Even the epic-ness of saving 300,000+ men from the shores of Dunkirk was a dud.  They never developed an immense sense of what this was about.  The portrayal of what should have been hundreds of small boats instead of British destroyers was less than remarkable.  Even the officer who was a character meant to provide exposition, Kenneth Branagh, was a yawner.  The story which should have been epic managed to be small, and the dialogue which should have given the actors a sense of epic-ness, or at the least metaphor on a grand scale, managed to create a sense of smallness.  So while am at it... the biggest annoyance was the damned soundtrack. Could not be clearer... the incessant drone of the soundtrack was a huge distraction. Drone is the right word. Loud, pounding, distracting. When you pound away like that, you exhaust the theme and have no where to go. This was repeated, over and over. It grew absolutely tiresome hearing this... made the entire movie which was already uneven in its writing and sequencing, even more distracting. Seriously folks, you have no where to go when one pours in a loud, neverending, repeated theme. You have no where to go. And it got there early on. No bones about it... I hated the soundtrack. It gave distracted support this already difficult to be engaged with film.OK, this is an unremarkable review but mainly because it was an unremarkable flick.  Had to write it out because I was left disappointed in every aspect.  I so wanted at least the Hurricanes and Spitfires to be cool because I understood they used real vintage planes.  But nawp.  How they managed to make this extraordinary historical event small was a disappointment.  As mentioned, the only real moment was the father and the events with the son.  Give it a 4 out of 10.  And by the way... we went and expected the theater to be packed or at least populated two days after the opening.  Also nawp.  It was spartan.  Not even 10% full.  Says a lot there. Oh well...  wait for it to come out on DVD.  I enjoyed the previews on a big screen far more than the movie which managed to make this extraordinary historical event, small.  Or a better wrap up would be... the film managed to make a remarkable event, unremarkable.",1,2,8,23 July 2017
The Legend of 1900," Wonderful...
",Why didn't this film win everything in sight?  Top to bottom it exhibited great craft.  A wonderful film that didn't try to be more or less than what it was... ... and that was great.  And the music interwined with the action- also great.Well worth the viewing.,10,0,1,5 January 2003
The Happening," Why oh why oh why?
","Why is M. Night Shyamalan still allowed to make movies? Does he think The Happening is worthy, creditable, notable, doable, seeable? I sat down really wanting to finally see a movie that had at least a scintilla of worth. Plot? What plot? Suspense? What suspense? Character development? Don't make me laugh. Dialogue? Script? Anything? No, no and no. Even the film score was yawningly predictable.This film is so awful, I cannot find a place to start, so I won't. I wish film studios would exercise a bit more caution when allowing this kind of thing to happen. We have lapsed into such mediocrity in so many areas of the American culture... and this is an example of why.M. Night Shyamalan, really now. These things are getting worse and worse. Please try and do something at least slightly dramatic, suspenseful, interesting. The Happening cannot get much lower than awful.",1,2,9,3 January 2009
Zero Dark Thirty," Yawn
","Let's see. I've seen comments like shallow, slow, inaccurate, and so on.Well, yes. The instant I hear anyone associated with a film start talking about a character's 'arc', run for the hills. For that is exactly what I did NOT see.The novelty of rush to production was beyond evident here. At the risk of dredging up a very bad moment in history, this reminded me of 9/11 in reverse. Instead of watching a suspense thriller (after all, this is the movies and a certain amount of acceptance towards suspension of disbelief has to be, well, accepted), I felt like I was watching a slow destruction of history, in backwards deconstruction. I could not decide if I should get behind the characters and this so called 'arc' (I did say run for the hills when you hear that word), or the historical unveiling of events, or just the spectacle. When the movie ended, I was unable to get behind any of these. Let's make it simple. Disgruntled employee rises above. Hang hat on premise for 2/3rds of the story. Sorry, worn out premise that fell on its face here.A good script and good story telling backed by solid characters makes for good flicks. This had none of them. If it had been told in documentary form, it might have stood a chance. That this thing was up for best film of the year is a testament to the fickleness of human nature to back the wrong horse because it might have had an interesting pedigree. In this case, the pedigree was a historical event. This horse needs to be given over to the humane society and delivered to a nice family with a pasture, which is where it should be retired to. PS, because extra additions are now part of a film's experience (DVD), I must add... when the materials focus on things like 'being proud of' or 'strove for accuracy' or such things... run for more hills. I find films that are worthy stand on their own with great writing, great stories, great direction, essentially greatness which none of this had. The most memorable take-away of watching this is when one remembers the phrase 'they are taking themselves way too seriously'. When the work stands, little needs to be said. When productions take themselves too seriously, keep running for them thar hills. This effort took itself way too seriously, down to the extras.",4,9,18,6 April 2013
Signs," yawn
","The system stated that 4 lines were required to be accepted.  Ok: 
Yawn. Yawn. Yawn. Yawn.The film tried to start fast in drama and mystery (gee, brush teeth, kids scream, dogs barking, corn field... novel), and yet the film still didn't start for 37 minutes.  And then it STILL didn't start.  Hardly an original thought anywhere.  Poor tricks galore.  About as much energy and originality as a spent AAA battery.Yawn.And people thought this was good?  Aside from an incredibly boring story that lacked spark, energy, originality, I don't know if anyone noticed, but this is about as poor example of writing dialogue as it gets.  Performances need to emerge from at the least, dialogue.  Oh well.  What dialogue?  My spouse, who was excited to see the film, kept looking at me also wondering, when is this thing going to start.... Yawn.  One of the least compelling flicks I have seen in a long time.  I'll go watch corn grow next time.  I have a sign for this film... it is called thumbs down.",2,1,1,9 January 2003
