Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A triumph, both Volumes together are 1 of the best films ever
","Kill Bill. Wow what a movie. Volume 2 starts off with a the little bit of the beginning of Volume 1, and goes to 'The Bride' driving a car and reciting a few cheesy lines as in 'I went on with what the movie advertisements referred to as a roaring rampage of revenge' and of course 'When I arrive at my destination, I am gonna KILL BILL.' The wedding scene was a good way to start the film. We get to see Bill's arrival in the chapel and some great dialogue with Bill and the Bride and we see the Bride's fianc√©e. The last shot of the chapter though is phenomenal. The Vipers heading into the chapel with their guns is just a great shot, and I'm sort of glad that they didn't show the massacre. Next we see the Bride's, (Ok now I'm going to start calling her Bea) next target, Budd. A trailer trash brother of Bill who works in a strip club. Though I didn't like the scene in the strip club we kind of started feeling sorry for Budd. Michael Madsen does the role very, very well.The burial scene, wow that was a great scene and brilliantly done.The Pai Mei bit are one of the best parts of the movie. Gordon Liu does a fine job playing the uptight Chinese trainer for Bea and the whole chapter is fun to watch. Elle's chapter is probably the most fun to watch. Daryl Hannah who plays the downright b*tch Elle Driver is just fabulous with the role. The whole Black Mamba speech which she got from the net with a notebook is priceless.The Elle vs. Bea fight is fun, fun, fun. It's dirty, raw and fun to watch. The conclusion was finely done, better than in the script.The Bill and Beatrix confrontation is probably my favorite part of the whole film. Uma Thurman just seems so natural in the role of Beatrix and definitely deserves an Oscar nod for this emotionally challenged role, I mean the scene where she sees her daughter is just an example of how GREAT she is in this movie. David Carradine is very charming as Bill, who has some of the best lines and dialogue out of all the characters. I thought the solution between Bea and Bill was beautifully done and I'm not disappointed with the film one bit. Tarantino is just a man who really loves movies and Kill Bill is a celebration for everyone who loves movies.Still so far the best film of the year and one of my favorites ever.<ul><li>10/10</li></ul>",10,0,1,9 August 2004
