Alien 3," They had NO REASON whatsoever to make this movie. But now they did: it is the worst Alien movie in the world!
","What a disgrace! The first Alien movie I ever saw! It really took away my breath - not because of fear - and I didn't feel much for seeing the rest of the Legacy. I think this scares off people who see 'Alien3' as the first movie of the Alien Legacy ( like me ) to see the rest! ( I recently saw all the Alien movies, so I got over it... )         LITTLE SPOILER COMING UP...Besides, NOTHING seems to make sense: how did the people on the ship - including Ripley - get impregnated? The Queen who chased them at the end of the previous movie wasn't able to lay eggs inside the ship since she ripped off her abdomen in 'Aliens'. And the dead of Ripley is not so pleasant as it looks. If you ask me, there was no reason at all to make 'Alien3'. They should've better made 'Resurrection' ride away. Since that one starts a few centuries later, Ripley would have died anyhow...The fx are good, the fights really tough and the actors are fine but the movie is not worth watching. Too bad that when you buy the Legacy Box, this one is included. A good advice: if you do wanna buy the whole Legacy, buy each movie separately. You'll enjoy it even more without 'Alien3'.",Null,13,20,23 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," May the Force stay with you, George Lucas!
","I've waited a long time to see it and I didn't waist my money on it. The Phantom Menace is superb! It makes you feel like a Jedi, like a menace, like a Sith Lord, anything your imagination allows you to be! My favorite moment were the fifteen thrilling minutes of the podrace on Boonta Eve. I never bought the race game, but that moment stays in my thoughts forever. Woa, mama! And the fights were great too. If only a battle in Star Trek had that quality, I'd admire those movies as much as I admire The Phantom Menace. The musical score added the glorious feeling you get during the battles and - actually - the whole movie. This must be one of the best things my eyes saw in 1999!It shows the fantasy of one men: George Lucas. Keep on making 'em!",Null,0,0,15 July 2000
Ghost," Woaw! -- that's all I could say when I saw it for the first time.
","It might be a love story, I ended up feeling sad when I saw 'Ghost' for the very first time. I never risked seeing it again, because I was scared to cry in the presence of my family. It is so touching when Sam dies and his ghost leaves his body. Whoopi Goldberg is at her absolute best ( same goes for Patrick Swayze ) and Demi Moore is believable but not outstanding. Gosh, this was indeed a great movie. Unforgettable. The soundtrack adds that little piece of magic and romance. Every time I listen to 'Unchained Melody', I remember 'Ghost'. The end is the most beautiful part of the movie. I don't remember well what happened, because tears filled my eyes and I couldn't see for a few moments ( it was the only moment of the movie I cried! ). It is possibly the only movie that makes you feel both happy and unhappy. A masterpiece!",Null,4,5,17 July 2000
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Wacky but good
","When I was about to see this movie, I kept thinking 'Who the hell is Roger Rabbit?' But after a few minutes, it was very clear to me that he's a wacky cartoon. Now I like Bugs Bunny, but Roger is much better! OK, let's discuss the movie, shall we?Bob Hoskins did a fine job as Eddie Valiant, and a big congrats to the people who took care of the special effects. I didn't know this movie was from '88 until I saw the site here on the IMDb. Right, I love the mix of cartoons and 'real' movie. Well, guess I have to  admit it was so wacky but yet so good. If only more movies like these ones were made...!",Null,0,0,2 April 2001
Alien: Resurrection," You just can't get enough of those slimy creatures...
","I've seen every single Alien movie, and this one is my favorite. 'Alien: Resurrection' has more special effects than the previous Alien movies, but that doesn't make it better.What I'm trying to say is that the plot has hardly changed. The good guys are trying to stop the bad guys from bringing the Aliens to earth, while protecting themselves against these vicious and mean creatures. You know: Ripley leads the team and kills them, one by one. And that's IT!I only like 'Resurrection' because it has mighty good visual effects. Okay, and I'm a big fan of the aliens too. But if you ignore the fact that the storyline is getting classic, the rest of the movie ain't that bad. It keeps you attached to your seat 'till the end. And isn't thàt why people want to see a movie?",Null,0,0,2 June 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Excellent entertainment!
","This was the first time ever I watched South Park. And I LOVED it! During the part where the boys are watching the notorious 'Terrance & Phillip'movie, I've laughed so hard I fell out of the sofa. That explains enough, doesn't it? I mean, it was so extremely funny I just couldn't stop laughing. If it wasn't for the language used in this movie, I guess everyone could just enjoy this piece of excellent entertainment, but because of the non-stop swearing it's just not suitable for children under the age of sixteen. Although my feelings towards the whole concept of the movie are quite positive,although I must say that Trey Parker and the writers shouldn't have made the Canadians so obviously ridiculous. And I also think that the 'war against Canada' must have upset the Canadian audience ( a bit ). Maybe not, but as a Canada-fan, I didn't really like it. The scenes with Saddam and Satan are hilarious but tend to get boring after a while (sigh) and Kenny's ghostly appearance was incredibly funny. Oh yes, how can I possibly forget about the SONGS? Man, that was SO BIG! It all starts with this lame, stupid song about South Park's spotless reputation as a normal, lovely, boring, etc. mountain town. Then there's the unforgettable song in 'Asses of Fire', sung by Terrance & Phillip, and after that we get these filty, cruel sing-a-longs performed by the kids of South Park. You should especially pay attention to Cartman's song about Kyle's ( or was it Stan? I always mix them up! ) Mom. And that's all I've got to say about 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'.

Home Alone," Kids, don't try this at home!
","This is - no doubt - one of the best movies John Hughes ever made - 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' rules! In 'Home Alone', Macauly Culkin outsmarts a couple of dumb thieves. Really dumb thieves. Boy, I bet that if you would count their IQ, the sum would be 18. This will bring laughter and some scary moments too. The traps set up in the house are not just little booby traps. Kevin made it so dangerous that he could even prevent a whole army from invading his house. In the meanwhile,his family is in Paris, panicking and wondering if he is all right. Just when you think the little smart kid is in serious trouble, luck saves the day. A wonderful comedy you should have seen. If you liked it, I also recommend 'Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.' Even a big city like the Apple can't stop little Kevin.",Null,0,0,15 July 2000
Bridget Jones's Diary," It's raining Oscars... soon!
","I bet 'Bridget Jones' Diary' will get one or more Oscars. Renée Zellweger was brilliant as Bridget, Colin Firth made me laugh and Hugh Grant probably acted the way he always acts... fan-tas-tic. Good music and a lot of humour and above all: the ending! Really, you ought to see this movie NOW, 'cause it will bring you the story of a 'normal' woman facing thé problem of her life: finding the right man. Will she succeed? That is - of course - up to you to find out. Let me end by saying: 10/10! Greatest thing I saw on the BIG screen this year.",Null,0,0,1 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Amazing story - incredible movie
","Let me start by saying: I've NEVER read a book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When I bought the DVD, I didn't even know who was who and what the movie was really about. So far, I was like, a stranger walking around Middle Earth. But after seeing the Extended Special Edition (which includes 30 minutes of extra material, but I can only guess which scenes since I never saw it in theatres), I could only think:Waw, what an amazing story, what an incredible movie - worthy of the name epic, worthy of the title BEST movie of 2001. And as sure as I am about this one, I can already feel that the second and third part of the Trilogy will be just as good. This is fantasy for young and old, something you can't really say about Harry Potter. I think Peter Jackson did a great job making this movie and last but not least: the cast is absolutely perfect.",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Probably the best movie Arnie ever made
","Hasta la vista, baby! The Terminator has returned to give us one more look at his world. I guess everyone who saw 'Judgment Day' cheered for Arnie when he fought against the evil T-1000, using mega-weapons of which I and a whole bunch of people can only dream about. It's funny, however, to see that nothing can kill the bad guy. If you see it for the very first time, you get desperate in their place. T2 contains amazing special effects and more action than the first part. Too bad the whole movie is to much like the original one. I hate to sum up negative points about T2, yet I had to say it. The rest of the movie is OK. Like I said before: it's probably the best movie Arnie ever made - hey, this could easily be the best action movie of all time, and if not, this one has got a special place in my heart. ( Didn't mention that literally )",Null,1,1,7 August 2000
Edward Scissorhands," Very beautiful, very touching. Very Edward Scissorhands.
","It's like the Addams Family, only a bit more touching. I think that 'Edward Scissorhands' has the concept of a Disney movie - hideous creature hides in a dark and scary castle on a hill and never shows his face in public because he's afraid he'll get rejected by the people. And then the girl comes in play... I guess you'll all know how this little fairy tale ends!OK, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed, I really did! 'Edward Scissorhands' is fantastic, even hart warming at times. It should get a *** out of *****",Null,0,0,8 September 2000
In the Name of the Father," This movie will make people realize how one's life can turn into a hell when being wrongfully accused!
","If you've seen this movie, you'll agree with me - I hope you do! - that one's life DOES turn into a hell when you're being wrongfully accused. Gerry Conlon's life did. ( POSSIBLE SPOILER COMING UP EVERYONE!!! )He was convicted for a crime he DID NOT commit! And if that hasn't been clear when seeing 'In the Name of the Father' for the first time, you should see it over and over again until you get the point. Anyhow, this movie will not only shock and confuse people, it'll make you feel angry about British cops and such. So far for publicity. Yes, I think this is a very good Irish movie. Daniel Day-Lewis and Peter Posthlewaith ( thàt's gotta be wrong, I feel it! ) were amazing. No need to repeat: great movie, 9/10.",Null,1,6,9 March 2001
Aliens," More aliens: more fun, more violence, more Ripley!
","If this would have been the last alien movie, it would be the bÃ©st! And actually, it still is. What a great sequel! Now you just don't face an adult alien, there's also the mean Queen. And who said that she isn't a good mother? The movie starts with a confused Ripley, just woken up from a fifty year long cryogen sleep. A money-grubbing business man called Carter J. Burke tells her that they've lost contact with one of their colonies. He asks Ripley's help to distinguish the alien race  that has possible taken over the colony. At first, she refuses to, because these aliens have caused more than enough trouble to her. But finally - supported by the best team of the Marine Corps - they go to LV-426 to find out what's really going on. Soon Ripley finds out that our friend Burke only wants to bring the aliens to earth, as he thinks they're the perfect bio weapon. What happens next, is so predictable. It's funny, violent but it is OK. Ripley wins the battle and escapes from the base. She takes what's left from Bisschop and the little Newt with her in a shuttle. I love it, no matter how many Alien movies would follow this one. Ok, Resurrection is the next best Alien movie. But remember: Aliens rules!",Null,0,0,30 June 2000
American History X," Too much violence, though I liked it.
","I saw 'American History X' a few days ago, during religion lessons. You know, when the teacher talked about discrimination and racism. No wonder she showed us this movie. It contains tons of violence, racism and other c**p our society has to offer to scum and gangs. It's a hard movie but believable. It shows - no matter how complicated things get - the truth. This cÃ n happen. Anyway, Edward Norton was excellent, as well as Edward Furlong. A few cheers for Avery Brooks and Beverly d'Angelo. Nice piece of acting. 7.5/10",Null,0,0,12 January 2001
Die Hard 2," Trouble never leaves town - neither does John McClane

I go to church every week!'McClane:'Too bad. I have to pick up my wife at the airport, so I have no time to listen to your stories. By the way, did I mention I'm gonna kill you?'(he shoots the guy)McClane:'Yippee-kay-yee, motherf****r!'Don't tell me that it didn't go like that! Every 'Die Hard' movie is the same: good guy kills bad guy and proves again and again that he's the hero. For once it doesn't annoy me. 'Die Hard 2' looks good. This time the place to be is an airport around Christmas, somewhere in Washington DC. And the bad guys are bad - really bad! If I go further, this will be a spoiler, so I quit right here.Great sequel, but an old fashioned plot gives it a ***and 1/2 out of 5.",Null,1,1,27 August 2000
The Commitments," Wonderful!
","When I read about a sequel of 'The Commitments', I was getting interested in the first movie. So here I am, talking about one of those unforgettable experiences in your life. The music is great but the movie itself rules! If you have trouble understanding people who speak with a genuine Irish accent, you're probably thinking it wasn't that great after all. But that's not the point. There are so many nice things to say about 'The Commitments' that I can't figure out where to start. All right, it's a funny movie, because of many things, but I'm not going to say more. You know now that you HAVE to SEE 'The Commitments'. Don't just say the second movie is good enough! Most of the cast was superb. Can't say who, because the list would seem endless. Uh, that's it! 10/10",Null,0,1,3 March 2001
Independence Day," Failed attempt to take over Earth but NOT to entertain the viewers!
","WARNING!!! THIS SYNOPSIS COULD CONTAIN A S*P*O*I*L*E*R!!!Most sci-fi movies end like this: aliens invade our peaceful planet, try to wipe us of the surface but are blown up by some unknown guy who then gets all the name and fame he (didn't) deserve(s). Trow in cool fx and a story that makes sense ( mmm, I'm not so sure about thàt... ) so you can entertain the audience. This is 'Independence Day' in a nutshell. Great actors are: Will Smith, Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum. They may have failed to take over Earth, but they have succeeded in giving us a movie worth the watching!

The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Great dinosaurs
","After seeing this movie, I felt a bit confused. Was this really the sequel of 'Jurassic Park'? It wasn't even that spectacular! The dinosaurs - as always - were fantastic. Same goes for the acting - 10/10 for Jeff Goldblum, I say! - but the plot didn't seem to fit. I don't know what Spielberg was thinking when he wanted to make a second Jurassic Park movie, but this could have been avoided. 5.5/10( I heard something about a third movie - let's hope they've learned from heir HUGE mistakes!!! )",Null,0,0,3 February 2001
The Mummy Returns," Oh my god -- it's the best thing I ever saw (or isn't it?)
","Usually, a sequel isn't half the way it's predecessor was. But in this case, I dare not say that that statement is true. The Mummy Returns really took my breath away. The first Mummy was a successful thing, but who'd know that the second movie could turn out to be even better?Just take a look at the special effects. I don't believe I can recall a scène where there's not a single thing that hasn't been created with a computer. It's all so perfect, and that's of course what makes a movie worth the watching. Quiet at times and extremely loud when it gets really tough, the music has it's own way of creating that icy, chilling sphere that surrounds every movement our beloved hero Rick O'Connell ( Brendan Fraser ) makes. The sudden events and the dazzling fighting sequences are splendid. And now, instead of one really bad guy, they have to defeat two dangerous Egyptian first-class bandits. With a little help of their Arabian friends this might work. The actors have done a great job. Nice work, especially from Rachel Weisz and John Hannah. No need to explain why I think The Mummy Returns deserves 9.5/10!",Null,0,0,4 June 2001
Mission: Impossible," My name is Hunt, Ethan Hunt.
","I never thought there would come a movie that is almost as good as the James Bond movies. Mission Impossible tried and succeeded. I lòòòve that scene where he breaks into the computer room of the CIA. What happens there? Just see it!Tom Cruise showed once again that he's the perfect man for an impossible job. But as a fan of Emilio Estevez (Jack, in case you didn't notice) I have to say the following: WHY DID HE GET KILLED SO FAST?",Null,0,1,15 July 2000
Titanic," Blub,blub,blub...
","There are only a few things that keep 'Titanic' afloat. First fact: excellent cast ( mind you: I'm not one of those Leonardo DiCaprio-freaks! ) with excellent performances. Second fact: nice ship... Third ( and last ) fact: beautiful music from James Horner. The huge number of goofs for 'Titanic' is famous but also annoying. My best friend came over to watch this movie ( she had seen it twice but said a third time can't hurt a person ) and started spotting 'mistakes' every two seconds. I was surprised to find out she was right, after having a close look ( my face nearly touched the TV-screen ). Most movies James Cameron made - Terminator 2, Aliens,... - are spectacular and such, but ALL of them have LOTS of goofs. Seems that 'Titanic' has broken a new record! If you insist on knowing what exactly went wrong, go to the goofs section. Small details, I know, but don't tell me it's not annoying when you are watching.I hope that telling you that 'Titanic' is filled with goofs isn't regarded as a SPOILER, because anyone knows it, even if you didn't see Titanic. So why watch it? Well, it features the most known and biggest boat of the twentieth century, it's unfortunate maiden voyage, a profile of some of the many passengers, and probably the most beautiful soundtrack I've ever heard in my entire life. I'd say a 8/10 should be enough.",Null,1,2,26 August 2001
Die Hard," A Classic. Need I say more?
","Action movies: you can't count them because that would take days. Some of them really suck, other's are superb. It's obvious that 'Die Hard' is a masterpiece. I'll never forget Bruce Willis saying 'Yippee-kay-yee'. It's almost like Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'Hasta la vista, baby'. What makes 'Die Hard' the proud king of action is the trills you get when seeing it. Tough fights and wild chases and most important of all: the hero survives! What more should a movie include to become that good? After all that I just summed up, I have no clue what more you could ask for. Probably for less blood, although we're talking about action. So all you sensitive souls out there, don't see this one if you can't stand a bit of blood. It's pretty normal that someone gets shot every minute in these kind of movies. To every person who didn't see 'Die Hard' yet, I strongly advice you to run like hell to the nearest store and GET THAT MOVIE!!! Or, if that's too much to ask, hire it.",Null,0,0,12 August 2000
Con Air," The funniest action movie I've ever seen.
","'Con Air' is a funny action movie, with too much explosions, guns and big, bad guys killing people. It has it's share of action, yes indeed, but if you watch it very carefully, like I did, you'll probably notice the hidden parts of 'humor'. E.g. ( sorry for the SPOILER, but I can't do it without! ) the way Duncan Malloy's beautiful blue '63 Corvette Stingray is destroyed. You should see the look on their faces when the car flies through the sky. It's so hilarious I almost fell out of the sofa. To make things a bit clearer: especially Cameron Poe ( Nicolas Cage ), Marshall Larkin ( John Cusack ) and Duncan Malloy ( Colm Meaney ) will make you laugh. 'Con Air' has a big amount of great actors: Nic Cage, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames,John Cusack and Colm Meaney. The good guys ( Johnny Cusack and Colm Meaney ) are always arguing about the way their gonna rescue the plane. Malloy is not very happy with the company of Larkin and this only gets worser when he sees his car getting destroyed. 2nd SPOILER: they make up near the end of the movie... The bad guys? Well, they argue so much it gets annoying! In fact, Poe was the worst of them all. He really acted like a softy. Remember 'Put uh, the bunny uh back.' Dumbo, really dumbo. So far, that was the only thing I disliked about 'Con Air'. **** out of *****",Null,0,0,12 November 2000
Speed," The Need for Speed
","I first thought this movie was about a bus that went out of control...WRONG!!!Apparently, it was about a bomb under a bus, that is set to explode when it drives below 50 mph. FIFTY!!! Com'on, even that dashing Ferrari from Ferris Bueller's Day Off can go faster! They should have at least changed the title into 'Bombed bus' or something! Beside this little mistake, the cast ain't that bad. But the plot sucks, the special effects are exaggerated and so on. This may sound crazy, but I have a favorite scene:Stephens: 'We're at the airport.'Ortiz: 'Yeah, so?'Stephens: 'I already seen the airport.'That was the only moment I laughed. Honest. So, whatever you do, don't consider 'Speed' as a blockbuster. It's okay, but it ain't a masterpiece!",Null,0,1,23 June 2000
The Breakfast Club," The best John Hughes film ever - after Ferris Bueller, of course
","This you should have seen. If you die without knowing 'The Breakfast Club', that is really sad. It is what makes the eigthies so special: the brat pack movie.'The Breakfast Club' is the absolute king of that genre. No one brought the mind of a few teenagers so close to you than John Hughes did. You can watch five completely different teens - the weirdo, the nerd, the macho, the sporty and the cool but misunderstood girl - spending a Saturday at school, for detention. The principal is ten times as worse as Mr. Rooney from 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', but let's ignore that and concentrate on the wiz kids.Emilio Estevez has the role of his life playing the sporty one. Antony Michael Hall is great as the quiet brainiac  and Molly Ringwald plays at her absolute best. Although she made a good appearance, I think Ally Sheedy did a better job in 'WarGames'. And Judd Nelson... well he's just tough. That's all.So, people. They just don't make movies like this anymore...",Null,0,1,16 July 2000

The battle scenes were terrific, the blood splattered everywhere but the feeling was there! A big A+ for Ridley Scott ( oh, by the way, Alien was good too! ) and for Russel Crowe ( loved ya, man! ). This movie deserves an Oscar -- make it five -- and it should be reviewed as one of the best movies of this year! I just had some problems with eating when remembering the bloody scenes.

Fox' outstanding performances and I remember I screamed: 'Wow, men! Cool!' when the DeLorean drove 88 mph and disappeared. Although it is getting old, 'Back to the Future' will never lose its attraction. The two other films can't beat the feeling part 1 gave me.
