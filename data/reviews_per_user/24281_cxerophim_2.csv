Requiem for a Dream," Mesmerizing...like a Catastrophe
","Requiem is not a movie for the faint of heart or easily offended, this coming from a discriminating viewer who adores movies that showcase society's gritty and grimy underbelly; and while it really has no other movie to compare itself against, I'd say the shock value and wow factor are on par with that of City of God. In a move of inspired cinematic form, we are led into the story slowly, providing four unique perspectives of life in a quasi-forgotten landscape near Coney Island. Through a deliberately slow buildup we are made to see these peoples' dreams of grandeur blossom for the briefest of instants and just as swiftly, wither and die. Each person has their own utopia in mind, but all are afflicted with a debilitating condition, addiction. And as each spirals deeper into the depths of their cravings they are forced to take drastic measures to get their fix. The endings, in my mind, are quite appropriate as they all find themselves in their own private hell. As I said at the beginning, there is no glamor, no glitz to be found here, just cold reality and it truly is striking, not a movie that most will watch casually, but one that I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for a well-produced, chilling reminder of the harsh realities of the real world.",9,1,2,14 February 2011
Pulp Fiction," Surprisingly Good
","I'll start off by saying that I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino and believe that his work is often too convoluted and involved to develop any of the characters fully; *however*, Pulp Fiction, I must admit, is a stellar piece of cinema. A literally star-studded cast portrays the characters beautifully, making you feel their joy and pain. Plotwise, there are numerous twists and turns, as to be expected, but they all manage to fit together rather nicely. And while some things do remain unexplained or unaccounted for in the end, it doesn't leave the viewer wanting. Dialogue in this movie is particularly delightful, with much reverence to dark humor and double-talk (not unlike the film Lucky Number Slevin). Ultimately the only scene I didn't like was Uma Thurman's. Other than that, I think Tarantino delivered a solid piece worthy of the place it's earned in the upper echelons of most critics' 'top 10'.",8,1,2,10 October 2009
