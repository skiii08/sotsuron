The Blair Witch Project," Lives Up to the Hype, Mostly
","My enjoyment of The Blair Witch Project was reduced somewhat by a bit of motion sickness from watching the camera bouncing about, but mainly from a couple of teenage girls behind me, commenting on proceedings throughout. Kinda ruins the 'suspension of disbelief' necessary to really get into the picture. Given the small budget/small screen nature of the film, I think this will convert really well to home video. Then, without interruption, you could turn out the lights and scare the hell out of yourself. My hair stood on end during the final walk through the house.",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
