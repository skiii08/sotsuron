The Avengers," why Avengers is a great movie
","Do you know what is better than one super heroes defeat a few enemies? No well I will tell you, a group a super heroes defeating thousands of enemies, that is why The Avengers is such a great movie. It is also amazing because it is the greatest team of super heroes every assembled, not just by Marvel but, all comics every created. This movie had a unique way to tell the back stories of the heroes, instead of just cramming all that information into a small part of the movie and making so you only got part of the story instead, they made prequel movies for each of the heroes expect for Hawkeyes which his back story was in Thor, Nick Fury which back story was in both Thor and Iron Man and Black Window which her back story was in the Iron man movies.This movie is what comic book fans have been waiting for, for years, finally a movie with Marvel's greatest heroes Captain America, the Hulk, Black Window, Hawkeyes, Iron Man, Thor, even Nick Fury is there to lead S.H.I.E.L.D and almost forgot about Loki which makes appearance as the bad guy like always. Not only does this movie have greatest possible actors playing super heroes like Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man, it has awesome special effects. Also this movie has great action scenes in fact, most of the two and half hour movie is action but, along with the action there is a lot of humor all throughout the film. This movie is possibly the best super hero of all-time best because of the perfect mixture of humor and action that all movies should have.Even though the movie is two and half hours long which is a pretty long for a movie but, it never seems like you are seating and watching the movie for ten minutes because it is so action, humor and suspension. If you compare this movie to any other super heroes movie, it makes them look bad because of the great job the Directed Joss Whedon did on the movie mixed with the brininess of Stan Lee the creator of the comic books making it a great movie for people of all ages. Also the studio said they were going to make another one a few days after it came out so, I am not the only one who thinks this movie was great.",10,2,5,19 November 2012
