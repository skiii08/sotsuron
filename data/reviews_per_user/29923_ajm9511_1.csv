The Ring," What the H-E-Double Hockey-sticks was THAT supposed to be?!
","I am thirteen years old. I should first say that I'm not easily frightened. I devour books and TV shows featuring ghost stories and can watch an 'Emergency Vets' marathon without flinching. But this movie just about did me in. I covered my eyes during most of the end. At first, I didn't think it wasn't too bad. After the first half hour or so, it became incredibly gruesome. The whole Rachel-puking-her-guts-out thing was just sick. It had the stereo-typical twisted, evil, physco kid that you can find in almost any slasher flick. (Actually, TWO evil, physco kids).My advice: Don't waste your time and money on 'The Ring'. No one should see it unless they have NERVES OF STEEL. 0/10",Null,0,1,8 June 2003
