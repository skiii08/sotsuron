The Blair Witch Project," Still can't sleep...need a night light.
","This movie was very good.  I grew up watching B Horror movies...Cat People, The Thing, It's Alive, ect.  Always have enjoyed the thrill of being scared. And I used to like to go camping. I won't give anything away if you have not yet seen it, the reviews you will read (as I have) are either hate it or love it so you will need to judge for yourself.  I have recommended it to all I know... Go see it when there will be less people in the theater though...two weight lifting jocks were by me and gave a running commentary that was very distracting. I think the unknown is truly the scariest thing...or perhaps the unknowable? Thats what makes Blair Witch so good. Go...but leave your jaded friends at home.",10,2,4,9 August 1999
