The Ring," Don't fall for the hype (but see it anyway)
","Cool movie but don't fall for the hype in these user comments.  See it for yourself.  Enjoy it and form your own opinions.  It's a fun horror film with a lot of originality and artistically filmed sequences.  At many points throughout the film I was ready to dismiss it as being 'dumbed down' for the general American moviegoing audience.  Instead, the movie throws in some twists and keeps it very entertaining.If you liked the following movies I think you will be pleased with this one:   Ghost Story, Jacob's Ladder, Session 9",6,0,0,20 October 2002
The Patriot," Revisionist, Hollywood-ized piece of garbage
","Visually pleasant but...  Predictable and palid plot.  Goofy dialog. Cookie-cutter characters.  Comic book version of American History. (and I'm NOT talking Classics Illustrated) If you liked Titanic you will most likely like this.I must admit I am offended at the number of foreigners who believe this film to be representative of American feelings about American history. (just an example of the power of Hollywood, I guess)First, this is a HOLLYWOOD film.  Hollywood is make-believe and mostly detached from normal American life.  It might as well be its' own country since it rarely has to deal with the reality of American life.Second, the director and many of the main actors are NOT EVEN AMERICAN! Roland Emmerich was born and raised in Germany. Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger are Australian.  Joel Isaacs (the EVIL BRIT) is... ummm... a BRIT!",4,4,9,5 November 2000

","This movie is a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood: corny dialog, predictable plot, schmaltzy acting but beautiful visuals that suck you in to waste your money and time on this film.I wanted to like this film but the cheezy plot twists and language made me cringe.If you liked Titanic you will like this movie.",4,1,2,5 November 2000
