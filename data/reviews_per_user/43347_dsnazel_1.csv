Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Phantom Menace Is Terrific
","The Phantom Menace is a terrific fantasy sci-fi movie. Only those with hatred in their hearts, will not enjoy this movie. It's visually stunning, very funny in spots, a terrific fairy tale in space. I loved it, I can't wait to see it again.",10,0,1,19 May 1999
