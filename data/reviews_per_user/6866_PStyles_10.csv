The Avengers," Despite a Cast of A-List Stars, 'The Avengers' is Just Another Superhero Movie
","I will start out by saying that overall, I did enjoy this film. I feel like the rating system here on IMDb is used so incorrectly by the majority of folks who use it. For example, if someone loved this movie, they give it a 10. If they didn't like it, they give it a 1, where the truth actually lies somewhere in the middle. Everything is NOT black and white in movies, and I feel like this movie is an unfortunate byproduct of that misconception. With a star studded cast and some pretty incredible visuals, 'The Avengers' does many things well that a superhero movie should. What this movie doesn't do well is deliver a unique 'gosh that's the best superhero movie i've ever seen!' experience, despite what the inflated rating would tell you. The plot of 'The Avengers' features a pretty basic premise; The US government, naive to their own research on a mysterious object called the Tesseract, accidentally opens a rift to another world allowing the Norse god Loki to enter Earth and essentially wreak havoc. This of course leads to the formation of 'The Avengers', which is a collection of Marvel superheroes that many of you will recognize, either from the comic books or previous Marvel films. Together, under 'The Avengers initiative', these superheroes go to battle with Loki over the sacred Tesseract which, when wielded by Loki, can open a rift to another dimension and potentially end the world as we know it. Sound familiar? It should, as this general pretense has been used many times over in the past. While the plot doesn't feature any large holes, it also doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table, either. You can expect many 'mini' battles between Loki and the heroes along the way, ultimately leading to the 'final showdown' of the film. This is superhero movie 101, and while it works for all intensive purposes, 'The Avengers' hardly innovates the genre in any way. Based on it's high rating, I had expected a somewhat unique experience for a superhero movie, but I was unfortunately let down in this regard. The movie does pace itself quite well, however, which kept me interested throughout. If there is one thing 'The Avengers' does very well, it's keeping the viewer interested without any serious lulls in the action. Next up is the acting/casting. This movie is literally jam packed with famous actors/actresses, from Robert Downey Jr. as the always recognizable Iron Man(my personal favorite from not just these films but all in the Marvel collection), Chris Evans as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as The Hulk, and Chris Hemsworth returning as Thor(my second favorite of these characters). There are many others, from Scarlett Johansson, to Samuel L. Jackson, to Jeremy Renner, etc etc. You get the idea. There are lots of famous people in this movie. The acting from these heavyweights of the industry is generally very good, despite a pretty generic script. You can expect a lot of cheesy one-liners, petty arguments, and general 'i'm a better superhero than you' moments throughout the script. With a lack of clever writing and, in my honest opinion, a truly despicable villain(Loki just doesn't do it for me, sorry. He looks like a 15 year old boy with a deer helmet), 'The Avengers' has a hard time distinguishing itself from the pack, despite all the talented actors involved with this film. One could really make the argument that the talented actors casted for this film ARE what makes the movie above average, because they really have to make the most out of what they are given in the script. Overall, 'The Avengers' offers an exciting, albeit predictable, superhero experience. The actors bring their A-game for this film and the electricity between them definitely makes this movie better. I do have to say I felt a bit of nostalgia watching some of my favorite heroes from childhood band together on the big screen to battle evil. Despite it's fairly long runtime, 'The Avengers' kept me interested from start to finish even if I cringed at some of the writing from time to time. Overall though, I think it was the villain, Loki, who brought the viewing experience down for me. He just isn't believable as a true villain, and the 'twist' at the end will leave you feeling pretty underwhelmed. Despite these fall backs, though, this is still an enjoyable film to watch. If you expect something more than a 2 hour superhero romp coming into this, you may find yourself a bit disappointed like I was. If you come into this thinking that you will see some cool superhero action and some great actors, you will be much better off. 'The Avengers' is a cool superhero movie, but in my opinion, nothing more. This film isn't American Beauty or even the Dark Knight(best superhero movie ever IMO), so as long as you temper your expectations, you will more than likely enjoy 'The Avengers'. For an exciting, if somewhat underwhelming, superhero experience, I give 'The Avengers' a solid 6/10.",6,3,7,23 July 2014
Interstellar," A Film Which Will Transcend Generations
","So many people have already reviewed this film, but after my most recent viewing, I now feel compelled to write a review as well. Films like 'Interstellar' come along very rarely; but when they do, they transcend generations. This film, deep down, is about love and how it can penetrate barriers we didn't even know existed. While the science behind this film may not be completely accurate, the concept is spot on; Nolan's writing compels us to see the value in the most confusing and powerful of all emotions which human beings share. I simply cannot applaud him enough for bringing us a story which teaches a real lesson about the human condition. He also brings us a story that can be enjoyed on many different levels; if you aren't one for the sentimental stuff, then take solace in the fact that there is plenty of thrilling moments within this film. If you want an intense sci-fi experience, then this will certainly deliver; however, it is my feeling that this story is about much more than the end of the world and space travel. Thus, those who seek a deeper meaning will be rewarded as well. The acting in this film is nothing short of sensational; Matthew McConaughey is brilliant, simply put. This movie, along with 'Dallas Buyers Club', have significantly changed my opinion of him as an actor. His recent body of work clearly shows that he is more than just an attractive rom-com star. Anne Hathaway also delivers a great performance, and showed range that I did not know she had. Perhaps the best of them all, though, is Mackenzie Foy as 10-year old Murph. Her performance was so genuine that it moved me emotionally, which is something that doesn't often happen for me in movies. There are many other noteworthy performances as well; I could go on and on. This film has some of the best supporting actors in the business (Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, ect...). Lastly, i'll touch on the plot. While it can be boiled down to a few simple constructs, overtly it is quite complex. It may take a few viewings to truly digest everything that happens in this film, but I think this is one of the things that makes it so great. Not unlike Nolan's other masterpiece, 'Inception', one can take away different things from each new play through of 'Interstellar'. This, along with the themes of survival, love, humanity, and faith are ultimately why I think this movie will go down as one of the greatest of all time (and transcend generations to come).Ultimately, this film isn't perfect; it very close, however, and the flaws that it has can easily be overlooked by everything it does well. While the sentimental undertones or the extreme science fiction backdrop may be a bit too much for some (those familiar with quantum mechanics may find it a bit too unrealistic), I think most who view this will find it remarkable. Christopher Nolan continues to revolutionize cinema with his bold stories and ideas, and 'Interstellar' is yet another notch on his belt. Don't miss this one folks, as it will most certainly be a film that resonates with generations to come.",9,1,2,3 March 2018
Rush," Visually Stunning and Masterfully Written
","I have been aware of the film 'Rush' for some time now, but until recently, I had not made the plunge. It's now been three days since i've seen the film and I must say, it resonated with me unlike any movie i've seen recently. With a masterful script, fantastic acting, a very captivating score by Hans Zimmer, and great direction by Ron Howard(who is apparently a big F1 fan. Who knew?), 'Rush' delivers in every facet a good movie should. 'Rush', based on real events, takes place during the 1970's, centering around two up and coming Formula racers by the names of Niki Lauda and James Hunt. Lauda and Hunt serve as the protagonists of the film(or protagonist/antagonist, depending on how you wish to look at it), with the story revolving around their lives starting in the lowly F3 racing circuit all the way to their legendary 1976 F1 season showdown and beyond. What makes this story so compelling is the relationships and forces that occur between Lauda and Hunt. Both are vehement enemies on the track, but it's quite obvious that they hold a mutual respect for one another. The competition that unfolds between the two rivals over the course of the film is part of what makes 'Rush' shine; both racer's desire to win is fueled by the success of the other. I came into this movie knowing almost nothing about F1 racing, yet I found myself completely enthralled in the details of the sport, and what made both Lauda and Hunt incredibly successful during their careers. Ron Howard truly did a fantastic job keeping me captivated despite my ignorance of the sport coming into the film. While the script and direction of this film is indeed very good, the acting is even better. Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl are simply stunning as James Hunt and Niki Lauda, and are a big part of why this film succeeds. Both actors nail their respective characters, delivering truly life-like recreations of who these people were. After watching the movie, I looked up several videos and interviews with both Lauda and Hunt and was completely awestruck at how accurate they were portrayed. Daniel Brühl was especially convincing as Niki Lauda. You must also give a great deal of credit to the casting crew and makeup crew for picking and crafting such perfect actors for the job. At the end of the film you will see a few clips of Lauda and Hunt from the 70's, and the resemblance between them and the actors who played them is pretty astounding. The supporting cast is also good to very good, with some very well known names such as Olivia Wilde and Natalie Dormer. Overall, the acting in this film is simply top notch. With a witty script supported by some truly inspirational acting and directing, 'Rush' delivers an intense, realistic experience of the 1970's F1 racing world. While the actual race scenes only account for a portion of the film, they are immensely exciting and only add to the overall experience of this character driven movie. You don't have to be an F1 fan to enjoy 'Rush', and you may even find yourself interested in the sport after watching it. Whatever your interests might be for seeing this movie, don't let the subject material sway your decision. If you do, you may just miss out on one of the best movie's made this decade. For a truly encapsulating and resonating experience, I give 'Rush' a rare 9/10.",9,1,1,21 July 2014
Split," A Solid Thriller That Derails at the End
","Overall I enjoyed this film, despite it's flaws. The concept is very intriguing in my opinion and has a lot to offer from a story telling perspective. For the majority of the film I was captivated and invested in the character's wellbeing...until the end. This movie is a shining example of how an ending can diminish what was an otherwise enjoyable experience. I will start by saying that James McAvoy was brilliant in 'Split'. He has, over the years, proven his worth and this film is yet another notch in his belt. While the script is inconsistent at times, McAvoy carries the load with his protrayal of a young man suffering from split personality disorder (23 to be exact, and thus we are given the title 'Split'). The acting is definitely one of the bright spots of this film, and McAvoy does not disappoint; he delivers a truly memorable experience from start to finish. The rest of the cast does a fine job as well; I was especially impressed by the performance of Betty Buckley who plays the therapist of Mcavoy's character Kevin. With an interesting premise and good-to-great acting, what could have possibly went wrong? Well, M. Knight Shyamalan is what went wrong. While i'll give him credit for rising above his recent disasters (and lets be honest, he hasn't made a halfway decent film since 'The Village'), he again attempts to be a bit too clever with this one. The 'twist', as it's become known as in his works, is downright terrible and threatens to derail the entire movie. In fact, the first time I watched this I did not like it because of this 'twist'. It wasn't until my second viewing that I was able to appreciate this movie for what it does well. While the climax of this film is pretty disappointing, the actual conclusion is somewhat interesting. For those who have seen Shyamalan's (good) films, you will know what I speak of when you reach the end. Many did not like this, but I found it to be a pretty cool conclusion. Watch for yourself to see what I mean.I originally rated this film a 5 simply for the disappointing aformentioned climax, but after a second viewing I have decided that it deserves a better score than just 'average'. You must suspend disbelief if you wish to truly enjoy this film, but that isn't uncommon in the movie world. While the climax of the film leaves much to be desired (as well as some of the over-arching plot), overall this is a solid thriller worth watching in my opinion. Kudos to M. Knight for making another film actually worth watching (and one that doesn't make the list for potential worst movies ever).",7,2,3,20 February 2018
Non-Stop," Entertaining, but nothing you haven't seen before
","I don't know what it is about airplanes in movies, but their backdrop always seem to add to the tension and sense of enclosement that the viewer feels, regardless of the source material's quality. Luckily, Non-Stop contains a rock solid script reinforced by some good acting, which ultimately delivers an entertaining movie throughout. I'm a fan of the action/mystery movies, despite the many mediocre films that unfortunately plague this otherwise interesting genre. Non-Stop was a film that kept me engaged from start to finish, and after the first 20 minutes or so, rarely lets up as the mystery unfolds before the viewer's eyes. In short, this movie centers around a misguided air marshall who is thrown into a rather precarious situation when he receives a text message from an alleged passenger threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes if 150 million dollars isn't transported to a specified bank account. Sound familiar? It should, as this general synopsys has been beaten almost to death over the years. What separates this movie from the rest is a series of intertwined mysteries that occur as the plane takes flight over the Atlantic ocean. This film really does keep you guessing throughout as to whom the 'bad guys' may actually be, as well as what their intentions really are. It's always refreshing when you are unable to guess who the perpetrator may be in the first 30 minutes of the film, and I would venture to guess many won't have a clue until they reach the third act of the movie. The red herring literary device is used throughout the script to good effect, misleading the viewer many times before the mystery is finally discovered. This, along with some solid acting from Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore, are what makes this film shine. Now to the negatives. While I found Neeson's character interesting, I felt the part was a bit overzealous in certain situations that detracted from the overall credibility of the story. Certain scenes have Neeson's character beating the crap out of seemingly innocent passengers, and while the situation was certainly grave, I would find it hard to believe an air marshall, an alcoholic, grieving one at that, would be flipping people around aboard a commercial airliner like Steven Seagal. It is part action flick though, so perhaps im judging too hard here. Another issue I had with this film revolves around some holes in the overall plot. As you watch, certain parts of the mystery will begin to make sense, but some portions are completely left either unexplained or become irrelevant, which certainly detracts from the whole experience. Lastly, while the acting was solid, there are by no means any Academy Award winning performances. Liam Neeson seems to have settled right in as an action hero in recent years, and parts of this film have a very Taken-esque feel to it without the more intriguing setting or plot. Julianne Moore is solid, but her character is unfortunately pretty forgettable. The supporting cast performances range from good to below average.The plot certainly isn't anything new or riveting, but that doesn't mean it wasn't executed well despite this. As I said before, the fact that it takes place on an airplane in flight adds to the excitement of the film, despite the plot holes and relatively mediocre characters involved in the film. I didn't find myself seriously engaged with any of the characters involved, yet I still enjoyed the film. The mystery factor really carries this film and is by far the strong suit of the script. The writers did a good job keeping me guessing and on my toes, and I give them immense credit for taking what should be a rather mediocre film and making it quite exciting at times. Non-Stop certainly isn't one for the ages, yet it delivers solid entertainment nonetheless. I'd recommend this movie for fans of the genre, and give it a solid 7/10.",7,1,3,18 June 2014
Ex Machina," One of the Finest, Most Thought Provoking Sci-Fi Movies of All Time
","'Ex Machina' is one of those films that has resonated with me heavily. I've now watched this film 3 times in the last week and I have to say, no sci-fi movie(or any genre for that matter) in recent memory has impacted me quite like this one has. I almost NEVER re-watch a movie more than once a month unless it's an instant favorite, and while it may not be my favorite movie of all time, it has quickly risen through the ranks to become one of my 10 favorite films of all time. I'll skip the synopsis since you can read it above(and I don't want to give too much away, either) but this is a movie best watched with little to no knowledge about the subject material going in. This may seem like a strange concept but I think it vastly adds to the viewing experience. You can probably guess, based off the title and other hints, that this is a film about Artificial Intelligence which is a topic that I am extremely intrigued and somewhat terrified by. 'Ex Machina' chooses to focus on the more philosophical side of AI which is a nice change of pace when comparing it to films of similar subject material. Currently, I am a Computer Science student working on my undergrad and i've also written several college essays about Artificial Intelligence and the impacts it has/could have on the future of mankind. Because of this, the subject material in this film is something that really hit home for me. Writer/director Alex Garland did a fantastic job portraying Artificial Intelligence not as sci-fi but as something our world is facing NOW, which I give him a lot of credit for. Before, AI has been fictionalized as something that will occur hundreds of years from now, when the movement is in fact happening now. It may be a while before we start seeing sentient robots walking the streets, but the fact of the matter is that advanced AI is right around the corner and something we should all be aware of. As far as special effects go, 'Ex Machina' is a real treat to watch. The effects are very subtle yet extremely realistic looking and, because of this, it netted itself an Oscar for special effects. Again, I don't want to give too much away, but the amount of realism Garland was able to achieve on a relatively low budget is nothing short of stunning. The cinematography in this film is also a real treat to watch; the film takes place in the vast wilderness of Alaska, and some of the scenic shots are breathtaking to watch. Lastly, i'll touch on the acting. All 3 of the main actors deliver stellar performances in 'Ex Machina', and i'm actually surprised Oscar Isaac didn't get a best supporting actor nod for his work in this film. I've become a big fan of Isaac over the last year, and I think this movie is a fantastic example of what he can do. His character is nothing short of hilarious at times but also displays a vulnerability that is difficult to portray for a movie like this. Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander are both terrific in this film as well, and the screen time they share together shows fantastic chemistry. All 3 deliver extremely memorable performances which is key to a film like this because if any one of them was less than stellar, the movie would have suffered greatly for it. I know my review is rather vague, and as I stated above, I did this on purpose. You will want to know as little as possible about the plot of this film heading in as it will drastically improve the overall viewing experience. From start to finish, 'Ex Machina' delivers laugh out loud moments, fantastic cinematography, and absolutely stunning special effects. The subject material is very cerebral as well, and will probably have you thinking about the ending long after the final credits roll. Movies like this don't come along very often and, when they do, they deserve to be celebrated. 'Ex Machina' is simply one of the most thought provoking films i've seen in recent years, and I will continue to think about the message it delivers as our society continues to advance further in the technology era. I rarely hand out 10/10s but in this case, It doesn't deserve anything less. 'Ex Machina' isn't just one of the best films of 2015 but, in my humble opinion, one of the best films of this decade and one that I will continue to ponder as the years roll on.",10,5,11,3 March 2016
Logan," The X-Men Movie We Have All Been Waiting For
","I absolutely applaud the creators of this film; finally, we are provided a mature, interesting take on Wolverine which has been long overdue. This film touches on themes of family, unity, and most of all, minority treatment wrapped in a relatable, superhero driven package. I've been especially critical of superhero movies in recent years. Often, in my opinion, these films feel watered down as they are pumped out faster than we can watch them. I've always had a soft spot for X-Men, though, and this is by far the best of the bunch. Wolverine is one of my favorite superheros of all time, and we are finally rewarded with a mature, explicit movie that shows wolverine exactly as he was always meant to be shown. This film is not meant to be a sequel machine; in fact, it is quite the opposite. 'Logan' is meant to be a farewell to the character as we know it, and I must say that it was done in exceeding fashion. I did not expect this movie to be as incredible as it is, simply put. The characters are complex and mature and the plot is believable and exciting. Those of us that have been waiting for an adult superhero movie with a halfway decent script are finally rewarded with 'Logan'. Hugh Jackman, as usual, does a fantastic job in his role. In fact, the entire cast does a great job. This film, though, more than any of the others, has a genuine, relatable feel to it. While there are obviously mutants involved, I think this is one of the most relatable superhero movies to date. With themes that touch heavily on the treatment of minorities and discrimination, 'Logan' tells a story more impactful than any superhero film made before it. If you are an X-Men fan, then you will absolutely love this one. If you aren't, there are plenty of other reasons to see it. With excellent acting and a memorable script, 'Logan' will most certainly resonate with viewers long after the credits have rolled. The themes I mentioned previously aid fantastically to the already great plot and give us something else to think about apart from action and conflict. To top it all off, there is blood, gore, and swearing to boot. This is a Wolverine film done right, and I think it is a fantastic farewell to one of the best characters in Marvel's illustrious history.",9,1,2,5 April 2018
Inception," Nolan produces yet another masterpiece
","To say Inception is good is an understatement. To say it is great is more insulting than complimentary. This film comes closer to perfection than possibly any movie I have ever seen. The story is flawless, the acting phenomenal and the special effects are absolutely breathtaking. Nolan wrote and directed an instant masterpiece with 'Inception'. After seeing the premiere, it didn't surprise me at all to see it jump right into the top 250, now sitting pretty at number 3. The movie centers around a technological advancement in science which allows people to enter the human mind through dreaming. Through shared dreaming, our main character Cobb(DiCaprio) enters the dreams of major corporate entities to steal their most prized secrets. This maneuver is called 'extraction', and starts the basis of the whole movie. While Cobb is the best extractor there is, he is haunted by past issues which ultimately prevents him from returning home to his family. Before he can return home, Cobb is tasked with one last job that requires doing the absolute impossible. 'Inception', which is the premise of the film, requires a team of extraction specialists to enter someones mind and plant a false idea. In the world of shared dreaming, this is considered an almost impossible task. Without giving away too many details, Cobb assembles a team of the very best to perform the task of inception. The target is the son of a wealthy tycoon ready to inherit a fortune. If this sounds interesting to you, and it should, then do not hesitate to see this film. The plot is very easy to follow, which allows all age groups to enjoy this film. What makes it amazing, however, is the complexities that the story holds. If you wish to dig deeper into Inception you can, and will be delighted at the amount of sheer detail Nolan included about his fantasy world. The idea of 'dream sharing' is covered in great depth and with amazing detail. It may be difficult for everyone to grasp the 'Whole picture' on the first watch, but that doesn't mean you wont understand whats going on. Thats the great part about this film. If you are looking for a casual good time, this film is for you. If you wish to watch something complex and beautiful, this film is for you. Very rarely does something that can appeal to all audiences come along, making this movie a real gem.Lastly, I would like to give credit where it is due. The acting is simply phenomenal. Its believable, savvy, and emotional all at the same time. Besides possibly Blood Diamond or the Departed, this is easily Dicaprio's best film to date. He plays a very hard character to project; someone who is filled with contradictions, yet is still calm, concise, and mature. Ellen Paige proved to me she can actually act with a powerful and convincing supporting role. Gordon-Levitt(Arthur) surprised me a great deal in this movie. Seeing his previous work I was unimpressed(Brick, just to name one) but in this film he shows his true talent. He pulls off the calm, level-headed partner to the T. He pulls quite a bit of attention away from Dicaprio on the screen, which is in no way an easy task. I give him absolute props for his role. Tom Hardy, one of the best up and coming British actors in my opinion, brings the comic relief to the movie and does it with the usual swagger he commands. Lasty, Marion Cotillard impressed me yet again, not just because of her beauty, but because of the emotion she brings to her character. The cast is nothing short of perfect, and without them this movie would still be good, but certainly not what it is. It takes believable actors to make the material seem real. I am writing this review to hopefully convince those skeptics out there to take a leap of faith. You wont be disappointed. 'Inception' has everything a good film should have. Romance, suspense, great dialogue, plot twists etc etc. While it certainly isn't my 'favorite' movie of all time, it sits pretty high on the list. Only a handful of movies in the past have had this sort of effect on me, and it should hold true for you as well. It will literally 'blow your mind'. :)",10,5,13,19 July 2010
Wonder Woman," An Above Average Superhero Film
","I'm incredibly surprised by all the 1 star reviews on here. Is this really the worst movie you reviewers have ever seen? 'Woder Woman' has it's flaws, sure, but is far from the worst movie i've ever seen. In fact, I found this to be one of the better superhero movies i've seen recently. As I stated before, this movie has it's flaws; the beginning of the film, while necessary I suppose to explain the backstory, felt fairly contived to me. The acting was mediocre at best (Robin Wright's character, Antiope, most of all) and the 'Amazon kingdom', where Diana (Wonder Woman) is from, felt hastily pieced together. Once the film leaves the island, however, things improve quite a bit. Now on to some positives. I felt that the supporting cast did an excellent job in this film. Chris Pine delivers another solid performance, which is to be expected these days. Danny Huston puts in a believable performance as the evil German general and, in my opinion, served as the best antagonist in the film. Ewen Bremner also does a good job in his usual 'silly character' role which has seemingly followed him since his first big performance in 'Trainspotting'. Gal Gadot does a fine job in the leading role, delivering what I felt was a fairly authentic performance overall. This film takes place during the Great War of 1918 which was an intriguing choice in my opinion. The setting seems pretty believable considering the context, which helps draw you into the film. The action scenes are, for the most part, well executed and aren't so frequent as to compromise the plot. This film does have a semblence of a plot, too, which is a big reason why I liked it. Many superhero movies forgo the plot for constant action, which luckily 'Wonder Woman' does not do. This allows us a chance to spend some time with the interesting characters. I felt the humor in this film was really well done as well, and did not seem forced like so many movies do. It also fit the time period fairly well. The ending has it's issues, but overall I felt it climaxed at the proper time and ended at the proper time as well. While the runtime is quite long (2 hours 20 minutes), it never felt dull apart from the first 25 minutes or so. There is one particularly emotional scene right before the end that I felt was really well done, especially for a movie such as this. The conclusion leaves room for sequels like all superhero movies do, and while I don't really care for these types of endings, it was expected nonetheless. Overall this film is indeed flawed, but I still enjoyed it as a whole. it is certainly not worthy of all these 1 star reviews it is receiving (is this movie seriously on par with Battlefield: Earth? I think not). While I was hesitant to watch it, in the end i'm glad I did. Watch it for yourself before passing judgement and see if you agree with me. This is the best DC movie thus far in my opinion, and well worth the chance.",6,2,6,18 February 2018
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," One of my Favorite Movies of all Time
","Over the years, i've watched this movie maybe 20 or 30 times and every time I find something new to laugh about. The Coen Brother have crafted a hilariously dysfunctional buddy movie in O Brother, Where art Thou? which never ceases to make me smile. Loosely based off Homer's epic 'The Odyssey', the story follows 3 men who, after escaping from a chain gang in depression era Mississipi, set out on a search for buried treasure left behind by George Clooney's character Ulysses Everett McGill. Along the way they meet all sorts of quirky characters which include an unscrupulous Bible Salesman, a horse eating redneck, a bank robbing lunatic, an ornery flour tycoon(who also happens to be Governor), a young man who sells his soul to the devil and a very peculiar blind man who owns a recording studio. It's safe to say the Coen Bros. took their time fleshing out the minor roles in this film and every new character you encounter feels very original. Credit is also due to the actors for performing these roles, but the writing in this movie is simply fantastic.Which brings me to my next point. The dialogue in this script is some of the funniest, most entertaining in films today. Everett McGill(played by Clooney) is the smooth talking, seemingly over-educated convict who self appoints himself leader of the escapees and is easily the bright spot of this film. Clooney's character is as hilarious as he is flamboyant and is definitely one of his best acting performances to date. Tuturro and Nelson are also quite funny as the bumbling idiot companions to McGill as they set out across Mississipi looking for the treasure. Some of the funniest moments in this movie involve simple conversations between the 3 and seeing the clearly uneducated companions try to make sense of McGill's over expanded vocabulary. Holly Hunter is also great in this movie as McGill's estranged wife and adds an extra dimension to the story that is quite interesting. The Coen Brothers are known for writing fleshed out, quirky characters in their movies and this one is no exception. The writing is witty and the acting is exceptional by everyone. The theme is meant to be light hearted while also maintaining a sense of realism for the time period in which it is set. I give them a lot of credit for staying true to the accuracy of the period but also keeping the feel of the film lighthearted and fun(Tough to do as depression era Mississipi was not a lighthearted or fun period in time at all). I also have to add that the score of this movie fits perfectly, mixing old time county/bluegrass to perfect effect. Overall, this is not only one of the best Coen Bros. films but, in my opinion, one of the best 50 films of all time. The humor is(mostly) clean as well so it can be enjoyed by a wider age group than many modern comedies. A can't miss film by some of the best Writers/Directors of our time.",10,1,2,10 May 2013
