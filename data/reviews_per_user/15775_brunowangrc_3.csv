Scarface," This movie is amazing
","The first time I ever learned about the movie Scarface was when I bought a T-shirt from the Supreme online store (First I wanna say that this brand releases every Thursday morning only, and all the stuff they sell sells out in like 1 or 2 minutes - for example, a T-shirt I bought online, the original price is $30-$40 at the online store, and some real popular ones can sell for like $100-$250; do it; you'll make easy money ; that's why a lot of young people like this brand and like doing this). When I got my shirt online, it had a picture of a guy's face and the word 'Scarface' written on it. I had no idea what that was. So I checked online, did some research. found out it's a movie - a 1983 American crime directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. 
 And it was amazing!
 This movie tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana who came to Miami, United States in 1980s. At the beginning, Tony was just a punk on the street and worked with a local drug dealer. Every time he finished the dirty works on time,so his boss appreciated him and put him on the top. He become the first right-hand man of his organization. At the same time,he got much stronger and more powerful, he was addicted to drugs. However, he was not satisfied. He took a big deal with Venezuelan drug dealers. And then he killed all the people that he didn't like it. It was too late that his boss realized that Tony betrayed him. So Tony took the boss out of the game and took charge of all the drug businesses in Miami. After that, Tony began to become suspicious of the people around him, even his wife,young sister and friends. In the end, he was shot by haters, but continued to taunt until he was fatally shot from behind by a shotgun blast. His body fell into a fountain below, in front of fountain reading ' The World Is Yours'.
 In the years that followed, this movie has received reappraisal from critics. A bunch of people said Scarface is one of the best crime movies ever made,especially in the gangster genre. The movie has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in rap, hip hop music, comic books and video games. One American rapper- Nas released the album ' The World is yours' in 1994.
 In my way, I think this movie is talking about the American Dream. Tony came to U.S. with nothing, and he started his own business. Even though he did a lot of bad things, he's living his own life, he does whatever he want to do, and became the person he wants to be. I really admire him in some way. He was working hard for his business, did all the things is for his family,friends. I really like this big man. He would pay anything instead of his life for his poor family. Those people who from the hood, they love their family numbers.Based on the movies, I learned a lot things. Lesson number one: Don't underestimate the other guy's greed.Also, don't be a paranoid person, trust issues is the most important things in friendships. Lesson number two: Don't use drugs in your life, not even try it. If you addicted to drugs, you will lose the person who you love, and your family numbers. In the end, I really like this movie, it's a perfect example of gangster movies.",9,0,0,20 June 2018
