Blade Runner 2049," Very overrated
","I find this new take boring, way too many dragged out sceens. They could with ease cut 50% of the content because it brings so little to the movie. I find the first Blade Runner much better with deeper characters and with a much darker tone (more cyberpunk).Was hard to watch the whole movie and it's sad because i really like the theme.",4,2,3,10 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Meh
","Very overrated, as a film with a beginning and a end i feel nothing. Some great acting from Leo but it feels wasted. The movies little twist was pretty obvious and it wasen't enough. Many good moments were cut and replaced with dragged out sceens.Anyway a movie that you don't feel anything from is pretty shallow, i love the era but it's not enough.",4,4,9,9 September 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Don't get the hype
","It's boring, i don't care about the characters. Overrated to madness. The movie could have been way darker, feels like a disney adventure.Great acting, ok story.",4,1,4,10 September 2019
