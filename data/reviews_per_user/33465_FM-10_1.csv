Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Don't listen to the critics!
","In Phantom Menace, Lucas lays the groundwork for the original Star Wars characters.  Any idiot who says this show has no plot is ignorant of the Star Wars universe and has no love for the story.  If you love the Star Wars universe and are vaguely familiar with the story, you will be able to follow the show easily.PM tells the story of Queen Amidala (Luke and Leia Skywalker's mother) and Anakin Skywalker (aka Darth Vader).  Anakin is a small boy living as a slave on Tatooine.  Circumstances bring two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, to the planet where they discover Anakin and his link with the force.  They take him off of Tatooine and bring him before the Jedi Council on Corescant.  (Keep in mind that the Lucas intended the Star Wars movies to be completely about Anakin Skywalker).Besides laying the groundwork for the characters, it also begins the story of how the Trade Federation becomes the Empire and how Emperor Palpatine ('The Emperor') came to be.There IS a story behind PM, the story of a greedy Trade Federation, led leash in hand by Darth Sidious, exerting force on a small planet.  The Federation thinks the reason behind the invasion is the money and the power, when in reality there are ulterior motives at play.The effects are excellent - amazing even.  The acting, regardless of what you've heard, is pretty good.  Liam Neeson and Ewean McGregor are excellent. The Jedi battle scenes are positively awe-inspiring.  The plot is subtle, and thus the reason simple-minded movie critics can't grasp it.  This isn't the best movie ever made, but it's sure better than Titanic.The Star Wars universe continues.  If you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT NOW! If you have, GO SEE IT AGAIN!",10,0,0,17 June 1999
