The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Worthy
","When Perks of being Wallflower film came out,I was sure that it was good.It didn't prove me wrong as I read the book.The book was excellent.So I didn't had a doubt that the film would be good as it was directed by the author of the book.The author remained loyal in the book adaptation,so I didn't have any complaint.I enjoyed how it showed the US of 90s,but what I really appreciated was the honesty.Although characters were fictionary the plot was a true masterpiece,and I wondered why the movie wasn't a success.It was good at receptions and it really deserved to be a commercial success.Finally the performances of the actors were good,especially Emma Watson's which earned her a People's Choice award.",8,2,4,3 May 2013
The Ring," Materpiece
","The Ring is absolutely one of my favorite horror films.It has to do with Rachel,a reported who tries to uncover the mystery behind the horrific death of her nephew.I loved the cinematography and the performance of Naomi Watts.I think that the film is all about mystery,not really about horror.I don't say that ,it is not scary.When I first saw it it was really disturbing.Actually few jump scenes,but still scary.The Ring is one of the best horror films of the last decade.I have seen many recent horror films but they are nowhere near The Ring.Well I can't compare it with Shining or Exorcist but it is still good.If you are a real fan of horror you've really got to see this.You won't regret it!",8,1,1,3 May 2013
Burlesque," Spectacular!
","I just watched the movie and all I can say is that I was so impressed,that I remained silent in awe during the whole movie.Not a fan of the musicals myself,this film was so rich with good songs and plenty shiny costumes,which is a pretty basic element for a good musical.Another clue is the fact that the film wouldn't reach this high level without the contributions of Christina Aguilera and Cher.An acclaimed singer and a legend(both singer and successful actress) respectively.Christina showed in some scenes her not brilliant but good dance skills.For some minutes I thought that Christina was singing Lady Marmalade but I was proved wrong.The dance/sing/act performances were brilliant.It is highly recommended for a womens night in bed with popcorn.Totally it is fun to watch it.Highly recommended!",8,0,0,29 June 2013
