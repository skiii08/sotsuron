Frost_Nixon," Only One Can Win the Duel
","Richard Nixon is perhaps the simplest or most difficult President to analyze. That is one of the reasons why his presidency has been constantly disputed and reviewed with plays, films and operas about the man.But seldom has there been an occasion where people are drawn to see Nixon after his Presidency. The premise of this film is the disgraced President going to 'duel' with a long shot talkshow host named David Frost in a series of interviews. I personally was more drawn to the film in learning how a man like David Frost could gain the courage and strength to interview the President of the United States.The film is delivered as a tastefully done biopic taking the story from both stories with Frost putting all he has on the line in the interviews and Nixon trying to regain his tarnished legacy. Both of the actors play their characters very well nearly capturing the key aspects of them. Langella matches the deep voice and muttering of Nixon very well and Sheen nearly matches Frost's appearance and looks.The film is an excellent duel of words and shows raw emotion of the President and a talk show host.",8,1,2,9 February 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Marvel Makes a Beautiful Remake
","When Ang Lee made the Hulk people were not disappointed but not satisfied. So it came as no surprise that the film makers decided not to make the two other Hulk movies planned. So when The Incredible Hulk was in development I had major doubts.But all these doubts became deafened by the good trailer and me seeing the actual movie.The movie made the right choice for casting Ed Norton as Bruce Banner and all the other actors particularly Tim Routh as Emil Blonsky worked pretty good to me.The movie is far more action oriented, great with a more understandable origin and a more vulnerable Hulk. Hence why they would make the Abomination a superior match to the Hulk. The acting and the hyper-realistic tone are all done very well and it is a great movie. I like how they were able to put in the Leader as a nice little hidden bonus for fans and Tony Stark revealing the plans about the Avengers.My two regrets are that this new General Ross is not as menacing as Sam Elliot and that it did not have some of the science explained enough.",8,2,3,27 June 2008
