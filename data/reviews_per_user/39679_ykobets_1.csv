Mission: Impossible III," Why don't we get James Bond married also?
","When the movie started, I thought it was cool to see a great spy being tortured, about to collapse and helpless (it reminded me the last delivery of the Bond saga, but this one is more intense). The sadistic and senseless face of the villain (Seymour Hoffman is a jewel, even in his performance in a blockbuster action movie), the spy begging, the shot in the head, the match sparking and the music. I throw some popcorn in my mouth and got ready for some frantic action, shooting and chasing. The elimination of a lineal plot, that buried M:I 2 back in 2000, and the comeback to a more elaborated storyline, a la De Palma style, was expected. The wife stuff was cool, the subject of the existence of life beyond the IMF, the legendary spy teaching the young recruits at Langley - all that was OK. And finally, the first mission throws Hunt, as expected, back to the field. The cool spy borns as one and dies as one. (WARNING: We are talking about the movies, so I will aloud myself to exaggerate a little bit and put things in perspective). The wife is left quietly at the peaceful home, while Hunt attempts to save a girl whose activity is much more interesting and challenging than the one his lovely wife represents. The storyline gets more complicated keeping you at the edge of your seat. The second mission, from beginning to end, is absolutely awesome. The special effects are state of the art, and we finally get an explanation of the masks and voices stuff, so commonly used in the M:I saga. The twists of the plot continue until we finally reach the point where we realize that the most risky, dangerous mission will be to save the wife, whose innocent existence was corrupted by the merciless villain. The national security, the deadly menace to the world, the treason - all of that goes to a second place. The wife is the center and motive of Hunt's activity. Why is that? The true spy have no attachment to the world of the feelings, nor to all that stuff that can hurt him by hurting said 'stuff'. I'll explain: Hunt got grabbed by the balls because of his wife. I insist, if you are a spy y can not aloud the bad guys to get to you through your loving ones, you don't have such loving ones and if you do, you'll suffer the consequences. In the real world, I must insist, this is nonsense, every single of us has loving ones, but a spy should not have. If he do, he becomes vulnerable. In the movies this subject can be treated wisely as they did in M:I 1, with uncle Donald and Momma Hunt as drug dealers. Nevertheless, Hunt's actions were not affected by this, he continued with the mission. In M:I 3, it is different, he faced a whole new situation, and the spy reacted as human. Maybe that is OK, but that is not the essence of the M:I saga. What is going to happen when James Bond got married? No more Bond girls? Clearly this is not the case with Hunt, but the vulnerability of the spy because of the girl is evident. One last thought: I understand that Cruise is madly in love with Kat, he finally proved that the sterile one was Nicole by having a daughter and he was intending to prove to Kat that he will do everything for her, even jeopardizing his life and of others to save her. But, man!! Do not mess with the Hunt character. Leave him alone! Do some crappy love story movie, buy her an island, send her flowers, but leave M:I alone! Cruise is clearly a good Hunt, but I seriously doubt that a fourth delivery will be approved. That is sad. I really recommend this movie. I liked it, it is enjoyable, I insist, its special effects and darkness are very good, but... Let's not repeat what I already said. Enjoy, guys.",6,0,1,9 May 2006
