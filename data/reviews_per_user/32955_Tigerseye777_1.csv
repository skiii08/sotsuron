Walk the Line," Excellent movie!
","This movie was a great movie! I loved it! If you like Johnny Cash and his music...then this movie is definitely for you! Even if you don't know all that much about Johnny and June, then it is still a great movie that tells one of the best love stories ever told! I give props to Joaquin and Reese for doing such an amazing job in their wonderful portrayal of Johnny and June! They did such a great job acting and singing! Johnny and June were really legends in country music, and Reese and Joaquin did a great job in portraying the person inside of these legendary country music icons. They were able to give people to get a glimpse into the love they shared not only for country music, but for each other as well. I highly recommend seeing this movie!",10,0,3,28 November 2005
