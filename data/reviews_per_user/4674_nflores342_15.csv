Sucker Punch," A Solid Flick
","To start with, Zack Synder is a movie genius; and like his previous movies that are amazing,'Sucker Punch' is no exception.The storyline of this movie was solid and unwavering, the audience was captivated and thoroughly entertained.The special effects where stunning,very much in the style of Snyder, that for me is what made the movie great,in fact that what the whole movie is; my only recommendation is to watch this movie in 3-D, which I didn't, I'm sure it will blow your mind;but add a good storyline to this fantastic flick and you have what you paid for, a good movie.The sets were fantastic, they truly enhanced the look of the movie, the costumes, brilliant, although I would hate to parade around in a corset all day long. Another aspect of the movie that truly enhanced it was the music truly great stuff.The acting from the actresses where as good as can be expected, not Oscar worthy, but I felt Baby Doll's pain, may I add that it's good to have Emily Browning back. Although the movie was a solid I truly can't help but feel that there was something missing(but don't let that stop you from watching the movie)That is why I'm giving this movie an 8/10, it not perfect, but it most definitely is not boring.",8,4,9,27 March 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Just Okay, Nothing more
","The reason these reviews are read is to gather information on whether or not the reader should spend their money on this movie, with that in mind i'm reviewing the movie as a movie, not just as a movie based on a book.So with that lets begin, The acting is as you expect it to be, just plain and nothing special, although some very small credit should be given to K-stew, she did slightly better. The hype for this movie was on a level with Harry Potter, only HP conquered all in literary and cinematic form.The Locations of the movie were worth the plain storyline, they were a character of themselves, but what made the movie truly worth it was the prosthetics that Kristen donned to play a Pregnant deformed human, bravo special effects you hit it spot on.Costumes, same as prior films, Music, consistent and wonderfully put together, the only problematic portion of the film is when the CGI wolves are having mental monologues, no one in the theater could keep a straight face. On top of that the storyline was inconsistent in pacing, it took a bit for the movie to get interesting.With that Breaking Dawn as a film, lets be honest, its not great, the series as films, well its no bueno too, but as stated as books where our imagination has no budget the films are somewhat decent, and with that I give this film a 7/10 not for the books transformation to film but because the movie entertained me for the two hours that I watched it, and that is what films are supposed to do.",Null,3,9,22 November 2011
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games is a Winner
","This movie is near perfect, and as far as book adaptations go this film is right up there with Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings films. The tension that Katniss is feeling in The Launch Room literally had my stomach in knots, never had I personally felt a connection to a character in any film i've seen than in that moment. With the mention of Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence's performance in this film is sublime. Her normally bubbly, charismatic personality is non-existent in the character she portrays, Katniss truly stepped out of the book in a near 'Oscar' worthy performance ( seems slightly exaggerated, but it was breathtaking).My Exact thoughts: Peeta.......jeez (marry me) The Capitol itself as beautiful as it was I still wouldn't live there, place reeks of evil.The arena, spot on.Effie, my new Halloween costume.Haymitch, weird.Cinna my third favorite character.Honestly the only semi negative I can say about this film, hence the 9, is that even though the film was two and a half hours long, some scenes felt rushed, and some scenes were too long, other than that this film is wonderful and cannot in anyway shape or form be compared to twilight (sorry had to do it).To keep it short, go watch it, even if you haven't read the book please go see this, it a wonderful adaptation that will make you actually want to read the book, but more importantly will make you a fan of the hunger games. Trust me, this film is not a waste of you money or time.",9,0,9,25 March 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Bold and Brilliant
","Very rarely do I give such a high ranking score to a film (the last being The Dark Knight in 2008)because there are usually certain aspects that are missing, don't work, or the film just wasn't good at all. I'm happy to report that this film was fantastic, like anything else there are people who would disagree with me and say i'm delusional, but everyone has their tastes.While i'm not a true Trekkie in the sense that I haven't watched the original series and films (i'm doing it now), I consider my self a Trekkie at heart, and fell in love with the 2009 Star Trek reboot. A known fact in films is a sequel usually doesn't live up to the original and while the 2009 film was great, Into Darkness was sublime.The pros: the fact that JJ Abrams took his time making this film (3 years) truly shows the attention to detail and passion he has when making his films.The acting was great, and the new additions into the cast helped make the film that much better, but most noticeably Benedict Cumberbatches character John Harrison, his character is in the same league as Heath Ledgers Joker. And while slightly cheesy at times, the script was great, despite what some say, I feel the essence of the original series seep into the script with it's witty one liners and cute linesThe costumes and sets had to be even more exquisite than in the original, and they very much were;they were exciting and realistic and made the film a great ride.The cons: The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I have to wait another 3 years for the next film :)Go watch it, that is all I can say it literally has everything a moviegoer wants(except horror): romance, suspense, action, comedy, and drama, a perfect blend that gives you a fantastic, action packed film.",10,5,13,1 June 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Fast 6
","I'll admit I was always a fan of the Fast and Furious series, but I wasn't a true lover of the series until it was revamped in 2009 with Fast & Furious; from there the series took off and became bigger and better.With that, Fast Six was a great flick don't get me wrong, the action, the story, and the cars were great, but I feel the movie was slightly too long and dragged out. I feel if they stuck to the pace of Fast Five, the film would have been perfectThe Pros: The cars were great! The actors sexy and believable and the action bigger and better than the predecessors.The sets amazing! had this been a straight racing movie, I feel the film would have fallen flat and not been as great.The Cons: The story had potential, it made sense and was definitely obtainable, having said that the story had too much going on that made the film jump around and wasn't cohesive. The action while amazing, was insane and probably would never happen in a real life setting (still was amazing to watch).Regardless of the cons that didn't float my boat, I still loved the movie and it was a pleasure to watch, i'm super stoked for Fast 7, if you want a taste of Fast 7 go watch Fast 6, enjoy a great car action movie and have a good time.",8,2,4,1 June 2013
Underworld Awakening," Another Fantastic Film
","I'm sick of 'Top Critics' giving these films such low reviews. We Underworld fans know what these movies should be about and love them despite the minor plot holes and all the negativity they have garneredLike most people with common sense, they know these films do not aim to achieve Oscar status, they aim to give us one heck of a ride with a great story line, fantastic action sequence, and brilliant make and CG effects: mission accomplished. The acting is solid for what these films require, they're believable and sell the movie; the sets, costumes and, make up, I give them a solid ten for originality and making this series what it truly is, amazing.Now for this installment, I give it a 9 because it blends in fantastically with the previous films, they coincide to where the viewers know when they see a dark city with a catsuit clad heroine that it is Underworld. Also the storyline is solid, and with the birth of a new character, this series just got even more exciting. Plus i'm a true fan of this series, can you feel my passion:)This is by far the best in the series, my only hope is that they do end the series with a fifth one, just to give us true fans a proper closing and one final amazing ride with the vampires and lycans.",9,6,15,22 January 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Simply Stunning
","This is my first review for a Harry Potter movie, and its not because I didn't like the other ones, but this one touched me in a way that the other ones didn't. This one was very if not almost exactly like the book, which lately seems to be a problem for screenplay writers who butcher great books. In the book you felt ever emotion the characters felt, and in the movie you could feel the despair and the sadness ten fold; you are literally with Harry, Hermione, and Ron. The pace of the movie made it brilliant, it lengthened the movie until you counln't stand it anymore,but it also made it aggravating. It kept you on the edge of your seat, waiting for what you know whats going to happen; or you simply waited with Harry and his friends in endless weeks of doing nothing,which was translated into the movie beautifully. The effects were phenomenal(as always).Also the new characters were just perfect, the snatchers looked BADA@!#'s. Like rock stars. By far the beginning of the movie and the Ministry of Magic scene were the best! Stunning, my jaw was on the ground. So for all you Potter fans, you wont be disappointed, it is a brilliant movie and cannot wait for the second one.",9,2,4,25 November 2010
Twilight," And so the lion feel in love with the lamb.(literally)
","An avid twilighter and lover of the series, I was completely stoked when I found out the book was being turned into a movie. And after watching the midnight showing I was in two words 'blown away' summit was completely faithful to the book, almost, really almost (please remember its a five hundred page book fit into two hours), every major scene in the book was in the movie. Not always in the exact same order, but to where it fit and made the movie run smoothly. Im not going to continue typing and say it was a perfect movie, it wasn't, no movie ever really is. But by personal preference, and opinion there was more positive then negative. The movie was done smoothly, meaning the length of the book was made into a strong storyline and made sense, what might had made it difficult for those who didn't read the book,was the pace. Where it should have been slow, it was slightly fast(like the hotel and meadow scene).The added scenes made the story much more enjoyable,it never took away from the story.the locations were beautiful, the acting was great,rob did an amazing job,as did Kristen. In truth all the put downs for all the actors casted(and there were a lot) they all did amazing jobs. the makeup was amazing. The other only little glips I see with the movie ,were the stunts,the length of the movie and the script. they could and hopefully for new moon, make the stunts look more realistic,natural, and less cheesy.and the script, maybe take out just a little drama from Bella,no matter how prone she is to danger,she felt stronger in the book, then she did in the movie. And finally, I hope the next movie is longer. two hours was not enough. The movie as good as it was(and it was good),was not enough to sate my appetite. I want more. More little details that will make us twilighters go crazy with joy. And I simply cannot wait for the next installment.new moon.",9,1,5,23 November 2008
The Dark Knight," Best Movie of 2008!!!
","10 out of 10. 2 thumbs way way up.Whatever you can list as brilliant do it because this movie is simply breath taking. I was expecting a good movie, I came out With everything and more. Special effects were amazing, acting superb, and best of all Christian bale was an even better batman. Heath Ledger, may he rest in peace, was absoulutly amazing. A performance to be rememembered. The costumes in this movie were a character by themselves,the joker by far had the best suit. This was by far the best movie of the 2008, and one can only hope that there is more batman in the future, because i will most certainly be waiting.",10,3,9,18 June 2009
Thor," Another Winner for the Marvel Universe.
","The Marvel movies of the past years have had only one disappointment, and that was with 'Hulk' which starred Eric Bana. Thor can be added to the past Marvel films that have made a mark on the cinematic world. I am not a hardcore fan when it comes to the Thor Comic books, but I know him well enough to know what the film version should include.While there is much to work with for the film I was still wary as to how they would pursue the film version and make Thor as successful as Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and so on; but they did it splendidly and the end result is a fantastic movie experience with amazing stunts and graphics.The storyline was solid moving from the Asgard to Earth made the movie much more interesting then having it set in one world. The sets were elaborate, beautiful, and very appropriate for the Norse Gods; and on top of that the futuristic style of the costumes added more to the sets and really brought the characters to life. Another aspect that made the movie was beside the heavyweight actors such as Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, and Anthonly Hopkins, brought relatively unknown actors to the big screen which added a sense a mystery as to what the audience can expect from the cast.Chris Hemsworth was fantastic, i'm eager to see him in the Avengers; the performances from his friends (Sif,Loki...)complimented his performance brilliantly. But I believe the film to be complete with Darcy (Kat Dennings) she made the movie funny in all the right places.With that I give this movie a 9/10 because as great as the movie was, it was not perfect some small flaws were, and I know that this is mean, but Natalie actually bugged me at times with her performance. I felt that she was too serious an actress to do this type of film, but as stated it wasn't a horrible performance from her just momentary instances where I was like 'oh my god.' But like anything else its a matter of opinion and preference to which everyone is entitled to. But enjoy the movie for it is a fun and wild ride.",9,1,4,9 May 2011
Burlesque," Show Me How You Burlesque
","Lets be clear, this movie really does make you want to just get up and start dancing. This movie was pure sexy fun, and for us ladies there was some great eye candy too. But with the fun we also have to be realistic and look at this movie like a movie. The good1.costumes,music, sets were great, amazing and beautiful. They complemented the movie wonderfully.2.Christina as a singer was amazing, there really is no other like her, and the supporting cast was just plain fun. Cam was plain yummy3.Cher still has it, no matter what anyone says.The Bad1.As wonderful a singer Christina is, her acting chops need some work, but for a first timer, she did well. But for the drama in this movie she needs to work on her acting for future productions. And lets be real at one point in the movie her acting was so blah that I just wanted to slap Ali for being so annoying.2.The storyline for the film had to much going on. Between Christina wanting jack who has a lady friend to wanting the other guy, to her wanting to be a singer in the show, then the whole money problem with Cher, to Nikki being a drunk , and lastly Georgia getting knocked up. Well There was just a little to much going on. So the movie isn't perfect, but then again those are hard to find now and days. But the movie was fun, flirty, sexy, and had great musicality.I give it a 6 out of ten for being the fun movie it was suppose to me, but knock of points for lack of consistent story and acting chops.",6,3,5,30 November 2010
The Woman in Black," Daniel is All Grown Up.
","As far as horror films go, this one is decent. our easily scared, this film will not disappoint, but for the heavy duty horror buffs (like me) this film won't disappoint, but won't have you covering your eyes.Although fairly predictable, and having no presence of gore, the film is still very enjoyable and worth watching. Most horror buffs think horror flicks need to have blood, guts, and a crazy serial killer to be considered to be scary; this film has a little bit of blood, has a serial killer (not typical one), but no guts. What it lacks in gore it makes up for suspense and a great storyline.The acting is average, the setting and period costumes were great, and are dear Harry Potter has grown up to be a great versatile actor. The Woman in Black, was actually very creepy and the best character of the whole film was the Marsh where all of this took place, just the though of driving up that very narrow road surrounded by muck sends chills down my spine.So a 7 out of 10 is given for this film just because I personally wasn't afraid,but give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is.",7,1,5,5 February 2012
X-Men: First Class," X-Men are Reborn
","The first three films had there ups and there downs and then came Wolverine's personal film to which it garnered mixed reviews. X-Men first class was a wonderful breath of fresh air.What made this movie wonderful was the relatively unknown actors that they casted, in the first four films the cast was packed with actors of the likes as Sir Ian Mckellan, Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and more. This is the first film I have watched with Jennifer Lawerance and I believe her to have been one of the focal points for the film; the story of mystique is so intricate that it's wonderful to see it in flesh and blood and acted out splendidly.Fassbender and McAvoy worked out wonderfully together (no pun intended)really they complemented each other the toughness with the softness and through in some sexuality and were good to go. The other x-men were funny,witty, and smart, and its always exciting to see your comic book heroes come to life (Banshee, Azazel, Emma...).The sets and costumes of the film were fantastic, its great to see everything in a different time period and see how it evolves later on. On top of that the story was solid and very creative, it added more depth to the story and made our history of that period seem more realistic.With that a great story+fantastic acting+and great sets= a fantastic, near perfect movie. All you marvel fans rejoice this one is a keeper.",9,2,5,3 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," A Stunning Ending to A Beautiful Trilogy
","All true Batman fans had to have loved this trilogy. It was true to the comics, realistic, and pulled us in from the very beginning. I know most final films are spectacular, but I honestly didn't think this film would compare to the Dark Knight. I was wrong,and have never been so happy at having been proved wrong.First and foremost, the acting was sublime; everyone gave a brilliant performance, even the smaller played actors. Simply amazing.Costumes and sets, phenomenal. Music, perfectBut my hat goes off to Christopher Nolan for not only directing a masterpiece, but for writing it and bringing it to life.Watch this movie, you won't regret it, it truly is stunning. 10 out of 10; the best movie of the year.",10,5,11,23 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The End of 10 Years of Pure Magic.
","To begin, it was needed that the book be split into two movies, one movie would have been too long, and would have ruined the essence of the book. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part two is what it should be, an epic finale of amazing graphics, locations, acting, and above all truth of the book molded into pure cinematic bliss.Like most books turned into movies the text is not exactly molded to film word to word; as in the case of the film certain pieces of the book were missing, but what was put on film was still well done and understood by the readers.The Good: -The pace of the movie was explosive but easy to keep up with.-The Graphics, absolute perfection! -The story -The acting, simply amazing tears were shed by all Potter fans -The movie itself was good, but to be clear it was true brilliance.The Bad: -While the movie was still great without certain parts of the book, it would have been nice to see the finale truly converted straight from the book.-the series ended! (but thats a personal problem :) The good out weigh the bad by a lot, but any true Potter fan would love this series despite the little faults presented. Go watch it, and when it comes out to own, go buy it, and once you've done that treasure it, because this movie is pure gold, and the series is pure magic.",Null,2,3,16 July 2011
