The Expendables 2," Old school action
","There has been a lack of simple gut-to-the-ground action movies over the last several years. CGI has reigned supreme, which isn't a bad thing. However Ex2 brings action back to its roots; big explosions, heavy fight scenes, and much loved comedic violence. The plot is simple and forced by some of the legendary talent, but it propels the movie through its storyline.I watched everyone in this movie while growing up. and when I think of movies that remind me of being a teenager, the stars of this movie are at the top of the list. E2 is one of those movies that, 10yrs from now, you can put in after the bar, and people will still watch it. That's my 2 pennies on it",8,2,4,22 August 2012
