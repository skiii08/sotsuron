Moneyball," Brilliant acting and insight into sports management.
","Based on a book with same name written by Michael Lewis about the 2002 Baseball season of the Oakland Athletics, and their General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt). The film also stars Jonah Hill among some other names, such as Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill put on fantastic performances in this film and are both deserved of their Academy Awards nominations. To accentuate the quality of the acting the film is very well directed and there is a fantastic script from Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian. I think the film is very well edited and interspersed with some real life footage and flashback stuff to fill in gaps with the story. There are also some fantastic and interesting dialogue sequences. The film seems to offer an interesting insight into the sport of baseball and the management of sports teams. Especially the actual financial and logistical management as opposed to player management. This is another film that manages to get the audience (well, me at least) behind the team and the competitors in the sport. We definitely feel the adrenaline of the player victories. I enjoyed the performances and character interactions most in this film.",9,4,5,26 May 2019
