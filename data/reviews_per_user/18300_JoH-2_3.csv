The Rock," Too brainless to keep interest
","Well, this is kind of a Armageddon/Independence Day clone... In other words: more nerve-racking than exciting!The holes in the plot are numerous (forbidden to use your brain)and the many,many (not so many as Armageddon, though) sins against plausibility kill all involvement. Is THAT how a 60-year old man behaves/jumps/runs/jokes after 30 years in prison? Is THAT how the muting soldiers will get their money after all?  I also got sick from the ridiculous scenes of stupid patriotism, and the total clich√© at the end.I really don't have anything against good action movies, but at least they have to stay honest with themselves. That is: if you're an action movie, then ACT like an action movie, without complexes or pretentions. Not so with The Rock! It pretends to be more intelligent than typical action movies. They try to make the Bad Guy Good(trying to avoid one-dimensional characters?). The injected humour (trying to put things into perspective?) seems totally out of place at times, which makes it difficult to care about what's going on.This one doesn't even reach the ankles of Die Hard....",Null,0,1,9 October 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," I really don't know what to write here. Eh.. it's great to watch :-)
","It was very interesting to go through some of the reviews here, and a few dedicated websites. You can say a lot about this movie, but NOT that it leaves people indifferent! We get the whole spectrum: people who didn't get it at all and didn't even LOOK for profound meanings. People who desperately try to read anything in it, looking for a way to agree that it is a work of exceptional art. People who consider themselves 'smarter than smart' by pointing out that it is all nonsense, that '2001' just relies on pseudo-intellectuals hyping a self-assigned 'profoundness'. People who THINK they 'got it', but only expose their limited intellectual capacities... Creationists, post-modernists and agnostics all finding something to their liking.   :-)And now it is my turn and I have to disappoint you: I do NOT have the definitive answer  :-)   What I DO know is that this movie wandered around in my head for quite a while! Some of its images,atmosphere and sounds are simply *unforgettable*. As someone else said: even if you were clueless, it still was a wonderful *experience* that made you feel out-of-this-world for a few hours. I have no problem admitting that figuring it all out was way over my head. Yeah, a few ideas about 'man vs machine', the 'birth of civilisation', the 'next step of humankind', entered my mind. But the Big Picture? I felt rather stupid when reading all the brilliant and profound interpretations by people with 5 degrees in philosophy <G>But it was worth it. I felt the emptyness, indifferent silence and immeasurable volume of space like never before. I sincerely questioned whether HAL was _killed_ or simply _shut_down_. I felt a chill down my spine when hearing the disturbing choir-music everytime a monolith was discovered. I got a feel for how absolutely BORING real-life spacetravel is destined to be, opposed to the typical Hollywood depiction. I learned to re-appreciate the authenticity of pre-CGI special effects. And all this from an old VHS copy on my ordinary TV set. I'd pay to see it again on the big screen, I tell you!",Null,0,2,27 December 2000
Contact," Plausible science fiction, not to be missed
","(CONTAINS SOME MINOR SPOILERS)Since I have been interested in the subject of 'Contact' for a fairly long time (with the necessary scepticism) , it did not really open up new vistas to me like it seemed to open up to many of the reviewers here. However I thoroughly enjoyed 'Contact' because of its plausibility. While most of the 'action' might seem rather un-exciting when compared to beasts like 'Independance Day' or 'Men in Black', it happens to be infinitely more powerful! Much like a piece of classical music often contains more intensity than some heavy-metal song that entirely depends on loud guitars. Apart from a few small details (only noticed by a select public of rocket scientists), the search for and discovery of the extraterrestrial signals happens just like it would in end-of-20th-century reality.That's what nailed me to my seat: I felt it extremely easy to identify with Jodie Foster. In fact I was completely absorbed. It's difficult to describe the excitement that I felt when the first signal is detected, or during the scary 2001-ish spacetime trip. When she ended up on that beautiful beach with the super-viscose atmosphere (what a GREAT alien-ating effect!!), I had completely Left The Building. Almost saw Elvis at that point :-)I agree that the actual meeting with the Aliens is susceptible to criticism, just like the ending. But I challenge anyone to come up with better alternatives! At least the 'lack of proof' bit was thought-provoking. Which is proven by the fact that both religious and atheistic people interprete it as an argument in favour of their personal conviction. Can we seriously expect a movie to change people's outlook on life? I think we can be thankful if, after viewing 'Contact', a few people raised their eyes to the nightly skies and wondered...",10,0,1,11 December 1999
