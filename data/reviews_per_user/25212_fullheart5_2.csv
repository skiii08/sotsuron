3:10 to Yuma," Absolutely Must Dee
","This is a must see movie. With all the garbage out there, this is by far one of the better films being turned out. I sat mesmerized through out the whole film and having always been a fan of Christian Bale since Empire of the Sun and Russell Crowe for a long time as well, it was wonderful to have them both in the same film. The actors involved were what drew me to this film, but the storyline has such redeeming value, that you can't help but find this to be a film that should be well recommended. I would say for me that it gives me hope. In many movies there are these moments that if you were watching on DVD you would fast forward through, in this epic there aren't any. Enjoyable and well put together.Go see, you will not be throwing your money away for a change.",10,4,10,7 September 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Not acceptable
","Well, after looking forward to this movie and waiting until it has been out a few days, we finally went to see it. Well, my advise, don't. It felt like we had just seen another trailer. I sincerely believe that you can't help being disappointed. It was like peeking through a window and seeing only small pieces of everything going on, never really getting the whole picture. Every step of the way we kept hoping it would get better. Sure, it worked as an outline, but that was about it. This time they failed to capture the drama of the book. It ultimately felt like all the wonderful actors who were hired to play the beloved characters were making cameo appearances. No, I hope that if this was the directors fault, they don't hire him again. Bring the other guy back.",4,0,0,14 July 2007
