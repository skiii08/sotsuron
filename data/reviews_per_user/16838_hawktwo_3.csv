The Blair Witch Project," You'll never camp in the woods after seeing this.
","This movie is worth seeing.  It is a very professional movie and one would never guess that it had such a tiny budget.  The acting was outstanding.  I enjoyed seeing a movie which I had to buy tickets for 10 days  in advance. I watched the Sci-Fi documentary associated with the movie which added to the atmosphere.  I simply wasn't scared, but sitting in a packed movie theatre (where 15 minutes before showtime there were only 2 seats left), I was clearly in the minority.  There were people for whom this was the 3rd and 4th viewing.  I found the movie intriguing rather than scary.",Null,0,0,4 August 1999
American History X," A Good Movie that was almost great
","Edward Norton deservedly received tons of praise for his performance in this movie.  Edward Furlong seems to spend the entire movie looking meaningfully at what's going on around him. I found parts of the plot a bit unbelievable.  Specifically, Edward Norton was redeemed by a friendly black laundry worker who was able to amuse with comic routines.  This black laundry worker appeared to have no knowledge of Edward Norton's vicious crimes, yet was able to hold back an entire prison group from murdering Edward. I usually like Stacy Keach but found his role depicted him as a buffoon. His character was highly intelligent with great organizational skills -- why was it hidden? Beverly D'Angelo gave a wonderful performance as the mother.  She is an actress with a wide range and q;uite believably pulls off her role as the mother (and widow) of a family who racially hates.",4,2,4,20 February 2000
The Deer Hunter," Thought that Streep and DeNiro were too old to be playing teenagers
","I married a vietnam vet, worked in the MIA and POW navy offices, and my father was a steelmill worker near Pittsburgh.  I stood in line 3 times to see this movie because it was so sold out.  However, as the movie started, I thought Meryl Streep was married to the an abusive husband; he just turned out to be a slap-happy father.  She was not a believable teen; neither was DeNiro or Cazale.  Having worked with POWs, none of them ever heard of the russian roulette, but the prison scenes did ring true with rats and all. The scenes in the VA hospital rang true.  I think the movie did a great job of showing the contrast between an idealistic teenager becoming a horrified maimed vet.",Null,0,0,17 August 2000
