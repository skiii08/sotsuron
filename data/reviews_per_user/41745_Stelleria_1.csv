Black Swan," 1/10
","It's a movie that makes you think and use your whole brain trying to keep up with what is happening through out the movie. I didn't get it anyways, but if you're smart you probably will get it better than i. The movie contains a lot of dancing and ballet is always beautiful to look at, especially when they have perfect clothes and makeup. so you should definitely see it at least once in your life. The beautiful and talented Nathalie Portman is starring this movie and she is excellent. To think of the hours of practice she must have done is amazing. Low scores from me only because i didn't understand the movie. 1/10 points from me, 0 was not an option.",1,4,9,12 November 2013
