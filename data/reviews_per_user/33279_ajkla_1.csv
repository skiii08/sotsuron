Requiem for a Dream," Unbelievable and near unbearable.
","To the people commenting on things that happen in the movie that wouldn't be possible currently: The book was written in the late 60s and is thus set then.It's difficult for me to find the words to describe this film... Requiem For A Dream is unbelievable. It tears your heart into pieces and leaves you emotionally shattered. It is without a doubt not for the weak at heart. Or those out there that don't understand the meaning of the word empathy. If you want a feel good, happy-go-lucky movie, it's not for you.I want to call this my favorite movie, but that seems to cheapen it. It's beyond labels. This movie is so much more effective than any anti-drug movie I have ever seen (which it manages to do without becoming preachy). I was left speechless afterward.I convinced my friend to watch it with me and for the next ten minutes, we sat in complete silence staring at the credits roll.I would call it a must see but honestly, I don't think the majority of people in the world could handle this movie.",10,1,2,19 February 2007
