The Rock," The Unsung Villains Steal the Show
","This movie is definitely for action junkies. If you enjoy disecting a movie looking for silly dialogue, plot holes, or looking for inner-meaning in a movie, you might want to skip The Rock. This movie is 2 hours, 15 minutes, but the action is almost nonstop and the movie moves briskly. It's typical Jerry Bruckheimer fare, including plenty of action, an implausible storyline, and big stars doing a fine job of acting.Some Bruckheimer characteristic events were obvious, such as the scene immediately after the car chase where Cage stands, and the camera rotates around him. This is reminescent of a similar scene in Bad Boys, another Bruckheimer film, where Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are standing in a similar pose with the same rotating camera view. Also present was the presidential address and accompanying slow-motion dramatic scenes near the end, ala Armageddon. I'm not saying it's bad for Bruckheimer to reuse his old ideas, just that if I was able to spot them, other people probably did as well.Some of the dialogue was way over the top, and tended to get a bit macho and silly. When Mason tells Lomax, '...you're between the Rock and a hard case', I felt like groaning. There was plenty of self-referential comments, such as this one where Mason refers to himself as a 'hard case'. There were also other comments where the characters would try to 'build up' the other characters, such as when Lomax says, 'You don't know Mason.' I hate it when movies do this. They try to make you believe how tough a character is by other characters talking about him. I would prefer to SEE how tough he is by his actions, rather than be told about it constantly using dialogue. Several parts of the movie, such as the stalemate in the shower, seemed melodramatic and reheased. I couldn't imagine Michael Biehn, in real life, giving the 'We spilt the same blood in the same mud' speech to a general that's holding a gun on him, but that's just my opinion.Cage plays the geek very well, with some very humorous scenes. The scene near the beginning where he's difusing the bomb, and finding the Playboy mags and gas mask, and his assistant screaming about the long needle, was darkly hilarious. I love that sort of humor. There were lots of very good scripting, such as the dialogue between Cage and Connery about the difference between winners and losers, and Cage's 'Actually, I'm a chemical SUPER-freak' response was a great one-liner.I did feel like there some were plot holes, or at least some weird occurances. For example, when Cage calls his girlfriend and tells her not to come to San Francisco, she yells back into the phone, 'Like hell I won't!' and hangs up. Why would she do that? Wouldn't she more likely ask something like, 'Why not?' Or at the very least, maybe start accusing him of being with another woman? Of course, this was the perfect vehicle for her to come to San Francisco against his wishes and have to be rescued. It didn't make sense, but it made the story move along. Also, she runs away from the FBI agent when he comes to pick up her. Why? Because the FBI agent refused to answer her questions about where her boyfriend (Cage) is. Why would she run away? I would assume the FBI agent is there to take me to safety or to her boyfriend. But again, by running away this furthers the plot--now she's in danger and Cage can agonize about her fate, and thus he has motivation to disarm the poison rockets. If she had stayed and allowed the FBI to whisk her to safety, he would not have been motivated to save the city. He'd already been shown to be a bit of a coward in the scene where he's throwing up out of nervousness. Of course, in other scenes he's terribly heroic. His character was a bit inconsistent, but you could explain it as him being thrust into the situation and once there, exceeding his prior limits.The incinerator was another weird plot device. It looked a bit unrealistic. It was obviously something dreamed up for an action movie, with moving cogs (wheels) that would turn and have to be dodged by the hero, all the while fire is rushing through the same area. I've seen an incinerator, and it didn't resemble this monstrosity at all. I have no idea if the motion sensor that detected the marines arrival was accurate and if the military really has something this sophisticated, but I thought it was an ingenius idea.You may feel differently, but I actually enjoyed the villains of the story more than the heroes. Most of the lines that struck me as powerful were delivered by the noble villains, Harris and Morse. I found the combination of Ed Harris, David Morris, and Michael Biehn (admittedly not a villain in this movie) a powerful combination. I consider all these actors excellent, and the stalemate in the shower room was especially powerful, as well as the standoff with the villains near the end. These scenes didn't feature Connery or Cage, or the occasional humorous tension breaker. These scenes showed us that all villains are not the same, and that some villains are evil, and some just misguided. This degree of gray, in an otherwise black and white character movie, added a level of complexity to the film. Thus, a film that I would have otherwise said was 'okay' became a really good action movie with some characters that I actually cared about.There was lots of violence and profanity, and a brief sexual situation (although no nudity) near the beginning. Despite my problems with some of the dialogue and plot, I found this movie enjoyable and engaging. If you don't mind overly macho acting and some silliness in the dialogue, and you love action, then you'll probably love this movie. If seeing serious characterization and motivation if more your style, you might want to check out Steel Magnolias and leave The Rock at the video store.",7,67,104,25 December 2000
The Rock," A Dream Cast, but still just a decent movie :(
","This was a knock-em dead cast:  Sean Connery, David Morse, Nicholas Cage, Michael Bien, and Ed Harris.  This was some incredible acting, but I'm biased as David Morse and Ed Harris are two of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, the movie is mostly a slug-fest, with Cage throwing out lots of lame-o humor in his disguise as a chemical nerd working for the FBI. Sean Connery got the biggest part of the glory in the movie, as he usually does, and I'm left yet again wondering why everyone is so crazy about this guy.  A few good scenes and some great acting elevate this less than intelligent action flick to a 7.",7,3,4,24 January 2000
The Blair Witch Project," The weirdest friggin' movie I've ever seen...
","... and I've seen a lot of movies.  I, probably like many others out there, fell for the idea that this 'documentary' was for real, and was creeped out to the max.  After reading stuff all over the web, I've come to the conclusion it's fake... 'just' a movie.   It's all very realistic and scary stuff... I was just about to pack up and spend a weekend at Burkettsville hiking and looking for clues to the disappearances (carrying a gun, of course).  In any event, it's a very realistic movie, if a little weird.  It doesn't live up to the hype of being the scariest movie I've ever seen, or is even close, but it's cool to creep you out on a Saturday afternoon.  Enjoy!",6,1,3,15 August 1999
The Longest Yard," This movie is crap
","I really hate to say that, because I wanted to like the movie. I just couldn't. It was the same old tired gags that guys like Chris Rock and Adam Sandler have been peddling for years. Sandler had a chance to make a serious motion picture with some real drama, and he blew it. There were various changes made from the original movie, from specific lines to entire scenes, and I honestly can't think of one that was an improvement. All the times where Crewe was a tough, underspoken character that really shined, well... he just became a smartmouth in the new movie. They also 'sanitized' a couple of scenes that really bothered me...**SPOILER ALERT** Crewe no longer slaps the girlfriend at the beginning, but now locks her in a closet. Not a big change, and at the time I didn't think much about it, but later on when it's revealed that he actually did shave points for money, the new movie subtly changes it so that a reason is given, and he says that his life was in danger if he didn't do it. I guess Sandler wasn't happy with Crewe having real, human flaws like the rest of us, and needed to justify Crewe's actions. I liked the original better, where Crewe just made a mistake and felt regret for doing it. It somehow felt more real to me.**END OF SPOILERS** They basically turned a great movie into a movie with nothing but cheap gags. It was very disappointing.",4,16,30,28 May 2005
Unbreakable," A Unique Comic Book Genre Movie
","Unbreakable is a difficult movie to review without revealing the plot, and trust me, if you've not seen it you don't want the plot revealed. The plot being a surprise is the key to enjoying this movie. Knowing this, I will not reveal elements to the plot. I hope you rate me with this in mind.This story involves two men, Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis. They are opposites. Jackson plays Elijah, whose bones are brittle and even a small fall can cause fractures and breaks. As a child, he lives in fear of going outside. As an adult, he knows there is someone out there who is his opposite in every way. Willis plays David Dunn, a man who has survived one accident and tragedy after another. A man, to Elijah, who appears unbreakable. That's all you should know going into the movie. I'd strongly advise against reading details about the plot.Unbreakable is getting split reviews. Most people either love it or hate it. This makes perfect sense because of the nature of the movie. If you're a heavy-duty comic book fan, you will probably love this movie. If you care nothing about comics, you could go either way, but I am willing to bet you will consider it a bit boring at times (maybe the whole time). I think this movie relies somewhat on you being in on the 'in joke' of comic book super-heroes. For example, Willis' character David Dunn--his initials are 'DD'. Double initials are a common trait that many older comic book characters exhibit. A few other examples are Matt Murdock (Daredevil), Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Peter Parker (Spider-Man), and Bruce Banner (The Hulk). Sure, everyone will get the gist of the movie, but comic book fans will get the most out of it.The buildup is a bit like Sixth Sense, and even more so because Bruce Willis stars in both movies. Even if you didn't know the same guy (M. Night Shyamalan) directed both movies, you could probably see a lot of similarity in the style. The same slow, intentional buildup with the same mind-bending twist at the end. Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance as a drug dealer in the stadium. Watch for him if you haven't seen the movie yet.Don't let yourself get distracted during this movie. We brought our 2 year old with us, and it was a mistake. This is the type of movie you need to settle in for, relax, and take in every word. Try to figure out what's going on. If you miss important pieces of the dialog, you're doing yourself an injustice.It's a comic book movie, but unlike anything we've seen so far. Whereas X-Men smashes the genre in your face, Unbreakable taps you lightly on the shoulder and quietly says, 'I'm a super-hero movie.' It's not obvious until the end, and depending on the viewer, sometimes not even then.From a comic book lover point of view, I'd rate it 4 out of 5 stars. From a non-comic reader viewpoint, I'd give it 3 or 4. Overall, I'm calling it a 4-star movie because I enjoyed it tremendously.",8,0,1,16 December 2000
Happy Gilmore," Sandler gets a birdy
","Whoa!  Sandler made a funny movie!  This makes two for him.  Wish he could be more consistent.  Anyway, this was a great movie.",8,1,2,8 December 1998
Spice World," YAAARRRGGHHH! THE PAIN!
","My God, this is a Truly Horrid Movie.  All this movie has going for it is some good looking girls (and the music, if you like their music, which I don't).  The acting is horrible, the plot is infantile (at best), and the dialog is stupid.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.An interesting side-note... almost everyone either voted 1 or 10.  I suspect the people that voted 10 will mature in a few years and block out this embarrassing portion of their childhood.",1,24,44,8 December 1998
Blade," What a surprise... this movie Rocked!
","Marvel Comics finally did good.  This movie was action packed from start to finish, with astounding action sequences throughout.  Some complain that it's way too macho, however.  Myself, that's the way I like my movies.Way to go, Wesley!",8,0,1,8 December 1998
X-Men," Wow, GREAT, GREAT, GREAT flick! Gonna go again!
","Comic movies tend to suck, or at least be a little embarrassing for us normal, well-adjusted comic readers.  It's painfully true.  Amazingly, X-Men was great!  It was easily the best comic adaptation to date.  Even the reviews are better than average, and as of today (7/16/00) imdb score is an 8.3, which is very respectable.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like people are turning out for the movie like I expected.  It had a few flaws, such as rushing into the movie, and a couple of hokey lines (not many, though).  The humor was cute, and the interplay between the characters was essential to having a decent story.  The few 15-20 minutes were absolutely incredible (my favorite part), as it explored the characters as human beings, rather than super-heroes.  There was lots of action as well, so we didn't get bored.  My biggest problem (and I can overlook it) was that some of the characters (I'm mostly bothered by Mystique) weren't true to the comics.  I mean, Mystique fought Wolverine to a standstill using incredible martial arts... no way would this have happened in the comics.  Of course, Wolverine was trying to kill everyone, so that was pretty cool. :)This comic movie even stands up to 'normal' movies.  It was really great.  I was split between giving it a 9 or a 10, but I ended up giving it a 10.  If you're a comic fan, you'll really enjoy.  If not, it's still great.",9,0,0,16 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," B.I.Z.A.R.R.E.: There's no better description than this.
","If you loved Braveheart, Lethal Weapon, There's Something About Mary, Office Space, or Die Hard, then this movie is probably not for you.  I don't care what most of the voters think--this movie is far out, and best watched when you're drunk or high.  A few good one-liners and an original concept is mostly all I found enjoyable about this flick.  I could never figure out whether it's a comedy, a dark comedy, or just dark.  I gave it 4 of 10.",4,0,0,13 May 2000
Pearl Harbor," Disgusting
","This movie goes beyond disappointing, and is downright disgusting.  A friend of mine who was a history major laughed all the way through it.  It tried to show the Japanese as the 'honorable enemy' who regretted their attack, but thought it was necessary.  Ha!  The movie did not show all the motivation behind everything.  We showed that the US intended to block oil shipments, but not why.  We did it because Japan had invaded China (which was apparent at the end of the movie, but the link wasn't made clear).  Does anyone really think the Japanese didn't want this attack?  If they wanted a fight, why not call us out and face us down?  It was a low-life dirty attack, and the writer should be fined for presenting such a ridiculously 'politically correct' joke such as this.Oh, but the hour-long massacre of men, women, and children had great special effects.",6,0,1,4 June 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Zzzzzz...
","I can't believe some guy thought this movie 'rocked the world'.  All it did was rock me to sleep.  This flick wasn't nearly as well-acted or interesting as Mission Impossible 1.  The only saving grace was that we were thankfully not subjected to John Woo's (in)famous slow motion scenes continuously throughout the movie at inappropriate times.  There were a few, but they weren't too distracting.  Cruise wasn't his usually best, but he did an adequate job.  At times I found myself talking to my girlfriend... the movie was just not interesting between the lulls in action.  Don't expect any surprises, like part 1 had.  This movie is a straightforward slug-fest.  I give it a 6/10 (5 being an average flick).",6,0,0,27 May 2000
2001: A Space Odyssey," Vast Confusion, Murky Storyline... Pretentious and Weird...
","Now I love a high-minded film as much as anyone, but 2001 didn't grab me like it did zillions of others.  In fact, it's confusing and unclear, and expects the watcher to make huge leaps in mind-reading.  I had no idea what the ending was about (even though I've seen the movie 3 times) until another review summed it up.  And I still think it's weird.  If you're looking for intelligent sci-fi, I'd suggest Contact.I hope I don't get lynched by the 2001 fans out there.  Sorry, guys, but I think I speak for a *lot* of people.",5,7,13,20 December 1998
The Waterboy," Adam should have stuck to golfing... :(
","Geez, Adam Sandler can be really funny, but when he bombs, he really bombs. Waterboy wasn't funny at all, whereas Happy Gilmore was hilarious.  Too bad. Adam better get his act in gear, because after The Wedding Singer (ugh) I had hoped to see him return to good form.  Maybe next time...",3,3,5,1 December 1998
Tarzan," 'Animal Man packs a Wallop'... Tarzan ROCKS.
","You know, I'm 30 years old and have been a movie fan since I was about 22 or 23.  I've watched so many movies almost every one is predictable and, most of the time, boring.  Watching the beautiful animation in this latest incarnation of Tarzan was just stunning--no joke.  The story was reminescent of The Lion King, and my favorite scene (many animation fans will know which scene I'm talking about) looks a lot like Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, but similarities aside, Disney has made another timeless masterpiece.  Who needs Anime?  I watch that stuff that so many people like, and I can't understand the stories, the motivations, or feel sympathy for the characters.  Anime.  Who needs it when we've got Disney.I could only be happier if they finally made a serious animated movie.  Take out all the singing and dancing, and put in a tough, realistic story. Otherwise, it's still easily an 8 out of 10 or better.Congratulations, Disney.  Best one since The Lion King.",8,1,2,8 February 2000
Fantastic Four," Another lost opportunity....
","Okay, I saw this movie tonight and it was fairly enjoyable, but nowhere near great. (I'd like to give it a 6.5/10, but since we have to choose whole numbers, I went ahead and gave it a 7.) Marvel is blowing it big time. With every mediocre movie, they are further 'expending' their most valuable characters. They've now used up X-Men, the Hulk, Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Elektra, the Punisher, Man-Thing, Spider-Man, and more to come, like Ghost Rider. With the exceptions of X-Men and Spider-Man, the movies ranged from absolutely terrible (Man-Thing) to various shades of okay/decent (Punisher, Hulk, Daredevil, Elektra). Avi Arad of Marvel just doesn't seem to be getting it--once these characters are used, they're done for at least several years! Not every mediocre comic book movie gets revitalized like the Batman franchise. More likely, they'll fade away and be forgotten, and the more often it happens, the less Hollywood will want to create comic book movies. Marvel should know this! So why are they letting mediocre and little known directors/talent work on their their flagship characters? Where is Stone, Cameron, Howard, Spielberg, Singer (okay, he did do two X-Men movies) and the other A-list talent that should be spearheading the biggest comic book movies? And why the heck would Marvel put a great brand like Fantastic Four in the hands of a guy that did 'Barbershop' and not much else? Sadly, I just don't get it.So from all that, I'm sure you can tell I wasn't overly impressed. It was an okay action flick and decent special effects. The acting seemed wooden at times, and some scenes were either edited heavily or just didn't make much sense. The actors gave it a valiant try, but at least two of them weren't even close to up to snuff. The writing was cheesy and not nearly serious enough for the epic this movie should have been. And of course, we had the obligatory change of events from the comic to the screen. You know what I mean--when the Hollywood writer/director decides that the comic story was 'silly' and adds his own ideas into the character's origin, thus alienating many comic readers by ignoring comic book cannon. This doesn't bother me IF the change is really necessary or adds to the story, but too often it's an arbitrary change (i.e. changing the Hulk's name from 'David' to 'Bruce' in the TV show) that really adds nothing to the story. Also, a few cheesy lines are fine, but this movie went overboard. My personal (un)favorite for 'Absolute Worst Line in this Movie(tm)' was the Johnny Storm one-liner: 'You're Hot', 'Why thank you--so are you!' Ugh. How lame.I do admit that Chris Evans, who I wasn't familiar with until now, did an excellent job as the Human Torch, but it wasn't enough to turn this movie around.If I had to briefly describe the movie's faults, I'd say it's a combination of mediocre acting and mediocre writing/directing. Avi, please start demanding top talent for your movies. I promise you it will pay off!",7,0,2,9 July 2005
Braveheart," The Best Movie I've Ever Seen
","This movie was really, really incredible.  I have no idea if the story of William Wallace is truthful, but it makes a helluva good movie.  The cinematography is wonderful... I loved the slow motion scenes (It's nothing like John Woo's 'slow-mo at weird times' scenes).  There are a few scenes that will actually make you want to weep, and I'm really not that kind of guy.  The scene where the young girl gives William a thistle is very, very moving.  Only one piece of dialogue I didn't like... the 'every man lives' bit is an old cliche.  Other than that, the movie was incredible.  I gave it a rare score... a perfect 10.",10,3,6,20 December 1998
