Requiem for a Dream," feels like getting hit hard your head
","-----spoilers----- I had been hearing about this movie from my friends for a long time ...Yesterday i finally saw it and WOW it really made an impact!!The movie starts out like a normal drug movie with happy start.But as it moves on from summer,fall and finally to winter.....it gets really ugly. Darren Aronofsky has done an amazing job in directing the final climax sequence packed with EPIC music by clint mansell. Ellen Burstyn,Jared Leto,Jennifer Connelly,Marlon Wayans do more than justice to their roles.Felt sorry for the old lady ....she just wanted to be on television!! Watch this movie if you like watching movies that impact you....",9,0,0,7 July 2011
Taxi Driver," Hugely disappointed.....
","I honestly don't know what to say. I think I was expecting too much from this movie. Some say this is a phycological thriller, perhaps physcological , definitely not a thriller. This movie just doesn't fit this genre. I saw one of the IMDb posts where people were saying that ,if u were lonely then u would understand this movie.But come on !! Travis could have had lots of friends if he wanted to,the guy just doesn't talk to any of his taxi colleagues. I felt like i watched 'drive' again with less plot and gore.But you can watch this for Mr.Nero's awesome performance.More than him watchout for the young budding Jodie Foster's Oscar nomination worthy performance and the b-e-a-u-tiful cybill... My final words , this thing is seriously overrated.",6,0,3,31 January 2012
