3:10 to Yuma," Dumbest posse in the west
","(minor spoiler ahead) Resurrect Howard Hawks before Hollywood completely destroys the western. Wade is the baddest outlaw around, we are led to believe, but the posse treats him like a juvenile who got caught stealing a stick of candy from the supply store. They cuff his hands out front and he kills one of the posse members the first night. No big deal, Wade is really Russell Crow, so they leave him cuffed the same way and he kills an other good guy...and this guy, we are led to believe, is a top notch bounty hunter. How did he survive this long? So now we have two dead in the first two days and they leave him cuffed out front. Throughout the remainder of the movie he is left to kill at will-which he does and he escapes but returns, after killing some dumb Indians. Besides the dumbest posse you have ever seen, we also have the dumbest and worst shooting outlaw gang in the west. How did they get this far? I could go on but it makes me sick to think about how bad this movie is. Go rent any old B-western and your time will be better spent.",3,1,5,22 March 2008
