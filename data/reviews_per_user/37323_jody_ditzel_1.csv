Hereditary," hyping this movie is disservice to Ari Aster
","This movie is being hyped for god knows what reason, but it does not deserve the praise it is getting. It is the most boring movie I have seen in my life, not a horror at all. Great series and movies are still made today, and this movie does not belong amongst them. Maybe Ari Aster will make a great movie in the future, but his chances for that to happen have diminisched by this hyping of his first movie, Hereditary. Also the cutting of this movie did a disservice to the actress who played the mother. Look for example at the mistakes in the cutting in the scene with the mother and the cult woman on the parking lot. Her facial expressions are not synchronized with the speech in that scene. Bad movie, cheaply made, no depth, hardly a plot, not scary at all. One star for effort.",1,5,11,8 July 2018
