The Hangover," The Best Comedy of 2009.
","This is an original comedy with the oldest characters of the last 20 years in comedy movies. The originality of this plot is in the way how the story is told and how each character has a role in it. The story is based on a stag party in Las Vegas: we have the fiancé, the crazy fiancée's brother, the best fiancé's friend and the fiancé's friend who is already marriage. OK, until here there is a lot of movies with the same premise, except by the way how the story will be told. That is the differential of this movie and what makes it so cleaver and funny.The story starts after a crazy night, which the spectators don't know what happened, all the characters wake up and realize the fiancé is missing and that no one have memories of the last nigh. How will they discover what happened is the key of your entertainment!Trust me, I'm sure you will laugh until the end of the movie, as I am sure this movie is destiny to be a classic in American comedy",9,1,2,8 February 2010
Zombieland," Refreshing for Zombie Comedy movies
","I just have finished to watch this movie and I must say that was a pleasant surprise! This movie has a cleaver plot and a good characters development, that is what make it so original. All the characters in the plot were very well played by the actors and the interaction between them was incredibly fun.Off course, it's a joke with the slash zombie movies and there's a lot of blood and action, but the great about this movie is in the creativity from the writers to develop the idea behind the apocalypse zombie survivors. That's why it deserves to be seen.",10,0,1,25 January 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," The problem of Hollywood
","Here, once more, is the perfect example of how Hollywood can destroyed a perfect movie with an improbably, but happy, ending.This movie rocks when try to approach the powers that the district attorney has in the USA and is very successful when make a good movie focusing in the search of a family father for revenge. The problem here is in the conclusion. After all movie development proving that the system is imperfect and very corrupt, in the ending, they focus in morality, in right or wrong.I'm very disappoint with the producers and directors who accept this ending without complaining. For this reason, I'm recommend, for the first time, no to watch this movie or accept to fell very angry in the ending.",5,5,8,15 March 2010
