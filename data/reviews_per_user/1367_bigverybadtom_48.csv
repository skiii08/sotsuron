Raiders of the Lost Ark," Escapist Entertainment That Makes No Pretense Otherwise
","This movie is a 1930's adventure, nothing more. It does not hold deep meaning, or fascinating characters, or moral lessons. It's like the epic adventures you see in the old Disney comics. It's what Spielberg made before he developed the desire to make 'meaningful' movies such as 'The Color Purple' or 'Schindler's List', with mixed success.So what is the story? Indiana Jones is shown trying to retrieve an idol in some remote forest peopled by savage natives, and fails. Then it shows him as a college professor teaching a class. Then he is hired to find the Ark Of The Covenant before Hitler does, and he travels to Nepal to find a woman who holds a medallion which holds the key to finding the Ark. Then she goes with him on a series of wild adventures.Basically the rest of the movie is a roller-coaster ride. There is little more realism than on the 'A-Team' TV show (an example is where Indy is dragged under a speeding truck and yet uninjured). Yet it is an entertaining ride, fast-paced and something you like seeing repeatedly, as I did.",10,0,1,21 July 2013
To Be or Not to Be," Starts Well But Fizzles Out
","The movie begins in Warsaw, Poland in 1939, in the days just before the invasion by Germany and the USSR (though the movie disregards the latter). Though the threat of war is in the air, a theater company's actors and staff spend their time worrying and arguing over theatrical roles and their status in the company. Also, a young bomber pilot has his eye upon an actor's wife (who is an actress herself), and tries to enter an affair with her.The invasion comes. Most of the company has fled Poland, including the pilot, who has joined the Polish exile forces in Britain. However, the actor and his actress wife remain. A professor is sent from Britain to Poland to help the resistance there...but he becomes suspected as a double agent, and the pilot is sent to Poland to stop the professor's intended treachery. He warns the actors who are still there, and they in turn impersonate various Gestapo members to try to foil the professor. Unfortunately for the pilot, the husband he tried to cuckold is upset with him, which complicates things.And unfortunately, it makes everything too complicated and confusing, and ruins the rest of the movie. Also not helping was the joke about 'Concentration Camp Gerhardt' which became irritating after being repeated a dozen times. Also, many scenes went on for far too long after they made their point. The movie is notable mainly for being a period piece; as a farce it dropped the ball.",4,4,12,11 August 2013
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Not Blasphemous, Just Insipid
","Except for the funny stoning scene toward the beginning, and the song at the end, everything else in the movie misfires. Yes, the idea is that another man (Brian) is mistaken for the Messiah-but the story's big flaw is that the real Messiah is already present, briefly shown giving a sermon to a crowd. On top of that, there is nothing about Brian that would convince anyone he was the Messiah; he doesn't even pretend to be one. This gives the whole movie a contrived atmosphere.The other scenes are hardly funny either. The Jews who plot against the Romans ask what the Roman occupiers have done for them, and as the scene goes on, the speaker amasses a list of benefits brought by the Romans. In a way, this glorifies colonialism and fails to explain why natives invariably come to despise their occupiers. There were plenty of reasons for the Jews to hate the Romans, but that is hardly brought up. Also, other jokes such as 'Biggus Dickus' and Pontius Pilate not being able to say the letter 'R' are juvenile without being funny.'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' was much better because it was clever; this movie perhaps tried to be meaningful and simply blew it.",3,7,39,23 May 2011
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Disappointing Adventure
","C. S. Lewis was the author of the Narnia story series, which was meant to be a 'Lord Of The Rings'-type scenario for children. Lewis himself wrote about religion and was a convert to Christianity later in life, but the Narnia series was not necessarily intended to be an allegory about Christianity, contrary to popular myth. Degrading death and rebirth of someone is obviously not exclusive to the Bible.I mention this because the novels (which I haven't read) and the movie are simply epic adventure stories. So how are they on their own merits? The establishing parts are good; siblings living in London during the Blitz are sent to safety in the countryside, and while playing they discover the title magical kingdom.Unfortunately the children don't really engage us, nor does anyone else, and the story is rather confusing. Worst of all is the ending, where the kids have grown into adults during their time there, but when they get back to their home, they are kids again. Huh? Special effects are okay, but that was about it. Go see Peter Jackson's 'Lord Of The Rings' instead.",2,2,3,13 August 2013
The Great Dictator," Chaplin's Only Good Talkie
","Not a great movie, nor of great historical importance, and obsolescent even as it was bring made (Hitler's full menace would not be realized until later), but still entertaining.The scenes with the silent comedy are still topnotch, such as the scenes where Hynkel plays with a globe like a medicine ball, the train having trouble stopping at the platform, and the beginning scene during World War One. But the movie isn't meant to be pure comedy; the stormtroopers are genuinely scary, and so is Hynkel even for the small conquests he made during that era. Even though there are contrived elements, such as the Jewish barber being hospitalized without contact with the world for twenty years and still having has barbershop available to him, and his being able to impersonate Hykel, even getting the right uniform, but the movie's message is still effective.Unfortunately Chaplin would find that his talkies would be nowhere near as good as his silents.",8,0,1,6 August 2011
The Hustler," The Movie Doesn't Exactly Hustle Along
","My mother, aunt and I watched much, but not all of the movie, which was supposed to be a classic. Why? Basically, once Paul Newman gives up his former career to take up pool hustling, the movie slows to a crawl. We watch very long scenes of pool playing, very long scenes of him and his girlfriend...and everything moves so slowly, I lost interest and dozed off.The concept was good, but it needed more than long pool-playing sequences. The scenes continued longer than they needed to, and we never learn much about the protagonist or what motivates him to want to be a big-time pool hustler. We see what he does, but never come to learn why he is doing it. Disappointing.",2,1,15,25 March 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Talky Boring Confusing Slow
","Another entry into the 'bring together a cast of major stars and still have a bad movie' category.This is a spy story set during the Cold War, dealing with a British intelligence agency that was shaken up after a botched operation in Hungary, with top agents being forced out. I wasn't expecting a James Bond movie full of cheesecake, fancy gadgets, or stunts, but I did expect more than a glacially-paced and confusing story involving mostly a bunch of men walking around and talking and shouting at each other. I bailed after a half hour; I couldn't make heads or tails of the story. Seeing the other reviews posted here I realize I hadn't missed anything.The only good part was the nice, big, and easy-to-read subtitles.",2,4,8,9 August 2014
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Some Good Parts, But Overlong And Erratic
","This is another period piece from the late 1960's where the outlaws are the heroes, and is loosely based on real people and events. The chemistry between Redford and Newman keeps the movie afloat (though they also star together in the much better movie 'The Sting'), and there are some funny scenes at the beginning. Examples: 'I'm stealing your woman!' 'You can have her!' and 'Rules? What rules-uggh!'But the movie's initial light, fun tone vanishes once Butch and Sundance are set upon by the hired trackers, and they discover just how much they man they stole money from disliked being robbed. Unfortunately, this initially tense chase sequence becomes slow and boring as it drags on, and the movie never recovers, even in the end when the outlaws have finally realized that they have entrapped themselves with no chance of escape.The actual story of the outlaws would be a great basis for a future movie.",4,4,8,31 December 2011
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Doesn't Live Up To The Hype
","Let me introduce this with the fact that I read about the making of this movie in the 'Chicago Tribune', and it mentioned that it was NOT originally intended to be a comedy. Fair warning?Well, it may have intended to be a dark comedy, but it had few laughs and the storyline wasn't very convincing. Why wouldn't anybody at the base have long since determined that General Ripper was crazy? And the British officer with him, unless he were utterly blind, should have been easily able to see through and overpower him. And it was very hard to believe that a nuclear bomber plane could be located, shot at, and damaged, but still be able to fly all the way to its target without further interference. (When Gary Powers' U-2 spy plane was detected by the Soviet air defense force in May 1960, they threw everything they had available at it until it was brought down.)A few laughs-'Don't fight, this is the War Room!' and such, but overall hardly a good movie.",2,13,36,30 April 2011
Elf," Enjoyable, But More For Adults Than Children
","I saw it last night at a Christmas party and found it enjoyable. But despite its Christmas theme, it was really intended to entertain adults rather than children.There was no profanity, graphic violence, and sexuality was limited to seeing the head and shoulders of a woman in the shower. But much of the humor would fly against most children's' heads. The basic story is about a human baby in an orphanage who crawled into Santa Claus's toy sack and ends up at the North Pole, being raised by an elf there. Buddy, as he is named, does not fit in as he is a giant compared to the elves, and Santa allows him to go to New York City to meet his biological father-who happens to be on Santa's naughty list for being too devoted to his career to pay attention to his family. Buddy meets his father, who disbelieves him at first, and he goes to the Gimbel's department store where he is mistaken as an employee and is put to work. Buddy inadvertently causes trouble there, and when he reunites with his father who finally discovers that Buddy was the son he never knew existed, he inadvertently brings trouble to his new family too.The movie is based on the 'fish out of water' trope, and Buddy is naive but not necessarily stupid. The ending is happy if predictable, and it works as adult Christmas entertainment. The actors work well in their respective parts too and Ed Asner makes a surprisingly effective Santa. Recommended, but really for the grown-ups.",7,2,2,13 December 2012
Lost in Translation," Tsumanne Eiga
","The movie has an opening shot of Scarlett Johanssen's buttocks-which proves to be prophetic.With Bill Murray, I was expecting this to be a comedy. But it is not-unless you count the scenes of Japanese people acting like crude stereotypes.Bill Murray plays a washed-up actor who goes to Japan to do a Japanese whiskey commercial, staying in an expensive hotel in the process. Scarlett plays the wife of a workaholic, also staying at the hotel while her husband is involved in his job, leaving her alone. Basically it's a pastiche of scenes of everyone talking, or lying around in their hotel rooms, or interacting with Japanese stereotypes, until the two meet in a bar. But then I stopped the movie-too many long,boring scenes of nothing happening. And from the negative comments here, I realized that there was no reward if I had watched to the end.My review title means, in Japanese, 'This movie is boring.' I wonder if any Japanese saw it, and if any of them liked it.",2,3,7,27 August 2016
Forrest Gump," Overlong, But It Works
","The book this movie was based on, which I haven't read, was more satirical in tone, which explains the basic concept of a simpleton managing to have such great influence on American politics and culture without being aware of it. His childhood leg problem inspires Elvis Presley, he unintentionally mocks Lyndon Johnson's showing off his surgery scar, he goes to Maoist China to play Ping-Pong, he unintentionally starts the 1970's jogging fad, etc. The book's story was purposely contrived; the movie plays everything straight.As for those who claim the movie glorifies stupidity, the phrase 'Stupid is as stupid does' has a more honest message, namely that stupidity isn't an inability to think but an unwillingness to. As for the movie's uncomplimentary view of the counterculture, there was plenty of bad as well as good about the 1960's-divisiveness, racial and other hatred, violence, the spread of venereal diseases, etc. But not only the left gets skewered. Remember the scene where the legless Dan described being told he could 'walk with Jesus'?The acting serves to make the movie work, just as Monty Python's comedy worked by everyone being able to play it all straight.",8,1,2,16 January 2012
Bridget Jones's Diary," Modernized 'Pride And Prejudice'
","Loosely based on the old novel, this is the story about Bridget Jones, a thirtysomething British woman who is mateless and unhappy with her life, and keeps said diary to try to improve herself. The story begins when Bridget is invited to her parent's home on Christmas Day, and is introduced to a wealthy man named Mr. Darcy whom she dislikes. Later at her workplace at a publishing house, she describes the colleagues she also dislikes, and her boss has his eye upon her, and he seems charming. But she finds that he and the other man have a dispute between them, and her own boss perhaps is not the nice person he seems to be. Then Bridget's own mother has her own midlife crisis and is unhappy with her family...An entertaining story, if a bit too full of bad language. There is sexuality, but the only very brief sex scene does provide the necessary shock value for the plot. Recommended, but for nobody younger than in their teens.",7,0,0,30 May 2018
10 Things I Hate About You," Done Before, And Far Better
","I remember the plot from a different movie I saw with the same story. Yes, based on 'Taming Of The Shrew', only in a modern high school. Once-popular older daughter who is totally unfriendly with anyone, younger daughter who wants to date but father says no, unless the other daughter will date (and the father is confident she won't), and of course one seemingly-nice boy has his eye on the younger daughter.The idea was done far better in the other movie (I unfortunately don't remember the title), but this has crassly exaggerated stereotypical side characters who have no relevance to the main story and who are supposed to be funny but aren't. I didn't finish this one; I don't recommend anyone to start it in the first place.",2,0,3,17 September 2018
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Could Have Been Good
","This movie is based on the true story of an US Air Force man transferred from Crete to Vietnam in 1965 to be the new DJ of the US Army radio station, and when he goes on the air for the first time, he refuses to follow the dull format of the previous DJ or play the dull music that had been played. In the movie, the new DJ is in fact encouraged by his fellow enlisted soldiers to play contemporary pop music from Motown and The Beach Boys and engage in rapid-fire comedy patter. Various military people all laugh at the new DJ's verbal antics, but as might be expected, the military higher-ups are not pleased with the new DJ's irreverent program.A good potential idea, but poorly utilized. Robin Williams' routine was reportedly ad-libbed, but his comedy routine failed to be funny. The soldiers are all shown laughing, but one gets the idea that they do so because that is what they were hired to do. Rapid-fire comedy and silly verbal antics can be hilarious, but Williams was simply dull and boring, as if he wasn't sure exactly what he was supposed to do. I didn't bother to finish the film; what I saw of it shouted that it was going to be standard and clichéd, and what good is it to watch a comedian who is not funny?I wonder what the real-life DJ was like. He certainly must have been funnier.",2,5,16,9 August 2015
The Shining," Confusing And Disappointing
","I haven't read the Stephen King novel, which was supposed to be much better. But it's easy to see why he would have objected to this movie production.For one thing, the caretaker is supposed to be a normal human being who slowly becomes mad as he stays at the hotel. But Jack Nicholson's character seems sinister from the beginning. Instead of slowly going mad, he seems to have been that way from the beginning with nobody else noticing. Yet the movie implies that the ghosts of past residents are for real, as one was able to physically free Jack from the pantry. Did they drive him mad, as they presumably did to the previous caretaker? And what would be their motive? Nothing is hinted at.Also, there are elements such as the child talking to his finger, a blood-filled elevator, and two ghostly twin girls who appear sporadically, none of which (according to other reviewers) appear in the novel. What purpose do they serve, since they don't advance the story in any way? The 'shining' is presumably how the boy telegraphs his sense of danger to the man in Florida, summoning him, but why he has it is never covered.",2,3,10,29 January 2012
Face_Off," Repetitive And Silly
","The premise is simple: at an advanced surgery clinic, a captured criminal is sedated and his face surgically removed, then surgically placed onto a policeman who intends to infiltrate the criminal's organization. But then, said criminal wakes up and figures out what had happened, and then manages to force the surgeons to place the policeman's face on him, then he escapes.Silly (and cliché'd) premise? Try the rest of the movie, which is as silly as any of the old silent Keystone Komedies-no exaggeration. The villain is skinny while the policeman is a fatso-yet we're supposed to believe only the faces were changed. Even the wife is fooled, until she is told to do a blood test on her supposed husband. Then she realizes. And even then, the story amounts to repeated episodes of the hero and villain meeting, then a big messy fight starts, then they separate, and soon meet again and repeats. I was not exaggerating in my comparison to the Keystone Komedies.",2,0,1,22 November 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," The Actual Story Would Have Been Better
","Like 'The French Connection', this movie is based on a book of real events, but the movie itself is a fictionalization. Also like 'The French Connection', a movie based on the actual story would have been so much better.I heard of the movie before, but finally rented it when I read the book 'The World's Worst Weapons' and it mentioned that the US military really has used the idea of psychic warfare to try to fight enemies. The movie did show a soldier staring at a goat and supposedly killing it, and how goats were used in real life to train surgeons to dress combat wounds.The movie does have some laughs; the general running into a wall, Cassady looking at a cloud while driving and using his mental powers to disperse a cloud-and crashing into a rock because he wasn't paying attention to his driving. But the storyline is mostly weird and confusing, and it would have been better if it has kept up with the suggestion (in the scene where the kidnappers had locked up the reporter and Cassady) that the psychic soldiers' 'powers' were really just the deception and trickery used in stage magic. Interesting to see once.",5,0,3,2 June 2013
Gandhi," Great First Half, Weak Second Half
","The first half of the movie made me develop an interest in Mohandas Gandhi and why he developed as he did. You see him young, wearing a turban but otherwise a regular suit and tie, and he encounters racism when he is thrown off a train for illegally being an a first class compartment when he is an Indian. Then he leads a struggle against racism in South Africa, winning some success before moving to India, which he says (in the movie) is a strange country to him. He would fight against British colonial rule of India, but then realizes that ending it might only lead to a government of Indians who would be just as bad-and then he adopts his famous white Indian clothing. After that, the movie falters, and we see less about Gandhi than the political events that follow, not delivered with great accuracy.Ben Kingsley delivers a perfect performance, looking and acting the part. But the image of Gandhi is completely idealized, and he never gets angry or otherwise seems like a real human being. Indeed, there were things about the historical Gandhi that would appall most people. But this is a movie to entertain, not teach.",6,2,3,6 February 2013
Ocean's Eleven," Shockingly Dull Heist Movie
","Danny Ocean is a criminal who plans the biggest heist of all-three casinos in Las Vegas which are connected to a single money vault, and all owned by one man. Ocean also has another intention-the man is married to Ocean's former wife, and Ocean wants her back. The usual elaborate preparations are made, Ocean preparing the heist for 'Fight Night', when he knows the vault will be at its fullest.The vault is gotten to by the criminals, but the casino owner is aware of this-and Ocean forces him to surrender half the money or have all of it destroyed by explosives. Of course the casino owner complies-even though he is supposed to be scary and powerful, and his losses would be covered by insurance. This adds an anticlimax to the heist.What else is wrong? Slow pace, overlong scenes, bad acting all around, and little tension like heist movies are supposed to have. I don't know about the original, but skip this snooze-fest.",2,1,4,19 July 2013
The Usual Suspects," The Movie That Negates Itself
","No exaggeration. As others have pointed out, once we get to the surprise ending, the reaction is...hey, what did we just see for the past two hours? I was at a youth hostel in Philadelphia years ago and they showed different movies in the evening including this one. I ended up watching it because at evening in Philadelphia, everything except nightclubs close up. Just as well I didn't pay for it, because while the movie was at first exciting, it then became too confusing and in the end, when we expect the 'cripple's' confession to tie everything together and reveal who Keyser Soze was, well...So we see things in the police office to suggest that the 'cripple' had been making up his whole story, that the 'cripple' really wasn't, and so on until we get the point that the past two hours were what really didn't happen. And we never find out what really is the truth after all. All this time spent on a false story? This wasn't a surprise ending, this was a gyp!",1,2,5,1 May 2012
Flashdance," Shockingly Weak
","For all the fame this movie got when it was released, when I saw it years later I found it quite lame. As I saw in the critical reviews at the time, the dancing and music were good while the plot was stupid. They were certainly right about the last part. The characters and storyline were hardly believable, especially all the inexplicable temper tantrums from Beals.Unfortunately the music and dancing weren't very good either, and the movie actually was pretty boring. How it got so hyped is one of the Great Unanswered Questions. Recommendation: give this movie a pass and see the far superior movie 'Footloose', from the same era but better in every respect.",2,2,5,4 May 2011
Liar Liar," Could The Movie Have Worked If It Weren't For Jim Carrey?
","My mother, my late aunt, and I picked up this movie because we thought it was going to be good. The concept might have worked, but the problem was that Jim Carrey spoiled everything by his extreme facial mugging. We compared him to Jerry Lewis, whom he was trying to imitate, but even Lewis never twisted his face around so much like Carrey kept doing in this movie. After a half hour, we got sick of it and unloaded the video.It's a high-concept idea, and perhaps could have worked if some other actor had done the job. If instead of twisting his face around to an extreme when he couldn't give a false answer to a question in a courtroom, the lawyer might have used a more subtle way of showing he couldn't talk, the movie might have had some laughs. But this movie had me choose to avoid any movies with Jim Carrey in it if possible. And that was the lesson I took from 'Liar Liar'.",1,4,12,23 March 2013
Good Will Hunting," An Overly Hidden Genius
","There is clearly a mix of glowing and scathing reviews here, so I might as well put my two cents in. So what do I think of it? The concept did not really ring true.The protagonist is an undiscovered genius who is able to figure out things that stump even the geniuses, such as a complicated mathematical problem, even though he works as a college janitor. He has a poor background and emotional problems from a bad childhood, plus a girl interested in him, yet instead of breaking out of his miserable existence he initially wants to stay in it...but is convinced to change his mind.So what went wrong? A genius might have a rough existence, but he acts like everybody else around him except for his magically solving complicated mathematical problems. Um, anyone who's so much smarter than his peers would show signs of it that nobody could ignore, such as being able to say and do things most others wouldn't think of. Why couldn't he have become, say, a professional gambler (degree not required)? Why would he cause trouble and not be able to charm his way out of it. Will Hunting is a genius and does not behave like a genius in real life would, no matter his background. That spoils the movie for me.",5,2,4,27 December 2019
Dog Day Afternoon," Excessive Length And Slowness Scuttle The Movie
","Based on a true story, several men rob a bank and take the employees hostage, but things go wrong right away when their getaway driver vanishes and the police arrive, and a standoff results. But as we later learn, this is no ordinary bank job; the leader of the robbers wanted the money to pay for a sex change operation for his gay paramour. Word spreads of this, and a crowd of homosexuals gathers in the area, rooting against the police and for the robbers.The movie was undoubtedly shocking in its day, and it goes for realism, with a lot of talking involving various people. But we ended up fast forwarding through much of the movie. Why? Because there was hardly any development once the scenario was established; we were waiting impatiently for the end, and all the talk was becoming boring. Even though the movie was intended to meant to show a realistic long standoff, it seemed to last longer than the actual standoff.",5,3,10,27 November 2012
Amadeus," F. Murray Abrahamson's Performance Carries The Movie
","Visually, the movie is pretty, and F. Murray Abrahamson's performance as Salieri is what keeps the movie going. However, the movie is overlong and the title character is depicted as a buffoon who can compose great works without even trying. Arguably it is natural for Hollywood to take artistic license and not try to be too realistic, but in this case they overdid it.For one thing, Mozart wasn't a magician who could create beautiful music without effort; indeed his music was the result of hard work. Also, the movie implies that Salieri might have murdered Mozart overnight while his wife and child were away; another reviewer had noted that Mozart died in the evening so that scenario is pure fiction. Salieri might have hated Mozart, but it is unlikely he had the opportunity or willingness to resort to murder.This could have been a better movie if they tried to be more realistic.",5,7,13,30 May 2011
Moulin Rouge!," Contrived And Artificial, But Works
","Yes, the movie is a contrived mix of late nineteenth century events with modern music. Yes, it's mostly a lot of singing and dancing and then the heroine dies as she was going to all along, having had consumption (tuberclosis). Yes, it's very flashy and unrealistic. Yet it still manages to work.How? Probably because everyone manages to play everything straight. Like Monty Python, it's the straightforward performances that manage to carry the material. The actors manage to meld everything seamlessly, which in other hands might have led to disaster. The movie was an artistic risk, but it paid off.",8,0,1,30 May 2011
Slap Shot," Fails At Either Comedy Or Drama
","I saw it at a house party last night. I heard it was a classic, but unfortunately I wasn't very impressed. It had some laughs, and was farcical in parts, but not enough to make this film a genuine comedy, and it didn't work as a drama either.None of the characters are really developed or win our sympathy. The coach's marriage has fallen apart, but why shouldn't it have? He's quite an obnoxious hole, really. The Hansons add comic relief by being overgrown boys who happen to be extremely dirty players, and they induce the rest of the team to do the same and they start winning by abandoning their former clean play, though one player stops playing in disgusted reaction. On top of that, the movie is full of profanity, nudity, vulgarity, and cheap homosexual jokes. Anger at the woman who was about to let the Chiefs fold for profit is one thing, but calling her little boy a fag who would suck cock when he got older was genuinely ugly.Lowbrow entertainment can be funny; this isn't the case here.",4,4,9,22 January 2012
Dumb and Dumber," Much Better Than I Had Anticipated
","I happened to see a bit of it on TV with my girlfriend and she liked what she saw. So I got the video and we watched it. I wasn't expecting much (from the movie's title), but the end result turned out to be quite good.The movie is light entertainment and hit and miss jokes, but like Monty Python, the actors made the material work through good acting. The chemistry between the lead characters was perfect, and there were clever bits such as the dog van 'peeing gas' and their unwittingly bringing their would-be assassin on the road with them, only to unintentionally have him poison himself. And best of all, the movie didn't overload on gross-out humor. Not for everyone, but it's one of the great lowbrow comedies.",8,1,3,26 April 2011
The Last Emperor," A Passive Movie
","The movie is visually beautiful, and tells much about how life was life for Pu-Yi, the child emperor of China who was never really an emperor but a figurehead kept under effective palace-arrest. Eunuch may make a show of worshiping him, but he never holds real power outside of the palace. His only power, when he reaches adulthood, is to banish the eunuchs from the palace for their corruption. (And this makes for the movie's best moment-they are given their 'organs' in little jars, as Pu-Yi is told that 'whatever their crimes, they cannot be denied their right to be buried as real men.') But even upon being taken out of the palace, when Pu-Yi is excited to finally see the world outside, he is still but a figurehead. He never is able to take an active role in the historical events around him, so the movie is essentially passive.",5,0,4,25 May 2013
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Not Really For Children, Is It?
","I was watching it with a girlfriend of mine when she suddenly got sick and had to go to the hospital. (Yes, she recovered and is fine.) So we only saw maybe the first half, but neither of us had a desire to see it any further anyway.Not having read the Roald Dahl book, I cannot make the comparison to that. But we get, at the beginning, a long exposition of Willy Wonka's background, which I don't know if it was in the book. (I thought he was supposed to be a man of mystery?) And he has a creepy air about him-would anyone want to send a child unaccompanied into a locked factory with him?Except for Charlie of the title, a good child living in poverty, the kids are not nice in one way or the other-greedy, bullying, etc., and bad things happen to them. Is this movie supposed to be a morality play? It seems a rather strange one.",5,5,9,13 August 2013
Big Fish," Long Bout Of Randomness
","Scenario: Father has a week to live. Son and wife visit him. Father tells a story to son, who knows it's another one of his many, many tall tales he has told throughout his life, and son is irritated because he had hoped his father was going to stop telling such stories and tell him what really happened throughout his life.Some examples: In his younger years, the father has fought in the Korean War and helped a set of Siamese twin ladies to defect. He goes through a dangerous wild forest to visit an idealized small town where nobody wants to leave, and in fact the father was expected to visit, albeit he arrived too early, so he leaves it. He meets a poet and a giant living in a nearby cave. Both characters would eventually leave the town themselves, and the town falls into decay.There is more, but this should be confusing enough. None of the individual stories, or the characters who are part of them, are developed enough to become interesting. We never learn why the father tells all these stories. Could they really be true (as implied by the ending)? Yet there is no overall payoff, and we don't figure out in the end why things happened as they did.

","This is a retelling of the story of two mountain-climbing teams who climb to the summit of Mount Everest in May 1996, when there is supposed to be ideal weather...and even then, it is dangerous. Why does everybody go? A Japanese woman has already climbed the Earth's other six major peaks, some media people want news stories, one man is sent by the primary school he taught at, another battles depression he only escapes by climbing mountains. The movie describes that in the past, one out of four people who make the climb perished in the attempt, but in 1992 someone decides to set up a system of camps and site employees including Sherpas to make it easier for less-expert climbers to make the attempt. But even installing ladders and ropes to bridge crevices to decrease the danger does not make the climb safe.Indeed, you don't need to see the movie in IMAX to see how utterly dangerous it is to climb mountains; the visuals and topnotch performances by all the actors do an excellent job in proving this. The staff at the Everest base camp tell everyone who comes just what sorts of hazards climbers can face, but most of the people still choose to go on, with few turning back. The sad part is how some of the people leave wives and families behind.If the movie does nothing else, hopefully it proves to people just what a crazy stunt climbing such a high mountain really is.",8,0,1,19 March 2017
2001: A Space Odyssey," Great Special Effects, Repetitive Story
","I saw this movie in a high school class, and the teacher explained things along the way as we watched. The theme of the story is clear enough-big black monoliths are affecting humanity's evolution over time, starting with our primate ancestors learning to use objects rather than just hands and feet to fight and hunt, and immediately jumping into where we start exploring outer space. The astronauts who reach the Moon (remember the movie was made the year before we actually put men on it) see another monolith, but nothing evidently happens right away.Then there is the falling-out between HAL, the intelligent computer which runs the manned spaceship traveling further out into the solar system, and its human crew. It is unclear why this occurs, but the result is only one human crew member survives, and in the end...presumably he evolves into something greater than human. Whoever is behind the monoliths is never explained or hinted at.The special effects are spectacular for the era. The overall storyline, however, is not really deep. But this movie was made in the psychedelic era, so it works as a period piece.",6,3,6,23 April 2011
The Artist," It's A Novelty Film, Folks
","Some reviewers have called this movie pretentious. I, however, never got the impression that it tried to convey any deep meaning, or make the protagonist some tragic hero. It was 'artsy' in its use of black and white photography, old movie clichés, dialog panels, etc. to convey the era. But I got the idea that this was meant to show that the protagonist was only able to work in that medium and was unable to do things the new way (as indicated by the dream sequence where suddenly the world makes noise but he still cannot vocalize.) The protagonist is somewhat sympathetic, but is it any fault other than his own he cannot make the transition to sound movies? Does his wife get the blame for his failed marriage? He ends up relying on others (including his dog) to save him from his problems.The story could have been told as a conventional movie with color and sound. But the idea was to deliberately produce it as it was, more as a novelty than a great story, and the movie's novelty value was undoubtedly the reason it has garnered acclaim. It was certainly better than Mel Brooks' 'Silent Movie'.",7,0,2,18 March 2012
The Fountain," Visually Pretty, But That Is The Movie's Only Asset
","I admit I'm biased because this was the last movie my then-girlfriend and I saw together before we broke up for good weeks later (no, ha-ha, this movie wasn't the reason), but while this movie isn't the worst I've seen, she and I both found it visually pretty but otherwise nonsensical. She said several times while we were watching she had expected differently of this movie and apologized for taking me to it, and she observed the few other audience members didn't seem to like it either.The first few minutes with the conquistadors was good, but the rest of the movie was so disjointed, long, and confusing we were glad it was over. If there was a point to it we missed it completely.",2,1,4,19 April 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," Self-Sacrificing Going Too Far?
","The premise of the story is, of course, how a man named George Bailey keeps sacrificing his money and his desires all his life to help others in various ways over the years, and when later in life he is finally overwhelmed by his latest problems which he cannot solve himself and is ready to commit suicide, an angel from Heaven whose eyes are upon promotion is sent down to tell George about how all his self-sacrificing had saved so many people from disaster.One can nitpick about various things in the movie: reading a Bible, there are references to cherubs and seraphs, angels whose status in Heaven is indicated by the number of wings they have; the fact that George, despite his frustrated ambitions, didn't do too badly-he has a nice wife and children and is not living in poverty, and not being eligible to serve in the military would not necessarily be considered by some people (including people who had) to be a bad thing.My problem, though, is this-it turns out that Bailey has lots of friends because of all the good he had done, and they're willing to pay him back to get him out of his financial hole and save him from jail. Unfortunately, in real life self-sacrifice, especially excessive self- sacrifice, does not necessarily result in gratitude from those one had sacrificed for. They might necessarily take your actions for granted and in fact might regard you as a slave, which all too often happens in real life. Once your purpose is served, the sacrificer is discarded and forgotten, or even despised. And that, alas, would have been the far more credible ending.",5,27,47,13 August 2013
The Cannonball Run," Major Actors Embarrassing Themselves
","Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Farrah Fawcett, Roger Moore, Sammy Davis, Jr., and other major actors gather in a movie as competitors in an illegal car race across the country. Sounds like fun? Ah, if only it were.There are a few amusing bits, namely a car crashing into a roomful of hippies attending an anti-automobile meeting, or Jackie Chan continuing to fight a bunch of interfering bikers while his co-driver says, 'Hurry up, dummy, we are losing the race!' But basically there is surprisingly little car action and a lot of scenes where the racers stop and interact in scenes which are supposed to amuse and often don't. There is also surprisingly little sexuality beyond cleavage shots, either. Best to avoid this sorry mess.",2,4,8,13 October 2012
Paths of Glory," Not So Much A Movie Against War...
","...as on the military hierarchy, at least in the French Army during World War One. A high-ranking French general is seeking further promotion, and he sees an opportunity to do so by having his regiment take a German position known as 'The Anthill'. Trouble is, he normally spends his time way behind the lines, and when he makes a front-line inspection of his troops, it is clear he lack a real understanding of what life is like for them.He orders the attack anyway, despite the warnings from the officers below him, and the enemy repulses the initial attackers so quickly, the remaining infantry mutiny and refuse to press the attack. The frustrated general finds three scapegoat soldiers to court-martial, and though they are represented by an officer who is a real lawyer, he is helpless to save them.We see the emotional damage the incompetent general has put others through-not for the glory of France, but for his own purposes. He might eventually be brought down, but his evil lives after him.",9,1,2,12 November 2017
Casino Royale," James Bond Kills...And Kills...And Kills...And Kills...
","The original James Bond series as created by Ian Fleming feature a spy who lives the high life as he does his spy work, killing a few evildoers and making love to several women in the process. There were some gadgets, though not necessarily flashy ones, and Bond wasn't always full of wisecracks like he would be in the later movies. The idea might have been that the later movies were too full of wisecracks and fancy gadgets and they were toning it down. But they ended up overdoing it and turning Bond into basically a glorified serial killer.The older movies did have Bond do killing and blowing up of villains' installations. But in this movie, Bond kills willy-nilly, often without real necessity. On top of that, the scenes at the gambling table and his romance with the (supposed) heroine go on for too long. Bond may be young and inexperienced, but no wisecracks at all? We might as well be watching a 'Bourne' movie.",5,2,3,16 February 2013
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Boring Mr. Fox
","I only gave it two stars because they did a decent job with the animation. I won't compare it with the Roald Dahl book which I never read, but it doesn't make a difference, The movie was charmless and so bland and boring I bailed after twenty minutes. I doubt even little kids would enjoy this.So what happens? Mr. and Mrs. Fox are at a farm, first conversing, then stealing a squab from it. Then Mr. Fox sees a trap and gets curious and ends up trapping himself and his wife in it. Then all of a sudden, two years pass (no explanation of how they got out of the trap) and they have an adolescent son, then they have a young cousin visit when his father is ill. In the meantime, Mr. Fox got a job in the newspapers and they move from their old hole into a tree home, even though they are located near disreputable farmers.My description makes the movie sound more interesting than it actually was. Where there should have been laughs and/or excitement, there are none. Everything is done in such a bland and blah way, even the puppets seemed like they were bored and wished they were somewhere else. Not for kids, adults, or anybody else, unless they need assistance in falling asleep.",2,1,3,24 September 2016
The Producers," Mel Brooks' First And Best
","Zero Mostel is a down-on-his-luck theater producer who is forced to romance elderly ladies to get money. Gene Wilder arrives at his office to examine his financial records, and notes that he had embezzled some money from his previous production...but this didn't matter as that production lost all its money anyway. Soon, the two of them hit upon a clever idea-make a theater production that is sure to flop, and they can embezzle all the money they can without fear of consequences!To do that, the pair seek out the worst play, 'Springtime For Hitler' by a crazed Nazi, worst director, a stereotypical flaming homosexual, and worst actor from an audition, a goofy hippie. Of course, the audience will hate it, right?The movie depends on a shocking concept, and only a Jew would have dared to pull it off. Performances and stereotypes are overdone, but that is part of the comedy. It's a fundamentally tasteless idea, but Brooks has managed to make it funny. Too bad his successive movies would never reach such heights.",9,0,2,30 May 2016
The Truman Show," Once The Scenario Is Established...
","...where can the movie go? A man discovers, at the age of 30, that his life has been entirely a manipulated television show, and the world around him a stage set and the people around him actors. The scenario necessarily requires quite a lot of suspension of disbelief, and is meant to convey a message. Director Christof does not merely want to keep his show alive; Truman was an unwanted baby, and Christof deliberately wants to keep Truman in his cocoon world to prevent him seeing the world outside and how bad it is, and does everything he could to discourage Truman from wanting to leave.Basically, the story is predictable. Once Truman knows the world around him is manipulated, why would he bother to stay? If he can leave the cocoon, why wouldn't he, if he is a normal, healthy man? Really, with everything spoiled, the whole point of the show is lost, and there is no way things could have ended otherwise, so the story's end is actually anticlimactic.",5,2,4,22 March 2013
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Funny But Definitely Not For Everybody
","Despite the movie's inherent over-the-top silliness (what else do you expect from Monty Python?), it still manages to convey the drab, dreary atmosphere of medieval Britain of a thousand years ago, with its mud ('How do you know that's the king?' 'He doesn't have (manure) all over him!'), plagues, witch hunts, and occasional famines. It is indeed quite a shock when the modern world comes to interrupt everything in the end.As for the story itself, it is meandering and uneven, but sometimes can be very funny. The Black Knight who still won't give up after losing all his limbs, Sir Robin the not-so-brave, the effeminate son of a tough lord, the three questions at the bridge, Castle Anthrax, and so on. A funny romp, but also gruesome and vulgar, so don't bring the kids.",9,0,1,4 November 2012
The Wedding Singer," I Didn't Hate, Hate, Hate This Movie...
","That's what Roger Ebert did with this movie, though I didn't. But I didn't find the movie particularly good either. The plot is standard romantic comedy: boy (the wedding singer) is about to marry an unsuitable woman, while girl (a waitress coworker) is engaged to a wealthy but horrible man. The rest you can guess.The movie takes place in 1985 and is supposed to be about the decade, though as someone who lived through the 1980's and who has attended weddings, I never heard of wedding singers until I saw the title of this movie. Was this a 1980's fad? Funny, I remember Yuppies and those stupid yellow signs to stick into car rear windows but never this. Also, Boy George and Madonna may have been 1980's successes but Huey Lewis And The News, Peter Gabriel, and Phil Collins were bigger and more successful during that time period, and without resorting to gimmickry.The movie did have one real surprise, though. Billy Idol showed up at the end to help the good guy defeat the bad guy. The icon of raw sexuality Billy Idol in a romantic comedy? That's like putting Fred Rogers into a slasher movie.",6,1,3,22 August 2019
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Weak Rehash Of The First Movie
","Basically this is a remake of 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark': Indiana Jones must beat the Nazis to obtaining the holy relic. The main differences are a lack of strong villains, and the inclusion of Indy's father in the story. Unfortunately Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are not convincing as father and son.The original film was an exciting roller-coaster ride, a remake of 1930's- style exotic adventures. This is the same without the excitement, or any good characters. Even the sword fight which takes place here to make up for the lack of one in the original (because rumor has it that Harrison Ford was too ill at the time to perform it) is tired and unexciting, as is the rest of the movie.The only good thing I can say about it is that it was better than the hideous 'Temple Of Doom'-but that is a weak compliment indeed.",3,3,10,24 August 2013
The Simpsons Movie," Basically A Long Simpsons Episode
","I've never really been a fan of 'The Simpsons', not even during its glory days in the early 1990's, so I can review this movie on its own merits. In fact, I rented it to watch with my girlfriend who likes the show more than I do. She didn't seem to get too excited over it either.Basically, the story is about Homer adopting a pig and causing it to mutate, and he accidentally poisons Springfield's water supply with its excrement. He and his family are run out of town, but soon afterward the EPA learns of this and the Schwarzenegger-like US President is convinced to put a giant dome over Springfield to prevent the pollution from spreading. Homer and his wife and kids, already outside of Springfield, travel around and eventually decide to do something about the dome.Besides its length, the only difference between this movie and any regular Simpsons TV episode is that you get to see Bart's genitalia during the skateboarding scene toward the beginning. This movie has nothing in it for anyone other than Simpsons fans, if even them.",4,0,0,12 October 2012
V for Vendetta," R For Ridiculous
","First of all, I never read the graphic novel it was based on so I cannot compare the movie to that. Second, I am American so I cannot view it from a British perspective-and I've noticed a lot of Britons and/or readers of the graphic novel disliked this film.But I did already know that Guy Fawkes was a Catholic terrorist who tried and failed to blow up both houses of Parliament in response to the British persecution of Catholics in his era. (We Americans aren't complete ignoramuses after all.) Yet the character V, who evidently models himself on Fawkes, supposedly intends to destroy the fascist government ruling Britain by blowing up Parliament and other major British symbols, evidently with the effect of returning the country to something better-anarchy? Democracy? The movie simply ends after Big Ben and Parliament are blown apart.The totalitarian government uses Christianity as a means of oppression, even though modern Britain isn't strongly religious. Also, a homosexual has a copy of the Koran and loves its poetry, which is tantamount to a Jew enjoying Mein Kampf, neither of which are symbols of freedom. And what of V having a basement full of forbidden antiques-how would someone like him have the time and energy to accumulate all this? And how does he manage to make and send all those masks to the public in a society where everyone and everything is being watched? That spoiled things right there-along with all the people donning V costumes and walking up to Parliament, past armed soldiers, unmolested? The whole thing gets ridiculous.And as for V himself, he's supposed to have been badly burned in a fire which ruined his flesh, yet he's super-adept physically and can speak normally. And he personally deceives and tortures his protégé to cure her of fear-and she still sticks by him and speaks admiringly of him in the end.There's more, but I think I said enough already.",1,5,14,28 May 2012
