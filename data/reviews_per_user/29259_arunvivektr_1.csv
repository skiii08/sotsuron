The Hangover," It is a once in life time movie for us.....
","First of all I do not like that much of American comedy movies. I only watch regional comedy movies which have 'clean' comedies and nice dialogs and all.. Some English Humor movies that I watched was hell like tragedy... But I liked this one. Nice dialogs, situations, surprises and a great climax. What more do you want a movie like this? The casting is superb, Very good direction and especially the soundtracks are greater than ever. The events are its beauty. It really tempts you not to go out of the cinema even at the interval. Its not a family type of movie. It is the one your mom is warning you about. But you know what it gives us the real pleasure of it. If you once watched this you will watch this at least two more times. It was with my friends that I watched this movie. We were expected a limed comedy thriller and what we got was real pain in the stomach by laughing. After the movie we were talking nothing but about it until bed.Some of them had an opinion that it will be better to avoid that much vulgarity from it. But I am quiet sure that it will kill the fun of it. So for any normal conservative Indian guy It is not the movie you want to go with the family and have a nice dinner there after. It is a movie that You go with your friend, laugh like hell, make some noise, thrill with fun and have a beer with.It is like the traditional Indian in me is freaking out, shamelessly scolding it but the man in me slaps it and saying 'this is what you need '. Yeah I agrees it this is a once in lifetime movie for us!!! What more?It's Classic!!!",8,1,2,28 May 2011
