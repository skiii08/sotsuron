Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Save your Money
","I am upset. I waited MONTHS to see this movie. I have seen every episode of the cable show. I almost cried when I couldn't get to the black carpet premier.I knew the trailers by heart. Unfortunately, the trailers were the funniest parts of the movie. I must also add that this was not a true documentary as some of the scenes were so obviously staged.Don't believe the hype. Don't believe that because of the huge success of this movie, his next film will earn him x amount of money.Does anyone know who I can write to to get my money back? You're better off waiting for the cable premier.",2,13,27,4 November 2006
