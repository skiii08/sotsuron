Raiders of the Lost Ark," Ghostbusters, but without the laughs.
","This film is so bad it could pass for a James Bond movie of the Roger Moore era. But without the beautiful girls. A puerile script, detestable characters and zero credibility. And that's before I get to the action sequences which were quite risible. I'm perfectly cool with the notion of killing a bunch of Nazi soldiers but when the said Nazi soldiers are shown to be a bunch of half-wits then just what is the point?Shame, I liked the first ten minutes or so, when he's dodging the booby traps, stealing the stuff and outwitting the savages. But it was all downhill once Denholm Elliott showed up. Not his fault of course, he didn't write this tripe. Two hours of completely wasted time. It seemed longer.",4,0,6,30 July 2016
In Bruges," Fifth rate rip-off of Pulp Fiction
","In Pulp Fiction, the dialogue was, if not witty exactly, at least funny from time to time. And you empathise to an extent with Jules and whateverisnamewas, especially after the scene where they are cleaning up the car. That's really quite funny.There's nothing equivalent in 'In Bruges', (and they can't even spell or call it right, the city is really named Brugge as everybody knows) and I don't understand the point at all. WTF is all that stuff with the midget all about? And why is it to be assumed that just because a guy uses the c-word every third time he opens his mouth that that makes him well hard? (Sexy Beast, another totally crap film, makes the same mistake). The fairies at the bottom of my garden are harder than Harry is.As a gangster film it's ludicrous. (Has there been a decent gangster film since Lee Marvin died?) And as a comedy it fails the very first test... it just ain't funny.My rating 2 stars out of 10, and it only gets them on account of the lovely shots of the wonderful city of Brugge that you get to see by accident every so often.",2,5,15,5 August 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Total Stinker
","I was sure I was going to enjoy this film, but what a disappointment it was.The pace is leaden rather than suspenseful, the violence is gratuitous, and the plot is quite inexplicable to anybody who has not read the book. And what the Dickens were they doing turning Peter Guillam into a homosexual? Just what the hell is that all about? And did nobody realise that casting Roger Lloyd-Pack (only known for Trigger in the BBC sit-com 'Only Fools and Horses') as Mendel was going to blank any credibility of that character? And what were those swimming shots for? (And is there anything more ridiculous than the sight of a man swimming while wearing horn-rimmed spectacles?)Anybody tempted to watch this rubbish should instead go out and buy the DVD of the BBC serial made in 1979. It will take you longer to watch, but it is more suspenseful, better acted, better directed, better scripted and better paced. Better everything in fact.And all this Oscar talk..... I'm just baffled. (Just like last year, when another crappy remake (True Grit) got a lot of nominations.) I don't understand it at all.",1,4,10,18 January 2012
Barry Lyndon," A total stinkeroo
","Where to start with this pile of crap? How about the obscene length of it? By half way through I was just willing somebody, anybody, to blow Ryan O'Neal's head off and put an end to this ordeal.This film could have been so different. Just imagine if Michael Caine had been cast in the main role, he would have created some humour and sympathy for a basically disgusting, cowardly and hateful character. But no, Ryan O'Neal runs the gamut of the emotions from A to B. He has the charisma of an 'I speak your weight' machine, and I just could not wait for him to get what he deserved.I give this a 2, it would have been 1 but there are some good shots of the scenery (which does a better acting job than the principals).",2,18,40,24 September 2011
Doctor Zhivago," What a waste of time, money, talent
","I've been in love with Julie Christie since I saw 'Far from the madding crowd' as an impressionable teenager so I was looking forward to this. But what a let-down. First, the Overture. Goodness me, it goes on and on and on and on.... Just what is the point of this nonsense? It's not supposed to be a musical is it, and there are certainly no memorable musical themes in it. So, it's fast-forward time. But it gets worse. Much worse. Sheer tedium. The lovely Julie Christie is as beautiful as ever, but her character is unattractive. She, and the rest of the cast too, (especially Rod Steiger), are wasted on this stuff. To be honest, I didn't make it past the intermission. Apparently there's a second disc in this set, but you are too long dead to waste any more time on this.",1,8,28,4 July 2006
U-571," Fairly entertaining action movie
","Well I enjoyed this film. The plot line is absurd, but so what? So was Where Eagles Dare, The Dirty Dozen, Inglorious Basterds and many others.No, it's a bit of all-action hokum set in a submarine. It doesn't compare well with Morning Departure, Above Us the Waves, We Dive at Dawn, and certainly not with the daddy of them all, Das Boot, but it's entertaining enough.And to those fellow Brits who take umbrage at the notion that Hollywood is claiming that the US Navy did stuff that they didn't, well I say lighten up. It's just a movie, it's not pretending to be history, it's a story. My suggestion... save up your money and commission a film that shows the British SAS taking Iwo Jima, HMS Ark Royal winning the Battle of Midway and the Japanese surrender taking place on HMS King George V, after the dropping of The Bomb out of a Lancaster flown out of Burmah. Now THAT I'd like to see!",6,10,21,27 October 2012
