The Hangover," One of the most hilarious movie I have ever seen....
","This movie is one of the best comedy movie ever made in Hollywood. The story is about four friends (one of them is the groom) who go to Las Vegas for bachelor party and in night they get so drunken that the next morning they couldn't remember what they did last night and then the story unfolds and they come to know what crazy things they have done.It is one of those movies in which almost after every 10 min something new comes up and you say to yourself : 'oh god! now where did this come from?'. I mean the whole story is very nicely displayed and each character leaves its mark.By the name of the movie you might get the idea that it will be about some people getting drunk and then not knowing what they are doing/have done after that, but this movie is far better then this simple idea. The things shown in the movie is simply awesome and the way it story reveals itself is superb.Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis did very good job.All in all: An excellent comedy movie.",10,2,3,26 May 2011
