Insidious: Chapter 2," Both scarier and all round better than the first one!
","Due to my disappointment with the first film and my confusion to why it was so over-hyped, I was extremely sceptical about seeing this film, however I left the cinema both surprised and shocked at how terrifying this film really was - this film easily beat 'the conjuring' with it's scares- it left me uncomfortable watching it and that is what a horror film should do, it should leave you worried about what is going to happen next and that is exactly what 'Insidious 2' did.Despite being terrifying and horrifying it also had an extremely thought provoking and quite disturbing storyline - even though it did continue Dalton's storyline in the first installment- it centered on tieing up the loose ends of 'Insidious'. I can now watch the first film with little confusion and more enjoyment.This film is extremely scary and truly amazing and I would recommend seeing it. In fact I would see it again (if I had any friends)",9,0,0,15 December 2013
The Purge," All crime certainly was legal when this film was made!!
","I won't lie to you, the film itself was watchable- It has a good premise, very good acting and some amazing scenes- however the ending made me want to throw the DVD player out of the window. It was infuriating and a classic example of a lazy writer. I have been dying to see this film since it came out, probably before, but I was extremely disappointed with this over-hyped, murderer of the genre. As said before the majority of the film was OK, there was immaculate acting from Ethan Hawke and young actor Max Burholder, but a lot more could have been done with a promising Idea such as this. For Ethan Hawke fans do not refrain from watching this movie as he does not disappoint but for fans of the average housewife don't even go there. I can conclude by saying that this film featured one of the worst endings in today's cinema!!!!!!",4,1,1,8 January 2014
