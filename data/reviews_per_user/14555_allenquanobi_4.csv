Blade Runner 2049," *videogamedunkey voice* A MASTAHPIECE!
","In the movie, Steve Jobs, Jobs says, 'The people don't know what they want until you show it to them.' Never before has a quote been so correct than for Blade Runner 2049. This movie is one of the best science fiction movies of the 2010s, as well as one of the best movies of the 21st century so far. No movie is without a flaw, so let's start off with this movie's short list of flaws:<ul><li>For me, the villain, Niander Wallace played by Leto, didn't have the gravitas and commanding presence as the villain in the original Blade Runner, Roy Batty, had. Wallace played more of a back role to Luv, giving her the main purpose of the movie. However, this flaw could also be seen as a positive because the movie never places a huge focus of Wallace because it isn't meant to. The movie is about K and his journey. - The pacing. This flaw is more of a critique for general audiences and why this movie is being bashed by them. The pacing at times is a little slow for those who entered the movie expecting a sci-fi action adventure as marketed by the trailers. Again, this flaw is inconsequential because the movie is not meant to be a sci-fi movie; however, the general audience will want it.</li></ul>Moving onto the pros:<ul><li>The writing and plot: This movie could have been ridiculously unoriginal; the original and movies like Tron, Terminator, and the Matrix explore the concept of AI and its place in our evolutionary timeline. However, the thing that separates 2049 apart from the rest is placing human conflict and exploring the human condition. K, **SPOILER** a replicant, discovers a mind-bending truth that makes him question his very existence and creation. The character is written extremely well, making the audience feel like they can relate to the character on his journey discovering what it means to be human. There is also an element of the chosen one storyline that is seen in many movies, with a decent twist on it. Dialogue between characters is perfect, laden with philosophical discussion and double entendres.</li></ul><ul><li>Film Making and Editing: Directed by Dennis Villeneuve, this movie is a visual orgasm. Beautifully shot by the legendary Roger Deakins (if he doesn't win his Oscar this year, it'll be the biggest injustice since Leo), the movie looks and feels like an accurate representation of future California. Villeneuve minimized use of CGI in favor of miniature buildings and physical backgrounds, and the result is amazing, capturing the aesthetic and feel of the original, while also building up more of the world around LA.</li></ul><ul><li>Soundtrack: I see many reviews that are critical of the loud and bombastic soundtrack that Zimmer has come up with. I believe that the score works perfectly in order to portray the characters as small in the grand scale and scope of the world. It also uses elements of the amazing and mesmerizing original Blade Runner soundtrack while also sounding unique in its own right.</li></ul><ul><li>Performances: Gosling as K plays it very well. Emotionally reserved and speaking very few words, he creates a mysterious vibe around K, while also investing the audience into the character. Joi played by Ana de Armas is good as the bubbly love interest. Sylvia Hoeks steals the show in scenes as Luv, portraying a menacing yet eloquent servant to Wallace. Harrison Ford manages to excel yet again as Rick Deckard, portraying a similar reserved Blade Runner as Gosling and his performance in the original.</li></ul><ul><li>Ability to stand as its own movie: This pro is very important and for good reason. Every sequel nowadays seems like it must either be filled with universe building, intertextuality, and plot beats similar to the original. Examples of this are The Force Awakens which, while a great film in terms of film making and acting, has an overabundance and over reliance on callbacks to the original trilogy (i.e. relying on the appearances of such things as the Millennium Falcon and Han Solo) in order to amp up the audience and entertain them. Jurassic World suffers from this also in that it relies of points such as the T-Rex, the original park itself, and basically replicating the original plot in order to get positive marks from the audience. What sets Blade Runner 2049 apart from these movies is the fact that it is a true sequel: it doesn't rely on knowledge of the original or images from the original in order to entertain an audience. The closest it comes to intertextuality is when Rick Deckard comes back, and he doesn't enter the film until the end of the second act/the beginning of the third act. It uses its original story and new characters in order to engage the audience, which is rare amongst movies today which all seem to be in grand service to a universe, i.e. MCU, DCU, Universal monster movies, etc. </li></ul>In conclusion, the movie is a grand feat in film making, story telling, and acting. Entertaining and gripping throughout, Blade Runner 2049 serves as a prime example for any film maker who wants to create a good film.",10,3,10,19 November 2017
Justice League," This is not the justice league
","TL;DR: The movie is a mess: Safe but unoriginal, thin and confusing plot. Zero character development, leading to disappointing performances. Ridiculously bad CGI. Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, and Superman. The most iconic super heroes in comic book and pop culture history. Should be easy to make a cool and compelling movie about them right? Eh, maybe not. Lets start with the Pros: - Ezra Miller as the Flash is entertaining at points. His comic relief at points felt forced, but some of the jokes landed. - Comic Book references; for a DC comics fan, there are cool references throughout the movie that were cool to connect to the comics and made me smile a little bit. Moving on to the neutral points: - The plot was extremely safe; however, it is also ridiculously rushed. One could say this is expected because 3 of the main characters (Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman) are appearing for the first time. The plot also is ridiculously unoriginal: Aliens are looking for artifacts. Once they find artifacts, the world will be destroyed. Team must assemble and stop them before it's too late. One could argue that this is expected too; look at the Avengers, they did that also. But the thing that the Avengers did that DC fails tremendously at is setting up each character with a backstory so the audience can feel and care about each character's motivations (except Hawkeye). The only character that is given a little bit of an emotional backstory here is the Flash, and if you have watched the TV series you know what backstory I'm talking about. In summary, the plot was incredibly unoriginal, rushed, and predictable to the very end. - Ben Affleck as Batman: Affleck fails to impress as he did in Batman v Superman; however it isn't his fault. He does the best with what he is given here, even delivering some funny one-liners. However, if anyone know Batman at all, the character written in this story is a complete 180 from both Batman v Superman and the Batman of the comics. Gone is the dark from the Dark Knight, replaced by a Batman so light, there were flashes of the post Keaton, pre Bale Batman portrayals. The fact that Danny Elfman's score also brought these memories back did not help. - Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman: Gadot suffers from the same problem as Affleck: her character is written extremely poorly. Similar to Captain America, she is a warrior from a time long gone, a time that was simpler and more heroic. Therefore, Wonder Woman should be going through the same effects that Captain America did in the Avengers: bashing with other characters who don't exemplify heroism while portraying the ideal heroic nature that she was raised with. However, her character gets demoted to sexy heroine; every shot that introduces her starts from her behind and ends at here chest area. Gadot does the best with what she's given though, and is just fine in her role as co-leader to the squad. - Danny Elfman's score: Heroic at best and fine at worst, this score is no Zimmer's Man of Steel or Wonder Woman themes. Every track here is nearly forgettable, only saved by Elfman's callbacks to his familiar Batman theme, original Superman theme, and the Wonder Woman theme. Lastly the negatives: - CGI: With a rumored 300 million dollar budget, one can only wonder how in the world can a studio mess up something that is more than 90% of the movie? Starting with the very first scene which is (spoiler) a video recording of Superman. As most know, Cavill was unwilling to shave his mustache because he was filming MI6 at the same time, so the studio had to digitally remove it. The end result is something that looked like Marlon Brando in the Godfather. Immediately bringing laughs, this scene is just a precedent for the rest of the film's horrific CGI. The villain looks like a college student digitally created him for an extra credit project, with clunky movement and not fitting in with the background at all. Cyborg is an unfortunate casualty of this as well because for the whole movie his CGI just distracts from Fisher's performance and dialogue (more on that later). Nearly every shot during battle scenes and on Themyscira look like they were animated for a commercial. - Momoa and Fisher as Aquaman and Cyborg: Similar to Batman and Wonder Woman, it looks like these characters were written with little to zero personality. However, unlike Gadot and Affleck, Momoa and Fisher are barely there, delivering their lines like they are reading them for the first time. Their characters just feel like ex machinas at points. Momoa tries a little to just be himself, which can be seen as a good thing, but doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all. - Jumping around from location to location: When Star Wars Rogue One came out, people complained that the first half hour was dizzying due to the jumps from planet to planet. In this movie, it's not planet to planet, but from city to plane to city to island to ocean to city to flashback, without any warning or location status to even prepare the audience of the scene. - Editing/Reshoots: Building on the last point, the movie itself feels off. One can definitely tell the different tones from Snyder and Whedon immediately. (Spoiler) For example, Aquaman is introduced twice, and it is extremely obvious which one was the reshoot compared to Snyder's version. It's like there were two versions of the movie, and they couldn't decide which version to release so they just grabbed and mixed scenes from both versions. The final battle as well is immediately guilty of this. - Handling of Superman: Superman was gonna come back, only a child would be surprised by this. However, this movie retcons Batman v Superman in a way that makes no sense.",2,46,88,16 November 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The first one in the series made for grown-ups and kids
","I'll keep this review short since the movie came out more than a decade ago and it has been universally viewed. 5 movies came after this one in the series and 2 movies came before, yet Prisoner of Azkaban still remains my favorite (and many peoples') Harry Potter movie. This movie is the one of the few in the franchise that tells and completes a story. It deals with Harry uncovering a truth about his past involving his parents' murder, and explores how he adjusts to this truth. Here's what makes that sentence special: was there any mention of Voldemort in that summary? You'd be hard pressed to find any mention of him either in the movie, except in a couple sentences. This movie can be seen as separate from the rest of the Harry Potter movies because it holds up as its own, without having to build up the universe or service the Voldemort storyline at all. It's also the first movie to feature the dark undertones that the first two implied but never fully explored. He must deal with his darkest fears while also dealing with the danger of a murderer seeking to kill him. This is more personal, but this movie ironically deals with time travel better than any sci fi movie I've seen about it because it portrays it in a way that time is immutable, which makes the most sense.TL;DR: Dark and original, Prisoner of Azkaban stands as its own movie without having to build up a universe, while also entertaining in its own right.",9,0,2,19 November 2017
The Matrix," Original and great, but with one important flaw
","Released in a time of ground-breaking CGI advancements, the Matrix notched itself above the rest of the competition in terms of film- making. Visually stunning, thought-provoking, and fun, The Matrix is a near-perfect film for any sci-fi fan or any movie fan. Let's start with the plot and writing. The plot revolves around a hacker named Thomas Anderson who acts as a somewhat ill- explained hacker named Neo by night. One night, he gets contacted by a mysterious internet group led by the omniscient Morpheus. One step leads to another, and Neo, 'much like Alice' goes tumbling down the rabbit- hole, leading to a world-changing (quite literally in this sense) discovery that will cause him to question his very own existence. Right from the start, the plot hooks you, making the viewers themselves feel like Neo, questioning their own existence. Interwoven with the thought of questioning one's own existence, is a religion intertextuality with Neo and Christianity, making the depth of the film felt even more. The writing is fantastic and philosophical, particularly with the dialogue between Neo and Morpheus. It eclipses in the scene with the Oracle and the famous line 'There is no spoon', which is where the movie takes a sharp turn. For about ¾ of the movie, I was locked into the originality of the plot and storytelling. However, in the film's final act, specifically around (spoilers) an incredulous scene involving a lobby, the movie collapses onto itself with the most unrealistic and bombastic endings that one could describe as Michael Bay-esque. The final half hour of the movie, while entertaining with fight sequences and explosions, seems pulled out of a video game. You don't feel that the characters are in any real danger at this point, and it all leads to the ending, which is satisfying, but left a sour taste in my mouth because of how unoriginal and cliché it is compared to the rest of the movie. Despite the problems I had with some of the plot, the film- making is amazing. Never before has a film influenced future movies as the Matrix did. With its famous bullet-time sequence, and choreographed fight scenes, the Matrix set an industry standard that few films have accomplished or eclipsed since then. Finally, let's talk about the acting. The performances are mostly perfect for their characters. Fishburne's enigmatic performance as the audience's guide into the world and Weaving's subdued acting as the monotone and (spoiler) robotic antagonist. However, the one that confuses me is Reeve's performance as Neo. One could argue that due to Neo's character of being Zen-like and unknowing, Reeves is the perfect actor for this role. However, I think any actor of the same age as Reeves could play Neo and the character would have been realized the same.Overall, The Matrix is groundbreaking in both film-making, world-building, and storytelling, a must-watch for any movie-goer. However, the ending, while satisfying to most audiences, will disappoint those who would expect something different and bold from a truly original movie.",8,1,1,19 November 2017
