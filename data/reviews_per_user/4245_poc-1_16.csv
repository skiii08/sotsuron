Angels & Demons," Where did it all go right?
","OK, so having read the reviews excoriating this movie I allowed myself to be dragged along to to see it with low expectations. I have now realised that Irish Times journalist Donald Clark is in fact a reverse barometer. He gave it 1 star out of 5. OK so it is not 5/5 but it is a respectable 3/5 and an amusing way to spend a couple of hours, even exciting. It is in fact much better than the Da Vinci Code mainly because it has better pacing, some genuinely exciting scenes and it is better visually. It is a chase movie and like the airport book it was inspired from, it is pretty vacuous abusing the disciplines of history, physics and logic in equal measure. But it's fun. You don't go to a movie like this expecting a watertight plot or expecting a message to humanity. You go because you want a bit of entertainment and popcorn. You don't expect the hero to die, you know he will save the day in the end. But so what? When you go on a fairground ride you know how it will end, but you expect thrills none the less. And if you are a physicist who is offended by scientific impossibilities, then you are in the same class as the religious types offended by the Da Vinci Code, unable to suspend disbelief.Does what it says on the tin.",6,0,2,16 May 2009
Minority Report," Highly original plot but overrated
","I found this movie long and somewhat disappointing. The plot was as contorted as we have come to expect from a Philip K. Dick story, e.g. Bladerunner, Total Recall. However the ending, the good guys and the bad guys were all completely predictable. The movie is stuffed with outrageous product placements for Gap, Guinness, Lexus and various other global brands. I had the feeling that as a short story the plot would work well as a Sci Fi shocker but when stretched to a two hours and given a Hollywood happy ending it just seems contrived.That said the acting was reasonable, the special effects well executed and there were some memorably disgusting scenes.6/10",5,1,2,8 July 2002
Memento," Clever mystery thriller
","This movie is a real cerebral thriller, which will leave you juggling the plot in your head to figure it out well after the movie is over.The actual details of the plot have been discussed to death elsewhere so if you are going to watch it, don't read anything about it beforehand. It suffices to say that it is very novel in its presentation and don't take any bathroom breaks in the middle of the movie, or you risk losing your grasp on the plot.If there is a flaw it is that at the end the pieces will still not fit perfectly together even if you have seen the movie two or three times.Some people will find it too clever and even downright annoying. But for me, a movie that you feel compelled to watch again must rate highly.",7,1,3,29 September 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Poor editing but a good movie
","This film has so much going for it. Great special effects, top notch eye candy in the pleasant shapes of Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, a killer performance from Johnny Depp and above all cinematic jokes that are genuinely funny. My one gripe is that it is too long and the ending was so drawn out and confused that it nearly ruined it for me. The climactic fight scene is also far too long. Cut a good forty minutes off the thing and you would be left with a much better film.",7,0,1,11 August 2003
Public Enemies," Hit and miss, mostly miss
","This movie tells the later stages of the crime career of John Dillinger, famous bank robber. What's good: Johnny Depp and Christian bale are good, the pacing is good, the sets and period detail are perfect. The score is quite good too.What's bad: a shootout sequence is obviously shot on a video camera looks cheap and has a major discontinuity in it. Other scenes the camera is shaky.Also for a movie that prides itself on historical detail, it plays fast and loose with the facts about the Dillinger gang. For instance the death of 'Baby Face' Nelson is complete fiction. You are duped into thinking the director cares about historical details with all the period sets, cars, news stories on the radio etc, but actually major parts of the plot are just made up. Of course the reason that historical movies rarely follow history exactly is that real events don't naturally follow standard narrative.So it is not a documentary, which is fine, so it must be a character movie right? This brings me to its biggest flaw. An important goal of a movie like this is to build an emotional connection with the central character. This ought to be easy with a character like Dillinger, because he actually built a huge public fan base as a latter day 'Robin Hood', despite being a murderous bank robbing crook. It tries hard and it does get close, particularly with the scenes involving Billie, one of Dillinger's many girlfriends. In the end, though, I just did not care all that much about him..It is competent, but ultimately it fails to match up in comparison with other movies of this genre. Right now the IMDb rating for this movie is higher than 'The Untouchables', 'Once Upon a Time in America' or 'Goodfellas', which is a testament to the cinematic ignorance of the majority of IMDb voters. No doubt the same people will rate this comment down, probably without even reading it, simply because I did not give the movie a 9 or 10.",6,338,423,2 July 2009
Elizabeth," Overrated, fictional
","Why do filmmakers take such care to reproduce locations and costumes and then completely distort the truth? So many things are incorrect in this movie. This is such a pity because the real story of Elizabeth's rise to power is much more compelling. Make no mistake, Elizabeth understood realpolitik from childhood, she did not have to learn on the job. Sometimes it is more stupid than inaccurate. There is no way English courtiers would argue with their monarch in front of the French Ambassador. I would be prepared to forgive some of this, if the movie were not so long and confused but after two hours I really was not sure when it would end. The main saving grace is the performance of Geoffrey Rush as the scheming Walsingham.Read a history book instead.",6,1,2,5 January 2004
Match Point," Too long and slow starting but rewarding in the end
","Slow starting and overlong, this movie lacked pace for the first hour. There was a plot building but so slow that I was starting to get bored. I liked the acting and the eye-candy (Johanssen and Rhys-Meyers) but the director could have made it move much faster. Some of the dialogue was stilted which is an unexpected weakness in a Woody Allen film. There also were several opportunities for more humour that were lost. Eventually the plot kicked off and it grabbed my attention back. The last twenty minutes and the conclusion were superb. Rhys-Meyers acting and accent also followed the same curve, at the beginning he really sounded awkward. I thought his Irish accent sounded wrong - until I realised he has a natural Irish accent. The clipped English dialogue and idioms were wrong for an Irish character. However, in the final twenty minutes he really delivered.It is so much better when a movie starts bad but ends well than the other way round.",7,4,6,7 January 2006
U-571," A bad movie made badly
","The plot of this movie is that the US Navy must capture the German Enigma encryption machine from a German submarine.How do I hate this movie, let me count the ways:The mistreatment of history in this movie has been documented in many places, so I won't retell it save to mention that it is highly disrespectful of the seamen who lost their lives recovering the real enigma machine from the sinking U559. Then you have a script which is filled with as many holes as the eponymous submarine. Then you have a plot which is thoroughly predictable. Then you have Matthew McConaughy who presence has ruined several quite decent flicks. Here he is just emblematic of its awfulness. Then you have poor special effects. Though I do confess the surface shots of what seemed to be real depth charges were a rare highlight. Then you have annoying characters who don't behave like real people in order to create artificial subplots. Then you have Harvey Keitel who has some awful lines, he should stick with Tarantino films. Then you have Hollywood who paid for this calamity. I don't hate Hollywood per se but this is the stereotypical example of what they do to history and heroism.Oh how I was praying that those depth charges would drown them all, but no, even when the sub is hit almost directly by several depth charges, everyone is fine apart from a few popped rivets.If you want to watch a really good submarine movie, watch Das Boot. If you want to watch a decent Hollywood made submarine movie, watch Crimson Tide. If you want to watch a Hollywood movie which is a bit silly that is still fun to watch, go rent The Hunt for Red October. In fact the Simpson Tide is better than this. Please help consign this trash to the discount bin.",4,4,9,25 July 2006
No Country for Old Men," Understanding this movie without spoilers
","A lot of people dislike this movie when they see it first. I confess to being a bit shocked by it myself and left the theatre feeling a bit bleak. However, this is precisely what is intended by the writer. Anyone who has not read the book will be surprised and probably confused by certain events in the film. It is not that it is ambiguous per se, but it does not follow the conventional thriller/pursuit movie narrative, even if it appears to at first. If you are confused or a bit disappointed after viewing this movie, you are not an idiot or Philistine. It is a great movie, but there are problems with transferring it from book to screen, despite it being very faithful to the text. Firstly, the dialogue is one of the best things about the movie and unlike in a book where you can re-read a paragraph if you missed something, in a movie theatre once it is gone, you can't rewind. The opening and closing monologues are the most important parts to pay attention to and again, because it is a movie, you may not see the closing monologue coming or you may not be paying enough attention to it when it comes. Again dialogue is more important in a book than a movie, where everything is highly visual. A movie like this can suck you in with its violence and suspense, so you start to ignore the dialogue, or at least let it wash over you. That said here is a guide to understanding this movie to those who have not yet seen it. Sheriff Bell is the principle character and he is only one given dialogue or monologue of more than a couple of sentences at a time. He is near to retirement and reflects on his life as a law officer at a time when crime has become so bad he describes it as a 'war'. In the opening dialogue, Sheriff Bell says 'Somewhere out there, there is a true and living prophet of destruction and I don't want to confront him. I know he's real. I have seen his work.' This is important, remember this. So you know it is coming, there is a closing monologue about his dreams, which you can find in the quotes section of this title. Llewellyn Moss is a hunter who stumbles on a drug deal gone wrong in the desert and makes off with $2M he finds on a dead drug dealer. Anton Chigurh is a killer hired to track down and recover the money. The rest of the action is concerned with this pursuit and its consequences. After this I will say no more about the plot, except that to say that if you are expecting Llewellyn Moss's great adventure, or a grand showdown between the good guy and the bad guy you will be sorely disappointed. This film is bleak and uncompromising. There may be a buried message of hope but it is communicated by allegory and allegory is not something we are used to seeing on screen. Like all great movies, it gets better with a second viewing.",7,1,3,21 January 2008
Garden State," Doesn't add up to very much
","This pleasant and inoffensive movie touches on themes common in US art house cinema. The angst of twenty somethings as they struggle to build careers from dead end jobs, the quirkiness of small town America, estrangement from friends and family. This movie is clearly influenced by such films as The Graduate and the Good Girl. However it is terminally slow moving and never rises close to either of those two movies. It has its moments spread thinly amongst endless scenes of is Zach Braff looking wan and Natalie Portman talking funny. The central theme of father-son estrangement is continually put off in favour of some blackly comic asides. For me the humour was more dead than dead-pan. The quirky details are nice enough by themselves, but you can't build an entire movie out of this and the central plots, estranged father-son relationship and finding true love have been done so many times before and better. Ian Holm's talents were barely stretched. Some of the scenes touch on controversial subjects but are only peripheral to the storyline and don't add much bite to the plot. The big reveal was not so big and the ending in particular was a great big howling romantic cinema cliché.",4,0,1,30 July 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Excellent but with narrow appeal
","This movie portrays the battle between CBS and Senator McCarthy in the 1950s. For those who don't know, this was the period where Joseph Mc Carthy became chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and used it to perform an anti-communist 'witch-hunt' calling dozens of prominent people and basically accusing them of treason on little or no evidence. It is very stylish, filmed in black and white with occasional jazz music. The character portrayal of Murrow (David Straithairn) is flawless. McCarthy appears in archive footage. The atmosphere of a 1950s newsroom is faithfully reproduced. Strangely I found George Clooney seemed to detract from this because he is such a familiar face on TV. In what it is, the film is pretty well perfect. It shows a genuine moment of human heroism where one man had the courage to stand up and say enough was enough. On the other hand, those who know nothing of the history may not find it engaging enough to draw them in. It does not go beyond its brief to inform and provide background to the climate of terror that McCarthy fostered. In fairness, most people would probably find this movie boring. But that's OK, a movie of this kind can't have mass-appeal.",7,1,2,21 March 2006
Downfall," Unique and compelling, but with some flaws
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. When I saw it I liked it but not as much as I thought I would. Perhaps this was because I knew the basic facts of the story beforehand but there were also some flaws. When faced with a moral dilemma there are three kinds of people. Firstly there are a tiny number of moralists who will resist. Secondly there are a tiny number of psychopaths like Hitler and Goebbels. Finally there is the vast majority of sheep, who will go along with whatever they are told and compartmentalise it. The film does an excellent job portraying the first two. The characters who fall into the third category are not totally believable, with the exception of Traudl Junge. Other characters are shown with morals qualms which do not seem believable given the historical record. In some places the dialogue does not seem realistic. There are things said by subordinates to Hitler which you cannot imagine being said. Partly this is because the director needs to inform the audience of particular facts. In situations like this the characters know each other so well, things do not need to be spelled out. It is down to the director's skill to ensure the audience is not left behind. This is one reason why this must have been an exceptionally difficult script to write. With a barrage of historical figures passing through the bunker it is easy to get left behind if you don't know who they are beforehand. Even so this is a unique film and well worth seeing.",8,0,1,3 March 2006
Casino Royale," Over-egged the pudding
","This is a classic example of how more is less. There are some fantastic stunts. There are some great characters, and great lines, great cars and villains. However each one seems underused, just so that more can be fitted in. In my opinion this is a movie which would be much better with 20% less of everything including stunts, characters and plot twists. 20% shorter running time would be much better too. A bond movie is a light entertainment and should not go over 100 minutes. There are fully four scenes of card play. Now I understand the rules of Texas hold-em and I found them boring and utterly predictable. Someone who doesn't know the rules, probably 90% of the audience, would only be confused. Two or three card scenes are enough. I like a movie with twists, as long as they are clever and delivered like a good punchline. However, the denouement here is rushed and jerky. Lovely opening credits, but where are the scanty-clad dancing girls? I missed them. Also there are some truly blatant product-placements. e.g. Bond: I already brought my tux. Bond-girl: But this is OscarDe-La-Renta! Bond: Its tailored! Bond-girl: I sized you up the minute I saw you (Bond tries on tux, admires self in mirror) Why don't they just have an ad-break it would be more honest! It is refreshing of the directors to make a Bond movie without relying on gadgets and special effects. It is just that this pudding has too many eggs and falls flat for me. Entertaining for the opening sequence and some of the dialogue. Annoying elsewhere.",6,4,8,21 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Breaktaking action with slow bits
","For the first half an hour I was getting worried, all the messy plot elements that needed advancing put forward a rather confused start to the film. Furthermore, leaving out the death of Saruman was a crime. Jackson claimed that it would have required a seven minute section unrelated to the rest of the movie, but to me the first 40 minutes seemed just as much of an 'add on'. Also grating was the constant harping on how all hope was lost, we're doomed etc.Once the action started it was a real fairground ride running almost non-stop to the climax. There were a few deus-ex-machina type escapes, but that is only to be expected in the fantasy genre. After this there was a lengthy 'climb down' section which involved all the characters saying goodbye and farewell. It was all a bit much for me. Frodo looks in Sam's eyes, Sam looks mournfully at Frodo, Frodo looks a Pippin. There were about five or six times when I thought the credits would start to roll, but no, there were more goodbyes, more characters to get married and live happily ever after. Still it was a fitting end to the best adaptation yet of Tolkien's weighty tome and probably worth a second viewing sometime.",6,0,0,29 December 2003
Gangs of New York," Boring, predictable, impossible
","Perhaps this movie has a resonance for New Yorkers but I doubt it. Everything in it has been done before, the fight scenes in Braveheart, the son avenging his father's death (Hamlet anyone?). The scenery and costume but in Far and Away. The love interest. Diaz and Di Caprio are pretty but Di Caprio in particular can't act. Daniel Day Lewis sounds uncannily like Groucho Marx. The fact that he also looks a bit like him on screen makes it look comic to me.
Day Lewis' character is a one-eyed butcher who can throw knives with an accuracy better than a centimeter. This is impossible if you don't have stereo vision. Di Caprio's character claims that 15,000 Irish were arriving per week in the 1860s - I don't think so, perhaps one week during 1840s but not afterwards. Clearly not much research was done. It looks as if Scorses read up on lots of amazing facts about 19c New York and decided that they were all true and happened all the time.<SPOILERS>By the end of the film I was cheering for the marines to massacre all these lawless savages.
Oh yes watch out for the CGI elephant at the end. Clearly Scorsese is aspiring to be operatic, but what we see is more like baudy, violent vaudeville.",4,2,8,14 January 2003
Donnie Darko," Not as clever as it pretends to be
","Jake Gyllenhall stars in this mix of sci-fi, horror and mystery. And he does well, creating the memorable character of a troubled teen. Where the film falls down is the the way the plot mixes in pseudo science and pseudo religion. It is OK to do that if the pace of a movie is fast enough so that the viewer is not bothered but this is not the case here - it is a slow movie with a disappointing climax. If you are going to use this kind psychobabble you should at least make sure your plot holes are covered and again this is not the case. The director follows the standard method of a countdown to give the film some forward motion, a sense of increasing tension. The principle character is informed that the world will end in 28 days. The problem is that after a while, this countdown seems interminably slow - When the screen said there were 12 days to go I was disappointed, I was hoping it was at least within a week of the climax. There were other disappointments, the man in the scary bunny suit was certainly scary-looking but there were no moments of real terror, which is what I was expecting. On the positive side the mood and characterisation was good. It remains flawed but watchable.",6,2,3,15 September 2003
