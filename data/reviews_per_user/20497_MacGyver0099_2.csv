Raiders of the Lost Ark," Best Movie of all time
","Gandhi may have won the Oscar for best picture in 1981, but this was the greatest film of all time.  Action, drama, humor, and romance all took center stage in this classic about Indiana Jones's race against the Nazis for the biblical lost ark of the covenant.  Twists and turns occur throughout the film until Indiana comes away with the prize Hitler covets most..., or does he?",10,0,0,7 November 2002
Spider-Man," Best SuperHero movie
","This movie had everything:  action, romance, and suspense.  It followed the legend of Spiderman quite well, while adding a few original features of its own.  For those who didn't understand Willem Dafoe's dual character as the Green Goblin, he played it very much like the one in the comic book and cartoons.  This was the best superhero movie I've ever seen.",10,0,0,7 November 2002
