Alien 3," Underrated masterpiece...
","Everyone thinks this movie is a huge disappointment and one of the worst in the series. Are you kidding me? This film is incredible. Not only does it go back to the horror of the first film, it invents new brilliant ideas. Like the Xeynomorph being impregnated in a dog (or cow, depending on which version you see), and taking features of that creature. The setting is incredible. Isolated and eery. The new additional characters are great. Clemens and Dillan are awesome and complex characters that add to the story. Ripley could not be better. Sigourney gives an emotionally empowering performance. I think it's the best she's ever been. The additional conflict with the company is incredible. People who say that there didn't need to be another movie after Aliens don't realize that the conflict with the company wasn't resolved in that film. This film not only expands upon it, but also concludes it in the best possible way. I absolutely love AlienÂ³. My second Favourite in the series. I don't get why people hate this film.",10,6,6,19 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Incredible film...
","I absolutely loved this film. The story is so complex and interesting. It reminded me a lot of Knights of the Old Republic. The twist and turns that occur are insane. The characters are so good. Rey and Kylo are so well written. Daisy and Adam are amazing actors. Finn and Poe were also great. The film is also very emotional and powerful. I'm not gonna lie, I almost cried watching this. The Emperor was handled really well. Much better than Smoke. Not only is his return convincing but also intense and scary. Overall, The Rise of Skywalker is a masterpiece and is one of my favourite Star Wars films. I do not get the hate. Easily the best of the Disney movies.",10,8,16,27 December 2019
Dunkirk," An absolute masterpiece...
","This film really blew me away. It's definitely one of Christopher Nolan's more unique films. It does have his style, but it's told in a frantic intense way. There isn't much room to breathe. And when there is, it's often interrupted by the enemy attacking. One critique I hear a lot from people is that there's no characters. I argue that this film takes into account that these are just individuals a part of a bigger picture. A battle involving multiple people. This film depicts a historical event in small bits to paint a big picture. There may not be character development, but that's because things are happening so quickly. There isn't much time for the characters to sit down and get to know each other. War is fast paced and intense and barely gives room to breathe. And I think this film did a tremendous job in depicting war. This is one of my favourite Christopher Nolan films. Currently my second favourite. It's an absolute masterpiece.",10,1,2,14 August 2019
The Godfather: Part III," Not as bad as everyone says it is...
","Although it does have notible flaws, The Godfather Part III is an incredible film. It continues the story of Michael Corleone and takes it to an all time high. Al Pacino is brilliant. It might be his best performance. The problems this film has are really just pacing issues in the first half of the film, and some dialogue that isn't great. Especially between Vincent and Mary. But these problems don't take a lot away from the movie. Now, is it as good as the first two films? No. Heck no. But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's a worthy final installment that I think is severely underrated.",9,3,5,25 March 2019
