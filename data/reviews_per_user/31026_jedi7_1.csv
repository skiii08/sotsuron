Alien 3," ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","How? Why?  What were these writers thinking?  How can you take a movie like 'Aliens', arguably one of the best movies of all time and in essence ruin everything it stood for!  'Aliens' had a great story and developed characters you really learn to care about.  Then, along comes 'Alien 3.'
When I first saw that another Alien movie was coming out I was extremely excited, being a huge fan of the previous two.  I could not wait to see the continuation of 'Aliens.'  What happened to the survivors, Hicks, Newt, Bishop, and Ripley.  These characters were awesome!  The developing relationships between Hicks and Ripley, and Newt and Ripley really added to the story.  The characters in 'Aliens'  made the movie special.
So what does this piece of garbage 'Alien 3' do?  It kills off the survivors from 'Aliens' and replaces them with awful characters within an awful story. I am hoping and praying that Mr. James Cameron comes aboard to direct Alien 5 to stop the bleeding.  He can pick up where 'Aliens' left off.  Perhaps start it off 20 years later so that he can use the same actors.  Forget that the last two Alien movies even exist.  Just AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!",1,418,458,24 February 2004
