Vertigo," Definitely Worth Seeing
","The story follows a retired detective with an immense fear of heights, which is ultimately used against him in a spine-tingling murder plot hatched by a an old college buddy of Scotty's who wants to be free of his wife. Scooty is hired to follow his friend's wife and is subtly tricked into thinking that the wife is suffering from a delusion that she is another woman who ultimately committed suicide after her child was taken away by a rich and powerful man. Scotty becomes obsessed with his friend's wife, and after she dies, he slips into a silent depression. When he finds a woman who looks very much like the woman that he lost, he seeks to make her over to look like the woman that he lost. The rest of the movie is so good that I'm not even going to share it with you. You're just going to have to see it for yourself.Everything from the shots, to the editing, to the acting, and the direction was wonderful. This film is one of my all-time favorites. It is absolutely irresistible. Anyone who hasn't seen it really should.",10,2,3,11 April 2007
V for Vendetta," Every Vigilante's Dream...
","The plot is like a giant web that connects all the characters and involves them, whether they wish to be involved or not. It is about a hero/villain named V who seeks vengeance against those who hurt and disfigured him. Evey Hammond gets involved in the plot when she tries to visit her boss and is almost hurt by fingermen. V rescues her and brings her with him to the site where he explodes the Old Bailey. After that, she is involved whether she wants to be or not, because the police think she is a suspect.This film is intelligent and engrossing. I always come away from it thinking about the themes of the story and how they pertain to history. While this movie came out in the U.S, there was some talk about how it, and other films, were somehow protesting what the Bush administration was doing. However, I think that anyone who sees this film will get a kick out of it, whether they are the left-wing or right-wing.",9,2,5,11 April 2007
