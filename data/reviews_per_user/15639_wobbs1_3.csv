Hereditary," 4 Stars for the acting only
",Major disappointment. Painfully slow and the story line has been done before. You get to the end and think ... 'Are they kidding. That's it! All that painfully boring lead up for that!'Such a shame as the adult cast was great. The teen actors did an ok job with the script they had. Maybe it's time Hollywood stopped churning out so many rehashed boring horror stories and put more energy into unique well written ones. Quality over quantity!,4,2,4,22 September 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A great change to over complicated sequels
",Loved this film. Belly laughed the whole way through. I have always hated the way many Marvel sequels over complicate themselves with in-depth story lines and rushed introductions of too many characters. This was a refreshing change to the bogged down Avengers and Thor story lines.,7,1,2,31 March 2018
Drive," Wanted it to end after only 15 minutes!!
","This is the first review I have done...and I was so disappointed with this move that I had to get it out of my system! Its the storyline that kills this movie. After the first action driving scene, I was left wondering - ..'surely thats not it.... really...that was an action driving scene ??..' If you are thinking of high action driving movies like the Transporter series (as an example only).... forget it.. this movie is mis-titled and should not be called DRIVE...I cringe when I say this - but I felt this movie was a try hard love story... with some violence thrown in just to try and appease any blokes in the audience...By all means - take a look... but don't expect a big action driving movie like the trailers suggest!! You will be very disappointed...",4,17,33,6 November 2011
