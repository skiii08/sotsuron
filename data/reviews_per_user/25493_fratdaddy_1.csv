The Ring," good movie
","ok, this movie was good, and i understood most of it.  the stuff that i didnt understand i pretty much got from reading the chat boards and all. however, i do have one question that really wasnt addressed that much: where does the little girl come from?  i know that her parents went away and then came back and they had her, but is there any more info that i missed that explains that? also, what is the deal with her?  i know that she is bad and mad at everyone, but why?  is she something like a demon or whatever?",Null,0,0,6 March 2003
