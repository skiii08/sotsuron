The Avengers," Buffy with stubble
","This was far from a bad film but it also wasn't quite a great film. It has spectacular CGI, is funny and each of the characters are well developed (especially The Hulk). There's even a sad emotional moment at one point. Scar Jo is actually quite cool and Loki is a bad guy who you can both sympathise and despise at the same time. I can't actually say anything is particularly bad except maybe The Hawk, I've nothing against the actor but his skills with the arrow seemed a bit out of place with the others. He was like Legolas without the blonde wig. Speaking of blonde's, you could tell the film was done by Joss Whedon as the dialogue was interspersed with quick one liners and the banter between the team was funny (the best bit though was probably when no words were used at all between Hulk and Thor). It must have been difficult to mesh all the characters together and give each of the stars enough screen time to keep them happy. Overall, it's not as good as the Dark Knight but its not meant to be as dark and serious as that, the Dark Knight is a cartoon/comic book character pretending to be a proper film star, the Avengers has film stars pretending to be cartoon/comic book characters and it never takes itself too seriously so is fun to watch.",7,2,6,1 May 2012
Van Helsing," Cartoon Movie
","This isn't a good movie, but it aint particularly bad.The actual premise had potential but the way in which is was realized was so OTT that even the escapist movie goers have trouble believing what they are watching.It took a while for movie makers to get to grips with CGI but now it seems they are using it to gloss over poor storylines and miscast actors/actresses.Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsdale are good actors but Hugh seems to say about 10 words in the movie (and one of them was an embarrassing howl at the end) whilst Kate does well at keeping a straight face while she talks in her 'east European' accent.We now seem to live in a cartoon movie era. I don't mean that allot of the films are based on cartoon characters (i.e. Spiderman, batman) but the actual way the films are made are cartoonish. Dialogue is whittled down to a few choice expletives and catch phrases and the physical action (jumping 50ft doors in a single leap) has reached totally ridiculous levels (even Spiderman thinks twice before swinging from a skyscraper).It may sound daft but there are boundaries to which the average movie goer can reach before coming out of the virtual reality of a film.The trouble with this film is that you snap out of the Helsing reality in the first 10 minutes and end up just smiling wryly through the rest of the film.",Null,0,0,10 May 2004
