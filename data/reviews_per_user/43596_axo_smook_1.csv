The Ring," *******SPOILERS********
","Oh yes, my friends and I have wanted to see this movie for forever, and we finally went last night. I was surprised the actual videotape didn't have anything really scarey in it, even though the first time they showed it my friends and I watched it through our fingers, waiting for something to jump out. But that woman brushing her hair in the mirror was so creepy! ugh. I also liked how eventually the main character saw all the things from the videotape. Very nice. But the guy in the bathtub was just gross. When the girl crawled out of the TV I started shouting at the screen without realizing it and my friends told me later the whole theater was laughing at me. The fact that they were hitting me should have tipped me off. The long hair in front of Samara's face was very nicely done. Added to the creepiness. I was also thinking after the movie how I had never heard that name before, and it is probabley because they wanted to pick some obscure name so no little girl would think she was evil. I didn't like how the movie felt like it ended after she rescued Samara's body from the well. But then again the real ending was very good. But why was Samara in white, and Anne was in black? That was backwards, I thought. As some other reviewer mentioned what was with the clerk at the cabins, I would like to know that, and about the girlfriend of Noah as well. Why did it show her going up there after he died? Maybe to show that if he would have showed her the tape he would have lived. I really liked the room in the barn. And another reviewer mentioned the sounds, and I noticed throughout it sounded like there was a film projecter at different parts in the movies. Hey, how did they get a horse to swim? THAT was scarey, having a horse chasing you. Alright, this review is so random I better end it.",Null,0,0,22 November 2002
