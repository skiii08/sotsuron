Hereditary," Don't waste your time
","All the good reviews must have watched a different film. It took all my will power and persistence not to walk out. Don't believe the hype! The acting is great, as to be expected from the cast. However the story is poor and too slow to develop. A complete waste of an evening!",1,17,40,18 June 2018
Joker," Overrated
","An astonishing performance by Phoenix, however the film as a whole whilst cleverly done is overrated. Worth a watch, but no need to rush.",7,13,31,6 October 2019
Black Panther," Overrated
",To say we were disappointed after all the hype is an understatement. It seems the mainstream are scared to be truthful about it. It had a lot of promise but was poorly executed. Don't waste your money on it.,1,0,1,1 June 2018
