The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A classic
",From start to ending 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is truly captivating and endlessly realistic. This film instantly became one of my favourites and will always remain so. As I have also read the book in which the film is based around I can honestly say that the entire cast play their parts fluently all the way through. A great thing about this film is that it also manages to appeal to an impossibly wide audience as anyone can relate to at least one area of the film. I truly class this film as a classic for its ability to have such a simplistic and realistic plot but yet create such a emotional and memorable response from the viewer.,8,0,0,28 June 2013
