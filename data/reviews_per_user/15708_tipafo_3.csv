Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not the movie I expected.
","I expected more of the same from the last two sequels. I thought those were tripe when they came out. Tasty enough, but tough and chewy, too. I saw 'At World's End' a while back, and while I still think it's overstuffed and over-long, it is at least entertaining.I can't say the same for 'On Stranger Tides'. Compared to the previous three movies, this one is certainly stranger. In a dull way. It's still preposterously plotted and there's plenty o' Jack and a fair bit of Barbosa, but it's only just enough to keep this creaking crate afloat.Even nubile sea nymphs and inanely melodious prose profusely proffered pointedly throughout cannot alleviate the strain of maintaining interest or enthusiasm as the climax climaxes.There is more to come, and oddly I hope it's more like the previous two, wacky and frenetic as they were, and less like this snoozer.",6,2,5,21 May 2011
Valkyrie," 'Valkyrie' ... Gosh, what a beautiful ...
","... tedious waste of 2 hours.Like long long long overhead shots of trees and fields and stuff? Go see 'Valkyrie'.Like long long long lingering shots of the 'one-eyed' Cruisenator? Go see 'Valkyrie'.Like thriller WWII movies that are as thrilling as watching paint dry? Go see 'Valkyrie'.Like watching old old Brits play baffled old old Germans speaking English with solemnity? Go see 'Valkyrie'.If not, skip it.",6,1,12,10 January 2009
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Laughed so hard my face hurt
","I haven't laughed this hard in years. Seriously, tears streaming down my face many times in the first hour. Easily the funniest thing I've seen in theaters in a long time.I'm not generally a fan of Will Ferrel and his brand of comedy, or that of Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, et al, so I was expecting a few chuckles in an extended SNL skit. I will say the last third of this movie drags a bit until the end.The slow down was okay, as it gave me a chance to catch my breath. Just about everything before is brutally hilarious. An odd choice of words, but those kids! An eight may seem high to some, but Talladega Nights was better than I thought it would be. It has a strong group of actors playing their parts straight, a few good race crashes, and just plain funny writing.Unlike most trailers, which often highlight the best the movie has to offer, 'Help me, Tom Cruise!' is not the funniest part of this movie.",8,0,3,12 August 2006
