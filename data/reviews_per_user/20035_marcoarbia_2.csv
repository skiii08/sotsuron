Hereditary," Never in my life i felt this terror
","It was the first time in my life i thought about leaving the theatre during a projection. About an half an hour through i couldn't feel my hands anymore and i started sweating and having tachycardia. I don't know how i menaged to keep it together till the end. Somehow i did. 
Never in my life, i felt this terrorized by a movie. Saying to myself that it was all fake it didn't help. It felt so real, and it gripped me with real fear, not shallow one given by lame tricks like jumpscares. 
Everything in this movie is masterfully crafted to transmit this feeling of unease and dread and hell i felt it. It really got to me and i'm sure it will stick for quite some time. 
I'm not sure i'm happy about that.",10,2,6,18 June 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Groundbreaking
","I cried, i cheered, i laughed, i screamed. I was utterly absorbed by this three hour epic conclusion, by all it's characters and their relationships beetween one another.
Groundbreaking.",10,1,3,26 April 2019
