The New World," Better editing needed, but beautiful film
","There's a lot of gratuitous visual footage in this film, and better editing would have made it more bearable through the first and middle parts. Quite frankly it got boring. There's time when such cinematic styles work and times when they do not, and i felt they did not with this film. The acting is OK, there's no great performances here. This is a bit puzzling as the cast is pretty good, i would have expected more but i feel the acting was hampered a bit by the tone the film set. After it picks up its entertaining... but if you are looking for historical representation you may just want to read the real accounts. Once i got over the standard Hollywood stereotypes it got better. Take it for a fun, fictional ride and not a historical drama and you should be fine.",6,1,2,10 May 2010
