The King's Speech," A King of a Movie
","Very few films leave me speechless, especially one about a speech! I rarely give 10 out of 10 but this is a must see film. Its a piece of History of a time when the King did mean something important. The film starts with a speech from King George V delivering to the Nation a Christmas message and culminates in a speech of far more importance as Britain goes to War. Not only is the story true, but it is delivered on screen as a cinematic gem, the acting is unsurpassed, Colin Firth who plays Bertie (George VI) suffers with a stammer and a lack of confidence. As the story unfolds he reluctantly visits Lionel (Geoffrey Rush)a speech therapist and a commoner, the relationship between the two men that develops is told with brilliance, As Bertie struggles to come to terms with the fact he could be King watching his Father dying and his brother develop a relationship with Wallis Simpson . Bertie therefore struggles with his stammer and the fact that what could be expected of him he will fall short on to deliver- there is humour and pathos and the audience is treated to a slice of history, we witness how the Government and Royal Family function in unison. As George V dies and Edward succeeds him to the throne, we witness how it is Edward who is not prepared to take on the responsibility of being King, being flamboyant and disinterested in the role. It is when Edward abdicates and Berie is reluctantly forced into the role that we see what the film had portrayed magnificently well. We see how It is Bertie who through his bravery to tackle his impediment and come to terms with being in the shadow of his Father and brother; that has grown in confidence and stature and we owe a great debt to a man that nobody had heard of (till now), pushed the future King to realise he was capable of being King. Apologies for the spoiler - but a moment of magic is when the KIng's advisor's have decided that Lionel is not suited to treat the King and Lionel gives a wonderful account of why he is. (in the middle of Westminster Abbey) - Pure acting and wonderful. There will be countless accolades bestowed on this film, well after I have written this. Suffice to say Colin Firth should receive an Oscar, the film should receive one too. This is truly the King of films. A Gem and one that will have you go through every emotion and feel uplifted when you have seen it. I intend to watch it again as I loved it.",10,12,22,13 January 2011
3:10 to Yuma," The best western since Unforgiven
","I read the comments earlier prior to watching this movie and they were spot on. The acting is fantastic and Oscar worthy performances throughout. It deserves best film but whether this is up for Oscars come next year who is to say, it should be and best supporting actor easily by Ben Foster who plays the ruthless gang member on the trail of his captured boss Ben Wade (Russel Crowe). His performance was the most memorable as he exhibits the resolute qualities of his captured boss. Both the antagonist and protagonist roles are well played. A well crafted and intelligent screenplay which makes for the best film since Unforgiven. Like Unforgiven it doesn't set out to show good guys as flawless and bad guys without some sensitivity. Ben Wade (Russel Crowe) exhibits all the wile and cunning of a fox to escape his captors and it is towards the end he shows a different side to that which he plays so well throughout the film. Another case in point Byron Mcelroy (Petre Fonda) who is on the good side. It is soon apparent that he is as ruthless as those he intends to bring to justice and those who are justice are equally as ruthless in other ways as the story unfolds. Only Dan Evans (Christain Bale) has any credibility as the suppressed rancher. As the story unfolds the twists in the story make the film intense and thoroughly enjoyable. It will stand out as a classic and hopefully be the revival of the western. If it is I hope for more of the same intelligently written well acted and Oscar worthy westerns. Lets hope it is nominated and gains the recognition to put it up there with Unforgiven.",9,2,4,8 November 2007
Child 44," IMDb 6.4 seems low
","There are many mixed reviews for this film but I am of the opinion its one of the best thrillers in 2015 so far, great acting throughout, there are some disjointed scenes and the story appears to lose track of itself mid way but then picks up. I recommend it worthy of a watch Tom Hardy is simply the best out there at the moment hes played some really good parts lately and this is just another to add to his CV. As its a trilogy by Tom Rob Smith I can only hope the next two get better similar to Hunger Games, having said that the film had my attention throughout the 137 minutes and that is what I hope to witness when I go to the cinema. If you enjoy thrillers you will enjoy this",8,8,14,4 August 2015
Fury," War is hell and Fury shows it
","I once served in an Armoured Regiment and found a tank claustrophobic, but the comradrie and team spirit second to none and so I found that to a degree in Fury - I was so fortunate not to go to war, but I would bet that it was very much as this film depicts, the closest I think you can get to what it must have felt like to come up against a German Tiger tank- There is a lot to admire about this film , yes there are some aspects that may not feel believable and some things that are cliché - but having seen it and been dead sceptical at first- I was shocked and still feel numb as it is the first time I have watched a war film of this genre and felt- Yes that is what would have happened; there was no sentiment for the Nazis and on reflection I imagine having fought through battles watching comrades die and the Nazis still not giving in that you would hate them and let them know it - The cast were magnificent, there wont be any Oscars as there are no niceties but each played their role convincingly Pitt plays a leader who wont give up and those that follow remind me of when I served - I would have followed my Tank Sergeant to certain death even if I knew deep down it may be the last time on earth and the remaining cast displayed exactly that ethos",9,7,16,10 November 2014
Argo," Another piece of history brought to life
","What a great film, I agree with a lot that has already been written it is a masterful piece of cinema making - having seen Lincoln earlier this week; Argo was yet another film telling a piece of history and telling it well. The film feels like it is being shown as it happened the authenticity of getting that 70s feel reminds me of the 70's. Mr Afleck should be rewarded with Best Director come the Oscars He is great at film making I loved the last two outings very different films but brilliant Gone Baby Gone and The Town. I cant wait to see what he brings out next as i know I'll be enthralled, entertained and on this occasion educated. I just felt gripped by the movie as the story unfolded and having little knowledge of what was to come the tension and the twists and turns in the story were so well done that at times I felt I was there feeling all the emotions that these 6 Canadians must have felt at the time. That is great film making three cheers to Mr Afleck",9,0,1,28 December 2012
Alexander," disjointed and a missed opportunity to make an epic
",I am staggered that anyone could find something amazing to say about this film. I sat for the full 3 hours and was very disappointed that a story that could have been turned into an epic was so disjointed that it became confusing. It was rather like watching a decorator putting up wallpaper without having a clue where it is supposed to go and at what angle or what colour in the confusion it becomes a distorted mess. I was looking forward to the battle scenes in the anticipation that they would make the film worthwhile sitting through the rest of the dialogue but sadly again a missed opportunity. The battle scenes didn't save it either. Unlike Gladiator where you could understand why Maximus takes the course of action he does to win a battle and demonstrates his leadership; or even more recently TROY where Achilles demonstrates why he was deemed a god and shows his leadership. Sadly in Alexander- Alexander states his intentions much to the surprise and shock of his generals- states what he intends to do but then we really cannot see how he achieves this. When flashbacks are thrown in during the film without a clue as to there relevance at that time it takes on epic proportions instead of becoming an epic for the right reasons! How Oliver Stone never took the golden opportunity of making this into an epic and taking a leaf from Gladiator and Troy in making it thus is beyond me. I am no super director but I am sure I could have made a better effort on the budget available. My only praise is for Anthony Hopkins who narrates well and makes an attempt (probably without his knowledge) to piece this disjointed effort together.,3,6,11,31 January 2005
Midnight in Paris," A Tapestry of brilliance
","Where has he been - Woody Allen? I thought he'd retired but I would just like to think he was having a rest before bringing out this gem of a movie and it is a gem. Well up there and surpassing Annie Hall The main protagonist Gil (Owen Wilson) plays his role superbly (as well as the great cast that Woody Allen always seems to find and take from roles you had normally seen them in to roles you would never imagine they could perform)- he essentially has come to Paris with his fiancé and her parents who are as materialistic about life as well as being insincere. Gil wants inspiration to write a book and his fiancé just wants to buy half of France! But at Midnight in Paris Gil is transported back in time to meet all his idols writers and musicians and painters and he re thinks his book and re thinks his life as a consequence. As the story develops nicely before our eyes we see how he struggles with his present relationship and the one he imagines in the past. The film has everything humour, poignant moments and above all is thought provoking. Simply Woody Allen at his best a possible Oscar Candidate and a Tapestry of brilliance.",Null,2,4,14 October 2011
Black Mass," What just happened?
","I have to say I was disappointed. I watched with greater expectations than I should have. The film failed to engage my interest (that doesn't mean it wont engage someone else's)I had seen Legend recently which was a far better production and Tom Hardy superb; so films with a Gangster theme appear to be prominent this year. This film also based on a true story was far grittier and didn't glamorise the actions of those that the film portrays - Johnny Depp is almost unrecognisable as Whitey Bulger which the film is essentially about. This could have been a brilliant film instead it is a collaboration of scenes mismatched together threaded together to make some sense which it fails to do as you don't connect to the characters in it; becoming ordinary and pedestrian instead of gripping your attention as say characters in the Departed which has been often referred to in reviews. I agree with a previous reviewer that had more emphasis been put on the development of the characters from childhood Whitey Bulger, John Connoly and Billy Bulger (brother and senator) and how this then transformed into later life this would have been a really good film as it is, it is worth watching but don't break a leg to do so. It also fails in the final 30 minutes as it doesn't show us how we get to the bringing the gang down - it simply just happens! there is no tension or how it all unravels. Watch the Departed on DVD for a real gripping film and Legend for better acting and a better presented story.",5,2,2,8 October 2015
Baby Driver," The MUST SEE movie of 2017 (so far)
","Absolutely brilliant - great car chases synced to music- Its like all the driver movies put together and True Romance thrown in. Ryan Gosling and Ryan O Neil move over as Ansel Elgort has come to steal your plinth . I'll not spoil it with lots of detail its a MUST SEE movie it keeps you entertained from start to finish - its high octane, great music from all genres and the supporting cast of Foxx and Spacey are brilliant too. throw in Eiza Gonzales and Lily James and it adds a little bit more to the mix - loved the film maybe a sequel? may be not they tend to spoil things maybe a prequel though that could be interesting - well worth seeing again me thinks!!",9,15,28,4 July 2017
Silver Linings Playbook," Wow - best film of the year - very emotional
",I have to agree with a number of the comments on this film - meggz3 put it exactly as I wanted to write it and I probably wouldn't do a better job of it as she or he has- I have to say I was blown away the acting was brilliant throughout by a sterling cast. Robert De Nero playing the OCD father deserves a best supporting actor and Jennifer Lawrence just gets better in every film and of course Bradley Cooper is just great - So many films will get the tip and the wink for the Oscar above this but that doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to be right up there with them. The superlatives for this film will still be going on about this gem of a movie well after the Oscars and I for one will be seeing it again because I fell in love with Jennifer Lawrence too! I don't want to say too much as I don't want to be blacklisted- but to play a role that is as difficult as somebody who has mental illness issues and to be as convincing is something else- but when two people do (an actor and actress) it is mind blowing - For me it is the best film of the year and I have seen most of the films that are in contention for Oscars- what they deliver in the most part is special effects or a history lesson or simply good old fashioned violence. But this film delivers comedy and romance in equal measures that leave you elated at the end and that is exactly how you want to leave a cinema experience I would be even more elated if this gem got best picture but I can dream,9,1,4,12 January 2013
Dunkirk," Where were the 400,000 men on a beach
","I cant conclude that this was a masterpiece or an epic - it most certainly wasn't - There are a few reviews on here that match my sentiment - the editing was poor several stories come together but are done almost ad hoc with a scene being almost a flashback to a previous scene where a plane that was shot down is then shot down again as part of a different story within the same story (if that makes sense). I watched the 1958 version of Dunkirk and it had more intensity than this the fear of the daily bombing and fear of drowning, fear of not getting off the beach alive - well that intensity was lacking in this there appeared to be a few hundred men on a beach who were occasionally attacked by 3 stucka dive bombers there were moments when you wanted something to happen and when it did you wondered what the hell it was about as there would be no dialogue. I felt like screaming what did you spend £150 millions on. It could have been so much more, special effects could have had thousands on a beach not a random selection of soldiers here and there there could have been more little boats coming towards Dunkirk. However, some things were done well the ship saving men and then only to be sunk again. Showing the desperation to survive and the cost of that survival. The spitfire scenes where we learnt something of what the RAF learnt in aerial combat that prepared them for the battle to come and the crew of the little boat and how they epitomised the spirit of Dunkirk - that was done exceptionally well but I was very disappointed about the rest and don't expect to see Oscars where there was little dialogue to deserve such.",4,20,35,25 July 2017
1917," One hell of a cinematic experience
",I can only add what the majority of people have said which is to say awesome breathtaking rollercoaster ride through hell. This is a movie that must be seen and must be seen on the biggest screen. And prepare to be immersed in what has to be said the cinematic experience of the year. This has to seen by the young generation now so they can witness what many of their age sacrificed for freedom and democracy. Their comradeship and the sense of duty. This film had me gripped from beginning to end with some superb performances and worthy of oscars. I would also add as an ex serving soldier that I was impressed with the attention to details although there were some goofs notably pointed out on the site. I would also like to add that this was my feeling and if someone else doesnt feel the film was that good thats there opinion when they then decide to call people names because they dont aspire to their point of view they demean themselves and there review should not be posted - Can IMBD ensure that people posting comments have some decency and respect for people s opinion even if it doesnt reflect theirs and refrain from calling people cretins and brainless,9,8,12,12 January 2020
Lincoln," Its a film I can say I learnt something
","I found the film heavy going but not being an American found that I was watching History and that was something I really did enjoy as I watched the film unfold and how Lincoln was a very clever and masterful politician in achieving the goal of the 13th Amendment (abolishment of slavery) and how he did that against a background of negativity and prejudice. This is not a film for the faint hearted already 150 minutes long and very heavy in dialogue throughout. It is a very intense film and focuses well on the build up to the 13th amendment which was written into the American constitution which goes to the heart of the American psyche. Spielberg draws out an acting Masterclass from some worthy actors and Sally Field as Mrs Lincoln comes out strong in a mainly male environment. Daniel Day Lewis appears to have been born to play the part come Oscar time if he hasn't won Best Actor I wonder how he could be beaten on this performance he is head and shoulders above anyone else. I go to the cinema to be enthralled, mesmerised or educated, on this occasion I was educated - I don't feel that I know everything about Lincoln what i do know he was a great American and what he achieved and what he stood for is something that Americamns can be proud of- Spielberg does a good job in that sense sadly he uses a few too many clichés but he does a great job of evoking pride in a Nation that now has a Black President.",8,0,2,28 December 2012
The Imitation Game," Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.
","Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine. This statement is made three times during the film at the most poignant times in it. This is a well crafted film and though the film is essentially based on Alan Turing it doesn't overshadow the fact that Alan Turing cracked the Enigma code with a small team that helped win the war. It is also difficult to imagine that once upon a time in history to be a homosexual was a death sentence and it highlights also that woman were not allowed to go for or to do what was considered a mans job. I go to the cinema to be entertained, thrilled, shocked try and guess the ending to a thriller or to be educated. The film accomplishes most of that; but its the revelation that one of the Worlds greatest mathematicians and greatest minds at the time whose commitment to breaking Enigma and pioneered the modern age of the computer was treated so appalling in the end and it is a story that must be told and it is told here without patronising its audience. And Joan Clarke (played by Kiera Knightley maybe not as convincingly as the rest of the ensemble cast ) highlights just how hard it was for a woman with intelligence and Alan Turing's' vision to establish herself as an equal- Today it is almost incomprehensible that we would treat people with such disdain and so callously because of their sexual orientation or indeed women as badly - although women are still not treated as equal in some quarters-",9,9,16,16 November 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Masterpiece get busy living or get busy dying
","This is not just a Prison film epic it is more than that - I feel its understated calling it a Masterpiece but it truly is. Rarely has a film stayed as long as it has at the top of the IMBD tree but there has been nothing since to compare. I have seen it a few times now and as I grow older it still feels as fresh watching again as it did the first time, only this time the way in which scenes are weaved together makes it even more enjoyable you watch and witness the characters grow and the story become more believable. How Prison would institutionalise and dehumanise a person and how that the main Character Andy Dufrane overcomes all this and brings hope - Its a masterpiece because you cannot watch it and feel for each character and see Red's redemption and come away feeling invigorated for the experience. The tarring of the roof, Brooks suicide the p\role hearings for Red and the most important part Hope - it truly inspires you feel that get busy living or get busy dying is such a powerful message in the end,.",10,1,1,10 March 2020
Parasite," Not a masterpiece but brilliant nevertheless
",I didnt get carried away it was a brilliantly crafted film showing the haves as a bit dense and the have not far more clever but because they had to be. It had brilliant twists and turns and deserves all the accolades. But best film. No. Films that should get best film are those you should visit a cinema for get the whole experience. Parasite will be remarkable on DVD which some films lose that cinematic experience that's why I don't rate it as 10 but that's me and I respect those that think otherwise.,8,2,8,13 February 2020
Prometheus," Failien
","What a disappointment- the long awaited prequel never really grips and lacks the suspense and drama of the original movie. With Ridley Scott back in the helm, there were great expectations there are some moments but they never hold your attention long enough and you keep wondering when is it going to take off when is there going to be any suspense as to what the deadly creature may do or look like or whatever- When action happens; it just happens no build up to it. A film that has great visual and stunning effects but lacks the ingredient that made Alien so excellent- with Alien you were kept on the edge of the seat you wondered what was around the corner. sadly this film you couldn't care less what was around the corner by the time it ends you are pretty well glad the credits are rolling. Sad really, really, sad a great ensemble cast but the script was written in a tea break, the best line concerns a female proving she isn't a robot.",4,4,8,11 June 2012
The Water Diviner," True events? more like Contrived
","The main problem with this movie is it opens with the premise based on true events and that is where the credulity of the audience is truly tested because the only true events is the battle of Gallipoli itself from then on in events take on an unbelievable journey. – The Director and writers must have thought how do I sell this better as its just another war film? I know say its based on true events – its how the Coens got away with making Fargo claiming it was based on a true story which it was later revealed was nonsense. However, like Fargo, the Water Diviner is a well made and well acted piece and worthy of praise for at least having a story albeit contrived. First we have a Father who travels to the Dardanelles to find his three sons presumed killed in action and he his thwarted in his efforts to go officially so unofficially turns up and as the ANZACs go to send him away a Turkish Major whom he later befriends changes their minds. The story then becomes even more contrived from then on in and I feel disappointed that it isn't true because there is nothing more than I would like for it to be so, as it is beautiful shot, there is a degree of realism in the barbaric nature of war. The battle scenes are gritty and a testament to many young men who thought and died for their Country. This film should be remembered for the fact that many men died for many Countries in the First World War and many families never had peace of mind to know whether their sons or Fathers survived as they were lost presumed dead and it is a fact that one such Father did try to establish where his son was killed at Gallipoli.",8,3,9,3 April 2015
Alien: Covenant," The tension absent and the action comes and goes to quick
",I had been eagerly anticipating this movie-there was a lot of things written to suggest it would be better than Prometheus. It took a while to get going and then when it did it slowed down again. Michael Fassbender playing both David and Walter was a revelation - the man can act. I was gripped by his performance and equally Katherine Waterstones performance as Daniels. There was a certain chemistry between Daniels and Walter that kept you rooting for them as things went pear shaped. Daniels is no Ripley but you sense she could develop into that role. The aliens were well like all the other alien films and after a while the scare factor isn't there - the tension doesn't come across as well as the original and there are some truly remarkably silly scenes in this one scene with Oram enticed by David (whose character is clearly a spiteful and vengeful one)-you are left thinking how did he fall for that really?? It just didn't do it and if another instalment does come along I do hope that its better- Sadly the Alien franchise has been done to death. Aliens 2 being the best gripping tense and full of action -for many parts of this latest instalment the action had come and gone before you had time to blink,5,0,6,23 May 2017
