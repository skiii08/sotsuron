Source Code," Fentress - Man in the Mirror
","This was another composite movie of the 'Time Machine' - Rod Taylor, 'Butterfly Effect' - Aston Kutcher, 'Out of Time' - Denzel Washington, etc.I was okay with the concept that after death of the body the brain waves remain active and the source code takes advantage of that energy. However, I think that the person who should have been on life support should have been the man in the mirror and not the face of Stevens. It would have been a kind of modern Frankenstein as the soul-looking like Stevens was transferred into the body of Fentress. In that way, the audience would realize how successful the Source Code was in that the soul-looking like Stevens lived on the body of Fentress. I got that if the body of Fentress met its death that the full completion of that source would be terminated and both the soul-looking like Stevens and the man in the mirror would cease to exist.Perhaps I just missed something but somehow not utilizing the image of Fentress was in the end as bad as the mistake of 'The Notebook' where we are given the image of the dark haired - clean shaven James Garner as Lon rather than the image of Ryan Goslin as Noah - dirty blonde - scruffy beard.Again, perhaps I just missed something and have no business writing reviews, but then again maybe I think too much about the devil in the details.",5,0,1,8 June 2011
Revolutionary Road," Eyes that cannot see...
","It would seem this couple lived in the backwoods of Appalachia rather than the Connecticut suburbs of New York City. New York City in the 1950's was hardly a period of dearth of intellectual, artistic, political and social change. The movie requires the audience to suspend time and actually believe April was so close-minded she could not get a driver's license or take the railroad into The City - The Big Apple ! Man. However, we are expected to believe she was itching to blaze trails and live the good life in beautiful Paris! Hey, there is a really apt expression that fits her situation : 'Where ever you go there you are.' She was infantile, narcissistic, and worse a coward. I would have had more respect for her had she simply gotten on the plane and sent him a letter with a picture of her standing in the Louvre Museum or sitting at an open air caf√© drinking a glass of milk! It occurred to me that in 'Titanic' - DiCaprio died and here Winslet does. Perhaps in their next movie together they can die together or couple in a modern version of 'Dead Again' made by Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh - this might work out the bad karma at long last - breaking the energy of star-crossed lovers who happen to be Libra (Winslet) and Scorpio (DiCaprio). LOL.It is safe to say I did not 'like' the movie.",1,12,21,13 June 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," A Composite Movie
","I am a movie nut. All things weird and unusual that play on the idea of true love and the required personal sacrifices to ensure the feeling is not lust is not easily conveyed in a movie. Having said that, this movie, in my opinion, was a composite of themes from 'City of Angels' - library and angels, 'The Matrix' - the agents and entry doors, a little bit of the 'The Butterfly Effect' - personal sacrifice, and 'The Wizard of Oz' - nothing scary behind the curtain! The implied sex was tasteful in an old fashioned romance way that did not come across as gratuitous as say in 'Blue Valentine'. Perhaps, having been married for 21 years has created an intimate buffer zone that rejects voyeristic sex. In other words, sexually adjusted people - married or not - do not need to see other people having sex. This was a movie that could be watched with a 16 year old child and discussed afterward without the awkward in-the-face sex seemingly thrown into so many movies these days. I enjoyed the effort Damon's character exerted to have the woman of his dreams - the soul mate - the best friend - the true kiss, and the ability of Elise to trust him and herself to go through the doors. For the 50 year old set, hard-core sex does not intimate-sensuality make, and more movies should provide the essence of innocence in 'the first time' experience, even if it is the 30th first time - sex should not be depicted as a handshake - but must always be forever the mystery of 'other-worldly possibilities' !",10,3,6,6 June 2011
Footloose," Sinner Man (Nina Simone)
","Stevie Wonder (Songs in the Key of Life, 1976) remained the Music Maestro even after the King of Pop coronation (Thriller, 1983).I was 27 when the one-and-only-Kevin-Bacon danced his way into the hearts of the then-still-corny-by-proxy-pop-music-not-rap-not-as-good-as Michael Jackson's 1983 Moonwalk. Just as Michael Jackson was the Moonwalk, Kevin Bacon was Footloose - two different pleasures enjoyed at different times in our lives because music and dancing became the best of friends and the best of lovers.Stevie Wonder is The First Love. Same goes for Jennifer Holliday (And I'm Telling You), Minnie Ripperton (1981) and Mr. Robert Nesta Marley (1981).... First Love and First Dance. Michael Jackson is the First Dance. Sade reminded us 'Its Never As Good as the First Time' taking me back to Stevie Wonder and the First Love and if one is very lucky another First Dance.Footloose (1984) is the Last Dance before the party ends.There is no point to the party of Footloose (2011), there is no sinner, man.",Null,0,4,14 November 2011
