Black Swan," This is why we love 7th art
","It took me 10 years to see the movie, so I come without hype and without prejudice.
Watching this movie was a beautiful chaotic experience, in the last minutes my hands were sweating.",9,0,0,22 April 2020
500 Days of Summer," Don't kill a good movie with your concept 'Manic Pixie Dream Girl' Just Don't
",What is wrong with us today? That nonsense mania of wanting to categorize everything. The concept it's okey for some film but in this case it does not fix. Summer is not an empty soul. Is not flat. Is not boring.,10,1,3,28 April 2020
Lost in Translation," What does this film great? THE CRITICS
","I am very sure not to be heartless. I waited a long time to see this movie and I think I had too many expectations.
I can say that it is sad to see how the critic sells a mediocre film and makes us pass it off as the best.
And it is very sad that other productions with a similar theme( depress, sadness, course of our lifes) and in fact well carried out do not have the recognition they deserve, but of course it is Sofia Coppola, they sell her film no matter what.",6,0,2,13 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino just wanted to treat himself.
","Many minutes left.
Don't say it's a masterpiece or people didn't understand it.
I saw this movie twice in the cinema and I don't think I will do it again.
Not remarcable at all.",7,1,2,2 June 2020
Joker," Works like a Clock
","Take the next ingredients :
<ul><li>The King of Comedy</li><li>Requiem for a Dream</li><li>The Dark Knight</li><li>Taxi Driver</li></ul>Mix all of these and then ladys and gentlemans we have : Joker .",8,6,9,7 November 2019
Wonder Woman," I have no seen it and I won't, Just boasting
","I'm here to be the envy of you who wasted hours seing a crap, I mean we already knew it's crap just don't needed to check it.",7,5,9,29 April 2020
Raging Bull," Good but not great
","Okey it's a very beautiful film with that outstanding photography and bloody rage fights.
It's just hard to enjoy , bacause the script is so flat.
Best de Niro's performance? No, in taxi driver and king of comedy is way better.
Best Scorcece's work? Neither
Usually biography films gets more that they deserve, just a tendency.",7,1,1,19 April 2020
