Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Spectacular storyline
","The Phantom Menace was pure story, brilliantly written, and not 'dumbed-Down' to meet todays usual coffee.  The story line follows that of young Anakin Skywalker on his desent into Darth Vader.The effects and actors blend well together with dazzling brilliance. Unfortunately, we don't learn much about the many wonderful characters.  We can only ask for  a  little more character development in Episode II.All in all, a well done masterpiece.  Avoid expectations, and simply sit back for the ride.",Null,0,0,20 June 1999
