The Sound of Music," I think this movie rocks!
","It isn't like modern movies. It shows the characters having fun, falling in love, and singing. Some might think it's the most boring movie because it has cheesy lines and corny jokes, but I think it doesn't because I think it doesn't have cheesy lines, but I think some of the jokes are corny. If I thought it was boring, I wouldn't have watched it countless times already. You might be thinking, 'She's obsessed with this movie,' but I'm not. If you aren't thinking that, good for you! I might be a little obsessed because I've made a remake list, but I'm not really that obsessed. Well, like this comment is titled, I think this movie rocks!",10,1,8,30 July 2005
