The Blair Witch Project," Some people said that was a real thing. Why was the casting necessary then? Yes, it is a movie, a bad movie.
","1 hour and many minutes spent from my life totally useless. Scary movie??? For who? Is wasn't scary even with my headphones at maximum. I watched it only because a friend of mine saw it and she was under the impression that was a real thing. Believe me, dear stupid girl, it was a movie with an original idea, but with a bad idea. Think that. ONLY if that was a real thing it would be some interesting, but if the movie would have only 30 minutes. Yes, indeed, is about the feeling of the teenagers in a strange situation, but is far to be good. Too many words wasted on that. Don't watch this crap unless you want to be sure that is how i said. P.S. 22 minutes of blackness with hysterical voices... who will watch that?",1,7,13,7 October 2005
