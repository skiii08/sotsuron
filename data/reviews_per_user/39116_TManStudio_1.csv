The Rock," Awesome!
","The Rock is a non-stop action movie of the highest caliper. From beginning to end, for almost two and a half hours, this movies has you enthralled. There are so many things going on and so much action that you couldn't really get any better. Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage work extremely well together, both being top actors. Ed Harris, plays a disgruntled Marine Corps Major General to a tee. Simpson and Bruckheimer have really pushed the envelope of the action/adventure genre with this collaboration. I rate this movie as a 10 for a few reasons, one being the intensity of the movie and two, the actors' ability to bring the parts together so well.",10,2,3,24 April 2004
