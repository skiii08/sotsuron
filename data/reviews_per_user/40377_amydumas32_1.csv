The Ring," To Disturbing!
","Talk about a disappointing movie! When I went to the Theaters I had high hopes that this movie would be as scary as The Sixth Sense, but I turned out to be a disturbing movie. The plot itself is all tangled up. I think the only thing you really understand is after you watch THE TAPE you have seven days to live before you die.*SPOILERS*The only parts that scared really scared me was when the horse fell off the ferry and died and when the little girl crawled out of the well and then crawls out of the TV and kills Noah. Aside from it being disturbing there is not real plot at the end. I don't recommend this movie to anyone unless you like disturbing movies.",3,0,1,22 March 2003
