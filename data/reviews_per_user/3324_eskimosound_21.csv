It," Better than the 1990 version
","So it's good, very good.
Pennywise is brilliantly scary and it knocks the socks off the 1990 version.
It's not as good as IT 2...that's great.
But worth a watch",9,1,3,18 January 2020
Dead Poets Society," Inspiring...
","This movie changed my life, from the haunting soundtrack to the Carpe Diem attitude. It's wonderfully cast and a total inspiration. I bought the original script and the ending was a lot different, I will allow Google to enlighten you. There's a handful of movies you should watch in your lifetime and this is one of them. God Bless Robin Williams...",10,1,1,17 June 2020
The Terminator," Fantastic Movie...
","Arnold Schwarzenegger is brilliant as The Terminator.
The movie is excellent, amazingly believable (yeah I know it sounds mad) and very well produced.
I'm sure it scared all the Sarah Conner's out there!!
Hey and Nike created a sneaker called Terminator.
It's an Icon. Must be on your watch list along with all the others that follow, they are all brilliant.",10,0,0,5 May 2020
Ready Player One," Excellent Movie!!
","There's a reason why Spielberg is such a good director and this just makes him shine.
I can't imagine how complicated this was to shoot let alone act.
It's a fantastic achievement and glorious movie.
Spielberg at his best.
A must watch..",10,0,2,21 December 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Finally a decent Spiderman Movie..
","This is easily the best Spiderman Movie...by far.
It's just more believable, the acting is great, the casting equally. You can just relate to it, it's more honest and not concieted.
Keep it up..",10,0,0,21 December 2018
The Beach," One of My Favourite Movies...
","This a great movie, it captures a time in life when you want to go explore and think you've got all the answers. It's excellently acted by the entire cast, morally disturbing and has a great soundtrack...will take you back to your travelling days...a must watch.",10,0,1,1 June 2020

2001: A Space Odyssey," Must Watch Masterpiece...
","So there's a lot of hype about this movie and I must say it's well deserved.
It looks amazing considering its age, fabulous sets and sound....
Once you get past the Chimpanzees the story starts unless of course you speak Chimp. In which case I have missed about 30mins of the plot.
I do remember falling asleep when I went to watch this at the cinema but I was only young!!
Came out before Star Wars and is a lot more adult.
Look out for Leonard Rossiter...
Daisy... Daisy.... give me your answer do...",10,0,0,12 April 2020

Joker," Stunning Masterpiece
","I am amazed and in awe.
Sad, realistic portrayal of a Serial Killer.
Set in the Batman Universe.
It's brilliantly filmed and wonderfully acted.
It's just horrible...like it should be.
A great addition to the Batman movies.
And lastly it should win a heap of awards including best actor, screenplay et al....",10,3,6,10 December 2019
It Chapter Two," Excellent/Brilliant
","Brilliant sequel.
Solid cast, great effects, good plot.
This is the best IT movie by miles.... and the cameo by Stephen King is genius.
You must watch this movie!",10,1,1,18 January 2020
Mary and Max," Fantastic Animated Feature...
","Adam Elliot is a modern day animation genius. His stories are fascinating, his art excellent and style impeccable. All of his animations have been brilliant, may he go on to make the other two features in his head and the last of the Krumpet/Biscuit trilogy. This feature should have won another Oscar. I hope his next ones do.
Best of luck Adam if you ever read these.",10,0,0,12 March 2020

The Deer Hunter," One of the best movies ever made...
","This movie is so good it's like a documentary.
From the haunting soundtrack to the seminal acting.
It's a movie you can watch over and over and it becomes personal.
It really is one of the best movies ever made.
De Niro and Walken are beyond amazing.
A must see for everyone on the planet.",10,0,0,31 March 2020
Am√©lie," Beautiful....
","What a beautiful movie, it's a complete artists canvas filled with beautiful colours and shapes. Its fluid and living camera work swirls round like the air. The filters they use are gorgeous, one long advert. Amelie is herself beautiful as is the charming story.
Breathtaking filmmaking.",10,0,0,7 May 2020
The Truman Show," Fabulous...
","It's a great concept brilliantly achieved. Carey is excellent, the movie a joy.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," This Is The Best Movie Ever Made
","Everyone alive should be made to watch this.
It's incredible.
May The Force Be With You.",10,2,2,1 April 2020
The Wizard of Oz," Amazing..
","This is an incredible movie....
The colour is super saturated because they actually shot on 3 movie cameras 1 Red producing a Red image, 1 producing a Blue and the last producing a Green image then overlayed them all...(yeah I know it's more complicated than that but hey..)
Then there's the make up, the silver they put on the Tin Man was toxic as was the Green on the Witch..the Tin Man actor had to be replaced as it was so bad and both the new actor and the Witch became ill during production...the Witch caught on fire when one of the pyrotechnic explosions went wrong..then the flying monkeys injured themselves when the flying wires broke...Toto the dogs paw was broken when it got stepped on....oh and the Snow is asbestos!!!!!!
Regardless of all the behind the scenes shenanigans, its an incredible piece of art, basically a long Stage Play filmed..it's still great to this day..",10,0,0,14 May 2020
The Godfather," Great Acting...
","Great Acting dreadful editing.
It's one of those must see movies but its just over rated.
Watch the horse's head scene and see how badly edited it is...terrible seeing as everyone holds it in such high regard. Wobbly sound and out of focus cuts throughout. Coppola should be ashamed.",2,2,8,21 December 2018
