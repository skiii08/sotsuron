Ford v Ferrari," High octane all the way
","I wasn't sure about this film at first, i thought it was going to be a bit of a documentary style film, well how wrong was i & i am so glad i did go to see it, it's nothing short of edge of your seat stuff, the actors bounce of of each other & it just rolls along & did make me laugh a lot,Tremendous effort on the part of all, well directed good camera work & quite beautiful in parts. not going to say anymore apart from i judge a film by this, do i want this film in my collection,,,,,,,,..oh yes.",10,1,4,14 March 2020
