Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," U.S. hating liberals and world-inexperienced college kids will love it
","The movie is very insulting. In fact it's one great big insult to US Citizens made by a non-US Citizen. I wish I hadn't spent my money to see what the fuss was about, it's really not that funny. While I did laugh at some parts (the reaction of the naked men running in the hotel was a low-brow high point), most of it was somewhat banal. Most of the comedy is suppose to be derived out of Borat making Americans look like unfriendly new-yorkers or backwards southern hicks. U.S.-hating liberals and world-inexperienced college kids will love it. What I didn't understand was how many people in the audience were laughing at the jokes that had already been in the trailers. If you seen the trailer you've seen about 1/3 of the movie (it's very short at 84 minutes). Also, the movie also contains the same jokes that 'Borat' has used in his several hundred interviews for the movie release. How many times you can hear 'My sister is prostitute' and still find it funny, I'm not sure. Once was enough for me. In short, I think it's better retitled 'Borat: Jew make fun of Goyim for Make Benefit of Wallet.' Because, after all, the whole world is anti-semitic and every goy is out to get the Jew.Edit: I dropped my rating to 1 after finding out the exploitation Cohen used against the villagers of Glod Romania (deeply impoverished, they were paid roughly $6 a day and told it was for a real documentary. Cohen slept in a resort each night, then came to work during the day putting sex toys on the stumps of amputees and put animals in their homes to make fun of them). Also how he duped other people in the U.S., where there have been consistent tales of how he and the producers lied and manipulated the folks who appeared in the film, who have had massive negative repercussions on their lives as a result.",1,22,47,12 November 2006
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel
","While it's not Wonder Woman (1974), it isn't Wonder Woman (2017) either. Hoping that Captain Marvel (April 2019) is better than Captain Marvel (March 2019).",4,2,4,10 March 2019
Resident Evil: Extinction," Has very very little to do with Vegas
","The movie trailers make you think that it takes place in Vegas are what you'd call a bait and switch. 3/4 of the way through the movie they arrive in Vegas, but it's just through the center of the strip that has been covered in sand. They get attacked by zombies and they move on. I thought the backdrop for the movie was to be in Vegas and you'd see them in the casinos and around the hotels. Nope, none of that. In fact, there was really no need to locate it in Vegas at all.Other than that, the movie is OK as far as zombie films go. However the genre has just been done to death in the past five years. How many ways can a virus/gas/substance turn people into flesh eating zombies or vampires or werewolves. The genre itself has become like a zombie that keeps rising again and again. Give it a rest for about 10 years.",5,0,4,1 January 2008
Man of Steel," Good, but not great. Should have been better for all the reasons others have said.
","Snyder was a good choice for the last half of the movie, but a terrible choice for the first. The flashback narrative was a poor choice. It left me not giving a s--- about why Clark acts as he does. And for a $200M movie, they could have bought some stabilizers for cameras. Please please please stop it with the shaky-cam films. Nobody believes it's home footage. Nobody. Speaking of cinematography, so many quick-zooms in all of the space scenes left me thinking this was a Battlestar Galactica movie. Once or twice may have been fine, but I had to stop and think why that style looked so familiar. Also, too many fight scenes go for the close-up one-on-one shots. Somebody needs to teach snyder about medium shots. As for the story. Didn't really care what happened. I felt no connection to Clark Kent/Superman. When Glen Ford died in the 78 version, it was a touching moment that Clark realizes that even with all his abilities he can't save everyone. But Costner's death just seems so pointless, and a stupid decision on his part to insist on getting the dog when Clark could have easily done it and not necessarily given himself away (because, like, there wouldn't already been rumors after that school bus incident). I'm left thinking that Pa Kent deserves a Darwin award.So many people killed and so much destruction. But everyone seems to be back to work as normal the next day. At least this is covered in The Avengers, even if they also didn't mention the many thousands who were probably killed. The Christ symbolism when Holo-Jor-El tells him that 'he will be their savior' and he floats off, arms out stretched and one-leg up as a Christ-figure forced out an audible groan. Sure, in 1978 Puzzo purposely wrote Superman as a Christ figure. It fit for the time and a largely U.S. audience. But global audiences and Christianity plummeting, I'm comfortable if they not get to religious on us.But Shannon made a well-played Zod. And I did enjoy watching the city get destroyed, but I suppose I could have gotten that from Transformers or so many other similar movies that I just go to see just for the eye candy. Superman, being an American icon and having such a long history, deserved a better story.",6,3,6,18 June 2013
High Fidelity," Best film about guy's view of relationships
","Possibly the best portrayal from a guy's perspective about relationships and our need (despite what cosmo says, we think about this s**t too) in trying to understand them.  Rob's an average guy with an average life with the usual string of failed romances and he seeks to understand them.  Unless you married your first girlfriend, you will probably find yourself relating to most if not all five of his top 5 failed romances. Girls, this is required watching if you really want to get inside our minds.",10,0,1,30 September 2000
