Blade Runner 2049," Pleasing visuals and eye candy - displeasing film and story
","Time for a quick pro and conPros: beautiful graphics, effects and sets are either real or realistic. It is an impressive feat of film making, moreover what there is stylish and futuristic The girlfriend is superb and sexy. She may be technology but with looks like that who cares? She is sexy and adds two pints on her own. The dog is affable. I am just a sucker for dogs anywhere anyhow.Cons: No story, no start, no middle and no end. What is this? no one's acts make sense. The busy thoroughfares do not exist. The smog is more like smoke and all the Japanese script is for no one's benefit as no East Asians are seen anywhere! The actors deliver their lines as if they do not care. How about a little emotion, guys? The cool eye candy laser baby has more emotion than the main characters.I won't be watching the sequel to this, the next 10 Star Wars, the next ten marvel films or the next baker's dozen Justice league films. I am tired. Give me a good film or forget it",Null,6,11,17 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars Name? Yes. Star Wars Film? No.
","This was truly an awful sequel. Disney pokes you in the eye to say 'we have no ideas, feeling, creativity or sense of the force and we just want your cash. Pay it up you nostalgic, sucker.' I cannot believe the movie reviewers have such low income that they take blatant bribes form the studios and blatantly review crap that is standard Hollywood borefest as socmething exciting.I won't be around for the next episode where the ugly chick spreads it for the confused sewagetrooper. farewell 'Star Wars.' You suck now. Here is a joke: JJ Abrams hahahaha",Null,20,26,17 November 2017
