Moneyball," More than just a sport story.
","To compare America's pastime with something more relevant in Britain would probably frustrate American's the world over, so I won't even attempt it. I thought the topic of the film would be lost on me considering my typically British upbringing, but there is so much more to Moneyball than just the sport of baseball.Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill bounce off each other so well (I wanted to be sat in-between them chuckling to myself), especially during the introduction of Hill's character Peter, with everything he said seeming to sound like an apology and Pitt's Billy Beane basically telling him to man up. The supporting cast did a superb job of looking dumbfounded when the new strategy of baseball drafting was presented to them, created awkward moments even Woody Allen would be proud of.The mix of archive footage with the newly filmed, brings an air of nostalgia that's really fitting. Without the back-story of Billy Beane creating the emotional connection we, as an audience, need, there would be no story at all (apart from that of which we could read on Wikipedia), but with this, there is enough narrative to entice even the most British of non-baseball fans.",7,0,0,2 December 2011
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Lived up to the 1st
","We all knew this was coming with a setting up like the end of the last film. Sequels have been popping up more and more recently, they are a sure seller, but this one definitely lived it to it's first instalment.Guy Richie's signature blue tint is back in force but didn't manage to depress me, the comedy between Robert Downey Jnr. and Jude Law certainly lightens the mood. The angles used for the chase turn a now normal and possibly mundane scene into something new and raw, we move with the punches as the camera swings around. Things that are so often taken for granted in films such as establishing shots, are used perfectly so the only questions the audience is asking are the ones the story has set up.Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes is bloody marvellous, I'm not afraid to say that he is quite simply perfect and the final fight scene is epic.",8,1,2,29 December 2011
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," I don't have the stomach
","I have to say, and I am ashamed for doing so, but I haven't seen the original trilogy or even read the books. I know, slap on the wrists, if not a slap on the face. Yet after seeing this film, I've been looking at buying the box-set of the Swedish version, I'm hooked.The title sequence seemed to me like a more disturbing Bond, especially with Daniel Craig appearing. I suppose the fact that they were a tad disturbing, should have set me up for a couple of hours of me shying away from the screen, to be honest, I'm not sure I've got the stomach for it. The acting from both Craig and Rooney Mara along with the impeccable story line made me stay.Apart from the few unsettling moments, it is very frank and candid, creating a funny repartee between Craig and Mara. There's so many questions and so much going on but I never once found myself bewildered by any of it, that's good storytelling.",9,1,5,13 January 2012
Goon," Good laughs
","Seann William Scott often fits into a certain type, to put it bluntly, silly films. After following his favourite hockey player, Doug (Scott) goes from bouncer at a pub to pro hockey player, seems to fit the bill.I didn't think much of the film or the story in the first say, twenty minutes. It just seemed to be in competition with the likes of Superbad and dare I say, American Pie. With Doug's best friend Ryan (Jay Baruchel) making obscene jokes every 5 seconds, I couldn't help but role my eyes. When the story moves away from him, is when the film really starts to pick up. We get to see what Scott's character is really like, which is a polite, cute, neanderthal with really hard fists.Liev Schreiber's character is rather terrifying, creating a great juxtaposition between him and the dimwitted Doug. The camera angles used on the ice show how scary it can be and bring the audience into the match. Now that I know it's based on a true story, I only want to meet the real Doug and give him a hug.",7,25,37,21 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Just a sequel
","I had a bad feeling from the beginning of this film, that our very own Simon Pegg was going to be the best thing about it (he is hilarious), but it wasn't too bad considering it was the fourth in the series of Mission: Impossible films and generally, I feel that sequels deteriorate the further they get away from the original flick (apart from Toy Story 3).Expect what you got from the other Mission: Impossible films; new gadgets to awe at, maybe a bit of girl on girl (fighting mind you). Just a heads up, the end sequence is ridiculous, fantasy gadgets is one thing, defying death is another. If you want to leave the cinema mildly satisfied, leave before the end.I've said before that I like a film that teaches me something. What did this film teach me? It taught me that everyone needs Apple products and BMWs.",5,2,7,13 January 2012
The Artist," Love, love, love.
","Oh my! I'm going to ruin the ending to my own review by saying I absolutely loved this film! No suspense or skirting around the issue, it's absolutely fantastic.From the offset, I was transported into a time I wish I'd lived. The theatre was so busy, I had to sit at the back where I could here the projector, which only added to the ambiance. The irony of a silent film documenting the coming of sound is perfect. Sound in film is all we know of today, lest we forget, it ruined a lot of people's careers (Norma Desmond, even though she's a character, is a prime example). Single scenes show the transition of two peoples entire emotions and it's done beautifully, not rushed, just beautiful.I really have nothing bad to say about this film, I'm giddy just writing about. Not having sound (or even the way they use it in doses) helps you to appreciate the subtleties. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are sublime, I even loved the dog. If only films like this could come along more often than a blue moon.",9,3,5,13 January 2012
50_50," Laugh and Cry
","I've never seen a film about cancer that was so real, that really said what needed to be said instead of cheesing everything up. I admit, it's a difficult matter to discuss without feeling you're treading on people's toes, but 50/50 does it perfectly.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, Adam, is shown to be an upstanding citizen; waiting for the green man to cross the road, recycling, didn't drink, didn't smoke, that's what makes it all the more frustrating for him, and us, when he gets cancer. It not only deals with cancer, but Alzheimer's's as well, with some truly heart rendering moments. Look out for the beautiful volcano metaphor and you may guess Adam's (Gordon-Levitt) outcome.Basically, take your tissues but don't be afraid to laugh, Gordon-Levitt looks more like an alien with his shaved head than he did in 3rd Rock From The Sun. Seth Rogen offers some hilarious moments, including his analysis, 'every celebrity beats cancer,' and Anjelica Huston is the perfect smothering mother.",8,0,0,9 December 2011
