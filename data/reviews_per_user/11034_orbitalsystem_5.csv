Ford v Ferrari," Could have been much better
",Good film but should have included more technical focus on the development of the car from the beginning not just cut scenes of them testing the GT.The film included too much drama between Miles and his family for some reason which was not necessary and didn't serve any purpose.,6,1,4,14 February 2020
