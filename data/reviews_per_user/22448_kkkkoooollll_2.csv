United 93," Not entertaining
","The movie is made too soon after the tragedy. The movie exploits the tragedy, but not in an entertaining way. There are several episodes in the movie, which are not credible at all, like the episode with telephones, and the bathroom, and the co-pilot stuff. The passenger's behavior is very strange, they act like Hollywood make-out war heroes, although they are supposed to behave just like ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. The camera work and the prompts are good, but the directing is flawed. I could not wait for the movie to end, and I regret wasting my time on it. Apart from being absolutely not credible, the movie does not grip you, does not make you feel for the characters, and as everyone knows how it ends, does leave much room for anticipation. I would definitely recommend skipping this one.",3,29,123,24 April 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Good movie, but with lots of holes in the plot.
","This is a very engaging and interesting movie, but I still was left somewhat disappointed after it ended. The actors are good and the camera work is not bad either. What let my overall impression down were huge holes in the story, quite a few things that didn't make any sense at all, and the absurd desire of the creators to add as many turns and twists to the story as they can possibly squeeze in. Seven people dies to save one little secret? Highly unrealistic. I will not go into divulging any of the spoilers, but the second part of the movie was so hollywoodish, in the worst sense of the word, that it was almost on the verge of laughable. Also, several key scenes were shot hastily and without any respect for the viewer, just to carry on with the unrealistic plot. The bottom line: it is an OK movie, but with some huge gaps in the storyline and direction.",6,0,0,20 June 2008
