Skyfall," And the Franchise Continues Masturbating
","This has to be the dumbest Bond movie yet. I saw this idiotic mess because I'd gone into the final Twilight movie in hopes of picking up some preteen action. Unfortunately I went in at the point where its theatrical run was coming to a close and all that could be found were the fattest dregs of its fan base; the kind of people who seem to have shotgun blasts of 'backne'. There were some hot girls there too, but they had their parents with them.. or their parents had mace... I can't remember... all I know is that I ended up beating off and crying in isolation to one of the worst movies I'd ever beaten off during (next to Skyfall later that night). I mean, I hadn't seen any of the other Twilight films, but I knew going into it that it was going to be terrible, but instead it was just horrendous. Watching Trash Humpers again for the eighth time would have seemed relaxing and pleasant compared to this arrant display of mental retardation splashed across the screen like a vomiting dog. Though there was one good part in 'Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 2.' While fumbling for the zipper on my pants I found a pack of matches in my pocket that had some broad with boobs on it. Totally awesome. The movie ended so I decided to sneak into Skyfall and try to pick up some old ladies, hopefully widows. The night ended again with disappointment. You'd think that they'd make a good movie what with it being the 23rd in a franchise, or at least do something different... But no, it was just like the rest. Bond wins and undergoes no changes whatsoever as a character. The same old spunk tortured out of Fleming's dead dick, tarnishing the legacy with repeated mediocrity... I've never even seen any of the other Bond movies.",1,6,13,10 April 2013
Cars 2," The longest Chevron commercial I've ever sat through
","I went to see this in theatres, and I never even made it to the movie. I understand that there are now commercials before movies, but this is really getting out of hand. Yeah, I get it, with Techron. I don't know how celebrities get roped into this crap. Vin Diesel wasn't even in this one. After what seemed like 112 minutes, the light came up and everyone left, so I assumed it was an intermission. I went into the lobby to get a refill of Cracker Jacks, then they wouldn't let me back in for the movie. Security pummeled me with truncheons when I refused to leave without having seen a movie. I'll never go to a Famous Players again! I wish I had rented Drive Angry. Oh well.",1,14,28,26 June 2011
The Dark Knight," Worst S&M ever!
","So... What I'm getting is there's this Dominatrix running around with a cape, funny ears, and a husky/scary/arousing voice. Who also beats up guys in parking garages, but none of them got aroused, so the story didn't go anywhere. She probably should have whipped them. also there was this rich guy who it showed a lot, but he didn't really have anything to do with the story. It was strange. But on the other hand there is that buxom green haired lady who gets beat by the Dominatrix and then dresses up as a nurse. I'd buy that for a dollar. Anyday. I think the Dominatrix probably should have got slightly naked, she's got some big pecs if you know what I mean and I would have liked to find out if the carpet matched the drapes. Like, That's the stuff I would bump into on the street 'by accident'. That Gordon guy had a moustache that made me wonder... But I digress, there was a lot of teasing, without any climactic moments of trepidating fulfillment, or masochistic zeal. I was appalled, disappointed, and, finally, ashamed. It almost makes you wonder how director Christopher Nolan even thought he was making an erotic film.",1,10,20,30 August 2010
Avatar," Avatar: a Total Waste of Time and Money.
","This movie was a total waste of three hours of time I could of put to better use watching porn and be less ashamed I watched it afterwards. I found myself hoping for that blue chick to get naked, but instead there I am sitting in the theatre with an erection and nothing to do with it. There wasn't even a point where I could relieve myself and stand up to get popcorn to make the movie slightly bearable to sit through. I was p**sed! From all the quarter-second nip-slips, I could have sworn they would throw me something I could use. The reason I had to desperately hope for nudity through this movie is because its story was unoriginal and packed with stupid gimmicks to make people ignore the bad writing. Also all its characters were one dimensional and very uninspired making me not care about them whatsoever. The main characters 'dramatic decision' he had to make has been used so many times before, and was so poorly executed that you know what choice he's going to make the second you see the options he has. Also the CGI sucked because they over-emphasized it being so-called 'State-of-the-Art' CGI, so I knew for sure it was fake, I couldn't believe or enjoy it. Overall, I would rather watch a man pulling up old carpeting than this Hollywood garbage.",1,9,14,17 September 2010
Titanic," what's the big deal?
","I watched this movie under the influence that it would be good. I don't get it. Is this supposed to be entertaining? The plot was totally pointless. Here's what happens: Some kid goes to a boat and finds this dog and then his stepfather says he can't keep it. Then there is a bear, and it's after the stepfather, but the dog comes to save him. Then it gets rabies and the boy freezes to death. How did that happen? I though this was about a boat? There was only one in the beginning. My friend later explained to me that I fell asleep and had a dream that was more interesting than this movie. That sort of explains why instead of credits I just got shoved by the usher and told to leave the theatre. Oh well, it was a long time ago.",1,5,12,5 August 2010
