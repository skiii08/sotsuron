Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino at his weakest
","This film did not impressed me at all, there was more talking than action. Even thought in all of Tarantino's films the conversations are interesting funny and random but in this one it was over the top. The part with the caravan with the snake in the case and the pulling out the eye was the only part that was entertaining, the rest especially the end scene with Bill was 'tedious', too much of 'How's your life been?' 'Tell me your life story'. The first film was good, because it's original e.g. with the manga cartoons, but there was nothing new about this second film. Tarantino should stick to his amazing crime thriller classics (Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction)",3,1,4,28 January 2006
Silent Hill," Best Horror Film of the year so far!!!
","I've finally watched this movie last night and fortunately I was very impress. To start with I was mostly on the edge of my sit throughout the film. When the lead character Rose Da Silva enters Silent Hill the atmosphere was very intence, it was nothing like the remake of 'The Fog' which look like something from a Bon Jovi video, it was literary that the whole town was hiding behind this mist. I know it's based on the game 'The Silent Hill' but had no idea what the storyline is because I only played on a game demo.The acting was adequate, Sean Bean's acting could of been better, his didn't really need to put on an American accent. The effects were very technicality well done such as the bleeding of the walls.Not only I found this movie tense and gripping but I also found it frighting disturbing. When watching through and seeing them zombie children, looking all mangled and horrible and the screaming sound they made gave me a cold shiver down my spine. Also when that officer was being burned, it was so graphic, I couldn't really watched.In conclusion, this movie is literary the best computer game base movie I've since. Unlike 'Resident Evil' the movie actually sticks to the games story. I think UWE Boll should get some tips from this movie, because I might make his movies exceptional to watch.",8,2,4,22 April 2006
Wanted," Wanted... to get out of the cinema as fast as i can
","To get right to the point i found this movie very distressing to watch, I do like watching action genre films but there's a line drawn where movies is divided by the sense of being realistic which I prefer to enjoy and totally unbelievable, I'll put the movie in the place of being completely far-fetch.Is all that special effects necessary? well watching the film it appears it relies more on effects than the storyline itself's that I really had a problem with. Since we are in the 21th century now and film-makers are looking for new ways of being innovative this is where the problem lies. Too many film makers are using their film budget more on special effects these days, like 'Wanted' it was hard to take notice of the narrative because of the constance special effect. So to answer the question, special effects is necessary in disaster genre pictures such as 'The Day after tomorrow', action films such as 'Shoot em up' and 'Wanted' uses special effects to make it look better when it looks OK on it's own. That is why I prefer The Die Hard, Rambo movies 20 years ago where special effects weren't a issue.I mentioned about it being beyond disbelieve, audiences today aren't considering the logic,but are more being amazed by the slow-motion scenes,fast-pace action and special effects. For example, one scene in the movie Wesley Gibson crashes his car and spins over a limo to shoot the target through the sunroof. Thinking about it if a car spins over this limo it will take approximately one second, in this second the character had time to say the line 'I'm sorry' and shoot the target when the car is spinning. At that point I couldn't bare to watch any more.Final outcome is that modern films are taking special effects as a alternative to make to appear better, which I dislike about action films today. This movie would of been better if the special effects was cut down or taken out, the acting was average and had an interesting story with twists. But unfortunately this year 'Wanted' is the worst movie of 2008 so far...",1,11,34,2 July 2008
Braveheart," God gave birth to this movie
","This outstanding piece of work from Mel Gibson makes it the best epic film ever. Stands next to 'Last of the Mohicans' and 'Gladiator'. Braveheart is truly an epic masterpiece, the storyline, the acting, the directing is superb.William Wallis is a Scottish rebel who plans to take over England. After the death of his father who was trying to bring freedom to the Scots. Wallis takes on the cruel greedy tyrant English King Edward the Long shank played by Patrick Mcgoohan. Filled with bloody battle scenes, one of the best is the first major battle when the Scots takes on the invaders.Braveheart gives one of the best one-liner ever, towards the end when Wallis is about to be executed, Wallis screams out 'Freedom!!!!' this gave me goose bumps all down my arm.For Gibson's directorial debut, he wins six academy awards including Best Picture and Best Director, in which Gibson deserves for this epic masterpiece.",10,1,2,25 February 2006
