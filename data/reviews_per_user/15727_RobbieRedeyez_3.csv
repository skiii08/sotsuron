Raiders of the Lost Ark," Not as good as its reputation
","I recently rewatched all the Indiana Jones movies .
I started wondering if its mainly for kids , but then the kill count is pretty high .
The story is ok-ish with some weak moments .
Harrison Ford is a movie icon with presence and makes up for a script that should have been better at some moments .
-- spoilers --
In a way the movie does try create its own 'feel ' .
Some typical things like ' scary animals ' , or the bad guys die in some strange ' shocking ' way , return in the next movies and are bit of trademark .
-------
I miss a bit type of endboss , the bad guys dont really make much of lasting impression .
I rate this movie a 6 as i find the overall rating for this movie should be closer to a 7 .",6,0,2,14 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Failed to deliver
","I did not manage to care one bit about the 2 main caracters , this made the movie even longer and more boring then already is .",4,6,8,17 January 2020
Joker," A joke without any entertainment value
","First , this movie made me start an account to write a 'review ' .
I completely dont understand all the good ratings and praise for this movie .
Also it always hurts when this type of movie could have lot to offer , but for me was nothing more then total let down .
I dont like the Joker caracter at all in this movie , not a good joker in my book .
Combined with a story that doesnt manage to pull me in or do anything at all for me , i felt this movie was boring pretty quick , and im an easy goin guy that can manage to put brain on hold for a movie if needed , normally it would take some longer before i start thinking ; hey ,i may be watching a bad movie here.
I can handle some graphic violence , i wasnt sure if it really served a purpose here .
Because of all these type of reviews , u start wonder if something is wrong with majority of people , or am i totally out of touch with a new reality .
I never watch any review or trailer beforehand .
I always use this website to find reviews of similar minded people , then have more entertainment then the movie i watched before and gives some piece of mind . To be sure it wasnt me on a bad day i rewatched the movie and still found it complete garbage .
I rate lowest possible because the high scores , but not sure if i would be willing to give any more if had lower rating , as i really did not like anything about it . Because the joker is so badly , wrong displayed in the movie , and i feel a really good movie about the Joker would not be that amazingly hard to make , this is just dissapointing beyond words , all the good reviews , i dont understand at all and is both annoying and disturbing .",1,12,31,13 January 2020
