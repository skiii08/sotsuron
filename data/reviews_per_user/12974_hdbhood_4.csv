Walk the Line," This is one of my favorite movies of all times
","This movie is extremely well made and extremely entertaining. It keeps you watching the entire time and it is the type of movie you can watch over and over again. The music is wonderful, because A. Its Johnny Cash. He's a legend, his lyrics are moving and so interesting that its hard not to enjoy. And B. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon sing them themselves and they are really good. Now its nothing compared to Johnny Cash himself but they are really great. Reese does such a wonderful job as June Carter, I mean I love Reese in every role she plays but I would have to say this was probably her all time best. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go see it. It is worth $20 if you want to buy it.",10,1,1,16 February 2008
The Love Guru," So awful it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
","This has got to be the worst movie I have EVER seen. Well Meet the Spartans was pretty awful too...Anyways. I went with a large group, I had no desire to see this movie but I did anyways. Luckily I did not have to pay for it. This movie was horrible. I was so bored and disgusted by it that I resorted to listening my ipod. I don't think anybody else in the theater enjoyed this movie. I should have walked out but for some bizarre reason I didn't. Mike Myers acted stupid. There were many 'poop' 'fart' and 'testicles' jokes which I find disturbing and many jokes referring to sex. A total guy movie that I don't even think guys would enjoy. It tried much too hard to be funny. I don't think I ever heard anyone laugh during this movie. It was awful. I wish I had that hour and a half back in my life. I could have done something useful.",1,4,10,16 July 2008
Twilight," I enjoyed it
","Yes, I am a teenager. Yes, I have read the books. And surprisingly, Yes, I found the movie entertaining. Let me start by saying that I was not a huge fan of the books, they were very cheesy and the hype over them annoyed me. Sure, they were enjoyable but they were by no means great literature. So I went into the movies actually expecting the film to be better than the book. And in some ways it was. The acting was pretty good, cheesy obviously, but decent. The cast was perfect, exactly how I imagined it, with a few exceptions. Edward was cast beyond perfectly, every time he walked in the room my heart skipped a beat (I'm exaggerating, obviously). My favorite character was the actor who played Charlie, he was perfectly awkward and fatherly and at moments funny! Now let me say, all these people saying the movie was awful, the book was better, blah blah blah, please just shut up! Books are almost always better than movies, what did you expect? The movie was, in my opinion, very true to the book. The story line was identical, with things switched around every now and then. They left out only what they needed to. People just need to look at it as they would any other movie and ignore the knowledge they already have. They will ruin a perfectly fine movie for themselves.All in all, movie was good, better than the book at some parts. The cast was very impressive and it was NOT a waste of money!",8,2,7,28 November 2008
Across the Universe," Music was fun
","So I am a freshman in high school and I absolutely love this decade that this film was supposed to take place in. I have never been too major of a Beatles fan but I am a fan of many other bands of the decade. At my school, freshman were RAVING about this movie. Personally, I find freshman to be stupid and I don't think they understood anything in this movie. They probably just liked the music and played along with the crowed and said it was fantastic. This movie was not fantastic. It was descent. The plot was very...blank. So to speak. I felt as if you couldn't really connect with any of the characters. There is also the fact that I am a extremely conservative person and this movie was extremely liberal. It is kind of hard to enjoy a movie when you don't agree with anything in it. The only reason I give this film 6 stars is because the music is very catchy. Now you may hear people say its so 'artsy', I personally thought it seemed like whoever created or directed this movie was trying too hard to be artsy, if that makes sense? All in all, see this movie, it's descent. It's worth the $3 at the video store but don't be surprised if you aren't overly impressed.Also may I add, I took it as Sadie represents Janis Joplin and Jojo represents Jimi Hendrix. I may be wrong but to me that is the way it appeared. I mean guitar hero and rockin chick...okay maybe I'm wrong!",6,0,1,25 April 2008
