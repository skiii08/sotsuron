Requiem for a Dream," boring, flat, awful
","Started to watch this one, after being recommended by friends and reviews i've read but was not amused. I was really BORED with it (so much that I could not resist to fast-forward, almost never happens). I agree that the plot (and trailer) promises an interesting movie to watch. But: no funny dialogs at all, flat characters, the actors we're not interesting at all. I could really not care for the boy. I could really not care for his mum. How do you show the effect of drug abuse? By showing eyeballs? Wanna see a good, gripping movie about drug abuse? Try Trainspotting,and you'll also laugh your pants off!",1,12,28,7 August 2005
