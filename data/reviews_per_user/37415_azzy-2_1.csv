The Blair Witch Project," WOW!
","I have just returned from seeing for myself what the hype was about. The first 3 times i tried to see it, it was sold out. Therefore, the anticipation was in full bloom by the time I finally got a ticket. At first I was a little up in the air about how I felt about the movie. However thats one of the tricks of the film, it gets under your skin, if not while you're watching it, after you leave. I was blown away! I am and avid horror fan, but just like many horror fans, I have been waiting years for a good one to come out. Horror has become a joke in the film industry...Please people, wisecracking maniacs, and slashers who won't die is getting a little old....ok, it's been old! But fear not fright fans 'The Blair Witch Project' will restore your faith in horror. I heard many mixed comments on the way out of the theater, from; 'I cant believe I paid to see that!'  to 'I'll never go in the woods again.' You either love it or hate it, no in between. The last 10 minutes of the film leave you yearning for another 10, but somehow the mystery behind it makes it even better.  I have yet to see a movie that scared me, ever..but this one had me looking over my shoulder all night....I gotta see it again!!!...By the way, my local video store owner told me that it was due on video and dvd in October and that she had already ordered her copies...that soon??..any truth to this??..If anyone knows please drop me an e-mail!",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
