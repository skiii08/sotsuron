","I love this movie. it was great just like Raiders of the Lost Ark is. It was a lot better then Temple of Doom. don't get me wrong. I do love Temple of Doom. But this was a little bit better. George Lucas did a great job as writer, by having the movie deal with the cup of Christ (the Holly Grail) with lots of action. Harrison Ford is such a great actor. Steven did such an awesome job directing this movie. Thats what I love about the Indiana Jones movie. The movie deals with God, and still has plenty of action. the music was great. it gives you a mysterious feel to it. If you know what I mean. You'll have to watch it to find out what I'm talking about. But enough said. This is one of the best movies ever made. I loved every moment of it.
