Catch Me If You Can," Absolutely Charming
","I was in no hurry to see this.  Oh, it looked entertaining enough when I first saw the trailor, and I heard many an excellent review.  But even though I do enjoy movies of this genre, it's not my genre, if you will. Even so, when I was invited to go see it, I was happy.And I was not disappointed.  This really is one of the best movies out right now.  The story is fast-paced, wity, and thorough, while the acting is superb.  Tom Hanks was as good as ever, but I was pleasantly surprised by the dashing performance Leonardo DiCaprio gave. I never was a fan, but this film proved me wrong.I'm sure Spielburg grabbed that artistic license and ran a marathon with the Frank Abaganale story, but the result is a funny, exciting, sweet, and thoroughly charming tale.",10,1,2,8 January 2003
