E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Don't be fooled........!
","This film can have an incredibly dark feel to it.I can't understand how it is seen as a nice, lovely, family film. The feel of the film has a dark, smokey, depressing look to it. The alien is the most unattractive thing I have seen, and if I was a kid I would not hug it as it looks slimy and wet. ET does have a creepy edge to him with his long thin fingers, and telescopic neck, the way it hides in cupboards, and walks around in the dark.Also the way it has complete control over the young kids. This film made me scared of the dark as a child, and I had many sleepless nights. It is also naive, full of sickly sweet emotion, and from an adults point of view can have a completely different vibe to it i.e. the alien has a complete hold over children.",Null,1,2,20 October 2001
