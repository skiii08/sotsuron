The Blair Witch Project," Mesmerizing, Unique
","The Blair Witch Project is a mesmerizing, unique film that builds its suspense for almost 97 minutes.  It's not a 'Hollywood' film...no cliches...no music score...not even a Hollywood ending. If you're looking for another 'Nightmare on Elm Street', save your money.  If you're looking for a fascinating cinema experience, give this one a try.",10,1,2,1 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Another Kubrick Gem
","Stanley Kubrick's mark is on this film from beginning to end and that's great news for those of us who really believe that he is one of the two or three top film-makers of all time. Forget the hype that preceded this film. Go see it with an open mind.  Leave your expectations in the lobby...you'll be rewarded with an original, compelling film that makes you think for a change. One of the best of the year so far.",Null,0,0,1 August 1999
