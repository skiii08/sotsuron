Skyfall," Very good film, but good bond film?
","I have to strongly disagree with the ridiculously harsh reviews on here of 4/10 and below. There is no doubt that this film is a very good film, but I find myself asking the question: 'it is a good Bond film?' as it somehow doesn't feel like a great Bond film, as I am failing to remember a distinctive moment such as Ursula Andress' famous scene or Halle Berry's or even a moment with a bond car or gadget doing the unexpected. However I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film and would definitely recommend it to you. Bardem is an extremely good villain and Dame Judi decent as ever puts in a top performance as M. There are some moments where you wonder why didn't they just do this? But that just isn't the Bond style to do it the easy way now is it?",9,1,6,23 July 2013
