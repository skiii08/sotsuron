Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A feast for the eyes, but.....
","I just finished watching Episode I for the ninth time and I still am unable to take it all in.  Lucas is the master of putting dreams onto the screen. I only wish I had a fraction of his imagination.  Everyone already knows the pod race scene is flawlessly gorgeous, so I won't get into that. But the best scene in my mind is when they're escaping from Naboo and are saved by none other than R2D2. The first time through, the crowd ate it up. Everything about this movie is perfect.  Forget the negative comments and see this movie multiple times. Jar Jar Binks is also an achievement.  He was hilarious. Although during the final battle, it was a little much to have his own clumsiness save his Gungan a$$. Audiences were going in with the acting second string to the visuals, so don't expect any acting awards.  The actors did enough to get a feel for their characters, and that's all I needed.  Except for the cringing 'yippees' from little Jake Lloyd, there are no complaints here. About the but....., there are no buts. A 9.9/10. I'll save the 10's for II and III.",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
Fight Club," It's not too late,......
","so, go see it.  I saw Fight Club for the fourth time and the only people there were myself and my girlfriend, who had seen it once before, with me. Why was this movie neglected like it was.  It is everything you could want. I can't wait until May when it comes out on DVD, so I can watch it over and over again. If you find yourself at home with nothing to do, instead of masturbating, jump in your car and go see Fight Club.  Being John Malkovich also kicks ass.  These two should both be nominated for Oscars, or at least a friggin Golden Globe.",10,0,1,30 November 1999
Fight Club," And the Oscar goes to.....
","...the Green Mile...probably. Because of all the issues brought up by Fight Club, the movie of the year will not be voted movie of the year.  The acting was top notch, most notably, Edward Norton.  David Fincher has put together a movie that deserves more business than it's getting.  The ending was probably the most unpredictable event in cinema this year.  I wasn't that surprised since Arlington Road, >",10,0,1,26 October 1999
Any Given Sunday," Doesn't Get Any Better Than This..
","Before Any Given Sunday, my favorite football movie was The Program, which I thought was bone-crunching excitement, but now that I've seen A.G.S., the Program looks more like a Pop Warner take on the gridiron.  Oliver Stone takes you straight into the action, and it never lets up. When I caught the trailer before Three Kings, I knew this was the movie to see. The best thing about this movie is Al Pacino, who uses all his bravura to bring to life a role that was tailor made for his over the top excitement. Any Given Sunday is the movie all football fans have been waiting for.  The only thing that bugs me is that it didn't use NFL teams, which I had earlier heard were going to be involved.  But it doesn't take away from any of the excitement, which is aplenty.  Go see it again and again and again.",10,3,5,20 December 1999
