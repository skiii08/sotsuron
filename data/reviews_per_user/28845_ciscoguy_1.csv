The New World," Pretentious, self-indulging, boring
","Over 2 hours of incoherent nonsense This movie should have been released silent. Would not make any difference anyways The only good thing about this film is great cinematography. If you decide to see this 'movie', make sure to allocate at least about 4 hours. As you would have to constantly rewind the film trying to understand what the characters are whispering. Colin Farrell should really look for a speech therapist He just can't seem to get any better with his mumbling and incoherent speech I have not seen 'The Thin Red Line' yet by Malick. But I don't see how I could be even more disappointed after 'The New World' experience. Oh, one more thing... If you're into nature videos, rent this film. Just make sure to turn off the volume...",3,1,6,17 March 2007
