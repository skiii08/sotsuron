Requiem for a Dream," WOW
","I always heard people talking about this movie, a lot. But, I always ignored it thinking that it was going to be another overrated stupid movie. I was VERY wrong. This movie makes you feel what the characters are feeling. I was very touched by this film, it was just so real. I cant even explain it..the way they just moved the camera and made you get in to the film itself is unexplainable...When the movie was over my mom and I just looked at eachother, speechless..This is truly a masterpiece.
