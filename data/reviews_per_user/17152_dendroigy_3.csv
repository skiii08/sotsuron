Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A flawed, but by no means terrible film.
","The Phantom Menace has gotten a lot of hate over the years, some of it deserved, a majority of it undeserved. I still say the prequels introduce an absolutely enthrawling time period, a complex narrative and interesting characters. This movie does all of that, even being the worst of the Lucas era.",7,0,0,4 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," An outrageously fun and interesting experince.
","Where The Phantom Menace fails, this movie excels. Awesome action sequences, we get lorebuilding involving the clones, we get Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin character development, did I mention Obi-Wan?",9,1,1,4 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A complex tale of tragedy.
","Revenge of the Sith is heartbreaking, it is hard to watch, it will make you cry. But it's also an essential watch, and an incredibly fun time also, somehow.",10,1,1,4 January 2019
