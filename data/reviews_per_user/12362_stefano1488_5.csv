Minority Report," Just another action movie
","Entertaining and full of fascinating special effects, but what does it leave you with in the end? Not much. It goes down like a glass of water.I've read a couple of Dick's novels, and I couldn't say they were thrillers. Science-fiction novels with thought-provoking implications, which made them interesting. In this film, this side is completely neglected, drowned in an orgy of special effects.Ridley Scott took one of Dick's novels and created a masterpiece: tense, visionary, fascinating, full of interesting, multi-faceted characters. Spielberg's is just a classic Hollywood movie: lots of effects, lots of adrenaline, lots of action, but characters are extremely dull, and almost every turn of the plot can be easily anticipated.Spielberg isn't very good at exploring characters and implications of a story, and Cruise is the right actor for a movie like this: a good professional, but also good for shallow characters only. Like other Spielberg's film, this one is also, sometimes, intolerably moralistic.Definitely no masterpiece; 6/10.",6,0,0,28 September 2002
Fight Club," David Fincher has done it again (badly)
","I can't say if the ending of this film is good or bad, because I've got fed up with it well before the end.David Fincher seems to have a taste for grotesque excess. This can be seen in the Madonna videos he directed; it was plain for all to see in 'Se7en' (a horrible film) and it is evident again in this film as well.This film is disturbing to watch, but, unlike 'Se7en', at least it's not revolting. It will be liked by all those who think that, in order to criticise the distorted way in which we live, it's essential that an amount of violence as high as possible be shown and represented graphically, even though it doesn't really add to the story. It's not just the violence: it's the whole film that is unpleasant to watch, for no plausible reason.This is not being original, or visionary, or artistic, or intelligent, thought-provoking, innovative. If you met someone on the street and he punched in the stomach for no apparent reason, how many of you would you say that his action is 'thought-provoking'? Not many, I suppose. This film is the cinematic equivalent of a punch in the stomach by a stranger, but it's a little less subtle.Moreover, this film is also boring, very boring.I'm rather tired of directors that seem to indulge in shocking the public with unrealistic plots and hyperrealistic violence. Clearly, some of those directors have realised that they can play that game and get away with it (plus a lot of critical acclaim and, probably, a good deal of money). Personally, I think that this film is basically nonsensical. I suspect that, as with 'Se7en', it succeeds in making some people feel trendy because they can stand industrial amounts of imaginative violence. Transgression is the word.Sometimes it's even ludicrous. In the sequence in which Brad Pitt gets beaten by the landlord, after the second punch his face bleeds, but after the third one the blood has disappeared. Miraculous, indeed.",4,2,6,10 January 2003
Once," What a stunning surprise!
","I saw this film tonight in a cinema near home, expecting to see the umpteen interesting independent film.It's just amazing. Not one of those unbelievable love stories that are the stuff blockbusters are made of, but something real. Nobody meets nobody in the street. Are you 'nobody', too? Then, there are two of us! He works at a hoover repair shop in Dublin, Ireland, and is a busker in the spare time, playing 'the songs people know' by day in order to make some money and the songs he himself writes by night. She's an immigrant from the Czech Republic, a single mother living with her own mother, the daughter of a suicidal violinist, trying to make ends meet by peddling flowers in the streets and working as a housemaid. They meet each other, they start talking; or rather, they start playing and singing in this strange, original musical. In the end, they go their separate ways (or do they?) without having even kissed, let alone having had sex, and yet having been aware of the feelings for one another that have grown in them. Actually I think the woman does tell the guy 'I love you', but in Czech: he doesn't understand, and she probably doesn't want him to understand her. 'Alone, and yet together like two passing ships', as a song by Canadian rock band Rush has it.A moving, extremely romantic, yet deeply realistic film; and not rhetorical at all. How many times so many of us have felt so close with someone else, sometimes someone we have met by chance, someone we never expected we would meet, and yet nothing happens? But, deep inside, we know it has. And yet, rather sadly, it hasn't.The director must be a great music lover: it shows. Music is the fabric that weaves the whole film together.My favourite scene is the one where they both go to a bank in order to get a loan. As a bank employee specialised in loans (but I'm no manager) I can relate to that. There's genius in that scene.But what stuns me the most, was to find out that this is not a new release: it is as many as two years old, and yet it shows in cinemas here in Italy only now, thanks to well-known director's Nanni Moretti distribution firm Sacher.This film is a jewel, a rare pearl.Do not miss it if you can: take it from me, you will not regret it.",9,0,1,15 June 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The problem with Tarantino
","*SPOILERS*First of all, let me warn you. I've always detested Tarantino, so I didnt'go see this film free of prejudice.That said, I can't think of a worse film I've seen lately, except 'The Matrix Reloaded'. The reason is that Tarantino shows too much violence, and that he doesn't show anything else. 'But that's the point!' some will say. The point of what? Ok, lets' make a film and let's show a rape and say that that's the point. Does that mean that the film is good?Tarantino has always been overrated (I disliked 'Pulp Fiction' as well). The reason is that he manages to feel unconventional and artsy, so many will feel smart by saying that he's a genius, that his films are masterpieces and all that crap. The plain truth is that he's either a sadistic voyeur or a cunning man who's found a way to make pots of money by exploiting people's naivety. Or both.Although I don't like gore or black humour, I sometimes appreciate it (eg some films with Vincent Price). The point is trivial, but worth making: black humour has to be, well, humorous. The problem with Tarantino is that he's nothing. A vacuum.Some reviewers have said that if you don't understand what this film is about, you just won't get it; that it's a mockery and so on. The problem is that if one treats himself to shallow, uninspired, unoriginal, uninventive films, who are shot chiefly for the purpose of using some glitzy special effects and for solvin someone's money problems for the rest of his life, you may find such a film creative or inspired, instead of just the trick it is.Tarantino is in quotations. He quotes all the time. But a film full of quotations and references is a trick that is worth doing once or twice. After that, it can't hide any more the outright lack of creativity that hides behind the references.If you watch a gory b-movie (or any b-movie, for that matter), you may like it, even love it, but you'd never go so far as to claim it's a work of 'art'. Tarantino is 'hip' (for the time being), so it's fashionable to call this lame director a genius.But time will tell.Remember David Lynch.",1,195,433,8 November 2003
Love Actually," Lost chance
","I went to see this movie thinking that I'd see something similar to 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and to 'Bridget Jones'. I was disappointed.I like romantic comedies, especially when they're not too trite and with a good dose of humour - I'm not cynical about them; I also like British film, because I find them wonderfully witty. But, in this case, there was frankly too much rhetoric. Some of the stories were frankly so silly, like the one about the sandwich deliver boy. Some others were better: the one involving Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman was actually quite moving, like the one involving the girl with a mentally ill brother; and the one involving Colin Firth was really funny. Also, the story about the character who falls in love with his best friend's wife and tries desperately to hide his feelings was touching.But the others were frankly ridiculous, in particular the one about Hugh Grant. Not even Frank Capra would have depicted a prime minister in such a silly way.Some scenes stand out: Hugh Grant dancing, or the cameo role played by Rowan Atkinson. But the rest is forgettable, and far too long (I walked out when the characters started going to the airport, because I was so BORED).5/10",5,2,4,28 November 2003
