Kill Bill: Vol. 2," woa
","i'm going to review both movies here. the first one was a very fun, almost cartoonish, romp of an action movie. the anime scenes were genius, and the music complimented the overall aesthetic very nicely. the second one completed the picture with a lot of character development, and even some tear jerking drama. the scenes that showed how the bride learned how to kick a** so well were amazing. the 70's kung fu film grain made my jaw drop. the overall camera work was incredible in the second one. the only thing that annoyed me was how he portrayed el paso. i don't know a single person who owns a stetson, and cirtainly no one who talks with a country accent. it would have been nice if he hadn't portrayed us as some hick, sh*t kicker town in the middle of no where, but it didn't really change my opinion of the overall masterpiece. this is definitely one to see.",Null,0,1,18 April 2004
