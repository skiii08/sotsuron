Kill Bill: Vol. 2," KB sums Tarantino up: all bark, no bite.
","Kill Bill is variously indulgent, shocking, corny, genre-clich√©d, self-reflexive and plain thievery. Despite the fact that it tries to be a million other movies, in the end its hard to say what exactly Kill Bill is, and that's the highest compliment i can pay it.I'm exaggerating, though, because Kill Bill is nothing more than a sickeningly simple revenge story taken intravenously from Sergio Leone with samurai philosophy and fights with big buildups that don't end up happening.Look back at the final fight of Vol 1, or Elle Driver's demise in Vol 2 - they sum up what frustrates me about Kill Bill, and Tarantino's personality - a whole lot of build up (drawn-out closeups with crecendoing music before the fight; talking your movie up in interviews before its premiere) then a soft fizzle (Lucy Liu can't really operate a sword - there's just a whole lot of running around, smoke and mirrors, hardly even one sword-clash, before the final blow... Elle Driver: The Bride pulls her eye out instead of the fight happening). There is so much build up with music pilfered from other people's movie scores (mainly of Morricone music), that nobody seems to notice that the actual fight never happens!Tarantino tries to convince us he does this on purpose, under the guise of 'f**king with the audience.'Tarantino talks so much he'll always find some way of making his movie sound clever - but in the end, the talk's cleverer than the cinema is. Movies aren't essentially linguistic - that's books. Movies consist of moving images, and by reducing that to words you avoid discussing the reality of the movie itself, distort it and pretend its something its not. This is an artifact of all reviews, including this one - but there's something a whole lot less objective about the way Tarantino raves about why his own movies are clever. Unfortunately, Kill Bill requires us to think of movies like Quentin does to think its clever.Quentin's constantly pointing out 'look how I f**k with the audience' is a method of distracting us from the content of the movie. Quentin seems to have forgotten that its the audience he's supposed to be entertaining, not himself. Movies are entertainment - at least, genre movies are. What QT considers 'clever,' I say is indulgent and makes for an impoverished movie-viewing experience.He can describe the movie however he wants, but the reality of watching the movie is that every scene runs uncomfortable long, the dialogue delivery is corny (though much worse in Vol 1), his 'references' grow to dominate his movies more and more, so that the end product is more synthetic than organic, the performances are 100 % Ham, and the style-over-substance (and not an original style anyway) nature of it results in a pretentious, empty experience.",2,6,13,27 June 2004
Spartacus," Pre-Lawrence of Arabia epic has naive characterisation of Spartacus, but still, doesn't get enough credit in Kubrick's canon.
","Spartacus is a slave... He wants to be a King... There's only one way to go about it...Its love story, and the character of Spartacus, belong to that old-fashioned school of naive epics, where the hero is relentlessly deified and praised as perfect.Its just too damn simple. The revisionist epics, like Lawrence of Arabia, are much more interesting - they are an investigation into the character of the hero. They do not therefore have to be perfect, only interesting. They are more interesting, therefore, and realistic, if they are imperfect.But all the same Kubrick fans don't give Spartacus enough credit. I always figured the most amusing thing in it was Tony Curtis' Brooklyn accent in the middle of this ancient Roman epic. But then I realised many of its characterisations are done with humour: Laughton and Olivier give performances which are tongue in cheek and camp. But best of all is Peter Ustinov, who lights up the screen with a very unique character.Kubrick's mastery at choreographing mass crowd scenes is evident here. It is a gorgeously photographed epic - and, if you're a Kubrick fan, a sumptuous and satisfying experience.Its musical score also has a gorgeous love theme.8/10. Spartacus is without a doubt an accomplished and above-average film.",8,1,2,18 July 2004
G.I. Jane," A cutesy name for an abrasive and confronting film about prejudice.
","Demi Moore is one female Seal out of water.In most cases of discrimination, the minority party is a small percentage of the total population. They have friends, you might say. Here its one against the world. The odds aren't hardly fair. The environment of prejudice here is completely believable. We don't need much convincing that Navy Seals training is a hardcore testosterone-fueled boys club. And its a scary place to be. I'd liken it to a girl put into an all-boys public high-school. She's eaten alive at every turn. The viewer is put in the position of such vulnerability, because we are aligned with the one woman in a world full of bitter, threatened soldiers, constantly passing sexist comments and threatening to take advantage of the female Seal.There are moments that border on exploitation: Demi Moore's implants are put to good use in a sequence doing pushups in a short cut-off shirt, set to Three Dog Night's Mama Told Me (Not to Come). There is a speech intended for dafter viewers by an African-American character sympathising with Moore by likening her to his grandfather who was refused navy service on the grounds that African-Americans can't see at night (A surreal anecdote, but believable.) On the whole, however, the film is well made in Ridley's late style, which is to say, less style than his earlier pictures. It has several glimpses of the striking lighting which characterised his earlier pictures. My recommendations are as follows: 1) If you're looking for a silly movie, this is not one. Its dark.2) If you're looking for a dark war training picture, or a good drama, then I recommend it.3) If you're going through all Ridley Scott's movies as I am, this is a good three-star picture, but probably won't be one of your favourites by the end, which for me so far are Alien, Legend and Blade Runner.",6,1,5,29 September 2009
Meet the Parents," Man with funny name tries to impress demonic father-in-law to be: everything goes wrong.
","Greg (Ben Stiller) is a regular joe trying to impress a psychotic manipulative trouble-making father-in-law to be. It seems to make matters worse, however, that he's also a male nurse, jewish, and his legal name is Gaylord Focker, in this movie which is about as pleasant as taking a visit to a tooth-pulling dentist who is against using anaesthetics.The riffing on Greg's name is primary-school grade humour, and has that feeling of a cheap joke, kind of that 'i can feel a song coming on' feeling in bad musicals, just as bad is the 'we're throwing in a funny line' feeling.This is one of those movies where everything you could imagine might go wrong - does - and always to the detriment of poor Ben Stiller. By the time the resolution started happening, it was too late. There were just too many bad things that happened to Greg Focker.All this is not to say that its bad quality. Stiller hits the uncomfortable fiance thing perfectly. And the script is good - there are many moments, especially within the first half hour, that anyone who's ever met the parents before can associate with. Is it enjoyable, though? No, i didn't think so. Ironically, its because they draw you in so much that its so upsetting. You simply can't accept these tragic situations as comedy - you feel too sorry for Greg Focker.The resolution is fairly forced and implausible.6/10. But not for me. Too sadistic.Highlight: the airline hostess at the end.",6,1,2,18 July 2004
Inglourious Basterds," I had no reason to be nervous...
","I was nervous seeing this. Death Proof was a major disappointment, it felt all talk and no fun compared to the joyful Planet Terror; and my first experience with Kill Bill had left me scarred and distrustful of Quentin. I guess I thought I knew who he was after P.Fiction, R.Dogs and J.Brown; and probably all I wanted from him was witty dialogue. I guess I hadn't really paid attention to the other aspects of those films which QT has chosen to indulge long-term 1) they're all genre-exploitation 2) they all feature Surprise Symphony pacing, with long stretches that lull you into a sense of comfort, then sudden climaxes, of which several of his finest to date are contained in Inglourious Basterds.Even though I love Kill Bill now, and plan to never see Death Proof again, I decided to expect nothing from Inglourious Basterds. I decided that even if I didn't like it, I might grow to like it some day. Basically, all my fears were unnecessary. IB is an immediately satisfying and mature work of art, with incredible pacing and structure, and stories that pay off big time.More than anything else, IB demonstrates, perhaps just how much restraint QT is capable of. The moments are wrought with such Also, QT has finally given us some real characters, who seem to think and feel things. (Though obviously with a Tarantino-style panache). And damn it we really care what happens to them; which is something I don't think I've ever felt during one of his movies. This is landmark maturity from a director who has usually sacrificed sentiment for style. Not that this is a sentimental movie; God no. But I'll leave all of that up to your experience. Save to say that unless you're a bit squeamish and don't like violence at all, you'll want to see what Quentin Taratino has made for you.As someone who was a big fan of early Quentin; and hesitant follower of the Kill-Bill saga, IB finally makes Quentin into a fully-rounded and satisfying filmmaker; his most mature work to date, sacrificing none of his flair and style. Should go down in the books as his best film, if not as historically important as Pulp Fiction.",10,2,9,26 September 2009
Dawn of the Dead," Film School Re-hash of Zombie Clich√©s - but zombie action is eventually SUPOIB!
","(spoilers)I don't think this did anything to augment the genre - that's my main problem with it. I just started to feel very familiar watching it. Maybe because i've just seen Night of the Living Dead and 28 Days Later... recently, And maybe it was because I came in after the first ten minutes, by the time Sarah Polley was in the bathroom, i'd missed the shock effect of the (what i hear) exciting first scene. So everything after the first five just sort of washed over me. I was very excited before I saw it, too... maybe i'd built it up too much. Too much plot, not enough zombie action for me. Maybe I just expected a zombie-a-minute roller-coaster, but instead got a sort of traditionally photographed too-modern looking character piece. Who gives a rat's dropping about the characters - I wanna see some zombies!Oh, and the other thing I felt while watching it: every new contemporary director gets their assignment, and its like 'Return of the Evil Vampire Lesbians,' but they inject all these unnecessary camera movements and pretentious film-school devices in there - its like they think its Return of Citizen Kane. I particularly noticed this while watching the Italian Job remake. I squirmed listening to the director on the special features (not my decision, Mrs Clifford was controlling the remote) talking his movie up Tarantino-style. It just makes me feel like watching The Toxic Avenger and exorcising my rage at film-school grads who take themselves too seriously.I don't mind art movies - love them, in fact, but if I go to see a self-conscious movie for artistic value, I expect it to be about something original, unique, and perhaps weighty. The last place I want to find art is in a movie called 'Dawn of the Dead'. Basically, I went into Dawn of the Dead expecting a slash-and-burn zombie flick, like Night of the Living Dead - I expected to have fun! But what i got was too many traditional dialogue scenes, a director who tried to take zombies seriously (as evidence I use the bathroom scene where Ving Rhames and that other guy try desperately to relate a plague of zombies to what they learned at Sunday school: is this the end of the world, what does it all mean, what's the meaning of life... you catch the drift... pretentious fooey!).The one beacon of light in all this seriousness was the scene where Ving Rhames and Andy play chess across the street from each other, and the 'pick a zombie who looks like a famous person and sniper him' scene. But this I think was bad for a different reason: we want to have fun at the zombie movie, but we don't necessarily want to make it seem like humans might have FUN killing zombies... because these zombies look quite a lot like humans... and it comes across very badly, considering the seriousness of everything preceding it. Especially in light of the recent Washington sniper, and videogames like Carmageddon which suggest children get points for running over pedestrians - after Bowling for Columbine, I think movies like this should be careful in making shooting things, no matter in what fictional situation, seem fun. Clifford's Tips:If you're of suitable age (definitely no youngsters - mums and dads, the violence is pretty hardcore), remember to stay during the credits.I'd still recommend you see the movie, purely for the mass-crowd zombie scenes: this is the advantage of a big Hollywood budget. When it comes, the zombie action is very good. They just didn't have the resources for this in 68'. I don't know how they did it, but they've got very convincing footage of trucks slamming into several zombies (which made my skin crawl a little for the same reasons as the sniper scene) - and scenes with a sea of zombies. You're unlikely to see such good scenes of zombies in any other zombie flick (or zombie FILM, as this director would have you believe).",Null,0,1,25 June 2004
12 Monkeys," Its like Brazil, but with a bigger budget.
","If you haven't seen Terry Gilliam's seminal dystopian film Brazil, 12 Monkeys might just be one of the strangest things you've ever seen. Its a very strange, dark time-hopping sci-fi adventure where Bruce Willis is sent back from the future to stop the annihilation of the human race by a mass plague (there were a few survivors, who now live underground). Its the sort of film where you have to keep asking yourself 'is this real?'On a side note, if i see another Terry Gilliam special feature stuffed with his nauseating laugh and complaints about 'the studio wouldn't let us do this' or 'money problems' i think i'll scream. Stop whinging about it. Hitchcock and John Ford could make marvellous pictures negotiating between their own wishes and the studio's without complaining, so why don't you.Why You Should See This: one superlatively good performance from Brad Pitt as a crazy guy which is surely one of the best things to come out of the 90's.8/10. Essential Terry Gilliam. If you're fairly conservative in you're viewing tastes, you might not like it!",8,0,0,8 July 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Rollicking great fun. It works b.c of tongue-in-cheek Depp.
","'But where's the rum gone!'All Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, who's Erroll Flynn meets Keith Richards) wants is to drink rum, swagger and regain control of the beloved ship he was cast from, The Black Pearl. Its convenient that he stumbles across Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who both may be exploited to get the Pearl back, and has a mission of his own, rescuing the princess, which Depp can go along with...Rousing, hearty, swashbuckling good entertainment. If Hollywood blockbusters were always this much fun (and always had Johnny Depp to bolster them and make them tongue-in-cheek), then i'd say more power to them. Its travesties like Pearl Harbour that insult the public's sense of taste.If you can overlook the lack of effort and skills from Orlando Bloom (doing his best Matthew Broderick impersonation - which is easy, just make your face as blank as possible)8/10. Its a masterpiece of the order of Back to the Future and Raiders of the Lost Ark. It lost big points from me because i found Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann to be corny and cliche, and am still amazed that people consider what Orlando Bloom does 'acting.' Plus, and maybe this is my fault, but i saw it three times within the space of a month, and by the third time its appeal was waning. It seems that unlike something like Mr Bean, or something as visually beautiful as Lawrence of Arabia, it doesn't have unlimited replayability. That probably means that its not to deep. Which it isn't - its very surface entertainment - which means you can only reap so much value from it.'And really bad eggs... Drink up me 'earties, yo ho!'",10,0,2,14 July 2004
The Girl Next Door," This sweet romantic comedy is ABOUT not PART OF the porn industry.
","Matthew has spent his high-school years valuing high-achieving, so when he meets (Elisha Cuthbert) in the lead-up to his scholarship application speech for Georgetown, she helps him see some other sides to himself. Things change when he finds out she might be from an entirely different side of the tracks...The marketing was somewhat misleading for this flick. Although the concepts are definitely for mature audiences - a porn industry event (sans nudity), two short shots of actual porn, quite a bit of language and adult themes, this movie is not by any means exploitation. The radiant Elisha Cuthbert who we've come to know and love from 24 is beautiful but doesn't have to do any frontal nudity.Its basically a sweet romantic comedy at heart, a coming of age story, and a story about leaving high-school that everyone can relate to. Like I said, i'd still recommend only mature audiences - but for us, its a surprisingly sweet evening.",8,4,5,14 September 2005
Finding Nemo," Call me unpopular, but...
","This is great entertainment, don't get me wrong, but i can't help feeling that Disney is cheating the consumer by making movies more like products than artworks. There are some new jokes in this movie, but they've just used the same formula they've been using since Walt was a boy.
When Shrek first came out, i thought - wow! Disney has taken a big leap here. It was clever, satirical, and hugely funny.Then, when Monster's Ink, Toy Story 2 and then Finding Nemo came out, it made me remember every single handdrawn Disney since the forties - there's always two people, usually males, a big person and a little person, at first they don't get along, and at the end they realise the most important thing - their friendship. Shrek and Donkey, Buzz and Woody, Sulley and Mike, Flik and the circus bugs, Simba and Nala, Timon and Pumba, Fox and Hound, Beauty and Beast, Lilo and Stitch, Mermaid and Flounder, Lady and Tramp, Mannie and Sid (Ice Age), Dumbo and Timothy Q Mouse, Pinnochio and Jiminy Cricket, Alladin and Abu, the list goes on. Ooh, i almost forgot: Marlin and Dory.It was sweet the first time, but by now its tired. The latest toy off the production line is 'Brother Bear'... need i say more?Give us something remotely new, innovative, like the small step forward Shrek was.",6,1,2,16 October 2003
Ed Wood," Burton: 'We remember, we care'
","This is Tim Burton saying that no matter how many people don't care about B-horror pictures, he does, and showing us that there can be poetry in them. 'Ed Wood' is a bio-pic of real-life B-hollywood director Edward D Wood Jr, done in the style of one of his pictures - unexplained framing devices, like Criswell's introduction, noirish lighting for no apparent reason, and incidental performances by actors who look like they've just shown up and not been told what part they're supposed to be playing. These last, like the doctor in Lugosi's hospital, are provided for colour, but are an example of the balance struck in this picture. It has the expression of a comedy - yes, we're asked to laugh at Wood's haphazard way of making pictures, and we can laugh about how terrible the pictures are, but beneath the comedy a great truth is found, and a message Tim Burton is passionate about is expressed. The heart of Ed Wood is really in the character of 'washed-up' Dracula star Bela Lugosi (played to a tee and rewarded with an Oscar, by Martin Landau).
Twenty years after Dracula, Lugosi's career was over. Nobody cared about him. It was like, as is Hollywood lore, you're only as good as the last thing you've done. And whatever classic roles or films you may have done, it all counts for nothing if you do a bad picture. This theme of the cruel way Hollywood forgets its greatest talents is also why the name Orson Welles keeps cropping up. Its not because Welles made pictures like Ed Wood's, its because, like with Lugosi, Welles's having made what is considered to be the greatest picture of all time, Citizen Kane, counted for nothing in Hollywood. If your pictures didn't make money, you were useless - so Hollywood did everything it could to keep him from working - RKO sabotaged his Ambersons, and eventually he could not get backing for many great pictures in Hollywood that, and here there is another analogy with Ed Wood, he raised money for himself and made independently. It is this determination to succeed, and persist in your work no matter what others think of it that makes Ed Wood (thanks to a terrific fun performance from Johnny Depp) such an important and admirable character. You can't help liking Ed, for his irrepressible spirit and optimism. It was Ed Wood who gave Lugosi another chance, the content of which Burton  romanticises and focuses on in his film. Ed Wood cared about Lugosi's work - Wood didn't care about popular opinion which said Lugosi was 'washed up,' whatever that meant. Wood had seen Dracula, and Lugosi was a legend, and that was all that mattered. Wood gave him the chance to be in pictures again, symbolising the appreciation of great works, not recent moneymakers. Burton and Martin Landau give the legend of Bela Lugosi his last great performance, turning him into the tragic figure to end all tragic figures. His performance of his 'I have no home speech' set to stirring, haunting music, on the steps of the hospital - his performance of the infamous flower-smelling scene from Plan Nine from Outer Space, the last footage Lugosi ever shot - all have the tone of appreciating a legend, giving Lugosi his due, saying who gives a sh*t if Hollywood doesn't remember, we remember.",8,0,0,1 March 2004
The Prestige," Competent but not stellar. Or interstellar.
","Professional rivalries between magicians in Victorian London: fun subject matter? Well, its quite melancholy in Christopher Nolan's hands. Its let down a bit by the casting of Hugh Jackman; he's just somehow miscast as a Victorian magician.Its a hard film to love. Everyone is just a little too spiky and distant, there's not a single character you engage with. It feels more like a technical exercise than an engaging story. Its just a little too conventional in its Love-Triangle style construction. I like it better than Now You See Me for example, but less than other Nolan pictures like Inception and Interstellar. I didn't love The Prestige in 2006 and I still don't love it in 2015; funny how some things don't change.7/10",2,1,4,14 May 2015
Catch-22," An absolute shambles. A disgrace of an adaptation. Robs the story of its humour.
","Catch-22 was always going to be tricky to adapt, because its a panoramic novel whose value is in structure, and the way one chapter is devoted to each character name, whereby we learn little by little about the main character Yossarian and various important aspects of the air-force base. But the absolute minimum I expect an adaptation of Catch-22 to capture is its essence, that spirit of cynical black comedy. You've got to remember, its an uproariously funny book.So aside from the failed attempt to tell any coherent version of Catch-22 in a two-hour movie, the main thing which makes Mike Nichols' attempt such a blasphemous insult to the novel, is its robbing it almost completely of its humour.Another movie was made in 1970 which uses black comedy to expose the insanity of war. Despite that movie's bearing no resemblance to Catch-22 plotwise, Robert Altman's classic MASH is a closer adaptation of the spirit of Joseph Heller's novel, than the movie which bears its name.The atmosphere here is sticky, hot, dusty and unpleasant - so we're not removed enough to be able to laugh. The performances are shoddy - particularly poor Art Garfunkel (he's only a musician, sir, leave him be! - and i will) and less excusably, virtually deserving a defamation suit from Joseph Heller's Yossarian, who no doubt would be amused by the whole thing, Mike Nichols' Yossarian, Alan Arkin. Terrible, weak performance. He looks like he's constantly smirking - yet he's not funny! No! All wrong!Catch-22 is interesting because of how rare it is that you find a movie this bad, and interesting because Orson Welles is briefly in it (only one or two scenes), though i'd warn Welles fans to steer clear of this. Even completists.Needless to say, anyone who's read the book, this movie will not only not live up to your expectations, it will actually ruin your memory of the book, and make you believe the book was not as good as you thought. Well, you thought right! The book is terrific, funny, clever! Read the book again! I can't warn you any sterner than this.3/10 for hiring Orson Welles.",3,10,25,27 June 2004
The Doors," Absorbing movie - i didn't want it to end. (my only friend...)
","Utterly absorbing bio-pic of Jim Morrison. The name Val Kilmer is, or should be, synonymous with incredible acting that is not merely natural or convincing, but immensely fun and commanding. You may have noticed while watching his recent Wonderland - Val has the ability to make a picture. Here, he IS The Doors: The Movie. There, he WAS Wonderland. I am exaggerating, i suppose. For Oliver Stone has crafted a marvellous film which makes you feel like you've experienced what the sixties were like. Through using The Doors actual music (what was missing from the recent Sylvia, the art of the subject itself - her poetry) to help tell its story and colour its scenes, and filmic techniques to create the drug-induced world vision of Jim Morrison, Stone really takes you into the world of his movie, and the world of the sixties.This movie made me appreciate what an exciting experience The Doors were, and has actually cultivated love in me for their music. I didn't realise they had more than one classic: Light my Fire, The End, People are Strange, Love her Madly, Break on Through to the Other Side, Riders on the Storm, Touch Me, Roadhouse Blues (Let it roll, baby roll) and probably more i'm yet to discover.For a better recreation of what Andy Warhol's factory actually felt like, see I Shot Andy Warhol. Crispin Glover actually looks more like Andy than the guy who plays him in 'I Shot,' but the guy in I Shot much better captured Andy's vagueness and almost unconsciousness while in conversation. This, however, is but three minutes in the movie and has no effect on it as a whole.Oliver Stone has an amusing cameo: a young film student, Jim Morrison, shows his short film to his class, who are uncouth and disparaging about it, after which camera pans to reveal Oliver Stone standing at the lecturn, (obviously, playing the film professor), who says: 'Why don't we ask the author what he thinks?'",8,45,60,29 February 2004
Battleship Potemkin," Wow
","I was quite moved by Battleship Potemkin. I had shivers up my spine through so much of it: the firing squad scene, the plate with the religious phrase on it, the scene where the leader is hanging on a life-raft, the incredible crowd scenes, but most strikingly, the Odessa steps massacre. The nuanced performances are some of the most subtle and effective i've seen in silent films, though this is more of an action film than a straight drama, truth be told. I was surprised to find myself cheering for the revolutionaries on the Potemkin, and was in awe of the power of Eisenstein's cinema.
The Odessa steps sequence is one of the finest things i've ever seen: the glorious tracking shots down the steps, the fast-paced editing, the little boy being shot, then the close-ups of his hands being trampled on by the crowd fleeing from the Cossacks, then finally the magestic moment of his mother carrying him in her arms in the pieta position, walking angrily towards the marching, descending row of Cossacks, demanding restitution. The most powerful single shot i've ever seen is the shot from behind her, carrying her boy in her arms, walking towards the ordered ranks of Cossacks, who march towards her. The famous pram down the steps is marvellously chilling, as is the woman shot through the eye of her glasses.I look forward to checking out more Eisenstein. This is my first, at time of writing, and i was very impressed.",10,2,3,29 March 2004
Elf," Find out: why Will Ferrell's performance is a good one, and which radiant newcomer to look out for...
","As the delightful human who was raised by elves at the north pole, Will Ferrell, the greatest new comic actor out, walks a fine line between satire and genuineness.If he played Buddy completely for laughs, the movie would not imbue the audience with christmas spirit, and make us forget our doubts for a magical hour and a half.If he played Buddy completely subversively, poking fun at the christmas myth, adults would perhaps have had a few more laughs than they did.The reason Ferrell's performance is one of the best comic performances in recent memory, is that it serves both these purposes: there is a hint of satire in Ferrell's over-the-top enthusiasm, yet the innocence on his face appears absolutely genuine. One of the greatest sources of humour in the movie comes from actually believing Buddy has the mind of a child.Truly a remarkable thing. After this he goes on my list of greatest comic actors.My other favourite thing about this movie (which i found absolutely magical) was exciting newcomer Zooey Deschanel. She was absolutely radiant in this movie. I would watch it again just to watch her. She played William's sister in 'Almost Famous' who leaves home to become an airline hostess (and plays Simon & Garfunkel's 'America' to her mother to explain why she must, in one of the movies's best scenes). She also played one of the funniest characters in 'The Good Girl' - Cheryl who remedies her boredom with her job by insulting customers without their understanding. I've now become a pilgrim of hers, and will follow movies wherever she goes. And believe me, i'm not usually this enthusastic!",Null,1,3,13 December 2003
Lost in Translation," spellbinding
","This film, scripted and directed by Sofia Coppola (Virgin Suicides) is certainly the best you'll see this year.It is completely genuine, and brilliantly realised. You get the feeling that the tale of this movie has not been contrived for entertainment purposes (although it is lively, funny, and moving) - but that we are being given a rare opportunity - a window into the lives of two fascinating people (both treated with equal understanding and compassion by Coppola - a rare thing in movies). At times you forget that you're watching a movie at all, it draws you in so well. It has the kind of brilliant direction that Orson Welles most liked in other directors - the kind that you don't notice, but that creates the experience and tells the story really well.Every moment of this subtle, moving story of two americans lost in Tokyo, alienated from everything else around them, is quite simply enchanting.",9,1,2,20 December 2003
Interstellar," Nolan solves the space epic: breathtaking for three hours!
","edit: no idea why this review is so unpopular. I loved Interstellar, I loved 2001: A Space Odyssey, but find 2001 too glacial and was impressed by the amount of pathos Nolan provided in this genre. Yes, HAL is an incredible character, like a spurned lover, but I'm never moved like I was while watching Interstellar.-BenA great director tries his hand at a space epic and the results are remarkable.Thematically, the film is mindblowing; theatrically, the film is mindblowing. There are echoes of Kubrick's 2001, but this time with feeling. There is humour, pathos and incredible scenes of technical wizardry. Special effects sure have come a long way since 2000's The Perfect Storm. The scene featuring the large 'mountains' was incredible.Incredible performances, characters you care about, a long movie that will grab hold of you through its entire length. Matthew McConaghey is great. He is a far more likable and human figure than Di Caprio was in Inception. I'd rank this up with Memento as Nolan's greatest achievement. Great to see him have the time to solve the space epic.10/10",10,3,10,12 May 2015
Full Metal Jacket," About individualism at war. A memorable work, except for voiceover.
","(SPOILERS! I pretty much describe what happens in the movie)Its structure mirrors the experience of the individual at war. Not the entire war like Griffith's Birth of a Nation, not the family at war like The Patriot or Saving Private Ryan, or a platoon like The Thin Red Line or Platoon, but a very individual individual: as in an American who values his individual values and personal expression (Matthew Modine). What is his place in war - which is a collective institution, something the United States is not naturally. The US values individualism, which is the conflict at the centre of Full Metal Jacket.The movie is all about the relation between the individual and the group: you start off by yourself in the barber's chair, yet to the barber (and to the audience, during the credits), you're just another face in a long line of anonymous recruits. Without realising it yet, you've already lost your individuality. Then, during basic training, you're with a misleadingly cohesive and small group of people, and the hard-ass drill-seargent (in a memorable turn from a real drill seargent that Kubrick hired to put the actors through realistic basic training and liked him so much he decided to use him in the movie) tries to make you all look and act the same, the way he wants you to act. But basic training ends, and you don't necessarily see the same people again - so we don't. Many characters we never meet again. Matthew Modine, being an individual, chooses the only way to express yourself at war, journalism. Then, when Modine finally goes out into the field, its not a large-scale depiction of an important manouevre, but a small-scale, just a small group moving around until they get into trouble, without any idea of the relevance of their specific actions in the large picture of the war.I love Full Metal Jacket - its another highly sculpted and architectured work by Kubrick - and an unforgettable one, with great music. I always find the last part particularly visceral - with the sniper. A great metaphor for the uselessness of war. The group are not achieving anything by moving through this area, its just a routine movement from place to place, but they get themselves one by one knocked down by a sniper, because they can't just walk away, they can't stop themselves from involving themselves. And when they finally meet the enemy (SPOILERS WARNING!), they are nothing like they imagined - hardly a menace at all.My only regret about Full Metal Jacket is the voiceover. You know how you sometimes listen to a voiceover and its really obvious that the actor who's speaking it has not made the film yet, or has no idea of his character, or anything to do with the situation. Matthew Modine's voiceover stands out for me as the single worst example of this, particularly in a phenomenal picture like Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.9/10.",10,1,3,1 July 2004
10 Things I Hate About You," Charming and memorable teen flick with star-making turn for Heath Ledger.
","This memorable 90's teen flick is a real charmer with lots of good laughs, even after multiple viewings. Its the sort of movie which will always cheer you up.Its terrifically written. It takes the general story framework of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, a great location, a terrific cast of memorable supporting characters, great dialogue, Heath Ledger's star-making turn (and star making 'Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You' scene) remains his most memorable ninety minutes.It contains many memorable moments and scenes, and is well worth seeing.",10,0,0,7 March 2005
Predator," When I was like 10 a friend told me there was a movie where this alien hunts down dudes and kills them one by one...
","Predator is an epic, primal adventure; a fight between man and beast, hunter and prey, a tale of survival of the fittest. The Predator is a creature with neon green blood, thermal vision, an invisibility cloak. Its prey are a bunch of bros with guns, including classic parts for Carl Weathers and Arnold Schwarznegger. If not for all of his other career-making role in The Terminator, this would be my first exposure to Arnie, as we called him then. He represented, in this movie, the absolute best a man can be. He's good-looking, strong, makes decisions, and says things like 'get to the chopper' without a shred of irony. He also says 'if it bleeds, we can kill it,' and 'Do it, do it now!' which are just fun to drop into any dinner party. The movie is a masterclass in pacing for action films. It works equally well as an action and horror film. In fact, it is the originator of a structure that I have come to think of as the Predator Structure, where people are hunted down and die one by one until only one remains. Its standard blu ray release has incredible sound quality, but just a passable picture. The film was shot with a lot of low lighting, and that doesn't tend to pop on in definition. Its murky and grainy, but still looks better than the previous DVD release. The only thing that has not aged well are the special effects related to the alien technology: the Predator's heat vision and invisibility cloak always looked bad, but they look positively silly in high def. Once you're used to them, you can easily look past.Who am I kidding, my love for Predator and Arnie in this movies goes way beyond the measured art of reviewing. This was a childhood favourite of mine and yes I had an awesome childhood. I first heard about it on the handball courts in primary school from this description 'an alien hunts down a bunch of marines and kills them one by one, its awesome.' I instantly wanted to watch that movie as soon as I could, and I loved it then and have loved it ever since.",8,3,3,26 August 2015
Cold Mountain," The fatal flaw with the film, and why Nicole Kidman will lose her career if she's not careful.
","Cold Mountain alternates between the stories of Nicole Kidman, waiting at home for her sweetheart to return from the civil war, and Jude Law, her sweetheart trying to find his way back to her. For conflict we have a rather nasty band of home guard who race around killing deserters... But Jude Law is a deserter... oh no! Run, Jude, run!Another period tragedy masquerading as romance adapted from a famous novel by Anthony Minghella. This time its a sweethearts separated by the civil war 'tell me a tale' story. The plot is Mills and Boone / Midday Melodrama, but so exquisitely filmed with such an exquisite soundtrack that we hardly notice. It maintains a sombre tone throughout, and goes for tears almost non-stop.I've pinned down the fatal flaw with the film. I felt that Kidman and Law had zero chemistry: that the film worked, but when the two finally met up, it felt wrong, like they were two separate satellites, individually fine, but there was nothing between them. Its built into the structure of the movie. The two hardly know each other before he goes off to war: they kiss, she gives him a photo and speaks in a poor southern accent, and that's it. Then they spend the entire movie not sharing the screen. They have their completely separate story-lines: him at war, and then journeying back to her; her at home waiting for him. So by the time they finally meet, we have gotten to know them both as independent from each other - and somehow this fits. Which is why it seems wrong once they're together. And there's the fact that Kidman is an ICE QUEEN!She's becoming increasingly cold and distant - and looking more and more like Vivien Leigh. If she's not careful, she may just end up like Vivien. Her career is in danger of disappearing if she doesn't come back down to earth, experience the real world and real people again.For a female protagonist in this film we needed somebody who the audience could associate with, imprint themselves on - instead we have someone with only relevance to her insulated celluloid world than to us, the audience. She's like a porcelain doll: elegant, but nothing to do with reality.Zellweger is a definite scene-stealing highlight. A unique, vibrant character - almost a broad character, but not a 2D character.5/10. Everything about its look is 10/10 stuff. Superb cinematography, great performances from Jude Law, albeit iffy southern accents right the way through, and despite the fact that I did not like Kidman at all in this, I enjoyed it, but its flawed, to my mind, by the lack of a chemistry, and Nicole Kidman's unwelcoming, mannered persona.",5,18,33,14 July 2004
American Psycho," One of the darkest, most cynical movies ever made - but maybe not for the reasons you think.
","I think this movie deserves to be controversial, but not for the reasons it has. I don't believe it is in any way irresponsible filmmaking - never did i feel the filmmakers were endorsing the behaviour of Patrick Bateman and the society he was a part of (1987 New York Yuppie) - if anything, they too strongly hint to the audience that they are satirising this materialistic world through turning character into charicature. In fact, this movie gives new viciousness to the word 'satire.'It is a fascinating movie - absolutely compelling, in fact. Its cartoon-like characters are marvellous to watch, and often it is very funny, though we are constantly reminded that the jokes are at the expense of these obnoxious characters, who in turn are sending up an entire way of life now referred to as 'the excesses of the 80's.' But through this very specific period-grounding of the film (1987, constantly reinforced through the soundtrack and the fashion victims...badum, ching!) the movie creates a very dark picture of human nature in general, and warns against letting society become like this again, where material worth and surface value are all that matter.At one point Bateman's girlfriend says to him, 'We have to talk.' He replies: 'You look gorgeous, there's nothing to talk about.' This precice bit of dialogue encapsulates the lack of real human interaction in this society. No two characters properly have a conversation in this movie - everyone is constantly performing a monologue at someone else, to satisfy their own whims.The director described the movie as having dual stories: Bateman's group of 'friends' and business associates provide social satire of this vacuous society, and the other story follows the misadventures of Patrick Bateman, Serial Killer by Night. This part of the movie is really no different to any other crime movie, where we follow the criminal. Certainly not as controversial as i had heard, because the filmmakers are constantly trying to make a point.(spoilers... what i think that point is...)These two stories are not totally independent, they very much serve each other. The central point of Bateman's being a serial killer is a very dark demonstration of what one does if one loses all contact with other human beings. If you only care about surfaces, and not about anything deeper, then there's no reason not to go out and slaughter people, if this satisfies you. In this way, Bateman is enabled by the society around him (which encourages the worship of surfaces). This is perfectly presented in the final scene of the movie, which may seem not very climactic action-wise, because it is mainly a climax of the unification of these two story lines. No-one will listen to Bateman when he tries to confess his crimes. No-one will hear him, because everyone only cares about themselves and surfaces. The irony of Bateman's uncontrollably going out and killing people at whim is that this then becomes a secret for him, something deep and real, that, perhaps for the first time, he feels emotion over. It is something that goes beyond the usual 'where should we make a reservation' or 'check out my new business card' chit-chat that is the level this people live on. So when he tries to tell his lawyer this, the lawyer suddenly pretends not to know him.(spoilers still!)Identity is a big thing for Patrick Bateman, which explores the issue: if the physical/material is all that matters in this society, what is a human being? At the beginning Bateman tells us he has all the physical attributes of a human being, but on the inside, there's nothing, just an empty shell. This is why Bateman's mentioning 'the inside' again in the final scene is significant. Ghostly visual references to Bateman only being an empty shell abound: Bateman's face is constantly shown hidden, distorted through translucent glass.(end spoilers)I think its a movie to see. I saw it again, and liked it a whole heap more the second time. The more you see it, the more of its satire you pick up (not that its subtle, but you laugh at it more).",8,0,1,19 April 2004
North by Northwest," I finally get how great it is: Hitch infuses his wrong-man caper with ironic movie language and reality-be-damned escapism and suspense.
","Its Hitch's most briskly entertaining movie, and one of his most comic, adventure-caper type movies, largely thanks to the persona of Cary Grant. But its also one of his most suspenseful - in the fact that Grant is being recognised as someone else, and that he may be put in jail for someone else's crime.I've finally come to realise just how great North by Northwest is. The reason you should love Hitchcock is he put entertainment upfront.  Hitchcock was not interested in whether this or that would happen in real life: he was interested in what would make the most entertaining scene for the movie. North by Northwest is a peak in this regard. The dialogue and situations intentionally throw reality to the wind - the double-entendre dialogue in the love scenes is not supposed to be the way people talk!If you said to Hitchcock 'as if he'd keep driving' or 'as if she'd do that' - he would just laugh at you and say you've missed the point. This is 100% movieland, and once you get used to the fact, and that this is not a fault in the film, but done intentionally, you'll love it. Its expressionistic - everything happens in movie language: the people laughing at Grant in the elevator, the way he keeps driving drunk near the beginning, the way he grabs the knife and everyone stares at him after someone's been stabbed.It flirts with the idea of identity. I thought it was interesting how Grant first is dismissing, then incredulous that people should be calling him by another name; then, as the tries to find out who this guy is, he enters the hotel room of this new identity, then he puts the suit on, and finally he identifies himself as George Kaplan.A succession of fantastic, memorable scenes, a great leading man in Grant, and one of Hermann's essential Hitch scores make for a movie i can put on at any time.10/10",8,186,264,24 July 2004
Doctor Zhivago," Not one of my favourite Lean pictures, and not one of his best. The widescreen visual is the reason to see Zhivago - so make sure you see the widescreen version.
","I didn't enjoy Zhivago when I saw it on TV, but since then i've discovered a great passion for David Lean, with the help of two rapturous viewings (my first two ever) of Lawrence of Arabia, and the sumptuous A Passage to India. So I decided to give Zhivago another chance, and bought the widescreen DVD.I'm glad I did, because pan/scan had spoiled the point of every single frame of Zhivago. As usual, David Lean has gone to painstaking lengths to position his figures in particular positions in the sumptuous widescreen, and by panning and scanning for where those figures are in the images and chopping off a quarter on either side the entire film is butchered.SO I URGE YOU: TO GET THE FULL VALUE OUT OF THIS BEAUTIFUL-LOOKING FILM, DO NOT WATCH IT ON TV: THE AD BREAKS RUIN THE FLOW, AND THE POINT, AND THE IMAGE IS BUTCHERED 4 TV, RUINING THE FILM. SEE ONLY WIDESCREEN!!!Its still not a patch on Lawrence, which is one of the most exciting visual experiences you'll ever have, and not as entrancing as Passage to India, which has both breathtaking cinematography and is buoyed by a superb central performance from Judy Davis.We are never drawn in by the story of Zhivago because we never feel there is any connection between Julie Christie and Omar Sharif. This film is supposed to be one of those Gone With the Wind-esque love stories, but as that it fails.Contrary to what Omar Sharif tells us (very slowly!) in the DVD's introduction, Zhivago is not a classic, and it will not always be considered one. But in tune with an ironic quote on the DVD's back, it may be compared to Gone with the Wind. It has attained classic status the same way Gone with the Wind did - by adopting all the outer signs of a classic, the beautiful colours, actors and music - but forgetting performance, story and structure. Not realising that the heart of the movie, the relationship between Lara and Zhivago, needed more attention or the entire film seems pointless.7/10. As long as you see it in widescreen, you'll appreciate the beauty that is in Zhivago, and realize why you're watching it. However, the relentless British accents in this Russian tale, the little boy's lines being dubbed by an old woman, Tom Courtenay, and the lack of compassion we feel for Lara and Zhivago, and they feel for each other - all these things flaw the film fatally.",4,4,15,22 July 2004
Tropic Thunder," Tropic Thunder is a movie about a movie playing another movie
","Apparently, Ben Stiller met actors who were in Platoon and talked about it like they'd been to war, and that struck him as ridiculous and many years later, he helped turn that thought into a war movie.Tropic Thunder is basically a self-aware action-comedy, a satire on the vanity of movie actors. Its easy to misjudge it, I've found. On first viewing, I just didn't think there were enough jokes. Its a strange animal because it has its feet equally in the action and comedy camps. Its almost as much about becoming the thing, as it is about satirising it. The movie I think is interesting in the way it pushes through the meta stuff to get to some kind of reality. It would make a good introductory text for a class on the nature of truth and reality, if not for how easily misunderstood its dialogue about race and disability groups are. While its clear to me that the intention is to make fun of movie actors at all times, I can understand how some people might have felt the movie was irresponsible in its messages with the 'Simple Jack' storyline and the blackface storyline. I know Downey Jr. was conflicted about accepting the role of a method actor who gets so immersed in his role as a black seargent that he can't drop character, but I'm glad he did accept it, because he's hilarious. He steals every scene he's in. As does Tom Cruise, who many didn't recognise until the closing credits, back in the day. Some of the team players get forgotten. Jay Baruschel is an excellent straight-man. He's the character we relate to, the one actor who hasn't been swallowed up by vanity. Jack Black also has a bit of a thankless job. He's unpleasant as the Fatties star, unpleasant as the drug addict, and has one hilarious scene when he's tied up to the tree. Steve Coogan also has an important part, and he plays it well. Back in 2008, I was expecting maybe Zoolander or Anchorman, which have maybe 50% more jokes. Tropic Thunder is a different animal. Its a bit more measured, but its way more exciting and immersive than any of the other over the top comedies it gets lumped along with.",8,3,5,3 September 2015
The Usual Suspects," Over-wrought.
","(major spoilers - plus, if you're a fan of the film, you won't like my review)I've never understood the fuss made over this movie - every time its been on TV i've watched the first five minutes, and rolled my eyes for various reasons (the first time it was Gabriel Byrne's accent, the other times it was how over-wrought everything was) and put something good on instead.I've finally given it the light of day tonight, to the end, and my feeling is this: one minute of cleverness at the end does not justify putting us through two hours of over-wrought actors playing at cops and robbers.The general situation is so very familiar - the crims who get together for one last job that goes wrong, and the way its told is not fresh either: the structure of the framing narrative in the present day and the flashbacks which take us back to a past event we want to learn the truth about, comes from Citizen Kane and Rashomon (ie, on its own does not make this movie original). The constant promise of a final mystery, which is intended to propel us to the end was invented by Orson Welles, and is a device used quite frequently (Citizen Kane, Rashomon, Go, Memento, The Exterminating Angel, and most movies, in fact).For two hours this is a lot of posing, actors dressed in 'slumming-it' costumes straight from the costume designer's wardrobe, cliche dialogue, unbelievable situations, one unsustainable haircut, stubble and a lot of brooding 'i'm a criminal' close-ups.There is a justified reason for all this falseness (aka pretentiousness), given in the final two minutes, which i can't even bring myself to say in case you haven't seen it and are still reading - i've had too many movies ruined for me. Save to say, like The Sixth Sense, this movie is a one-gimmick movie, and it takes watching it for two hours to find out that gimmick (which is the only possible explanation for characters having what i like to call Stephen King names, by which i mean they sound like someone has sat down and thought 'What's a really cool name i can make up?' instead of names real people would have. Or possibly 'what's the wackiest name i can give a person and have the audience not laugh' - if this was the case, they failed with me. Every time someone said 'Verbal Kint,' 'Kobayashi,' or 'Kaiser Sosay' i couldn't help giggling) - i spent two hours rolling my eyes and two minutes saying 'yes, that's clever, but if people didn't equate twists with quality then i could have enjoyed the entire two hours - but it would not have been this movie, which is nothing without its gimmick. I had the same problem with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind - i need more than one gimmick to keep me interested.",1,51,86,8 May 2004
The Pianist," Incredible survival story, and incredible demonstration of the power of cinema.
","No other medium in the world has the power to illustrate for us what life would have been like in certain periods of the past but the cinema. One of the most important periods to not let go forgotton is the massacre and repression of Jews in Germany and occupied europe. If war and racism led to people to be killed like dogs and worse, simply for belonging to a certain group, then everyone should know about it, in my opinion, to keep history from repeating itself, and to make sure they didn't die for nothing. Don't turn your back on it - stare this movie in the face and look at what racism and intolerance can lead humans to do to other humans.Scene after scene of such penetrating truth and honesty encapsulate in cinematic episodes the horrors committed by the Nazis, the state of desperation of the Jews and many other aspects of this horrible ordeal, based on the personal memoirs of the main character, famed Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It was based on the memoirs of Szpilman, which means we know he survives the war, and it was marketed with this in mind, as a survival story. And this, of course, is the main attraction to this movie: not to put oneself through experiencing the horrors of war, which i nevertheless believe is important, but of finding out how in heck a Jew living in Nazi occupied Poland could have survived, and as such it is a remarkable story of hope and courage against unbelievable odds. And not one calculated by a Hollywood studio to manipulate you - this stuff really happened, and to the character portrayed in this movie by Adrian Brody. Some of it also happened to Roman Polanski himself, which made this a very personal project for him.As i mentioned at the beginning, this movie demonstrates the power of cinema, and one of its central themes is the power of the arts, particularly music, to affect people, to make them feel.",8,2,5,2 April 2004
The Elephant Man," Superb haunting story about human nature.
","With a crowd bearing down on him, the tortured cry of The Elephant Man (John Hurt) rings out: 'I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being!'Set in Victorian England, it looks into the Freak Show trade that was popular then, through one particular gentleman, grossly and uniquely deformed, by the name of John Merrick (The Elephant Man), and is based on the memoirs of the doctor played by Anthony Hopkins, Dr Frederick Treves. It shows the humanity of poor Mr Merrick and condemns the society that exploited him for its own monetary gain and sick pleasure.The story itself is a difficult one, and i'm surprised that any producer, even someone as offbeat as Mel Brooks, would have agreed to pour money into this idea. It has none of the classic elements of the commercial formula for making a movie that will make money: it has no love story, it has no sex, and, without spoiling too much, it is quite a tragic, unhappy story.The pervasive tragedy of the story is that John Merrick is an intelligent man, trapped inside this hideously misshapen body. Hanging over the head of the story is also the fact that nothing can be done for Mr Merrick. And the metaphor running throughout is that Merrick is no elephant man at all, he's just as human as the rest of us, but this exhibitionist, heartless society whipped him and made him dance around for them like an elephant in a circus tent.'Luck, my friend,' A circus dwarf says to the elephant man at one point in the story, 'and who needs it but we.'It is a story of immense sensitivity and humanity, and one the likes of which you won't see anywhere else. Its definitely not for the weak-hearted or depressed. Its often devastatingly difficult to watch (mainly in one or two scenes), most of this story is wildly compelling and human drama due to the immense talents of Lynch and Hopkins in particular. There are certainly moments of reprieve - all is not black.Its certainly a beautiful movie - every frame is perfection. Gorgeous black and white cinematography give this subject the class it deserves. A wonderful score by John Morris helps give it a haunting beauty. It is directed with superb classical storytelling, illustrated by Lynchian brushstrokes: expressionistic dream sequences and trademark Lynchian soundtrack. David Lynch should be very proud of this early effort. It is a marvellous film. The sensitivity of the construction, and its classic perfection, are the work of a master.But it is hard to say what this movie would be without Anthony Hopkins. It is a topic that easily could have fallen into the trap of the society it depicts, of exploiting freaks for the petty thrill of exhibitionism. But whatever credit for this that does not go to Lynch, must go to Hopkins. His sincere delivery, in one of the most genuine performances i've ever seen, are a major factor in our believing this story really happened (which it did), and taking it seriously (which we do).5 stars.",10,11,12,1 April 2004
Dog Day Afternoon," One of Pacino's best, most satisfying portraits. The crowd's blind support for criminals is very of its time.
","Al Pacino gives one of his most vibrant characterisations as eccentric and very strung-out gay bank robber Sonny, in this film where an accidental siege in a bank becomes a hotspot for all the power tensions of 70's culture.Its obvious from the construction of the film that homosexuals were not seen on screen very much up to this point - so here we have a very penetrating look into the eyes of one, courtesy of Pacino. Its a very big performance, which is great to watch, but it does not feel mocking or unsympathetic on Pacino's part. I think we like Sonny very much - probably not as much as the crazy 70's crowd who are shouting 'power to the people' and other desperate demonstrating phrases.8/10. The social politics of this movie (the function of the crowd outside the bank) are very dated and unfashionable today, but this movie is very suspenseful, and one of the best siege-dramas i've seen. Its a must see for anyone who wants to know what Al Pacino is great.",8,1,2,24 July 2004
School of Rock," Amusing tribute to Rock is perfect, suitable, family movie. Will please fans of Rock and fans of Jack Black particularly.
","Dewey Finn lives for rock, but his band fire him before the up-coming battle of the bands. He needs cash to pay rent back to his room-mate's evil girlfriend, so he decides to pose as his room-mate, and take one of his substitute teacher jobs. When he sees the munchkins are musicians, he gets the idea to teach them rock music, and maybe enter the battle of the bands as his band... it just might work!From Richard Linklater (Dazed and Confused), Mike White (The Good Girl) and Jack Black (Shallow Hal), this amusing comedy really comes alive with the rapport between the kiddies and Jack Black. The scenes where they are discovering rock music are precious. I can't believe how much energy Jack Black has. He's so prepared to take risks and seems not to care about embarrassing himself. He's totally over-the-top in School of Rock, but, luckily, it totally works. He's really the best thing that's happened to rock music in a long time. He really brings back the passion of the old rockers. Fans of rock music will get the most joy from this, as will kids and fans of Jack Black. Its the perfect family movie - no swearing or anything unsuitable.Plus, as fans of Linklater know, he utilises great classic songs of the past - and this one's no exception. Watch out for the scene in the van where Jack and the kiddies howl to Immigrant Song. Plus, the original songs are great, especially the title song played at the final concert.7/10. I wouldn't watch it too often - the script is not hysterically funny, certainly not on a par with Mike White's The Good Girl, and its a little too slow. Many of the class-room scenes should have played out at virtually twice that speed. Too many unnecessary pauses and silences. I noticed it while watching a clip from the movie, and I felt it while watching the real thing.",4,4,9,13 July 2004
Back to the Future Part III," The most fun of the three.
","Part III, the wild west entry, is probably the most fun. The original has just such a fantastic premise that creates a sense of urgency about seeing it out till the end, but there is something uncomfortable about your mother having a crush on you that leaves a bad taste in the mouth during Part I. The premise of Part III is this: in 1955, Doc learns that he will eventually travel back to 1885 to live out his days as a blacksmith, but then Copernicus, Doc's 1955 dog, stumbles upon a gravestone that tells Doc and Marty that Doc will be shot to death by Buford Tannen over a matter of 80 dollars. Naturally, Marty says he will travel back to 1885 and get Doc and bring him back to the future with him (though it couldn't be 1955, because there's already one Doc there).There are time-jumping laws that are not obeyed by the scriptwriters here, and much worse than in the second film, but this one's so well concentrated and so much the better movie that they hardly matter. It has a climax involving a train that rivals the clocktower climax of the first one. A fantastic scene.Thomas F Wilson, the perennial bad guy of these movies, who started off as Biff Tannen in the original, played Griff Tannen in the second one, throws himself into a Yosemite Sam part as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen in the third. Mary Steenbergen, in one of her few leading roles, is a nice addition to the cast. She fits right into the wild west world, as the dainty schoolteacher who plays 'his beloved Clara' to the Doc.Like the others, its larger-than-life tone, with the over-blown time-travel dialogue and melodramatic highs and lows, render it into a kind of live-action cartoon. Kids will enjoy Part III the most, but it is so good-natured that adults should have fun with it too. Out of the three, this is the one that you'll be able to put on any time and feel good. Great, harmless fun.",Null,45,61,21 May 2004
Men in Black II," Its an old story: movie studio thinks they can get a free ride off the name of a big hit movie without having to do any new work: public eat it up like dogs.
","If you've seen the first Men in Black, and loved it, don't see this. If you're a glutton for punishment, be my guest.To put it politely, this is not Godfather Part II (which was an entirely different story and concept). Its certainly not Terminator 2 (which improved on the original). Its not even an Alien Sequel (which all match up to the original at least okay).Its more like Analyse That or The Santa Clause 2: a disastrous retreading of the formula which adds nothing and is not enjoyable.Enjoyment was all i expected from MIB 2. I expected to take my dear mother along to the sequel a movie we had both enjoyed together: but instead I sat there writhing, muttering and foaming at the mouth at how they'd just decided to make this before a better script came along.An insult to the standards of moviegoers everywhere.0/10.",1,2,6,19 July 2004
Kelly's Heroes," Familiar buddy-war epic with explosions and 50's TV humour.
","Its easy to pick the three guys about to become big TV stars: the guy playing Moriarty, Big Joe and the german general with the grouchy voice and the crazy hair. Big Joe is okay, but all three give very television performances, and give the general impression that this is television-sitcom grade humour operating here, when there is humour. I'm a Donald Sutherland fan and i didn't think he was that good. Found the stoner character a hamfisted, obvious ploy for comic relief. As a whole, though, its not as bad as i've started to make out. A so-so to good war flick will please blokes, as in general it endorses hanging out with buddies, blowing things up and disrespecting most laws for personal gain. Clint Eastwood was at the height of his stardom here. He was the top dog in Hollywood. If you want to see him give a better performance, and have much more fun watching him, see The Good the Bad and the Ugly instead. Dirty Harry would be a better option, if you feel like a cop flick, or his own Play Misty for Me (which you may or may not be impressed with - i took it with a grain of salt) for suspense/thriller/horror in the Hitchcockian vein. Remade as Fatal Attraction.If you want a buddies-at-war picture, which has less explosions, better sticking-the-finger-up-at-establishment, more and better fun Donald Sutherland, and more innovative storytelling in general, check out Robert Altman's MASH.You may like Kelly's Heroes, however. Its a very safe-feeling movie, because its very familiar. This reviewer, however, was reduced to boredom by that saturated sense of familiarity.",2,3,8,14 March 2004
Donnie Brasco," Superb mafia drama. Deeper, and rings truer than most.
","First rate mafia drama connects on a deeper level than most. Its cinematography may not have the moody, noirish atmosphere that makes The Godfather so appealing, but despite its slick Hollywood look, it seems to attain such penetrating truth (this, perhaps, has a little to do with its being based on a book by the real life main character). The central situation of the aging mafia man taking under his confidence and vouching for an undercover FBI agent, and that a bond forms between the two men is a great one. The performances are absolutely superb. Particularly the two men who the story centres on, Joe Pistone, a.k.a Donnie Brasco (Johnny Depp, going for realism in this role, is incredible. It begins and ends with a closeup of his eyes - this movie would be nothing without him) and mafia man 'Lefty' (Pacino, who gives us one of his finest characterisations - best bit, his close-up after Donnie is asked to shake hands by a certain character on a certain boat). The vividness of the characters in this movie seems to owe a great deal to the superb screenplay (again, credit to the real-life source material). Recurring catch-phrases make it easy for us to get to know characters, and wonderful little touches give the story such a resonance, and make it ring true: like Lefty's smoking inside the car when driving with Brasco and accusing Brasco of trying to kill him with the draft when he opens a window to let some smoke out, and the portrait of Lefty, the opposite of how we imagine a mafia veteran, as a vulnerable, often emotional man.Deserves at least four stars. Recommended to anyone (except, obviously kids, for a few scenes unsuitable to them).",6,59,81,11 March 2004
Caddyshack," Uneven, see it for Chevy Chase.
","Uneven comedy has three or four B-stories, which lead us astray from the less-interesting A-story of the young caddy Danny Noonan who wants to be a golfer. You could write four or five different plot outlines focusing on the different B-stories, but the best one probably just focuses on general 'comic goings-on at an exclusive golf club,' (Rob Hartill, imdb Plot Outline).This is Harold Ramis's first film. He would go on to make the first National Lampoon's Vacation movie with Chevy Chase, and one of the best comedies ever made, Groundhog Day. We also have him to thank for Analyse This. For fans of Ramis, this is definitely worth a look.Bill Murray is insane and over-the-top (and pretty funny in places), Cindy Morgan is cute as Lacey Underall, the big boss's daughter, the kid Danny Noonan is funny looking and i'd be happy if I never saw Rodney Dangerfield ever again - but the gem of the piece is without a doubt Chevy Chase. He's the reason to see this. This is his first big movie role after being discovered on Saturday Night Live (his career would get its big boost with Vacation in 83 and Fletch in 85) - and its a knockout. Its one of those parts where he'll say a line completely deadpan, and you're ears will do a double-take, and you'll go: hang on, what did he say?For fans of undergraduate comedy like Animal House, this is worth a look. If anyone is particularly offended by racial humour, there are enough racial stereotypes and jokes in the beginning to end a peace conference. They're not malicious, and they peter off after the first half hour, and after this it ends up being enjoyable and pretty funny - especially Chevy Chase. 6/10.",4,2,7,27 June 2004
The Evil Dead," See it for Bruce Campbell.
","Its low-budget look gives it a real charm. It progresses along gradually enough, ie the suspense builds realistically and naturally, instead of giving us zombies within the first five minutes, that we believe the zombies when they eventually come - it actually works as a straight horror movie, unlike its sequals.I don't know where Raimi found Bruce Campbell, but he's the real highlight of this movie. He's incredible - he's got this superhero's head. It was a great idea to have a certain guy's face being the figurehead of the series. Especially when he's got a face like this! Those crazy eyes, that jut jaw. Raimi is right - he does look great in a head shot.The first half hour is really exciting, because you can tell everyone is just learning how to make a film. It was shot over a period of seven years, i hear, so the general quality improves throughout, but there are no noticeable jumps in quality - the texture is not incredible uneven. It all hangs together okay.Its a fairly full-on zombie experience, once we get into the thick of it. Its fairly harrowing and foul, so be prepared - weak of stomach should stay away.Certain parts were better than others: I thought the zombie trapped under the trapdoor banging up against it was fantastic, all of Bruce Campbell was fantastic, especially his later scenes. But i didn't like the part near the beginning where a girl wanders into the woods and vines start chasing her and climbing up her crotch.Raimi's lightning-fast steadicam which predates Barry Sonnenfeld's famous 'crazy-cam' from Raising Arizona by a good decade is pretty freaky, but gets a little gimmicky.7/10. Bruce Campbell's head in this movie is a thing to be seen.",7,1,4,30 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Like putting a gold frame around a piece of graffiti.
","When I came home after seeing KB, I said to myself, as if i'd only just realized, that its storytelling had been kind of incredible. And it is: its great slowness, the title cards, the way they fade in slow, fade out slow. The way it has chapters, like a great piece of literature, the epic fight scenes, the epic explanations of prior events (that really is Hatori Hanzo steel...). It does everything 'big.'But as soon as I sat down in my home, I couldn't look at my Pulp Fiction screenplay, which i'd been the night before to get autographed by QT (as he signs, so he can sign as many as possible), and felt kind of sick in the stomach. I wasn't going to admit it yet, but I was like a son who idolises his father, only to realize one day that his father wasn't such top s**t after all.I was quite attached to QT, i'd loved Pulp for many years... but it took a second viewing of Volume 1 for me to face the facts. Kill Bill was just plain uninteresting. It was probably the worst film to stand a second viewing since Batman and Robin. I was having flashbacks to Batman and Robin, actually, during the film... I guess its a sign of how bored I was. Kill Bill reaped absolutely nothing from a second viewing. First viewing, you've seen absolutely all there is to see: because he hands it to you so slowly! So much is wrung out of the most insignificant little moments (the ten minute sushi scene, the twenty minute sword-making scene, the half-hour anime scene, the ten minute hospital scene) that its over-wrought almost to breaking point!What Tarantino has done in Kill Bill is like putting a bow-tie on a turd. Its like putting frills and pretty lace on a pair of work shorts. Its like putting a gold frame around a piece of graffiti, giving an Oscar to Uma Thurman, comparing your own movie to the great films of all time when its empty genre-rehashing bubble-gum trash. He takes something which is so vacuous (a simple revenge story), and pretends its a great roman epic. The result for some has been exhilaration. If you could stand a second viewing, i don't want to cry at your party. Don't keep reading. For me, it was one of great frustration. QT loves crappy asian martial arts movies. That's fine. But what he doesn't realize is that those movies are so lovable because they AREN'T presumptious. They don't pretend they're Citizen Kane, or War & Peace. KB is the very definition of pretentious. It dons fancy disguises, pretty colours, sound effects, camera angles, good music, animation, slow fade-ins and outs, it gives chapter names to half-hour long (unnecessary) sequences! - all to pretend it is epic cinema. But what substance is there? A few action scenes, exploitation violence and a thin-as-a-tampon revenge story.QT talks (boy does he talk) about 'f**king with the audience' - his words, not mine, IMDb - but he can talk his way into a coma and it won't distract me from the fact that never in my life have i heard cornier dialogue and hammier acting, and never in my life have i seen a more self-serving movie. The audience might as well not even be here - Tarantino only cares about amusing himself anyway. You should have heard him laughing at his own movie at the premiere...",7,0,3,27 June 2004
The Last Emperor," There's nothing you get from this picture that you don't get looking at the video box.
","A fascinating central situation: a six year old is told they're almighty ruler of a thousand years (so the kid eventually figures out he can do anything he wants), but for six years more he's kept in a secret city sealed off from the rest of China, and no-one tells him that outside that city, China is no longer a monarchy, and he is no longer an emperor.This central situation has to be enough to sustain your interest: because there isn't much story further than the central premise here, like in most Bertolluci films. At 50 minutes it starts flagging, so Peter O'Toole is introduced. After another 25, another character is introduced - you get the idea.Luckily the concept is fairly intriguing - but honestly there's nothing you get from this picture that you don't get looking at the video box cover. Not as interesting visually as Bertolluci's The Sheltering Sky, but certainly a more comprehendable story, mainly because its much simpler. The other main interest in watching this is the great Peter O'Toole. I'm always curious to follow Peter wherever he crops up in moviedom. He's wonderful to watch here, as always.3/5. Probably the most widely-accessible of Bertolluci's movies, but like the rest of them, its high on style, with a big concept, but low on plot.Disclaimer: only for adult audiences. 3 sex scenes. Violence: the most brutal scene i've ever seen, one hour in, a real mouse is thrown against a hard surface and its body pulverised. The Emperor is approaching the gates of the city when it happens. You've been warned.",Null,4,9,26 July 2004
Big Fish," Three tales about Big Fish - one man's impressions of a very busy, ambitious film.
","Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a sick old man. His son (Billy Crudup) is frustrated by the fact that he's spent his entire life telling tall tales instead of really talking about himself. So, to tell us about his father as a young man (Ewan McGregor), Crudup only has these stories to tell us.Obviously an intensely personal film for Burton, who is really here telling us a tale about his own father.* I could imagine it all before I saw it. Or maybe I felt the exact content of it wasn't relevant - the initial idea said everything there was to say: man tells tall tales instead of talking, son is not impressed. I could imagine these fairy tales from watching the previews. Just tall tales.* Or maybe its because I just found the character of Burton's father so frustrating. Always claiming he cares so much about people and about life in his stories, yet not caring enough to talk with them like a human being. Stories make nice movies; but would i take them instead of life?Burton isn't naive to this. Its the conflict at the centre of the film.
But i just couldn't forgive Albert Finney's character. Burton clearly can. That's the problem with too-personal projects. You can't be objective about what you expect the audience to be experiencing while they watch it - because your own experience of it is informed by so much that's offscreen. So of course Burton can forgive Finney, because he's his own father! You love him despite the fact that he's a selfish, frustrating old rat. But he's not my father, or anybody else's - why should we forgive him?* Its such a busy film, too. Burton really shot for the moon with this one. He tries to tell us a million movies at once: every five minutes a new movie, and frankly I didn't care about any of them. The twenty minute tangents into his fathers' stories had about as much dramatic tension as my own grandfather's stories. They were all just silly stories his father was telling. I thought the gawdy colours were too much for the same reason.6/10. I find his simpler films like Edward Scissorhands more profound and beautiful: less is indeed more. Maybe I just didn't like Billy Crudup (BO-RING! Think robotic Hayley-Joel in Secondhand Lions). It didn't work for me.",1,7,18,18 July 2004
Quiz Show," Camp look at quiz show corruption.
","Based on a book by the Dick character (played by Rob Morrow, the lead of TV's Northern Exposure), Robert Redford's 1994 film evokes the quiz show world of the first years of television, done in the camp style of 50's movies and television. Thus, the bright colours, the superlative performances (which don't go so over the top we forget they represent real people), all the classic/cliche voices of 50's entertainment - the wise old man (Charles van Doren), the brooklyn investigator (Dick), the nerd (Stempel), the nagging wife (Toby Stempel), the con men (Dan Enright, Albert). John Turturro gives another unique character, and i can't think who his character reminds me of, but Herbie Stempel is a funny highlight of the movie.An absorbing, fun, immensely watchable movie, which rests on a very simple but captivating premise.",Null,0,0,7 May 2004
Men in Black," Fun, memorable sci-fi comedy has lots of personality thanks to director, composer, and two lead actors.
","Agent K (Jones)'s partner retires, so he has to find a new one. Street cop Will Smith seems an unlikely contender to join this very special service and help K battle illegal aliens.Barry Sonnenfeld's experience as a cinematographer put him in good stead for planning this quirky fun sci-fi comedy.Men in Black is given life by Sonnenfeld's shot-choices, for greatest comic effect, terrific fun musical score by Danny Elfman, and two perfectly cast actors: Tommy Lee Jones' wry delivery and Will Smith's comic persona make for a movie with some real personality.Vincent D'Onofrio is a memorable bad guy - especially when we don't have to look at his regular face.A few death scenes will be too gruesome for kiddies, but once they're a certain age its bound to be one of their favourite movies. Such terrific imaginative fun.10/10Woman: 'You here to make fun of me, too?' K: 'No maam, we here at the FBI do not have a sense of humour we're aware of. May we come in?'",10,82,101,19 July 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I stand corrected about this movie - you're right, it is brilliant.
","In place of my old review, in which i called this movie pretensious, i'd like to lodge a formal apology. I stand very much corrected. There is no artistic effects in this movie which are used just to be clever - it all serves the main theme, which, when you get to the end and hopefully discover it, is very moving.The reason i was untouched by the movie the first time was i got stuck comparing it to Being John Malkovich, which it only resembles in such superficial elements like use of a steadicam. The other reason is I was up the back of the theatre, and i couldn't hear the music well enough, so the music wasn't allowed to draw me into the movie's world, so i felt sort of detached - though, in retrospect, the movie stilled my beating heart for the first two-thirds the first time i saw it.",8,0,1,28 April 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Pure cinema.
","Kubrick's wicked masterpiece Clockwork Orange is pure cinema. Every scene is movie magic. The incredible thing about this movie is that thirty years after its controversial first release to widespread banning, provoking of gang violence, owing to which Kubrick decided to withdraw the film from release, it has lost none of its insane, shocking power. Watching Clockwork Orange, you one moment have fun with its wicked sense of humour, incredible invented dialect (taken from Anthony Burgess' hilarious, inventive novel), and the next moment feel sick to the stomach. The first time i saw it i was absolutely terrified. I felt terribly sick in the stomach. Now, of course, it feels slightly less like Satan damning me to hell (and i'm not religious!) and more like a delightfully cinematic, delightfully dark joke. Each time i see it, I further appreciate it: it's visually stunning, menacingly comic and unashamedly controversial and shocking (with a touch of the old social satire, my droogs). It gets in your face and there's no stopping it. Does it all mean something? Is this our future described? That's for you to decide. What's certain is that Clockwork Orange defies every law about movie making ever invented, and defies categorisation at every turn. Try and predict where its gonna take you next, or try and sum it up (which, you may notice, i've avoided doing), and you'll likely fall on your face.",6,0,1,24 March 2004
The Untouchables," Lush-looking and sounding period police procedural.
","A lushly designed and photographed period picture about a group of treasury officers out to nail Al Capone for tax evasion.It has Brian de Palma's usual superlative visual style and approach to violence, but this time the cops are the good guys. Spaghetti Western legendary composer Ennio Morricone gives a very nice score indeed with touches of Inspector Gadget, which fixes the main element which hampered Scarface, its score.A treat to watch, with good performances, Untouchables announces itself as a prestigeous picture from its credits, which are very handsome indeed, and i believe it lives up to them.De Niro and Connery could have been a little better - but Costner holds it all together here.This is definitely the best de Palma picture i've seen, but probably not as original and memorable as Scarface.Highlight: the sequence with the little girl in the corner store at the beginning, and Malone's final scene.",6,2,4,7 May 2004
It's a Wonderful Life," It's a Wonderful Movie
","A beautiful, moving movie. It takes you on the journey again every time you see it. Every scene is a classic. Jimmy Stewart is quite incredible in this movie. If you ever thought classical actors couldn't rival method actors, see how genuine Stewart's performance is. Two special moments: Stewart's tears as he sits in martinis, and the scene where Mary and George both listen to the same telephone receiver. Its such a magical scene - one of the best scenes of all time. Neither of them listen to what Sam Wainwright is saying on the phone, because all of a sudden the two of them realise they are standing the closest they've been together in twenty or so years. He can smell her hair and she can smell his aftershave. The scene is played out in expressions and movements, and you can read their thoughts on their faces. A joy.This movie does a difficult thing, something we love to be reminded of each christmas, it makes you appreciate the important things in life. Its about falling back in love with life. Frank Capra was a master director. Not only are his movies brilliantly realised, perfectly shot and constructed, but they contain just enough awfulness to ensure that the endings do not seem corny - their positive messages do not seem contrived - they are a joy and a relief. Frank Capra doesn't pretend the world is a perfect place, but he does something many filmmakers can't - he actually provides answers as to how best to deal with the world's imperfect nature. If you're ever feeling sad and low, or too concerned with trivial things, watch Its a Wonderful Life.",10,4,9,24 December 2003
Love Actually," Perfect popcorn, snuggle with someone you love, entertainment.
","After a silly intro about terrorism, the rest of the movie features what, if we're being honest, everyone wants to see: people meeting and falling in love. Its the best part of every love story: so instead of dealing with all the unpleasantness that follows (a la Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind), let's just have excerpts from twelve characters who experience only those good bits.I'm not doing it justice by saying its only the good bits - its more like the most vibrant bits. Two or three stories have a more sombre, sour quality. But vibrant highs and lows are not unique to Love Actually - they're a staple of any melodrama: they are the definition of melodrama! In this context, though, as happy ending as was possible considering the premise of each short story, was affixed.I think he's cottoned onto a good idea with this - take the best (or most interesting) bits from many short stories and stitch them together into one movie. I thought the connecting material was sometimes weak, and i often felt we were just bouncing back and forth from story to story, progressing like a cement-mixer across the narrative. A bit to mechanised, not fluid enough, in other words. Also, i never felt like i got to know these characters. There's no time to really delve into any of these stories - which leaves us with something that's fairly superficial. But not as superficial as you might think.This is indubitably popcorn entertainment, and a fitting choice for a couple looking for a romantic night at home, but you didn't need me to tell you that.7/10Highlights: I was glad i saw this for Bill Nighy, who plays the aging has-been pop star. He's hysterical. There is one strikingly beautiful scene of the movie, where Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now is put to good use.",7,6,11,27 June 2004
Whiplash," Ringo never had it this tough.
","Andrew (Miles Teller) draws the attention of drum instructor Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), whose methods are not exactly easy-going.Probably not a movie to put on if you're looking to relax, Whiplash offers a movie experience like dynamite. It makes no apologies about being brash and uncompromising. The fact that its well-made, brilliantly observed and written, most will concede. Whether they LIKE it may depend on their temperament. It raises interesting questions about nature vs nurture and morality and refuses to spoon-feed the answers. Reactions to this film should be mixed according to the personal truths people found in it. I could tell you my feelings, but that would defeat the purpose of what I've said and what the film is saying. Its up to you to find that line for yourself: is it worth it?8/10",8,1,5,17 May 2015
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Grimm's Fairy Tale source lends beautiful darkness to Queen's scenes / Disney cuteness + classic songs in dwarf scenes make for excellent children's viewing. The only scenes i remember from my childhood, how
","Snow White is the fairest one of all. The queen wants to be number one, so decides to come after her. Snow White, cut loose from the castle, stumbles upon a hut where seven dwarves are living - which is where the Queen comes for her, in disguise, with a poison apple...This has classic written all over it. Disney's first major feature, the grand debut, cements the major features of those to come. It draws from very dark but fantastic material, Grimm's Fairy Tales, and alternates scenes of evocative darkness (the Queen's castle, the man sent to cut Snow White's heart out, and the forest that's alive, are some brilliant examples) with scenes of superlative cuteness and song and dance numbers.
Drawbacks:There are some beautiful compositions, but the movement of the animation is not as fluid as it would become, even with Pinnochio, Disney's very next feature. Plus, the singing styles are very 1930's opera-style. I can see why i always used to just think of songs during musicals as things i had to wait through till the story got going again - its because almost every song in Snow White doesn't advance the story. Great musical numbers, like the ones in West Side Story, do. They don't feel like we're just waiting around. When most of the Snow White songs come on, the story gets put on hold.Snow White is too naive, plain and perfect a character to hold our interest these days. Contemporary audiences just don't worship 'perfect' people like this. Plus, the attempts at animation of real people is not good. Snow White and the Prince in particular just don't work - whereas the cartoony dwarves really come alive. Try watching her face when she talks.Highlights:All of the Queen's scenes are absolute gems, actually. And the dwarves are great. Seven great characters.One of the best things Disney ever did was the Queen's angry walk down the staircase to the dungeon, and her subsequent making of a potion to transform herself into an old witch. The way the liquid she's mixing comes alive is fantastic, and the close-ups on the crow sitting on the skull are a nice touch.The poison flooding towards the centre of the pot, engulfing the apple, and the jack o'lantern face on it afterwards.Some of Disney's most classic songs come from Snow White: Whistle While You Work, Heigh Ho (its off to work we go), and one of the most beautiful Disney songs ever, Some Day My Prince Will Come.There's also a very memorable piece of theme music that plays during the climactic storm scene.10/10. An essential, marvellous work. A thing to see.",8,33,43,8 July 2004
The Lion King," A triumph.
","A symphonic pairing of music and image, a wonderful musical, an endearing story, great fun characters, a stellar cast (best are Jeremy Lions as Scar, Nathan Lane as Timon, with cameos by Whoopi Golberg as a hyena and Rowan Atkinson as the bird) and marvellously directed. A superb film. One of Disney's best. The two best scenes are undoubtedly the herd of wilderbeast scene and Scar's incredible 'Be Prepared' number, with operatic visuals punctuated with references to Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will.Seeing this again for the first time in about ten years (i was then a child, am now 20), i'm struck by what a powerful exercise in filmmaking it is. So dramatic, so fun, such great songs, but above all, each moment magestically, perfectly directed.If you only saw this when you were a kid, i recommend you reappreciate it with adult eyes.",9,0,0,20 April 2004
Stalag 17," Solid, classy Billy Wilder flick is nothing flashy, not hilarious, but it draws you in expertly.
","Stalag 13 is indeed another Billy Wilder classic. His movies develop well, have good characters, good suspense, and often utilise visual cues particularly well.  The light cord above the chess game which signifies that the mole has left a message for the Nazi officers is used wonderfully here.Its just a nice, well-made POW drama. I think it was going overboard a little bit giving William Holden an academy award - he was always just William Holden! But he has a nice presence in this movie. My problem with him is as soon as he starts talking, the audience knows 'ok, this is a movie.' And, more often than not, it makes it feel like an old movie. So as soon as i get drawn into the world of the picture, Holden's voice shoves me straight back out again.Despite this fact, its a very absorbing and involving drama. Not hardened drama, of course. This is not Five Easy Pieces. Billy Wilder's trademark was dealing with dark and bitter material with humour - so everything in his movies is palatable to all viewers. This'll mean more people will get the opportunity to experience the issues it raises.8/10. Not groundbreaking, but very very classy stuff.",8,5,10,18 July 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," A cute and sentimental prison drama?
","Quite frankly, this is a movie of clich√©s. You want examples, I got examples! 'Some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are too bright' or 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' or 'Terrible thing, to live in fear' or 'It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away' or 'need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone' or 'Hope is a good thing, and good things can never die' - if you say so, sensei!Problem is Stephen King never leaves anything to the imagination. He tells us everything - if Tim Robbins organises some special event for the inmates, like playing music over the loudspeaker, Morgan Freeman's voice will come right out and suggest a few reasons why this episode is so wonderful/significant, the nature of which are very similar through each episode of the movie. And Darabont obviously likes the idea of assuming the audience are very thick, and will not see or experience anything unless you dictate to them what to experience, and has made his movie by it.Also, i'm starting to be wary of Thomas Newman as a composer doing exactly what Darabont has done as a director: employ a formula that has worked in the past. His score for Shawshank is calculated on the same formula of highs, lows, and general atmosphere as in his score for Road to Perdition, American Beauty, Meet Joe Black, Horse Whisperer, Scent of a Woman, and The Green Mile, not surprisingly. If you think about all these movies, they all have a similar feel, they all go for a similar nostalgia, haunting sadness - which admittedly i find very appealing, but i'm starting to worry at how similar they all are.I think encouraging this movie too much is like rewarding someone for employing a formula very successfully - instead of taking risks and doing something edgy that still turns out to be enjoyable and brilliant. Most people do not evaluate movies based on their IMDb ranking, but i certainly would be surprised if any major lists ranked this in their top ten.That said, this is still a good movie, with good performances, a good unity, despite its necessarily episodic nature, and it looks great. Its only for movies people insist on putting on best-ever lists that i require a certain originality, the feeling that what this movie gives you you could not get anywhere else (I believe this is why movies like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, 2001, Raging Bull, Third Man, Grand Illusion, Persona and, for me, Exterminating Angel, are constantly mentioned on such lists, and deservedly). What this movie gave me, I could get from reading any other Stephen King story, or seeing any other movie adaptation of a King story.",7,39,123,3 April 2004
Platoon," Supreme. An opera.
","The greatest war movie ever made, and one of the greatest movies. A breathtaking film. It is photographed exquisitely. My favourite shot is the sun coming through the trees right near the beginning. This is Director Oliver Stone's masterwork. Brilliant performances by Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe, John C McGinley (who adds a bit of comic relief). Watch for an early appearance by Johnny Depp. The supreme aspect of this movie, however, which gives the events the gravity of an opera, is the original score by Georges Delarue - the main theme of which is one of the most memorable in all cinema.This film ranks among my greatest admired.5 stars.",7,1,2,17 October 2003
Back to the Future Part II," Many people's least favourite of the trilogy.
","Part II takes the surface characteristics of the original but somehow forgets to transfer the original's essence. There is something perfect in the original that just feels forced in the second one. The second one also begins the characteristic of global-scale reproduction of sequences from the original. reproducing entire sequences from the original, set in different eras and reworked. This is done for comedic purposes. We're supposed to recognise the sequences and say 'ha ha, that's right.' It is most certainly done intentionally.Like many sequals it tries to be bigger than the original and ends up being worse. A movie which tells us one brilliant small story vibrantly, so we never forget it, will usually be better than one which tries to tell us many large events and stories. It gives us more time jumping, which ends up making it uneven (which is why it stays in your mind less, I think). Its very episodic, with only the thread of getting the sports alamac off Biff and Marty and Doc to hold it together.It involves larger-scale changes to the future: Biff's becoming rich means the entire world is thrown into disarray for a portion of the film, entire areas are slums, brothels and biker-gang hovels. This kind of superlative treatment of plot will only really work for kiddies, who'll find it too unpleasant anyway.Plus, it also makes a whole lot less sense. Because it deals with so many time-jumps, there are so many more places to slip up and disregard the rules established within the world of the film for time travel: that interacting with anything in the past will change it, for instance.What is clever about the second one, and was always the thing I liked most about it when I was a boy, was how Marty and Doc go back to when the first film was taking place, and we run into those events again, we see Marty, George and Lorraine doing their bits from the first movie. Its fairly obviously trying to get people to say 'oh isn't that clever,' but its still pretty fun all the same.",2,1,6,21 May 2004
Bull Durham," Makes ambitious promises to show baseball as a religion, and like sex, but then resorts to sport movie and love triangle cliches.
","Baseball groupie Susan Sarandon only sleeps with one player a season: Tim Robbins and Kevin Costner both want to be that player. Except Costner refuses to compete - and now his assignment of getting star pitcher Robbins to buckle down and concentrate on Baseball is made much harder...It starts well, with Sarandon's voiceover making these big promises to liken baseball to sex and religion, with a church choir playing in the background as the camera looks at various shrines in her room. I was so excited seeing this that when the movie turned out to be just another love triangle losing-team-triumphs sports movie, I was very disappointed.There is still sex and superstition in it, but the film doesn't really fulfill its promise to demonstrate to me how baseball could be a religion to anybody except the players. Here's why:1) The only two non-player characters we meet are a slut who sleeps with all and any of the players and Susan Sarandon, who only sleeps with one player a season, and is always in the power position, so she's more like a sexual predator. In introducing actual sex, the screenwriters have made it impossible for us to see how baseball could compare. We get the sense that sleeping with the men, and watching them play baseball are two completely different interests for these women.2) The story is too small-scale to fulfill Sarandon's promises. We never get these global, grande feeling that baseball means more than just hitting balls and boredom. We only experience these few characters.3) The other reason its not very effective is the screenplay is not well-focused. It meanders all over the place - giving us nondescript scenes of baseball, travelling on the road.4) Costner's storyline is almost forgotten. Its just badly written. He never goes out of his way to pull Robbins in line because the love triangle interferes.5) They pretty much assume that just showing us some Baseball will make us moan with ecstacy - but you pretty much need to already bring a love of Baseball to this flick to do that.2/5",4,9,25,30 July 2004
Sweet and Lowdown," The first essential Woody Allen film in a long time.
","Sean Penn plays Emmett Ray, a little-known jazz guitarist, an eccentric, egocentric genius self-proclaimed as the 'greatest guitar player in the country' or the 'second greatest guitar player in the world' - because of that gypsy from France, the bane of his life, Django Reinhardt. The story of Sweet and Lowdown is the story of Emmett and the girl he first describes as 'the little one with the silly hat,' who is also, incidentally, called Hattie. There is something so special and memorable about the chemistry between Hattie and Emmett. Hattie is perfect for Emmett, because she's mute, and therefore he can sound off all day about how great he is, and she's the one person who won't contradict him.Woody has the knack of making highly watchable movies - and popping them out one a year. There is a continuity across them all, yet they all seem somewhat unique. Sweet and Lowdown stands heads and shoulders above every other film Woody has made since Husbands and Wives. With Sweet and Lowdown, Woody reminds us why we loved him in the first place - yet i'm not sure i can think of another Woody film that's as genuine, beautiful and moving, yet eccentric and funny at the same time. Annie Hall was probably as touching, but with Woody is no actor next to Penn, which i think makes an incredible difference! Penn brings to life a character so eccentric and unbelievable, yet we never doubt him, we never feel he's not a total human being.Penn's performance is counterbalanced by another equally moving performance by Samantha Morton as Hattie. Often you'll find yourself watching a two-shot with the both of them on screen, and you won't be able to decide which character you're more curious to watch. More often than not, you'll watch Samantha Morton, to see what Hattie is thinking and feeling. An extraordinary job by an extraordinarily talented actress you may have seen as the mother in In America or the pre-cog Agatha in Minority report.The one fault in the film is Uma Thurman - she is badly miscast and clearly only suited to intentionally hammy fodder like Kill Bill. Her character, Blanche, is great ('Okay, so i slept with him, but i was just researching a book!'), which makes it more the shame that Thurman speaks her line like she thinks this is a cartoon or a Tarantino movie. The audience will only accept the eccentricity of this style if the performances are genuine: she gets an F. She pops the bubble of this movie. When she appears, we suddenly realise its only a movie, and the spell is broken. Nevertheless, she's only in a relatively small portion of the film, and she can't bring down the rest of it. Sweet and Lowdown has the feeling of telling you a tale, and it spins some great fun yarns about little-known jazz guitarist Emmett Ray. Penn and Morton bring to life an incredible couple of characters - two of Woody's best creations. Well designed with nice period costumes and well directed, especially the magestic final crane shot (a reference to La Strada i believe). The story is beautifully punctuated with scintillating jazz music by Dick Hyman and others.'Come listen,' Emmett tells someone at one point, 'you'll love this, i'm great.'",8,37,44,31 May 2004
Identity," Cracking good Hollywood thriller.
","Its opening credits are Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal, then it goes on to introduce us to the main action Memento-style, then gives up the gimmick and goes Psycho, establishing a 'phones are down and we're stuck here in the storm' type deal, where it sits comfortably, until at one point it becomes a slasher. Also like Memento, it keeps coming back to a second storyline, the Silence of the Lambs/Hannibal Psychiatrist character, who is separated from the Bates Motel storyline.After this, however, it goes on to become a cracking good thriller. Just go with it.John Cusack is notably good as stone-faced ex-cop Ed.John C McGinley turns in another vibrant character part, this time it varies from the character he played in Platoon and TV's Scrubs, and is a nervous / compulsive little man (who is admittedly lots of fun, but his constant sarcasm does tend to wear thin).",Null,0,0,2 April 2004
A Night at the Roxbury," In-jokey movie is great fun to watch with a group of mates.
","A very in-jokey movie. If you're a Saturday Night Live fan, and especially if you like these two characters: a pair of juvenile brothers think they're party animals, but nobody else does.The unsaid joke that runs through this is that these guys are gay and want to give each other man-cuddles.If you're sick of homophobic comedy, and are prepared to move on, then this movie might look a little old-fashioned.Because its such an in-jokey movie, though, and because its such great campy/cheesy fun that doesn't take itself seriously, its the perfect sort of movie to watch with a group of makes, so you can repeat the jokes to each other for weeks and even years later.7/10, for that reason.",Null,1,3,14 July 2004
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Craven had lots of fun making it, so we do watching it.
","Great, imaginative premise: Freddy Krueger comes to you in your dreams, and if you believe he's real, he can really hurt you, even kill you.Executed in a fun way, with Johnny Depp in his first onscreen role, as one of the main characters, boyfriend to THE main character, in fact. He has quite a bit of screen time. If you're a Depp fan and haven't seen this, you'll love it. He's very young, 21 exactly.Genre pictures which are self-referential, and don't take themselves too seriously, and are made by someone who loves the genre are always the most fun. This is why The Matrix Reloaded was one of the least fun sci-fi pics ever, and why The Matrix series was just asking to be spoofed in the worst way - there's not a single joke about the sci-fi genre in it, or a single moment where it doesn't take itself seriously.Nightmare on Elm Street does not compete with most 'serious' movies due to its incomparably bad acting (with the exception of Johnny Depp, who even at 21 captured the half-serious tone here), but in this case these unconvincing performances actually benefit the movie by drawing attention to the fact that this is only a movie, and further allowing the audience to enjoy and have fun with it. I was thinking, while watching it for the second time that if the performances WERE incredibly convincing, Nightmare on Elm Street would be rather unpleasant to watch. If you REALLY thought these teenagers were dying, and the central character was REALLY having to deal with their deaths, then it wouldn't be as fun. In an interview on the Scream DVD, Wes Craven says: 'People don't go to scary movies to be scared, they go to them to have fun.' The fact that he thinks this is what makes his horror movies the most fun. I sometimes wonder whether he'll be known for anything other than Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream. I hope he does give us something new and original, but if not, he has at least started two great fun modern horror series (even if their sequels are mostly garbage).",7,0,1,27 March 2004
The Truman Show," As perfectly choreographed as the world it depicts.
","The major factor in this is one of the best screenplays i've ever seen. Its a thing of beauty the way it progresses, shifting gracefully through different levels of reality: first we begin inside the show (with opening credits like 'Truman Burbank as Himself, Created by Christoph'), along with interviews with cast members to establish the concept that Truman Burbank is naive to the fact that his entire environment is contrived by a television producer in the ultimate reality television experiment, everything from the weather to the dialogue of the actors who play the people close to Truman. This terrific concept never loses its impact: each time you see it, it takes you on the journey again. Even considering the spate of actual reality TV that has invaded our homes since 1998, which this movie foretold (or perhaps inspired), this movie will always retain its appeal because its specific situation, raising a baby in a reality-TV environment and keeping them from knowing they are on TV and that they are fake (in other words, what reality TV strives for, giving viewers genuine reality to watch, in the person of Truman), is not likely to happen in real life.Each moment is so beautifully rendered in cinematic language that film buffs the world over should feel like applauding it at every turn during a second viewing in particular. Take the scene where Truman goes to the travel agent to book his trip to Fiji: we see Truman standing in the agency, with bags in hand and beach-holiday clothes, and the most precious musak plays in the background. When he sits, we see a poster on the wall behind him with a plane being struck by lightening and big letters 'THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!' So simply, it conveys to us that they are going to try and stop Truman travelling by plane as well.And the much-praised performance from Carrey really holds the movie together. He's got the tone just right for this movie: which might be perfectly described as 'wry.' It has a fable-like quality, each moment infused with humour, yet we never lose sight of the eerie reality that this is a human being trapped in this situation.The full credit for achieving this delicate balance of tone goes to Peter Weir (Australian director of Dead Poets Society, Gallipoli, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Witness, Mosquito Coast and Master and Commander).The Truman Show is without a doubt one of the best movies of the 90's. A rare perfect film. 5 stars.Best bit: the two most famous scenes, the stopping traffic scene and the incredible final scene.",8,0,1,25 June 2004
True Romance," Exciting, sexy crime thriller with top-notch Tarantino script.
","Clarence: I always said, if I had to f*ck a guy... I mean had to, if my life depended on it... I'd f*ck Elvis. Exciting, sexy, enjoyable crime thriller with great and great-looking stars is one of my favourite Tarantino scripts. Sparkling pop-culture dialogue, great characters, great scenes (check the one between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, Gary Oldman's gem of a scene, Brad Pitt's just lying there on the couch, the classic movie theatre scene where Clarence and Alabama meet, followed by the just as classic diner scene).Has a great sense of humour - the pervasive joke is every reaction you think Alabama will have to the various stupid things Clarence does, she has the opposite. Violence is true romance - sick? Perhaps. Its the one thing Tony Scott and Tarantino agree on: unnecessary violence is not cheap exploitation, its entertainment. I personally think the shock effects Tarantino uses to structure his screenplays are quite gimmicky and undergraduate. Quality does not always mean sudden shifts of sex and violence. Surprise is not always good. I could have done without the hotel room scene, for example, where Alabama has a near-deadly encounter with a hit-man. One of the most violent things i've ever seen.Nevertheless, if you skip these scenes, its a compulsively enjoyable ride, and one of Tony Scott's least offensive films (Top Gun is sheer obnoxiousness today).8/10",8,1,2,27 June 2004
Back to the Future," The cleverest of the three.
","Part I is certainly the cleverest of the three. A rip-snorter of a premise: Marty (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back to 1955 in the time machine that his friend Doc Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd, in a zany, unforgettable, over-the-top performance that creates one of the best characters of all time) has built, and he accidentally interferes in the meeting of his parents, so that instead of his grandpa hitting his father (Crispin Glover in another over-the-top but crucial and memorable performance) with his car, he hits Marty instead. So instead of Marty's mother falling in love with his father, she falls in love with him! Controversial and awkward though it may be, you can't deny its greatness. The real aim of this, though, is not incest, its learning what his mother was really like in her youth, compared to how she tells it. Plus, it lends a certain urgency to what Marty must do to set back the course of time, which makes us need to watch till the end to see he does it: he must somehow make his parents meet and fall in love, or he won't be born!The second main quest in the movie is the technical problem of getting Marty back to the future: since in Part I the time machine runs on plutonium, and plutonium doesn't exist in 1955, they have to find some other way of generating the 1.21 gigawatts needed to get the car to 88 miles per hour and send it into time.The third main problem of the movie is that on the day when Marty got sent back in time, in 1985, Doc will be shot by Libyan terrorists for stealing their plutonium to run the time machine, unless Marty does something about it. A terrific feature of these movies are their climaxes: Part I is a terrific scene where Marty must hit the power line connected to the clock tower at 88 miles per hour at the precise moment lightening strikes it, involving a reference to a famous silent movie image, of Harold Lloyd hanging from a clock high on a building in Safety Last (1921).Back to the Future pulls a lot of old punches, uses a lot of traditional storytelling gags and devices that feel quite familiar, but its unabashed sense of fun, larger-than-life tone and ripsnorter premise make it the kind of movie you treasure and watch time and time again.",10,4,5,21 May 2004
Evil Dead II," Like watching a horror movie do standup comedy.
","I saw an interview with Raimi about Spiderman 2 where he said he's always learning how much is too much, that he's never sure when he's gone too far.He didn't have to tell me twice. I already watched more than ten seconds of The Quick and the Dead. A crazy steadicam followed by a crazy zoom, steadicam, zoom, dolly, pan, thrust! And all this within three seconds of celluloid. There's no other way to put it: this isn't clever, its ridiculous! Its so too much it hurts your eyes!Same here, if not quite as bad. Raimi has a bigger budget this time, so he decides to throw away all the credibility of the original. Like the worst sequels, he takes it that because there was a first movie, then absolutely no buildup is necessary in this one: we can have zombies within the first ten minutes, people cutting up their girlfriends and hardly seeming surprised, etc. There's just no lead-in! Maybe at a drive-in, but even there your audience aren't laughing with you, they're laughing at you.Clearly Raimi and I have different ideas of what makes entertainment: this, to me, is just too ridiculous. Its like watching a horror movie do standup comedy. Its just constant riffing, a collection of sketches, not a cohesive movie. If that's your thing, check this out. For me:5/10.",8,3,6,30 June 2004
The Godfather," The Godfather Phenomenon in a Nutshell
","The epic adventures of the Corleone family: Don Vito doesn't want to get involved in drugs, because its a dirty business. This causes repercussions and sparks a war among the five families.The Godfather Phenomenon in a nutshell: people love it for Gordon Willis' exquisite indoor cinematography, the performances, the Scarface value of being able to say sentences in the Don's voice, the in-jokes (give him an offer he can't refuse, go to the mattresses), Nino Rota's iconic musical score, and the iconic scenes (the opening monologue, followed by the Don's first totally quotable speech 'you come into my house on my daughter's wedding day', the horse's head, Sonny's sprinkler bashing in the busy street, the fruit-market shooting, the toll-way shooting, the gun in the bathroom restaurant scene, the garden fertiliser scene near the end, and the Baptism scene).There are faults in the second film: i think Fredo goes a little over the top, for instance, but the first Godfather is as close as you'll get to a perfect film. If there was a weakest link, though, it'd probably be Diane Keaton. She does bring an interesting quality to it, I agree, but it always looks like she's reading lines. Luckily, she doesn't have too many.It can be difficult to follow, due to the fact that its an adaptation of a long, elaborate book - but i think that contributes to its mystery. You always feel like watching it again to try and figure out who killed who and why.To make a great film, Coppola went back to basics, pure and simple, grande classical storytelling. He took the lessons of the masters to heart, and the result is just one of the best, most beautiful epics in the language.10/10",10,1,4,14 July 2004
