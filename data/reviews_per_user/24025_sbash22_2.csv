Hereditary," Highly Entertaining Until The Bad Ending
","Toni Collette's excellent acting held this movie together tightly and made it so memorable. Had a lesser actress been chosen for the lead role, the movie would have likely fallen apart long before it actually did and that was just at the final hurdle - the disappointing conclusion. The supporting cast all put on fine performances too, it should be noted so strong acting through and through. Good directing and cinematography too. I won't delve into the details here but will say that the ending of the movie was rather unoriginal - I remember watching old horrors from the 1970s with very similar occultist themes and endings. Certainly worth a watch as a horror fan but the ending cost this movie 2 stars so had it ended with a lot more originality I would have rated it an 8.
In the end, it gets a 6..",6,0,2,21 November 2018
District 9," Absolutely incredible movie! Out of this world!
","Everything about this movie screams brilliance. From the cast, acting, directing, script-writing, plot and digital effects. This is one of the best movies I've seen for years. District 9 gets a 10/10 from me. No movie is perfect, of course, but this is very close.While being a far cry from contemporary formulaic Hollywood sci-fi's, it does recall some themes and moods from the better Hollywood sci-fi's like ET, Flight of the Navigator and even the original Star Wars, although with a much darker twist than any of those films and with equal and sometimes better cinematography. The core of this film is politically fuelled but there are comedic elements too so it really will appeal to a wide audience.Whether you're into Sci-Fi or not, if you like a movie to keep you captivated this is the one to check out. Truly a delight to watch. I'm really hoping there's a Part 2, it was that good.",10,1,5,26 August 2009
