Deja Vu," I really enjoyed this film
","Well the reason I choose to watch this movie because I was looking for films that had to do with twin flames. I absolutely really love this movie, not that I would want to experiences something like this in order to find my twin but just for entertainment purposes. It amazes me to see people rate this film 1 or 2 stars I don't understand. That is what really makes life beautiful one mans trash will always be anthers treasure. There was great action jokes here and there and a love story with a metaphysical twist,just my cup of coffee. I think they put a lot of thought into this film I loved the continuity. I had no clue there was a metaphysical aspect like I said I was recommended on a site that this was a film about twin flames. This is now one of my favorite movies.",10,2,3,7 March 2013
