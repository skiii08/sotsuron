The Hangover," Excellent Writing, superb acting, very clever
","Anybody who comments about how this is a 'guy's only film' should know that my doctorate wife laughed as hard and frequent as I have ever seen her laugh. This is an exceptionally well-written movie. There was only one spot where I felt I knew what was happening next. The Asian bad guy, Mr. Chow, was very funny at first but his gay side was overdone. The ending was superb bringing the entire picture to closure for us. We laughed throughout the entire movie. My wife did not feel offended and we both want to go see it again. This movie is very well made.It should be stated that we find very few funny movies being made in the past decade. The Hangover is a huge exception. This is a comedy with creativity. I haven't heard that much laughter in a theatre since 'There's Something About Mary'. I imagine that movie also insulted some people with some of its 'vulgar humor'. The poster who said he felt he wasted $20 on the movie and the food he bought at the theater has judgment that cannot be trusted. After all, who spends that much on food at a movie theater?",9,8,14,5 June 2009
