Walk the Line," Great film
","Considering the formula junk coming out of Hollywood these days, I was blown away by how good this movie was. The direction was perfect. Using close ups to get us in under the skin of Johnny Cash. And since it was a period piece, he could have bored us with lots of cgi of Memphis and L.A. to take us back in time. Instead he used the actors and the music to take us there. Biopics naturally have a formula to them, but the director and screenwriter did not take us down the track of overly sentimental scenes. These were real and done with a bit of well placed humor. Just like real life. Afterall you still have to follow the real lives of Johnny and June. You can't make it up, just to be original! The movie was also a movie you can take most of the family to. No nudity and sex to SHOW how in love they are, just real dialog...it's nice to hear REAL dialog and not just another chase scene, or four letter word. Yes, some movies need that to tell the story, this one doesn't. This movie goes onto my short list of great biopics, with 'Ray'. Not much else comes close to Ray or Walk the Line. The true test of any biopics is: can you still understand the plot even if you never heard of the people the movie is about. This movie is a great love story even if you never heard of Johnny and June Cash. Oscars all around I say! Plus I loved the Rockabilly music through out the movie.",9,224,281,18 November 2005
Friday Night Lights," Child Abuse Glorified
","'Lights' was shot the way I was afraid it would be.. glorifying this type of 'all out' High School football rather than condemning it. The Book was written to show how 'out of control' football has gotten in Texas. But the movie seemed to justify even the abusive parents. A parent decks his son and the coaches just watch and wait for the abuse to end, then they go right back to practice. In a book the author can editorialize, but in a movie they must take action or the viewer thinks that the abuse is o'k. Too many sports fans I know thought this movie was great and wished all High Schools had football programs like Texas. Their attitude was: 'I'm better than you because I played football' and that is just so sad. Sports has gotten out of control in America. I love sports, but I don't plan my life around. I don't live for the next game. I can watch a movie or go play Golf then check the scores later. I don't tape games to watch later. Spend time with your families not with million dollar sports stars. I like Billy Bob Thornton but even he couldn't save this movie for me. I have not met one person who felt the movie condemned 'all out sports'. But that was why the book was written! The book was written to show how High School football in Texas is nothing more than child abuse... Cohen and Berg re-wrote it to glorify abuse and Hollywoodize it. If this is how most football programs in Texas are run, they should be shut down. And I think most Texas football programs are still run this way or close to it. How sad that a kid would think he is worthless because he dropped a pass.",2,6,12,29 May 2006
Donnie Darko," Dallas dream ending
","This could have been a very good movie.... but it wasn't. I liked the movie all the way to the 'Dallas-it-was-all-just-a-dream' ending. O'k here is the problem with the ending... if his Mom's plane didn't crash, then where did the jet engine come from?????? So none of the rest of the movie makes sense. I liked the actors, the script was out there, but I was willing to go with it, but the ending ruined the entire movie. Teen angst is great for a movie, but the ending eliminated the teen angst, since the teen was dead all of the time anyway. There have been sooo many time travel movies made, you really have to go the extra mile to make a time travel movie work. The ending lost that extra mile. I think the Writer/Director just had no real ending for the movie, so he just pulled this ending from his butt and explained it as new and different. It wasn't. It was done in the 80's on the TV show Dallas. Remember the whole Bobby-wasn't-dead-it-was-just-a-dream season? Or the ending to Newhart? It just twisted it to he didn't live, but was dead the whole time. Very lame. Too bad, because it had a very good cast.",1,10,21,20 October 2006
