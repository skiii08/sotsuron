Requiem for a Dream," A haunting, outstanding film that could possibly change your life forever.
","When I first heard about this movie, I thought 'nothing could be more heart-wrenching when it comes to showing the dark side of drugs than Trainspotting.' Man oh man, was I wrong! This film absolutely blew me away. It's one of those films that you just can't stop thinking about. The haunting images and emotions I felt during the film stay with me even at this moment.Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly had phenomenal performances in this film. Their characters were so vulnerable that I couldn't help but feel the strongest compassion for them. Jared Leto's talent really shines through in this film. He proves that he can go beyond acting in a supporting role and really knock your socks off in a leading role. In the scene where Harry and Marion are on the phone when Harry is in the prison, I have never felt more sorrow while watching a scene. I also found the scene when Harry wakes up after having his arm amputated extremely haunting. Though it is extremely short, that scene really sticks out in my memory.Ellen Burstyn steals the show in this film. I had never actually seen her in any other films, but after seeing this, I definitely want to see her more! The way she transforms from an addicted television viewer into a crazy, diet-pill addicted, ill woman was phenomenal. The music in this film really added to its intensity. The theme song played over and over was absolutely chilling and literally made the hair on my arms stand on end. This film would not have been the same without it.I could go on and on about how phenomenal this film was, but I am going to conclude with this. Requiem for a Dream is a MUST SEE. The direction and cinematography of the film was out of this world amazing and beautiful. I had never seen anything like it! It may be uncomfortable to watch, but it is an incredibly important movie. It is something everyone should watch. The story and the characters are so real that you can't help but feel pain for them. Although I do not believe doing drugs is right by any means, I was able to sympathize with the drug addicts and could actually relate to them (which I never would have imagined would be possible). All in all, this film changed my life.",10,9,16,28 September 2008
