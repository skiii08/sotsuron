Iron Man 3," Lived up to expectations and even went over it!
","I went to see this movie with relatively high expectations because of the splendid trailer and the good things i read about it. It makes me happy to report that it lived up to the expectations, like many said before. Also something what many said before is the fact that we see a lot more of the human side of Tony, other than the egocentric billionaire...And that's a good thing. Pepper on the other hand is more 'present' in the movie and i appreciated that a lot. The story in general is actually better than i expected, or as i'm used to in most action movies. It's difficult to write about the story without spoiling things so i'm going to keep it with that for the story. The special effects are (like all the Iron Man's) very spectacular and there's some new tech too, to keep Iron Man up to date ;p. I'm really afraid of spoiling things, so i'm going to wrap up here! GO WATCH IT! You won't regret it!",9,2,9,2 May 2013
