Alien 3," Spectacular!
","How anyone could dislike this film is something I can cope with, but I certainly cannot approve of! This motion picture is quite likely one of the most underrated films of all time. In my opinion, it outdoes all others in the series by miles. The ending was so noble, and such an incredible end to a good series, that it sent chills down my spine! Its content is amazing, especially when you consider the fact that David Fincher's only big-time work prior to this were some Madonna music videos. The first one shocked you. The second one thrilled you. The third one will make you cry - one way or another.",Null,1,3,5 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Critics, try prozac, this flick is 10 out of 10!
","WARNING! Depending on your definition of the word, this review  may contain tiny spoilers!I was quite privilaged to see this film at 9:15 a.m. May 19, and it RULED! I have seen this film 5 times since then, and i'm telling you, the critics are NUTS! This is the holy grail of sci-fi! When I went to school the next day, though, other people that saw it were quite disappointed. I almost totally disagree with them, except there was one major fault: Jar Jar Binks. His speech impediment...his stupid antics...even Qui-Gon found him annoying! But the ultimate reason to see this movie: Darth Maul. Gotta admit you loved this guy. He's like, sooooo cool! Admit it... the double-bladed lightsaber... the awesome makeup... the neat eye color... his solemn silence... the ultimate evil villain. Can't beat it! If you haven't seen this movie, I will say to you what all those squares out there said to us Star Wars fans and trekkies, ' Get a life! '.",10,5,7,3 August 1999
