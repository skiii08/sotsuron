Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Mind Blown !!
",Man oh Man... what an amazing movie this is. I never anticipated this movie to be so fantastic. There are many people who didn't like this movie. complaining about few details missed from trailers etc. but none of that matters. I didn't have much expectations for this movie. because there isn't any actors from main movies. i just basically wanted to watch this movie coz i have seen all other star wars movies. Initially the movie was going in a slow pace but gradually it started picking up its pace. All the cast were awesome. Lot of old school spaceships etc reminded me the times when i watched star wars for first time. the action scenes by Donnie yen were awesome. i liked Forrest Whitaker's presence and acting. Background music was awesome as ever. And the ending was so EPIC. I recommend this movie to everyone. Please do watch this movie. It is deserved to be on IMDb's top 250.,10,3,9,24 December 2016
Passengers," Good sci-fi movie.
","Not that great but definitely good one. well, this movie is directed by the same guy who directed 'the imitation game', the basic concept idea behind the story of this movie is really good. but the way it is shown on screenplay was not up to the mark i guess. that's where this failed. the main thing i liked the most in the movie is the visual effects, since this was 3D movie. the stunning visual effects and all the usual sci-fi stuff used in the movie were great. i liked Michael sheen who happened to play bartender role. there is good humor in this movie. and good to watch once. i thought this movie would get nominated for visual effects in academy awards. sadly it didn't. overall a OK-good kind of movie.",7,2,4,5 February 2017
Suicide Squad," Funny and Awesome. !!
","Will smith is one of great actor and i have been looking forward to watch his movies. All of his upcoming movies were about average. When this movie finally got released, me and my friends were very egar to watch it. This movie was amazingly funny and awesome. Just like Marvel's deadpool, DC's anti hero movie Suicide Squad. All characters in this movie are crafted well. Especially the Jokers's character is really very well played by Jared letto. It was ambiguous that no one can ever meet performance of Joker other than heath leadger. But jared has performed that superbly. One of main attraction in this movie is of course Harley Quinn. perfect role played by morgot robbie as insane joker's girlfriend. Well, the story was well written. and visual effects were really great. Batman and flash sequences were also great. Overall wonderful movie and very good to have fun watching with friends.",9,0,2,9 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Excellent and Entertaining !
","I am a usual superhero fan , i haven't read that many comics.. but i have watched all marvel movies. I had no idea of this character doctor strange. I didn't get that many idea from trailers. but when i saw this movie, my mind was blown. those stunning visual effects and in 3D.. ultimate experience.. visual effects and actions were like inception and i should say it was better than inception. well i liked all the characters and acting. Benedict cumberbatch is the perfect actor for this character. Rachel mc Adams acting was superb. but story lacked in training of doctor strange. Marvel humor was good as usual. and new infinity stone came to light finally... time stone. i am looking forward to watch doctor strange 2 and this character in Thor Ragnarok and infinity wars. Overall a fun and entertaining movie.",10,3,7,6 November 2016

Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Ultimate 3D experience and lots of fun !
","Here we go !! The wait is over for this movie. I bet everyone missed harry potter from past few years. well, this movie gives you exact thrills and chills as any of harry potter movie. you don't have to be fan of harry potter or there is no major links from this movie to harry potter movies, there are certain Easter eggs. I am your average movie fan. I haven't read any of novels. and i almost had forgot stories of harry potter movies. Watching this movie certainly brought back memories. The story is around 1920s , which relates to American era where most of them thought witchcraft existed. This movie takes place in New York. All the casting were really good choice. Eddy Redmayne has performed another wonderful character, its so good to see him in those nerdy characters. Qweeny part portrayed by Lucie phol aka Fine Frenzy is so beautiful. 3D , animations , beast characters were very creative and mind blowing experience to watch them on big screen. Story was good but in my opinion it needed to be bit more descriptive. i guess those parts come in next movie. I am so thrilled, cant wait for 4 more movies of this franchise. Do watch this, you wont regret it.",9,3,7,21 November 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Awesome 3D effects and good story...
","This is best spiderman movie so far.... spidy slow motion scenes are ultimate...(andrew garfield acting is no match for Toby's acting). This movie is Better spiderman and worse peter parker.. peter parker friend's acting is good.. they should have showed more about peter parker's friend..i was disappointed after wathching Amazing spiderman 1, but Amazing spiderman 2 is far better than first movie... completely satisfied.. Emma stone acting is really nice... Expected rhino scene a big fight.. but it was less than 2 mins. but CGI are really good.. However Director is changed in next movie.. it is not Marc webb.. well this is a must watch movie for marvel fans.. PS: post credit scene was useless, they showed xmen trailer which we saw on IMDb.",10,9,23,13 May 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Awesome ! must watch.
","I was waiting from so long time. I had lot of expectations for this movie. Avengers first movie was superb and was huge success. but this is far better and awesome than first movie. I watched this with my friends. and everyone in the theater was happy when movie ends. action are unbeatable. Only disspointing thing is tat Loki is not shown in movie. but things storyline, action, cinematography are amazing. and it made me speechless. starting scene with slow motion was superb.. i sat there with jaw open. completely entertaining and mind blowing . please do watch this movie.. watch with ur family and friends and have fun. it is suitable for witing top 30 of IMDb.",10,1,7,26 April 2015
Don't Breathe," One watchable - not bad movie.
","This was movie which me and my friends did a sudden plan to watch for weekend. it was very long time since we watched horror movie on big screen. this movie was not too good nor that bad. It had lot of jump scares. All the actors are a bit new , but they have done a good job. Story was bit okay and small one. That old man has acted good and that character is good and scary. there is this one disgusting scene but that seems necessary to make movie bit horrifying. Well if you are expecting a great horror movie with high expectation, you will be disappointed. overall it is fun to watch once. there is this dog in this movie, it gets on your nerves sometimes. rest of the movie is overall good. i give 7 ratings. this is my honest opinion.",7,2,6,9 September 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Amazing movie.. enjoyed Batman v Superman !
","Me and my friends were waiting for this movie from very long time.. I am big fan of Batman. Just watched the movie and felt really great. First of all the visual effects were awesome. As always promising visual effects for all fighting scenes by zack snyder. Story was not much intriguing but i believe all actors performed great. Ben afflick was not a bad batman after all. Gal gadot as wonder woman was superb. To be true, all audience in theater cheered more for wonder woman than to Batman or superman. the costume design was great. Lux luthor character is well shown. jessie eisenberg didn't mess up the part. I hated that they changed character actor of flash. i also missed green arrow who was one who also helped batman in fight against superman in comics and animated movies. but comparison to comics aside, movie script was great inside its own boundary. Ultimate background music by Hans zimmer. Overall a great movie.. hoping to watch again.",10,0,1,26 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Awesome ! Enjoyed a lot.
","So finally the wait is over. I waited so long for this movie. After watching the trailer, I couldn't wait for movie to be released. When i watched it, this movie exceeded my expectation. I hope the same will be felt for all other fans. I have watched all 6 star wars movies. Every one of them is my favorite. To speak about story. story-line is great. Screenplay is superb. CGI effects are mind-blowing. Acting part is also good. Harrison ford is great actor. Daisy Ridley has performed her character well. All of the action scenes are great. A must watch movie. Cant wait for another movie. I can watch this movie again and again. There is not much noticeable cons in this movie.",10,4,42,12 January 2016
Deadpool," Awesome , intriguing !
","I have been waiting for this movie since first teaser. This is real masterpiece! me and my friends had so much fun watching this movie. Story, screenplay , Direction were excellent. Every scene is carefully directed. When u watch this movie, you gonna love each and every moment of the movie. This movie certainly reached my expectation. The Deadpool character is very well displayed just like in the comics. To talk about acting, Ryan played a massive role in acting. Even though most of the time he will be under mask, the bonding with character is great. So much fun stuff, this makes us watch movie again and again. I really miss 3D. But it doesn't matter anymore. This movie is great!. I really recommend to everyone.",10,4,13,16 February 2016
