The Ring," More of a mystery
","Not the least bit scary, folks!  Interesting concept, but found ending a bit confusing.  This would be much better classified as suspense/mystery.  If I had paid theater prices to see it, would have been disappointed.  All said, if you liked 'Blair Witch Project' you'll enjoy this one.",Null,0,1,11 May 2003
Lost in Translation," What's all the fuss?
","I found this movie very boring and hard to watch.  Slow moving & overrated. Big deal!  So another man faces midlife with a young hippie chick at his side.  Who cares?!  I chuckled a few times, but was overall unsatisfied. How this movie won any globes, just dunno!  Can only hope that it doesn't get any oscars.  Compare this dog to a movie like 'The Color Purple' (which was shut out) and you'll understand.  Would have been very angry if I paid theater prices to see this.  Boring boring boring!",Null,1,2,1 February 2004
