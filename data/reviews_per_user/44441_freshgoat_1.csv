Alien 3," Can't dismiss it...
","Given the embryonic state of the film throughout its life, it is a mischievous masterpiece because of the fight between the original ideas of the director,the screenplay and 'fox'. Reagardless of the squabbles,somehow they managed it. The director's cut especially. The film continues the Ripley saga and for the most part, she is without fault. The script dictates the actors sometimes. The script, the bleakness and simplicity of the locations only heightened the feeling of claustrophobia apparent in the production. Mostly English, mostly miserable actors who excel at this type of work. Charles Dance deserves a particular mention as the doctor, who convinces at all times. And without forgetting the lady herself... Ripley. Sigourney plays Ripley as only she can. The only criticism I have is the inclusion of Fu.... Bloo... CGI.I mean, why? It demeans the film. If CGI doesn't look better than the traditional methods, don't use it. Simple. Excellent film with a few foibles :)",9,4,5,14 September 2012
