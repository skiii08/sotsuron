The Blair Witch Project," Man, that thing gave me the willies!
","Note: this comment has a pseudo-spoiler, but won't reveal any plot points.By working so well, this movie is a great example of where horror movies have gone wrong.  I've had friends say 'That movie sucked!  You never saw anything!' and my response to them was that they were looking for The Haunting.The Blair Witch Project, by providing the audience with a totally irresistible sense of dread ('oh man, they're not really going to have to be in the woods another night!?!') shows with great clarity why old-school horror movies are regarded as classics more often than, say, zombie movies. All the best horror movies have made people wait for the glimpse of the Beast (Alien, Jaws are good examples) and BWP takes that idea to its logical conclusion.I had the willies for about four hours after the movie was over.  That hasn't happened since I was little.The only problem with the film: to make a feature-length movie, they inserted maybe too much (maybe way too much) arguing between the campers... at times the movie turned from The Horror That Lurks In The Woods into The Horror Of Having Housemates That Hate Each Other.Definitely worth seeing, but I'd see it during daylight.",Null,0,1,10 August 1999
