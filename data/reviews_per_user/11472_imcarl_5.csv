The Blair Witch Project," Excellent Movie - if you can suspend you disbelief
","I just rented this movie and was blown away. Using what I think was two camcorders, no special effects, no music and an under $50,000 dollar budget, three (probably more as well) filmmakers made a hair raising, wonderfully crafted movie that scares effortlessly without one single, scary scene. The premise starts with 3 students attempting to make a documentary on a local legend-The Blair Witch. They interview the local people living around and eventually go into the forest to search for a cemetery. They eventually get hopelessly lost and we see a wonderfully realistic transformation from hope, to anger, to sadness, to absolute desperacy. The acting is completely unscripted-and to a person who lives in movies where every line has five minutes of thought behind it, might find it a little one note, but if you can forget it's a movie, one will see it's an amazing performance. The characters truly develop and if any of you have been camping for a long time, it will feel very realistic. From bicker to tears everything works well. The premise behind the movie, is that you have to suspend your disbelief and doubts and accept that the everything is real, and further, immerse yourself in the experience and pretend that you are lost in the forest. If you enjoy movies that go to lengths to scare the apathetic viewer, you won't like this movie. It requires empathy and understanding, an once you can accept that, it will blow you away. And if you can, the movie can give a real tense scare and a wild adrenaline rush, without one scary scene.",9,1,2,10 March 2005
Howl's Moving Castle," Breathtaking like every Miyazaki film-but storyline a bit too much the same
","I think I should say this outright before I get started, Miyazaki cannot top Spirited Away. Orson Welles could not top Citizen Kane. Simply put, some directors make something so good they cannot beat it. So we should not expect too much. Needless to say, this is still Howl's Moving Castle is a very good film. The animation is rich, not quite as much as Spirited Away, but you cannot expect that much from one person. It's just fun to watch.I guess what hurts this film is that it uses every same plot device Miyazaki has used before. Howl has much in common Haku. The Wicked Witch of the Waste becomes much the same as every other MIyazaki initial villain. Sophie's journey has much in common with Chihiro's or Sen's. In many ways, this repeats a lot from Spirited Away but with too much absurdity and not of charm. The plot and explanations become complex or thrown together. It just doesn't have that usually ingenuity of his other movies.The entire point of this movie in the end was to take our breathe away with amazing sites. And it did. The animation is better and while it is not as good as his other films, it still is better than a lot of the stuff out there. So if you like Miyazaki or if you just like animation, see this movie. It's worth the five or six bucks. But don't expect a masterpiece like 'Spirited Away.'",8,2,4,23 June 2005
Schindler's List," Good - but a bit overrated
","In the past couple years, I have been taught about the Holocaust and the Rwanda genocide. And so out of curiosity, I have seen both movies made about the tragedies. Schindler's List was and is given a lot of praise, but I didn't find the movie as compelling as 'Hotel Rwanda' or many other stories. This movie sorely lacks characterization. In order for the audience to truly grasp the tragedy of genocide, we first need to establish a connection with the characters that undergo such torture. But the truth is, other than the main characters, those surrounding Oskar Schindler, we mostly never get to see the other characters through the methods of characterization. The almost never talk, a background story is rarely given, we never get an idea of other character's opinions about them and like I said they never talk. All we know about them is what we see. About the only the writer's and Spielberg lets us see the tragedy is watching total strangers go through h***, but we get no idea of their personality, hopes and dreams with the exception of some small addititions. This movie suffers the same fate as 'The Passion of the Christ.' It spends it's hours showing us blood, gore and misfortune and expects us to feel sorry for the characters. But without really understanding that the characters truly don't deserve the torture they go through, we can never really understand the tragedy. The film is good, but the lack of a rich cast of characters, I really cannot give this film a 9 or a 10.",10,3,9,14 April 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A Fun Movie - It doesn't want to do more
","Too many people complain about pointless things when discussing a film like this-it has not morale, no true characters, where's the drama.... But what this film wants to do is fill two hours and make it fun. The jokes were funny, the couple did, as Mr. Ebert said, had chemistry and the action sequences were interesting. If you're looking to spend some time at a theater, this is worth the trip. The only thing I can complain about was the camera. It was often way too focused in situations I thought should've been more clear. It was very jittery and not very colorful. But since the real power comes from the actors and script, I'd say it was still enjoyable. Will it win an Oscar? No. Will it be timeless? No. But was it fun. Yes.",8,1,6,12 June 2005
Goodfellas," Completely Pointless - This is way overrated
","I was bored in study hall, it was a Friday before a long break, so I decided to watch this movie. Have you ever listened to a song compressed to an unreasonable size? This is what this film is. Crushed to a time of around of 72 minutes, this story could really use two. The truth is, this film doesn't convey anything. There's no central point or conflict. 'Pulp Fiction', a much better film, pulled off the lack of a main central conflict, but without any characterization, or a sense of a real journey this film suffers the same fate as the boring 'Aviator'. The story of a real person with a lot of glitz and gloss galore in every seen but a severe lack of content. Every seen moves very fast and everything happens instaneously and they use a narrator to fill in the blanks of information they use narrators. Characterization dies and a quick and painless death in this pointless script. I'm pretty sure the book writer and writer of the script had a central conflict or point of the film in mind when they wrote it, however, it never comes out in the film. This movie is just bad.",1,27,83,16 April 2005
