Child 44," Two unsatisfying story lines
","Child 44 is not a detective story.Nor does it make any sense otherwise.I watched the trailer here to be sure, and yes, this movie is advertised as the story of a search for a serial killer. It is not! I guesstimate that maybe one fifth of the storyline concerns police vs. a serial killer, and that storyline about chasing down a serial killer is very superficial, in which deductions are made as if 'out of the blue,' and the killer is apprehended quickly. No suspense whatsoever.The main thrust of the 'plot' is just as silly: a policeman (Tom Hardy) is a hero, is then disgraced and demoted (for dubious reasons), becomes a hero again and is promoted. Since the thrust of the movie portrays a regime's iron control over its citizens, it's illogical and even laughable that our 'hero' should be reinstated after going way off the grid to pursue a killer against orders. That's just one prime example of this movie's nonsense!Another example: the character that Gary Oldman plays doesn't serve any purpose.Considering that the neither of the two story lines makes any sense, I'm inclined to believe that neither does the depiction of life at a certain time in soviet Russia.I agree with reviewer John Wayne from United States: 'Citizen X' (1995) is an excellent movie about a search for a serial killer under a soviet regime: I recommend it.",3,14,32,30 April 2015
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," An interesting cartoon
","David Fincher (director) and Steven Zaillian (screenplay) accomplish a solid, if limited, vision of Stieg Larsson's internationally acclaimed novel. If that required making a dark cartoon of the title character, she's an unusually interesting one that apparently appealed to the filmmakers: the underdog/heroine with ready-made (by Larsson) makeup, wardrobe, and 'attitude.' With a personal story that could be tweaked to 'keep it simple' but is, by its nature, compelling. No worries about a sequel; 'Lisbeth's' story is tweaked into movie-style completion in this film. Something about international high finance to gratify 'Lisbeth' before she rides into the sunset on her motorcycle.If Rooney Mara's acting struck me as robotic, where's the harm? 'Lisbeth' = 'tough;' robots = 'tough.' To add a little - realism, is it? - she doesn't have to act just a little 'vulnerable,' she just moves through the plot element emphasized by the filmmakers to imply that she is, a little. Within their vision, a glaringly unrealistic element, in my opinion. And her halo slips while she viciously performs an unnecessary cruelty. But we suspend our better judgements when we are watching a cartoon, anyway. No big deal.Tweak the internationally acclaimed plot a little more, and the respected investigative reporter, 'Mikael'/Daniel Craig becomes the (surprisingly well acted) perfect foil, an absent-minded professor type who bumbles his way through his part in an investigation while our heroine saves the day. (To make sure we don't miss his bumbling, Stellan Skarsg√•rd's character calls attention to his idiotic behavior, chalking it up to human foibles). No point in throwing out the investigation of a decades-old mystery completely, as it adds its own 'spice' to the titillating mix. Besides, it's a ready-made (by Larsson) way to bring in 'Mikael'/Daniel to elicit 'Lisbeth'/Rooney's 'vulnerability.' But no need to dwell on any details of why/how two seemingly unlikely, previously unacquainted people manage to solve an 'unsolvable' mystery. (BTW, Chris Plummer overacts his part: he brings poignancy and gravitas to this throwaway 'sub'plot).I did mind the film editing, which unbelievably won the 2012 Oscar. But if you're already familiar with this story and you keep your wits about you, or if you use mind-enhancing drugs, you should be able to follow along some of the rushed through, chopped up plot elements chosen by the filmmakers to sort-of-include in this tale.Overall, if you don't find the caricaturization of a punk 'tough cookie' to be offensive, you should find this movie enjoyable. Sort of like a 'real-life' Batman ensemble, with very nasty sex. If you might prefer characterization over caricaturization, and a story of two excellent and complementary detectives, the Swedish film of TGWTDT is for you.",3,2,11,2 April 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Superb film
","This is an excellent movie with a standalone plot, so that you wouldn't necessarily have to plan to watch parts 2 and 3 of 'The Girl' trilogy. The plot contains mystery, suspense, action, and closure.The two main actors, Rapace and Nyqvist, do such a great job of creating characters that that you might come to know and like that you might feel compelled to follow them into parts 2 and 3; if so, you should plan on watching both of those, as 2 leads right into 3.The supporting actors are supportive, and the bleak winter Swedish landscape contributes to the pleasurable and menacing tone of the film.One of the most enjoyable movies that I have treated myself to, after reading the excellent books. I should add that this movie contains 'very mature' themes.",Null,2,3,13 October 2011
Thor," Ack! Boring
","What a disappointment! Even the so-called 'action' was sub-standard. The great actors must have been directed not to emote. And why were they paired with totally boring clones?? (Clones in that they were all boring). Maybe I could grant Chris Hemsworth a silver star for displaying a slight bit of charm. Subtotal: No engaging plot, no engaging dialog, no engaging acting, no engaging action. Yeah, yeah, clash, clash. I frequently enjoy 'mindless' movies, but not this time. To top it off, the graphics were so annoying that whenever we left the desolate New Mexican desert for the colorfully depicted alternative world (or whatever that was), I mentally squirmed. Remind me not to frequent any more movies directed by Kenneth Branagh; he seems as convenient a patsy as any of them.",Null,0,2,29 September 2011
Jersey Boys," I expected a celebration, not a dirge
","If you don't have any particular reason to see this movie, you should skip it. I was expecting a celebration of the music, but there is little joy to balance the dreariness in this film.The acting is adequate, so I don't think it would be fair to pick on the actors; the screenplay is dull. I was looking at my watch towards the end.Yes, indeed, my foot was tapping on its own volition during performances of their songs! But there were few of those scenes.The movie focuses so much on the hard knocks that I'm left wondering, 'Was it all about the money?' Not how I expected to leave the theater.",5,5,22,25 June 2014
Godzilla," Anti-climatic
","I went to this movie to see Godzilla, and I hardly ever saw him. When I did see him, he looked clumsy and facially not as attractive as previous incarnations. That and an anti- climax spoiled the movie for me, in spite of some good 3D effects.I was annoyed by several cuts of scenes that caused me to wonder, 'what just happened??' Also, the spoof of 1950's flicks doesn't quite come off.What will stand out in my mind will be the 3 forces of nature battling it out (briefly) oblivious to the smashed city under their feet. Maybe that will be worth it to you.",3,15,31,23 May 2014
