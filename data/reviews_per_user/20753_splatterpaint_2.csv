The King's Speech," Breathtaking
","Wow. Just wow. I can't put my finger on it but, that was the single best movie I have ever seen. It puts all other movies in the dust. If there is one movie you have to see before you die, it's The King's Speech. It wasn't a funny movie, but when there was a joke it was pretty funny. Character development people, character development. I made the movie. I didn't like Queen Elizabeth very much, she seemed too uptight and snooty in the movie, although I was happy that she supported her husband through his journey. I was holding my breath throughout the speech. I have never liked historical movies, but this one blew me away.",Null,0,1,11 September 2011
Rango," Go Rango!!!!
","I have nothing but praise for Rango. It was one of the best movies I have seen all year. Definitely on my personal list of top 50 movies. A great movie to see with friends and a great family movie. Both of the friends I went to see it with didn't like it for some dumb reason or another, but I absolutely loved it. I was laughing for weeks after, more than worth the $12 I spent to see it in theaters. I was crying because I was laughing so much.I really enjoyed it, all 107 minutes of it. Rango is such a great character, so dramatic and triumphant. The only thing was that I didn't see much character development on his part. These days it's hard to come across good original comedy, but Rango was original and silly. In the trailer they show the actors acting out the movie, and throughout the movie I pictured the actors as the characters and let me tell you it was hysterically funny and it added to my experience. I also felt that it helped the actors get into character more.",10,1,1,11 September 2011
