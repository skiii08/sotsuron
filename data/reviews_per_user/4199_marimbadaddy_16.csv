"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Excellent laughter with just a touch of heart
","Simon Pegg does it again with another excellent performance. Though not as campy or satirical as Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead, Run Fatboy Run features his excellent comedic timing, and a solid cast. I wouldn't necessarily classify this movie as a romantic comedy, it does have a bit of that in its tone. However, it does contain plenty of the slapstick that we've come to appreciate from Pegg's previous work.Pegg plays Dennis, a looser who has made nothing of his life but a mess. He discovers his ex-fianc√©e (Newton) is seeing Whit (Azaria) which hearkens jealousy, and the subsequent reevaluation of his life. He vows to run a marathon against his advisory Whit, to prove to that he can accomplish something. In the end he proves to himself that he can be more than he has thus far achieved, and winds up a hero not only to his love, but also the entire city.A fun movie, well worth the time to watch.",8,0,1,22 February 2009
Star Trek," Star Trek 2.0 - Sort of...
","I am a fan of all Star Trek TV series and Films; though I do not own any merchandise, uniforms, or Vulcan ears. I grew up watching TOS, adjusted to TNG, and thoroughly enjoyed the Latest Enterprise series. Though I do like the TNG the best, I do understand the significance of TOS in regards to its tackling of social issues, as well as inspiring an entire generation of engineers to produce the technology we live with today. I've never been to any Trek or Sci-fi conventions, so I am uncertain if I could be classified as a Trekkie or a Trekker, and wouldn't be insulted if someone called me either. (Some loathe being called a Trekkie.) This latest Star Trek film is both incredibly awesome, and somewhat disappointing. The action is great, the actors are wonderful, the special FX are excellent. The one issue I am having a difficult time coping with is the alternate universe. In essence, though this film adopts much of TOS and Enterprise's back story, it creates an impossible paradox of time travel, as well as completely altering the Star Trek universe if they decide to further this particular plot line in future films or TV series. Though the alternate universe issue is a well used device of TOS, TNG, and Enterprise; it is creating cognitive dissonance for me to attempt to reconcile these new plot points.However, the film is great, the characters are believable and real. Plus, the film is a lot of fun as we get to meet the young Kirk, Spook, Sulu, Checkov, Scotty, McCoy, and Uhura. There is a plethora of nods to TOS to satisfy everyone's inner Trekkie or Trekker, as well as plenty of new developments to increase our curiosity. My mother, who likes Star Trek well enough, but who is not anywhere close to understanding the subtleties of the alternate universe, particularly enjoyed this film too.",8,1,6,17 May 2009
Underworld," Excellent piece with plenty of grit
","Underworld is a highly stylized vampire and werewolf action movie. It sometimes appears on the horror shelf, but it really belongs in the action category. The vampires and werewolves do most of their killing with guns and not their razor sharp teeth. Thought there is a bit of gore, and transformation scenes, it is not scary. Of all of the deaths in the film, only one human is transformed into a creature, the rest are due to the war between the vampires and lycans (werewolves) as they are called in the film.The movie features excellent action sequences, and a very interesting plot. The writers also did an excellent job of creating characters with depth, history, and an agenda. This film even has a sci-fi subtext which describes the nature of the vampires and werewolves.One finds oneself drawn into the film quickly while following the lead character's quest to find answers. But as she finds more and more answers, they only lead to more questions.This is an excellent action movie, with the fun of the vampires and werewolves fighting it out.",8,0,0,14 July 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Pirates 2.1, got to wait a year for 2.2 to complete the plot
","Wow. A lot of fun. Almost as much fun as the Curse of the Black Pearl.I didn't like this as much as the first POTC film. Mainly because I couldn't get over Davy Jones' & his crew's severe dermatological problems. I guess it was hard for the effects team to top the undead moonlit creative genius from the first film.I also didn't like the fact that this film doesn't end. You will have to actually see the 3rd film to get to the denouement of the plot. Similar to the ending moments of Back to the Future 2, but not nearly as satisfying. As a matter of fact the ending of this film raises more questions than it answered. Though I may skip the the third film out of spite. So the title should be 2.1 and the third film should actually be called Pirates of the Caribbean 2.2: The Curse of Disney Co's Greed.",9,1,8,28 July 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of the Snores
","This is by far the 'worst' of all of the Star Wars films (including the Animated Clone Wars Movie). I use the term worst lightly as it is an overall good film, it just doesn't hold up to the dramatic standards of the original trilogy or Phantom Menace.I felt while watching this movie that the relationship between Anikin and Padme was not fully fleshed out, and I don't mean in the physical way. As both of these characters were fighting there training, expectations, and duties, neither seemed conflicted enough, nor was there sufficient tension established during their romantic development. This is reinforced when one watches the deleted scenes dealing with some of these issues. Obviously they were edited out for time, and perhaps their inherent sappy quality, but would have made their secret romance far more satisfying to the audience, and Padme's surrender to her feelings more fulfilling.Outside of the lack of depth to the main character's romance, the film was excellent. The chase scene through the air space of Coruscant is just incredible, as is Yoda finally brandishing a lightsaber (if he had a meat cleaver instead, he could also double as a food processor). The special FX are incredible as always with ILM's work, as is John Williams' score. Overall an great movie, and as it is part of a trilogy/hexology, it is somewhat difficult to judge it all by itself.",7,1,2,4 January 2009
Burn After Reading," Burn Before Watching
","Burn After Reading is a difficult movie to quantify. It has comedic moments, and I believe that is the overall intention. However, it also features some confusing drama, some of which has no seeming point. I suppose it is in the WTF? milieu of film genre, but it really isn't cerebral. Weird.Brad Pitt certainly has the best character and performance as the idiotic personal trainer secret agent wannabe. He is quite funny in just about every scene he's in. But that is off set by Malcovich's angry and quirky character, which I can't even remember what the heck happened to him in the end. It is also unclear as what the point of Clooney's character was, perhaps other than being an A-hole. Weird.Though there are some funny moments, I finished the movie and continued to ask myself: 'what was the point of that?' Not quite as bad as 90 minutes of your life you won't get back, but almost. Weird.",4,3,6,22 February 2009
Wanted," Haven't I Already Seen This Already? Oh Yeah, The Matrix.
","This was a very disappointing movie. It had great action sequences, but the plot was extremely thin, boring, and predictable. Once the main character is recruited and trained, I would be amazed if anyone in the audience doesn't realize that he in fact is going to kill his own father, rather than avenge him.I really don't feel that there is a need to show in slow-motion: bullet's going through someone's skull; the skin being stretched out; and the little bits of brain and skull wafting out. Oh, and we get to see it both in forwards and reverse, how uncool! So what is the director thinking: 'Okay, we have a thin script with a paper thin plot, lets put some gore and well worn out special effects in'; 'Oh yeah, and Angelina's sweet booty, that should help fool the audience.' This film is too Matrixesque, with some elements from Jumper thrown in. Give me a break, if you are going to copy the Matrix, please at least make the plot fun, or over the top; either suspend my belief entirely, or make the film and characters believable.My recommendation: skip this and rent The Matrix series, and Jumper. Both of these are fun and highly entertaining.",4,0,2,3 January 2009
Tropic Thunder," Fumble in the Jungle
","Hysterical fun! I believe the intention of this movie is mainly to spoof Hollywood, and self centered actors, and not so much Vietnam War pictures. There was some great humor in and throughout this movie. The fake trailers at the beginning were particularly memorable, so be sure to watch all of the trailers on the DVD, as they are mixed in with the real trailers.Ben Stiller as the straight man is great, especially to Jack Black's freaking out. Robert Downey Jr. was unbelievably funny and over the top, even just the premise of his character's character is funny in and of itself.Tropic Thunder is a bit similar to the premise of Galaxy Quest where the actors end up fighting in a 'reality situation', the traditional fish out of water scenario. But whereas Galaxy Quest meant to spoof the genre, Tropic Thunder is poking fun at the film industry and the vanity of many actors. It is a fun movie well worth the rental fee.",7,0,0,4 January 2009
The Love Guru," A decent 90 minute diversion
","Before seeing this movie I'd read a few scathing reviews. So, I went into this movie expecting the worst. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is fair, with several hysterical laugh out loud moments.I do believe that there are too many emotional threads which may have lead to the generation of so many poor reviews. There are times where the movie struggles to have heart, but fails. Other instances the movie wants to have high action, which is decent. And further times where the film goes straight to potty humor, which is raunchy and pretty good. Some of the characters could have been given more depth. For example, Jessica Alba's character is fairly weak, as is Myer's side kick/assistant. Although entertaining, Myers' character is not very engaging or admirable. The main character's self realization is undercut by the lack of high quality writing coupled with the lack of character depth.There are some pluses however. Justin Timberlake's character is great. Way over the top! There is some good physical comedy, and the elephant scene is hysterical. The interaction of Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan is excellent (reminded me of the sports commentators from Bedazzled-2000.) I like the fact that they used real NHL teams and such, Rob Blake appeared for his team, and that action looked fairly authentic. I was also surprised that Deepak Chopra himself appeared in the film.It would seem that the script was one draft shy of finding success. However, having to satisfy the studio, NHL, and Deepak Chopra may have led to the weakness of the script. If you come to this movie with low expectations you will probably enjoy it. However, if you are coming to this movie expecting the next great film from Myers, you will no doubt be sorely disappointed. Take it for what it is worth, a 90 minute diversion from real life, brain candy, and all in fun.",5,4,9,22 September 2008
The Dark Knight," Wow - Mind Blowing Action
","The Dark Knight was probably the best action film I've ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that we've not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledger's best performance from his all too short career.The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesn't use too much 'face time' on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.",10,13,24,22 February 2009
2001: A Space Odyssey," A must see for any science fiction fan
","Having been weaned on Star Wars, and Battle Star Gallactica, it was after seeing these productions that I finally saw 2001. It is a great film, with still stunning special effects. I think even in the actual 21st century, with all of the computer generated, and other hight tech visual and special effects, this movie still delivers.The plot is great with the theme of technology gone berserk. The actors give good performances and the technical crew did an amazing job of making the audience believe these guys are actually in outer space.I'm not real sure how far off the book that Kubrick got, but I'm aware that he and Arthur C. Clark had many arguments about the script. Although the movie clearly can stand alone, it is helpful to see or read the sequel 2010. Though the film 2010 isn't as good as 2001, it is very good visually, and features some good performance from John Lithgow, and Roy Schieder. There is also a third book by Clark, 3001: the Final Odyssey which completes the story. I'd be surprised if that ever makes it onto the big screen though.",9,0,2,29 July 2006
Hancock," Enjoyable Antisuperhero Movie
","I enjoyed the fact that Hancock is an anti-superhero, with a severe personality disorder, and a drinking problem. I would have liked to have seen Jason Batemen's character have been a bit more outgoing, as he is eventually overshadowed by Smith and Theron. However, the threesome's interaction is pretty good.This movie was far more dramatic than My Super Ex Girlfriend, which has comparable plot elements, but still has some funny moments. The ending of the movie seemed rushed, perhaps because there was not a strong establishment of a villain throughout. In fact, the movie starts out with Hancock being his own worst enemy, but towards the end, his own inner battle is forgotten, overshadowed, or replaced by an outer battle with foes.Ultimately, this is fun for a while, then gets mired down in drama. The ending is somewhat satisfying, and somewhat unsatisfying. Not so disappointing that it is not worth renting.",6,0,2,3 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the Prequels
","It is impossible to judge this film on it's own. One has to have seen the Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones to really appreciate the Fall of Anakin Skywalker. And even though (most of us) know how the film is going to end, we still really feel for Anakin as he makes the wrong choices but for the right reasons.I also wonder what it would be like to see the entire series from PM through Jedi, without having seen the original trilogy first. Some of the surprises we felt in 'Empire' and 'Jedi' are certainly changed by the events in this film particularly.I know a lot of people were very disappointed with Episodes 1 and 2, having waited nearly 20 years for this part of the story to be revealed. However, Sith really is much better than the first two, both in action and drama. After Empire, Sith has become my second favorite chapter in the hexology.",10,0,2,5 August 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars: The Disillusionment of a Fan Base
","I renounce Disney and Star Wars.If you have only seen the movies, you probably will like this one. But if you are a fan of the novels and the expanded universe ‚Äì you will most likely hate it, or it will make you extremely uncomfortable. It ignores all of the events of the novels and makes up an entirely different (and extremely lame) history. I wish I could love this movie. Heck, I wish I could like it.Why would Disney pay 4 billion dollars for a franchise with a rich universe and a broad fan base only to negate most of it? Oh, yea. That's apparently Abram's thing ‚Äì completely ruining an established franchise. I foresee the need for Star Wars recovery groups. TFA is just a retread of Episode IV ANH - Chasing after a droid containing important information, and blowing up a giant planet destroying weapon. So, there was all of this hype regarding firing the initial screenwriter, and Abrams taking it over. That was obviously a huge mistake.The film looked great. It was fun, exciting, and had most of the great elements of a Star Wars story. The score by Williams is great. Special FX also great. I like the new characters Finn, Rey, and Poe. Supreme Leader Snoke and Kylo Ren were both lame and lacking characters. And it's difficult to swallow that Ren, trained in both the light and dark side, even with an injury, would have such a difficult time battling an individual with no apparent force talent wielding a light saber, or a girl with obvious force talent, but who is completely untrained.Harrison Ford is truly the star of this film, and he is great. His character arc was completed with full satisfaction.Unfortunately the film is so fast paced, and there is never a pointer scene where we are allowed to breathe and to digest the plot of the film.I wish Disney would have just followed through with re-releasing the first 6 films in 3-D. They would have made money on that investment, and that strategy would have afforded them the time to really analyze the vast amount of material they had to draw from. There are several of the novel trilogies that would have made far better films and not abandoned a vast fan base. If they would have consulted with one or a few of these great Scifi writers, there might have even been a way to tell Abram's story and still make it fit in the existing universe.Plot Hole - Anakin & Luke's Lightsaber ‚Äì That is the one that was lost when Darth Vader chopped off Luke's hand in Bespin. I'm not sure, but didn't it fall out of the bottom with Luke when he ended up hanging on the antenna, and it continued to plummet into the atmosphere of that gas giant? (Though, somewhere in the expanded universe, it was recovered along with his hand, and was used to clone a version of Luke.)Conclusion ‚Äì This was a good movie, just not a good Star Wars movie. TFA makes any of the prequel trilogy look like masterpieces.",5,23,34,21 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Timeless Classic
","I'd been wondering how Star Wars: A New Hope would stand up to the prequel trilogy visually. The release of the DVD version with the cleaned up effects keeps this a classic that can hold pace int the modern era. One can watch the whole series from Phantom Menace to Return of the Jedi and be visually satisfied throughout. I wonder if we'll ever have an opportunity to see all six films in sequence at a theater.One of the greatest movies ever, this film will keep entertaining future generations. It has every element to satisfy the individual, classic story, magic, dogfights, romance, stunning cinematography.",10,1,2,5 August 2006
Pineapple Express," Not quite as funny as I expected
","The Pineapple Express is not as funny as some of Seth Rogen's other films, like Superbad, or the 40 Year Old Virgin, and is somewhat disappointing. That said however, it is a funny film and well worth watching.The premise and plot is somewhat predictable as a couple of stoners get involved with a murderous drug dealer, and stumble and bumble whilst on the run. The situations are sometimes predictable and sometimes quite funny. Rogen's and Franco's performances are both great, and leave the audience laughing.Overall well worth watching.",7,2,5,22 February 2009
