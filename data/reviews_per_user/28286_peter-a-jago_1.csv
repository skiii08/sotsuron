Hereditary," Terrifyingly...awful.
","Toni Collette has lost the plot, and so have the writers. 
She spends most of her time making small miniatures of her family life, not lifting up her head to see what's going on in the real world. 
She forces her daughter to go to a college party with her son. She dies. 
Her husband tries to help. He dies. 
Her son gets possessed by an evil entity. He dies. 
You just know that when she makes friends with Aunt Lydia, from The Hanmaids Tale, it won't end well.. it didn't. 
I know there may 1 or 2 spoilers here, but I'm happy to have saved you $20.",1,3,7,15 October 2018
