Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Good, but in a really cringey way
","Well, what can I say? Having been a fan of S.B.C since the early days, that son of a bitch is getting braver and braver and after watching this am surprised that he didn't get a lynching. In my eyes the rodeo would have been the place.While not deep belly aching laughter, there was parts where I nearly spilled my drink at the guts he displayed in taking comedy to a level that hasn't been explored since Chris Morris' 'Jam'.I wanted to fast forward parts of the film because I felt so much for the situation. I was almost too scared to see him get a kicking.I give him an eight purely because the ending could have packed more punch than what it did.",8,1,3,25 January 2007
