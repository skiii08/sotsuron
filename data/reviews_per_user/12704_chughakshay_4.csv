Requiem for a Dream," Terrifying and anxiety inducing
","I found the film to be extremely hard to watch so much so I had to stop halfway and finish it the next day. This film excels at inducing anxiety in the viewer. The film has a lot of negative energy which is hard to process, averting the viewer from enging in the themes presented in the movie. I found the film terrifying and can comfortably say it's one of those films which is too negative to ever watch twice.",9,1,1,12 May 2020
The Aviator," Underrated film
","One of the best film I've ever watched, definitely in my top 10 and definitely underrated.",9,0,1,8 February 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Worst Tarantino film by far.
","Worst Tarantino film by far, prepare yourself to be sorely disappointed.",1,4,8,23 December 2019
Lucy," Perhaps one of the worst films I've ever watched
",Perhaps one of the worst films I've ever watched. You have to have an IQ of a toad to enjoy this film. The best part of the film was that it was only one and a half hours long so I didn't have to endure this catastrophe of a film for too long. You literally can't watch 1 minute of this film without running into a plot hole.,1,2,9,23 December 2019
