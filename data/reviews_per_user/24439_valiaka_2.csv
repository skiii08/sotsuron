Skyfall," One of the worst Bond movies ever
",Story line was what mostly spoiled this movie for me. M's corporate style excuse for betraying one of her agents actually made me root for the bad guy. Also made me happy to see her die at the end. Not a stellar finale for Judy's role as M.Bardem's tirade on what HCN does to a person when ingested was probably very impressive for somebody who never went to high school or never watched CSI.The Bond girls tradition was broken too. Normally the girls would leave a lasting impression - either good or bad. Not the case this time. Their screen presence was barely noticeable. I thought the franchise had hit rock bottom with Halle Berry in that regard. I stand corrected.Daniel Craig's and Javier Bardem's performances were stellar and this is the only reason I gave it 3 stars. And I am not sure I will be paying to see the next one. Unless the the franchise comes up with money back guarantee.,3,8,18,5 January 2013
Django Unchained," One of the best profanity movies of the year
","After the huge success of this movie over the past few weeks I started wondering what is Tarantino's winning recipe for this movie. Was it the depiction of brutality African people were subjected to during the slavery? Certainly not, since there are movies that do a much better job in that area. Was it the spaghetti western style? Not the best one in that area either. The satirical portrayal of some characters or situations? The movie has its funny moments, but with all of my generosity I could not call it a comedy nor a satire. And then it struck me. Profanity. Profanity spiced with a few jokes and the right dose of blood spatter. Thinking back to his previous work I started to see the pattern. This recipe seems to be very successful with the audience. Why not give the masses what they want, right? That one worked for Rome too. At least for a while. It seems to me the prophecy of the movie Idiocracy regarding our society is becoming a reality much sooner than expected.",1,96,177,7 January 2013
