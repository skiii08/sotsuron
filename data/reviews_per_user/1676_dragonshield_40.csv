Deja Vu," A decent thriller with the right amount of twists in it, yet an amusingly corny packed ride
","This movie was pretty much what I expected. Nothing too serious, just a fun ride from the beginning till the end. The plot has this good twist in it, which makes the movie interesting and there is overall pretty much the right amount of sci-fi and thriller blended together.What to expect from a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer? Explosions, gun fights, car chases and over the top dramatized scenes. Well, that's pretty much what you get from Déjà Vu. The movie's enjoyable, but like said before, it's nothing too serious. Denzel Washington is entertaining as usual, a right man for the role indeed. Don't expect this movie to contain any phenomenal role performances, as that is really not the case when it comes to movies like this one. This is just another perfect example of a movie which is only made for entertaining purposes. If you want to see this and you see this, it's what you expect it to be, nothing more or nothing less, you finish the movie with that usual smile on your face. Your entertain level is satisfied.The movie's a big cliché overall, quoting myself on what said before; Over the top dramatized scenes. I mean, it's so predictable. The cinematography almost does that all for you; Fast forwarding, slow motions, shaking the camera, the screen flashing white every now and then.. I could go on and on, but oh well, you get the point. That is sadly pretty much what the cinematography always does in these kind of movie nowadays. It's like every possible way of cinematography is already used before and no-one tries to make anything unique anymore. You could always just cut down the cliché(ish) ways and keep it simple and normal. Well, then the movies like these wouldn't actually be movies like these, so the cinematography does what it's supposed to do after all. You can't complain about that, now can you? The music is also used to make it more over the top and it's just a bunch of corny compositions put together to make the movie more emotional, but for me it's more like a bad joke. Overall the music is also so predictable, giving a random example of that; 'Now he sees a dead man, now his eyes freeze, now he walks next to the body, close-up shot of the body, corny piano music starts playing, close-up to the main character's eyes, now a tear drop, oh how sad' Yup, got it right again. So predictable. Well, you can't complain as then again, you get what you order.Like I mentioned before, the plot has this good twist in it and it does make the movie interesting. It's also a bit unique in its own way. Though it is surprising at first, it's all downhill after that, as then it catches that famous predictability. Well it's not as bad as you may think from that last sentence, it's just is what it is. Despite from all of this negative feedback I'd still recommend the movie if you're looking for an action packed ride with a bad ass lead actor in it.",6,27,49,3 May 2007
Casablanca," So precise and detailed, so nostalgic, so legendary. So good
","For a long time I felt ashamed that I had never seen 'Casablanca' which is among the most legendary movies ever made. Last night I finally had the chance to watch it and I was very surprised how good it actually was even this day when movies are so different. If you are going to watch this movie you honestly have to relate to the time when it was made, because if you're going to watch it like any other movie, you may be disappointed.It was breath taking to see how detailed this movie actually was. Everything's just so precise, from the dialog to every single item that you see on the screen, even if it was only in the background. You can't even compare the acting to acting these days, it just isn't anything near it, as it's a totally different art form of its own, so significant and so great. Every single word spoken by every character is so powerful and compelling, every word is precise and carefully chosen. Humphrey Bogart is perfect for the role, a bad ass American, Rick Blaine, who owns a night club at Casablanca during the World War II, but yet he is surprisingly soft-hearted. Then there's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, whose beauty shines through the screen in her role of Ilsa Lund, the woman who was Rick's one time love when they met in Paris. The story between Rick and Ilsa is filled with passion like no other, making the whole movie one of the most passionate movies ever made.The screenplay's just excellent and it also compliments the whole directing of the movie. It progresses with scenes that are just so phenomenal, so legendary and so nostalgic. It includes one of the most legendary quotes in the history of motion pictures, for example; 'Play it once, Sam', 'We'll always have Paris' and 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'. Even when I had never seen the movie, I just immediately recognised those sentences and smiled, as they are among the sentences everybody knows even if they've never seen 'Casablanca' before. The whole plot is also surprisingly exciting, comparing to the plots nowadays it would definitely work in any movie, as it is just so thrilling from the beginning till the end and you just can't know how it ends before the last minute of the movie. The final solution's just genius and it's actually so good that I had to start clapping my hands together when the movie ended. Superb.One of the best things now when I've seen the film is that I can finally be proud in saying 'I've seen Casablanca. And I love it' Even after 65 years, 'Casablanca' simply shines, making it enjoyable in every imaginable way. It's thrilling, it's passionate, it's flowing and it's just excellent. Throw away your thoughts of modernity and enjoy some real nostalgia with amazing role performances, superb directing and an excellent screenplay. A masterpiece.",9,3,5,6 May 2007
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Life of Brian - The bright side of that almost forgotten specific humour
","I bought 'Montys Enzyklo Pythonia' -DVD package a while back. It contains all the three movies and unfortunately one of those movies I had not seen before - 'Life of Brian' is a great comedy. It wasn't as good as I expected, but it sure was great. I have to admit that I still like 'Holy Grail' the most from the Monty Python movies. I didn't like 'The Meaning of Life' so much and I think it's the worst one of the three movies, though it isn't that bad after all. The story tells about.. Well, about the life of Brian, who is born in the exact same date as Jesus himself. After a few ten years Brian, a Jew in Roman-occupied Judea, is mistaken for a messiah which throws him into a plot he wouldn't want to be part of.The story itself is surprisingly good and the storyline follows the movie really well, so it stays in the package throughout unlike 'Holy Grail' which is just messing around with intelligent silliness and 'The Meaning of Life' which doesn't even have a real plot. So, story-wise this movie is the best one of the three candidates, having a story which is also surprisingly entertaining and interesting. It isn't anything that serious though, as there still is that same Monty Python humour that no-one else than the Monty Python boys could come up with, and it is indeed hysterical. The movie is non-stop joking throughout and it doesn't really get boring in any part, which is especially good when it comes to comedies like these. The jokes are funny, some of them being not that funny and some of them being absolutely hilarious. I still didn't laugh as much as in 'Holy Grail' though, so you shouldn't be expecting a comedy in the same level.Again, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin play various characters, which all of them have their different personalities; Hilarious, yet sometimes being familiarly sickening - The kind of personalities we know the Monty Python boys of. Once again, my personal favourites are John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin, who have always been the best actors Monty Python has offered, or at least for me. The other three, Graham Chapman who is pure excellence as the main character Brian Cohen, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones also perform their roles flawlessly and of course with guaranteed Python style, which really can not be compared to any other comedy styles.What I like about 'Life of Brian' is the whole set-up of it; The milieu is Judea, but the Judean people themselves are all actually English, which is merely hilarious as its own - The whole story and the jokes are just a plus to that. As a fan of British humour, especially the accent, I find some of the jokes hysterical just because of the accent of the language; The use of words, different emphasis's and the whole body language which is also so significant for the entire purposes of the jokes. It's just so brilliant and the humour this movie has to offer has also surprisingly much intelligence inside it, though it is silly and it swings on the edges of stupidity.I found 'Life of Brian' entertaining throughout and I'm glad to say I have finally seen it. It's a must-see for every Python -fan there is and it's a must-see for every comedy-fan there is. Monty Python's humour is not for everyone and as far as I know it that specific humour has divided people to two different groups; Those who like it and those who don't, it just depends on the person you are. If you haven't liked the series I would still recommend seeing this film, as it's actually a bit different than the series, naturally, as it still is a full length motion picture after all. As I watched 'The Meaning of Life' in slight disappointment before I saw 'Life of Brian' I found this surprisingly refreshing - One thing I can also be glad of is that this isn't a disappointment. It's a sure recommendation for all those who want to have a laugh and a great time when watching a movie. No matter how much you'd hate it, you can Always Look on the Bright Side of Life - Even perhaps the Life of Brian.",8,1,5,21 August 2007
Se7en," Brilliant screenplay, amazing role performances, all in all a definite thriller masterpiece
","I wasn't so sure what to expect, either a very brutal and a disturbing movie or an intelligent and an exciting thriller. Well, it was brutal at parts, disturbing at times, but it still managed to be an intelligent and an exciting thriller all the way through, a true diamond for the thriller -genre. The movie tells about two homicide detectives, an experienced veteran detective Somerset who's about to retire from his job and another detective Mills, a rookie who's supposed replace Somerset after he's retired. They soon team up together when they find out that there's a serial killer who commits his murders by choosing victims who each represent one of the Seven Deadly Sins. A perfect plot for a thriller indeed.I just mentioned about the plot being perfect for a thriller, but does the screenplay manage that perfection? Oh yes, it does. The screenplay (written by Andrew Kevin Walker) is absolutely amazing, along with the whole storytelling. The whole movie is exciting and thrilling throughout all the way from the beginning till the end by not making one single stop or telling any irrelevant subplots. It focuses on the main theme, the whole progress of solving a crime in a very detailed way, making it undeniably one of the best thrillers ever made. Another thing mentioned above is that it was brutal and disturbing at times, but it still doesn't take it over the top. I could describe those parts as being important for the film itself. By showing these brutal things it makes you alert and sort of scared, and really makes you despise the unnatural murderer who's behind the horrible crimes. You really start to live the movie itself, you want to catch the criminal and make him pay what he has done. That is because the absolutely brilliant storytelling the movie has, also giving it a very good flow which causes the 2 hours go in a blink of an eye. That is what a real flow should all be about, making a 3 hour long massive epic movie seem like only a 30 minute short film. That is what 'Se7en' manages, a flow that's just so good it's a real pleasure for eyes to see.The directing is close to excellence and it is lead by David Fincher whose work I will most certainly be observing in the future, as I was so pleased on the result he managed with 'Se7en'. Fincher sort of follows the whole story as it should, translating the screenplay on the screen in a very successful and an entertaining way. The movie also got nominated for an Academy Award back in 1996 in the category of Best Film Editing. To be honest, I immediately noticed how detailed it actually was, how it made that flow even better scene after a scene. It makes the whole movie more immense and stirring, backed up by the great cinematography which gives the movie that dark edge it needs. The music's just gorgeous, building up the tension and making your heart beat very fast when there's these highly intensive scenes, giving the whole movie that final touch. It is composed by one of my favourite composers Howard Shore and to be honest the music is very much like Shore. I can't describe it more precisely, but if you're familiar with his work you know what I'm talking about.Starring Morgan Freeman as detective William Somerset and Brad Pitt as detective David Mills a thriller couldn't ask more from the lead actors. Both role performances are outstanding and both actors are very convenient in their roles. Morgan Freeman happens to be one of my favourite actors of all time and he's indeed one of those actors you just have to admire because to me the man hasn't done one single bad role performance in his career. Freeman is very convincing as detective Somerset, giving the character that Freeman -edge it needs, being wise and witty, a perfect mentor. I must admit that Brad Pitt also happens to be one of my favourite actors and as detective Mills he does a superb job, making the character what it's all about, the one with the looks, being fierce and serious. Both of the characters have this very realistic depth in them. To me Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were one of the best pair teams I've ever seen on the screen, they just compliment each other's performances so well it just almost makes me shed a tear.'Se7en' is all in all an amazing movie. Surely one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. It's intensive, immense, exciting, detailed and thrilling, just what all thrillers should be like. Everything seems to click in this film; Brilliant screenplay, directing close to excellence, great characters and even better role performances, intensive cinematography and music that just captures the whole essence of the thriller -genre. Despite the fact of it being somewhat brutal at parts it really doesn't matter in the end, it still isn't that tasteless over the top violence the horror -genre seems to have, so you shouldn't even worry about what I said about it. I'm not saying it's a movie suitable for children, I'm saying it's a movie where even the brutal and disturbing scenes are made with a good taste and a classy style. I'd give it a 9.5/10, but as that is impossible it has to satisfy with the more than deserved 9. All this gives you an absolutely guaranteed motion picture experience, it does it smoothly and it does it with style. A thriller among the best.",9,1,2,22 May 2007
The Big Lebowski," A fine piece of quality comedy entertainment
","'The Big Lebowski' is a hilarious movie. It makes you laugh scene after a scene and that makes it a fine piece of quality comedy. It has a rather bizarre story which sometimes gets a bit silly, but it's still enjoyable all the way through. The story tells about a man named Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski. He is accidentally mistaken for a millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski and this leads him to things he wouldn't want to have experienced. With his bowling buddy Walter's help he tries to get things right but is constantly failed in his tasks, mainly because of Walter's strange personality and anger issues.The best thing about this film is the characters and the role performances done by the actors. The characters are just great, they're vivid and they all have odd personalities and different ways of interacting. Jeff Bridges plays the character of 'The Dude', a total looser who would have preferred bowling instead the things he accidentally mixes up with. Bridges is so real in the role, though the character itself is so surreal, sort of an ignoring person who pretty much defines stupidity. Although Bridges is superb in the role I thought John Goodman was more entertaining in the role of Walter Sobchak. The character of Walter is just so bizarre. He is a Vietnam veteran who constantly deals with his anger issues and thinks he's right when it comes to solving things, yet being pretty much wrong in every case. Trying to help 'The Dude' he just makes things worse and doesn't even admit that he's been wrong. I've never really found John Goodman as entertaining as in this movie, so thumbs up for that. There are also other characters worth mentioning; The always enjoyable Steve Buscemi as Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos who never seems to be able to speak up his mind as he is always bothered by Walter. Being a bowling buddy of 'The Dude' and Walter he still remains as one member of the group and there is some sympathy showed towards him in the end. Julianna Moore is also in a so surreal role, the role of Maude Lebowski who is obsessed with sex, the British daughter of the real millionaire Lebowski. We also see for example Philip Seymor Hoffman and Peter Stormare in one of the roles.The screenplay's very well written, written by Ethan and Joel Cohen it definitely mixes up everything from the beginning till the end. This what also makes the plot a bit confusing at parts. You really need concentration, as there is constantly this fast dialog between the characters and it's just impossible to know what is important for the plot and what is not. There is just so much fillings in the dialogs that it gets a bit messy. The directing pretty much does the same, directed by Joel Cohen. It can be described from what I described the plot and the dialogs. Being precise, entertaining and swift it also blends up with the story so well, making the whole movie this one big entity where the main theme is never lost. Although it does get a bit confusing it's still that definite quality and you just can't go wrong with that.'The Big Lebowski' is a good movie, it's nothing phenomenal but it's definitely something worth watching if you don't want to watch something that serious, as it just does include these irrelevant and silly, yet hilarious parts which in their way are simply one crucial part of the movie. You will laugh, if not because of the great jokes or the dialog, then the odd silliness it has inside it. Great characters, superb role performances, a plot that evolves to something you couldn't have imagined and a guaranteed laugh-packed ride. 'The Big Lebowski' does what it needs to, it doesn't have to exceed that.",9,2,4,15 July 2007
12 Monkeys," Intelligence in its purest form
","'Twelve Monkeys' is odd and disturbing, yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. It cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films.The story is just fantastic. It's so original and so entertaining. The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named 'La Jetée' (1962) which I haven't seen, but I must thank the director and writer of the movie, Chris Marker, for giving such an inspiration for the writers of 'Twelve Monkeys'. I read a little about 'La Jetée', it's not the same story but it has the same idea, so this is not just a copy of it. David and Janet Peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story, which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. The music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling, composed by Paul Buckmaster.Terry Gilliam, who we remember from Monty Python, as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me, as I really never thought him as a director type of a person. I know he has directed movies before, but I really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. It shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job. You can still sense that same weirdness as in the Python's, but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. Yes, it is indeed odd, weird, bizarre and disturbing, so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too, so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. It's not as heavy as you could imagine, but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. Despite that, the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks, dreams, jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part, though it does need concentration from the viewer after all.What comes to acting, well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. The role of James Cole is played by the mighty Bruce Willis, who probably does his best role performance yet to date. Now people may disagree with me, as he did some fine job in for example 'The Sixth Sense' as well, but for me the role of James Cole was so ideal for Willis and he performs it incredibly well. The character is very well written too, yet performed even better. Cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself, starting to question his actual time of living, trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. By hardship he starts to loose his faith, questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. Other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of Madeleine Stow and Brad Pitt. Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist of James Cole, who sees something strangely familiar in Cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. She somehow starts to believe Cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. Brad Pitt is so good in the role of Jeffrey Goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. The insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought Pitt even an Oscar nomination for it, so I guess I'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing.All in all, 'Twelve Monkeys' is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from Willis and Pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. It's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures I've ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really, but that's how it is, it's mind blowing.",9,0,0,26 June 2007
Shaun of the Dead," Absolutely hilarious
","I had never seen this movie until two days ago and if YOU haven't I suggest you do. 'Shaun of the Dead' tells about a man named Shaun who works in an electronic goods shop. He spends his days with his unemployed friend Ed either playing video games at home or drinking in a local pub 'Winchester'. Shaun is pretty much what you could describe as a 'loser'. He has a girlfriend, Liz, who suddenly after 3 years of being together has had enough of Shaun's attitude towards things, never having an adventure or basically anything different. This of course leads to a break-up. Suddenly almost the whole London catches sort of an epidemic and everyone starts to turn as the living dead, zombies. Shaun figures out that he has his life's biggest opportunity to prove his ex-girlfriend that he is not a loser. Things lead to another and well, it's done in a way that won't give you time to stop laughing.One thing that surprised me a lot is how well the whole movie was made. I mean, it's a comedy after all and it's not every day you see a comedy where they've really put some time and effort to make it. The whole world and the zombies are done like in any other serious movie, so believably and so realistically. This already gives the movie something that keeps you interested throughout besides the story, which in its parodied way is also surprisingly well written. Although the zombie -thing working as the main story in the movie, you could imagine the movie as a romantic comedy as well. The movie takes a while before the zombies even kick into the plot and the best thing is that the things before that moment is not even irrelevant in any kind of way. It kinda evolves the story, builds up the characters and the whole main theme, letting the viewer inside the actual story. Brilliant in a way I'd say.The one thing where the movie has its definite highlight is the humour, which is absolutely hilarious. To me as a fan of the British accent (although to be exact I especially love the cockney accent) the movie's jokes were top notch. You just can't say some things in another accent than the British one and to be honest when I had my Finnish subtitles on I really didn't even pay attention to them as some of the jokes are just so poorly translated they loose their purpose and meaning completely. Although the movie being a total laugh packed ride, the jokes sadly start to repeat themselves and it does get a bit repetitive. When you think about that it's a really hard thing to prevent really. When it comes to parodies they usually stumble in that way towards the end, so it's a very common problem. Despite it this movie doesn't do it so much you could imagine, so it's a real achievement. The film also includes so called 'long jokes' which aren't so funny at the first time but when repeated they eventually get funny and when they're done in places where you wouldn't expect them at all they have their moment and it's magnificent.Although the movie being a parody all the way through I was also surprised how good the acting was in it. It does have drama in it too, yet done in a satiric way. The brilliant Simon Pegg as Shaun, Nick Frost as Ed, the always hilarious Bill Nighy as Philip the stepfather, Kate Ashfield as Liz and Dylan Moran as David, the whole cast is carefully and very successfully chosen. When it comes to comedies like this one the acting is usually done over the top to make it funnier. Well, the acting in this movie also goes over the top, but it's done so unbelievably well by amazing actors/actresses and in a way I've never seen before. Usually when the acting is meant to be over the top, it's usually funny at the first time but you get bored of it very quickly and it gets so unfunny and (I can't believe I'm saying this) unrealistic. Though it is actually meant to be unrealistic, 'Shaun of the Dead' does the unrealistic so realistically and the unbelievable so believably. Now that's what I call a huge achievement, very nice indeed.'Shaun of the Dead' is all in all a great comedy. It has a surprisingly good storyline which keeps you interested throughout, including humour which just makes you laugh so hard, even giggle after the actual movie has ended. It's silly, but it's silly in a good way. They don't make comedies like this so much and when they do it's a great achievement. It's always a real gem for the comedy film industry and you just have to give your two thumbs up. The movie sadly suffers from already mentioned slight repetitiveness, but when it comes to the end it really doesn't matter so much, but that's what also lowers my final rating of the movie. If you want to laugh, seriously, 'Shaun of the Dead' is a movie for you. Great.",7,0,3,30 May 2007
Black Book," Visually stunning, hanging on Carice van Houten's beauty
","OK so I saw this film a while ago, but I never had the time to review it, but now I do. This was probably the first Dutch film I've ever seen and to be honest I was quite pleased with it as well. I also like the language a lot, it kind of fascinates me. To me it was sort of German and English blended together and I enjoyed hearing it. It's very easy for your ears. Anyway, the movie itself tells about a Jewish woman, Rachel Stein, who during the World War II hides from the Nazis in The Netherlands. By different circumstances and accidents she joins a dutch resistance group and under a false name Ellis de Vries she becomes a spy at a German headquarters.The story is all in all very interesting and the screenplay is very good. It includes so much plot twists that the movie is an exciting experience throughout. The story is very original too as it's not just another story about WW2. An interesting way of coming up with a plot based on WW2 and that is what also makes it so fascinating. Though there are some battle scenes the main focus isn't on them, it's totally on the story which also has enough depth in it to keep the viewer far away from bored. Directing is also very enjoyable, directed by Paul Verhoeven, it definitely compliments the story by being accurate and precise, having this good tempo and a great way of describing or showing things. There are probably a couple of unnecessary scenes included and although for example the nude scenes are supposed to be realistic the nudity is also pretty useless and it doesn't wake up any emotions in the viewer, being basically just unnecessary.The best thing this movie has to offer is undeniably the role performance of Carice van Houten who plays the role of Rachel Stein aka Ellis de Vries. The movie pretty much hangs in the hands of van Houten, the role performance is simply superb and she just shines with her beauty. She is just so beautiful in the film that it makes the viewer adore her, probably even worship her. Being so real and so true she keeps the movie on its feet, being simply the definite glaze of the movie. Another role performance worth mentioning is the role performance done by Sebastian Koch, who plays the role of Ludwig Müntze, an SS-officer who meets Rachel at a train smuggling weapons. The meeting comes more important than Rachel thought, as when she becomes the spy at the German headquarters the headquarters is actually lead by Müntze. Koch is just so brilliant in the role. I thought he was more enjoyable in 'Das Leben der Anderen' though, but there's nothing to complain about him in 'Zwartboek' either.What catches your eyes besides the beauty of Carice van Houten is how visually stunning the movie is. The use of colours is just magnificent and all the other visual sides are all in all an incredible achievement. I have to raise my hat for the whole art department and also the department responsible for the costume design, as that was also a pleasure for your eyes as well. The glaze of Carice van Houten actually makes me think of older movies and the first one coming up to my mind is 'Casablanca' where Ingrid Bergman did pretty much the same thing, although these two movies can not be compared together, even when it comes to the beauty of van Houten and Bergman. Bergman's beauty is just so classic, when van Houten's represents the world today, although it is probably also going to be a classic after 50 years. At the moment comparing is just out of question. The music used in the film is very old fashioned and it just fits with the them so well, well it's based on WW2 after all. Composed by Anne Dudley it gives more of that realistic edge for the movie and by beautiful and gloomy compositions it's more than important, it's necessary. And it's brilliant.'Zwartboek' is all in all a good movie. It had the chance of being much more than that, but it somehow goes wrong in some part. Not actually wrong, but it kind of looses it's flow, although it somehow is interesting throughout. Hard to explain really, but that's how it is. The movie is definitely worth watching though it isn't phenomenal. It doesn't have to be, as when being good a movie is always worth watching. If you want to recall the old times when movies were made with style and with a lead female actor who melted the hearts of men then this movie is definitely for you, though I could describe it as a modernized version. A good movie, a good achievement from Verhoeven.",8,8,11,9 July 2007
L.A. Confidential," How detective movies should be made
","First of all, I wasn't expecting so much about this movie. It had a pretty high rating at IMDb and it's praised all over the place, but I just wasn't so interested of it. Well, it turned out to be an excellent movie. The movie tells a story happening in Los Angeles in the 1950's and it tells about a corruption occurring all over the police force and a committed murder, which three different polices start to investigate in their own unique ways. Ed Exley, the golden boy of the police force, smart and the one obeying the law. Bud White, a rough man ready to break the law to seek justice. Then there's Jack Vincennes, a celebrity detective being the one who does the job for publicity and press photos, but still managing something with his smart, yet somewhat crooked ways.There are two things about this movie which make it so magnificent; The storyline and the cast. The storyline is filled with excitement and it keeps on going all the way through. After the first hour the movie kind of stops a little bit and it seems like it starts to stumble, or that's at least what you think. There are these scenes which seem like irrelevant, but they eventually get important for the whole plot in a genius way. This movie is a perfect example of how to make a real crime/detective movie, there's the crime in the beginning and after that there's just this fantastic progression of the whole investigation from the very beginning till the very end, detectives finding interesting and also very surprising clues during the progress. Then there's the amazing cast; Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, David Strathairn, Danny DeVito.. Honestly, can you think of any better? Great indeed.This leads up myself to the acting the movie has to offer. The role performances are all in all fantastic. Ed Exley is played by Guy Pearce and I really haven't seen Pearce in a role like Exley before, but I am happy to say that he is great in it. Then there's the always superb Russell Crowe playing Bud White, the real bad ass cop. If someone can play a bad ass and look so furious it's Crowe without a doubt. He's just so frightening. Finally there is Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes and as I've watched more than a few Spacey movies recently I'm starting to like him more and more and he is starting to be one of my favourite actors. In this movie he still is as excellent as you can pretty much expect from him. Pearce, Crowe and Spacey shine with astonishing role performances and they are the best thing the cast has to offer. I'm not underestimating the rest of the cast at all though, as there is the fierce James Cromwell, the beautiful Kim Basinger, the somewhat charismatic and cool David Stathairn and then there's the tiny but incredible Danny DeVito, who I haven't really seen in a more fitting role and he does some damn fine job in it too. Cromwell is enjoyable as usual, Basinger does what she does best and Strathairn is the coolness itself, though in my opinion he was better in 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' Still a great achievement though.'L.A. Confidential' offers you a great movie experience. It sets mark on how detective movies should be made and how the whole crime investigation process should be progressing. It's exciting and it's interesting, doing that all the way through. It includes fantastic role performances and brilliant characters which all in their vivid personalities will most certainly not disappoint the viewer. It doesn't get messy in any part so the viewer won't be missing anything and won't get lost, so the film is also easy for your eyes. Directed by Curtis Hanson who captures the real essence of 1950's through images and music and based on the novel by James Ellroy which is translated to a magnificent screenplay in the hands of Brian Helgeland and the director Hanson himself, it just doesn't go wrong. I'm recommending this movie to everyone; The pleasure was all mine when watching it and I hope it will be yours as well.",9,1,2,12 June 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A visual spectacle
","The third and the final installment of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' -trilogy came out to the theaters not so long ago and as I liked both of the previous movies I decided to go and see the third one as well, obviously. I'm not a hardcore fan, but I think the movies are one of the most entertaining movies ever made. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' continues where the second part left us; Captain Barbossa, William Turner, Elizabeth Swann and the rest of the crew leave on a journey to get Jack Sparrow back from the land of the dead. Along the adventure they have to face villains like Davy Jones and Lord Cutler Becket. The story includes so much more, which really can't be explained shortly, as there is just so much twists and tweaks in the plot. I wouldn't even have to describe the plot more specifically as everyone has probably seen the movie already, so I just get the to review itself already..The final part of the trilogy is pretty satisfying. I just don't like the way they've overdone the humour; They did it with the second part and now they've done it with the third part. The first movie, to me at least, was more like a serious movie and it had its humour, not being overdone or not playing a major role in the movie itself. The character of Jack Sparrow was hilarious in the way it was and that was it, they didn't overdo it. When the second part came out, they had pretty much overdone it all, there were punchlines and other humour just trickling all over the place and the character of Jack Sparrow didn't have that depth like it used to. It's like they dragged the movie down one level and to children it was a pleasant surprise but for us more mature viewers it was a disappointment, although the humour was actually funny, but I was just hoping for a more serious movie. The third part of the trilogy continues the same joking as the second movie did, although being funny it also leaves the whole depth of the story in a minor role, which is pretty disappointing after all. It sadly turns the movie to a hollywoodised sequel.Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is great, but it's pretty much on the same level as the second part was, so I still think the first one is the best one of the trilogy. The things which make these movies so magnificent is the original characters and the story, not forgetting the spectacular visual effects. The character of Jack Sparrow, played superbly by Johnny Depp, is without a doubt one of the best characters ever written on paper and ever seen on screen. He is amiable, so sympathetic in a way and the audience favourite, the definite crowd pleaser. He is so original, being a hilarious swashbuckler who definitely knows his things, though being somewhat mentally unstable. To me the character is just so ideal and in all of these three movies Johnny Depp does his best role performance yet to date. Then there's William Turner, the golden boy played by Orlando Bloom. Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful girlfriend of Turner, played by Keira Knightley. Geoffrey Rush as the fierce Captain Barbossa, you can't really choose a better actor for the role, as he is just so perfect in it. The always enjoyable Bill Nighy as the evil Davy Jones is just top notch in the role. The whole cast is simply amazing and in the third movie we see such actors as Chow Yun-Fat, Stellan Skarsgård and also Keith Richards in supporting roles. The character of Keith Richards was hilarious, though he only had a few lines and didn't play any major role in the movie. What made it hilarious was that it actually was Keith Richards and when both me and my brother saw him the first time on the screen we both laughed, just because it was Keith Richards.'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' is, like already mentioned, visually spectacular. There were running all kinds of visual effects on the screen throughout the movie which made the movie a masterpiece in entertainment. Explosions, sword fights, rain and tornadoes, all this junk just flying all over the place, quality stuff indeed. The third movie is all in all what I expected, though some of the things being silly it's still that quality entertainment you want and it won't be a disappointment in the department to anyone. The story does get a bit messy, everyone is cheating everyone and there are so many twists that it's sometimes really hard to keep up with the plot. The movie is also a little bit too long, or at least for me it was. Especially when there wasn't any breaks in the theatre, you just had to sit there nearly 3 hours. Anyway, if you want to see entertainment then this is what you want to see, as you just won't be disappointed like mentioned earlier. This is a trilogy which is a must-have for every action fan there is, I'm probably going to buy the trilogy-DVD-box when it comes out. Who wouldn't like pirates, eh? Arrrrr matey!",7,2,4,16 June 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Beautiful, magical, fantastic. A fantasy movie for the more mature audience
","To be honest, I wasn't very interested in seeing this movie. The trailer was OK, but it still didn't wake up my interest. But, as so many people had praised this film more then enough and it had a rating of 8.5 at IMDb putting it at the 45th place at the Top 250 Movies of all time -list I just knew I had to see it to know what it's really like. It couldn't be that bad, now could it? Well, all the people buzzing about this film were pretty much right. It is indeed an amazing film. I just don't know where to start. The movie is mixed with history, drama and fantasy, and that pretty much makes it so unique in its own genre, as there aren't really movies like this one. When I first heard about the movie I thought it was a happy family movie for children, but then I heard it's really a film for the more mature audience. I was very surprised how violent the movie actually was and how dramatic a fantasy movie can really be. It can also be compared to thriller -movies as there really is some very exciting parts in it too. It's just really hard to describe it more specifically as I don't want to give away any spoilers.The story's just brilliant. My interest surely kept on throughout the whole movie, as it just is so exciting. There are actually two plots in this movie, one based on the historical events and the another one based on the fantasy world, and though it may seem that they don't connect together at first, they really do and the way they connect together is just intelligent. Screenplay's also fantastic in its wholeness and it is written by the same man who has directed the movie, Guillermo del Toro. I've seen a couple of his movies before and I must admit that all of them have been very disappointing, but this time the man just totally goes over himself. The movie progresses forward in a very flowing way without any pointless scenes or useless parts. Just fantastic. What comes to role performances this movie doesn't include any phenomenal ones, but everyone does their job flawlessly. There are actually two actors above everyone else which I want to mention. The young actress who plays Ofelia, named Ivana Baquero, who is pretty perfect for the role and a man named Sergi López, who does an excellent job in playing a villain. A perfect villain indeed.The fantasy world and all things connected to it are very well made and the movie just looks so good. It's no wonder the movie won the Oscars from the categories of Art Direction and Make-Up, the whole art department deserves a huge plus for making something look so good. The world is magical, dark and scary, and also surprising. You simply can not know what's coming around the next corner, you just sit there staring at the screen and wondering how everything just simply look so beautiful. There's not enough compliments to make when it comes to the art. A job amazingly done indeed.One thing that is also so great in this movie is the cinematography. The whole movie is shot in a beautiful way, both in the real world and the fantasy world. Again, the movie did get its third Oscar from the cinematography and it is no wonder. All the angles, how the camera moves showing you the world and squeezing a little bit more of that excitement for you is just brilliant. A well deserved Academy Award. The music is also a spot on; Though it's not meant to be a beautiful composition or to make you cry, it really does its job. It gives the movie more of that dark edge it needs, making it slightly more magical and giving the movie that extra something. It's used in the right places and it has enough variations, so it's not repetitive or it isn't used in a corny way to dramatize any situations. It just fits like a key to a treasure chest.Even if you're not a fan of the fantasy, just turn off your 'surreal-alert' and enjoy a damn good movie. It will amaze you a scene after a scene. Enjoy a beautiful story, a perfect villain, amazing cinematography, fantastic art direction and a great movie. Just watch it and you will see yourself that the people praising this film were actually right. Great.",9,2,5,4 May 2007
Taxi Driver," One of the best character progressions ever written on screen, though the movie itself being slightly disappointing
","'Taxi Driver' is a good movie, it's nothing phenomenal, but it's good. Like Martin Scorsese's movies usually it is also over-hyped, or at least that's what I think. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but the rating of 8.5 at IMDb is probably a bit too much, it is not that great. The movie tells a story about Travis Bickle, a Vietnam veteran who works as a taxi driver at nights. He is constantly disturbed by the life around him and that gets him mentally unstable. He thinks the streets of New York City are full of trash and by that he is referring to people, and all the injustice and corruption the world around him has. Bickle doesn't have any real friends and he starts to question his own existence, he is lonely and a complete outsider to everyone, failing to make any emotional contact with anyone. The film follows Travis's story's progress from attempts to desperation and it deals with mental issues along with the search of love and happiness.The best thing this movie has to offer is Robert De Niro, who does an amazing role performance in the role of Travis Bickle. The character itself is very well written as well, so De Niro only had to translate the character on to the screen and he managed that pretty flawlessly. The whole progress of the character is just brilliantly acted out, all the facial expressions and the whole body language changes along the progress in a fantastic way and De Niro makes one of the best role performances he has done this far. It was also pretty interesting to see De Niro in such a 'young' age, as he was magnificent back then as well, even he actually was 33 years old when the movie was made. The story focuses completely on Travis and there aren't much scenes where he wouldn't be, although there are supporting actors/actresses along the way. The one in the most supporting role is Jodie Foster, who in the age of 14 plays a child prostitute. I was very surprised how good actress she was even back then, in the age of 14! She is so real and performs the role of Iris superbly, I just can't believe she was only 14. Two small parts are played by the legends Peter Boyle (god bless the man) and Harvey Keitel, Boyle in the role 'Wizard', another taxi driver in New York City who gives advice to Travis and Keitel in the role of 'Sport', a pimp in New York City who for example sells Iris for money and who Travis just can't stand.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is definitely recognizable as his, as it certainly has that Scorsese touch in it, though I think it is darker than Martin's movies usually. Scorsese always seems to describe violence in a very violent way and he doesn't hide the truth, though sometimes a fictional truth, behind the true violence and other disturbing images. This movie is all in all very disturbing and like Scorsese's movies usually it's also pretty heavy, so the weak minded viewers won't be enjoying it and watching it all the way through. The heaviness is also caused by that slight dullness the movie starts to have after the first hour and it seems like stretched, you keep on watching these irrelevant scenes which don't even matter so much in the end and the movie sadly loses its flow. It does get better towards the end, but there's just this one part of the movie where it seems to stumble a little bit. Maybe I'm being too harsh, so don't slay me because of that, but after all that is just my opinion. The screenplay is pretty much only the building of the main character, the movie is after all a story about Travis Bickle and no-one else. Despite the fact of the screenplay being almost nothing else than the story about the character it still manages to have surprisingly much depth in the plot, which is a very nice thing, as it also drops the heaviness level a little bit.'Taxi Driver' offers you a disturbing, yet psychologically clever experience, not forgetting the intelligence it has inside it. Robert De Niro is undeniably the best thing the movie has to offer, so I'm recommending the movie for everyone who is seeking a movie with an astonishing role performance. Like mentioned before this movie isn't for the weak minded, but if you still want to see it then it's your decision and you have been warned. 'Taxi Driver' is partly all in all interesting, above decent without a doubt and it could be described as an artistic rather than an ordinary movie. So for those who are in search of a light and an easy movie for the Friday evening to watch with a girlfriend, then this isn't for you. It requires concentration and nerves, thinking and collecting pieces of the puzzle afterwards. It's not a phenomenal one, but it's definitely a good one. If all this still doesn't satisfy you, then for god sakes please watch it just because of the experience of seeing the hilarious long dark curly hair Harvey Keitel has in it. Marvellous.",7,1,4,13 June 2007
Fargo," Filled with excitement, more than just a true story
","'Fargo' is a true story. Quoting the first writing that comes up on the screen when the movie starts, the events depicted in the film took place in Minnesota 1987, although at the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred. 'Fargo' tells about a man named Jerry Lundegaard who's in a desperate need of money. So he comes up with an idea to kidnap his own wife, hiring two thugs for the job. Jerry's wife Jean has a father who's rich so the plan is that the father, Wade Gustafson, has to pay the ransom for his daughter, which Jerry will make profit from. Jerry makes a deal with the thugs and carefully plans the whole thing, but things don't go quite as he thought they would.The amazing thing about this film is that it's really a true story, so what you see from the screen is pretty much what has really happened. It's tragic and it's sad. The screenplay's written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen and the movie's directed by the other of the two brothers, Joel Coen. What comes to the screenplay, it's very well written, but in my opinion some things could have been left out. I won't go to the details, as I don't want to give away any spoilers. Although there are those unnecessary things in the screenplay, the movie's still very interesting and detailed throughout. Directing has this nice flow, capturing images of cold landscapes, a coldness, giving the movie this darker edge, which is really like this sort of a background essence of the movie. It's pretty hard to explain, but it's important and necessary for the film itself.William H. Macy plays the role of Jerry Lundegaard and I must say I'm pretty damn impressed of his role performance, one of his best performances yet to date for sure. Macy's one of those actors who can really look believably nervous, which again gives the whole character this huge credibility. His just perfect for the role. Frances McDormand plays the role of a pregnant local police Marge Gunderson, which granted her an Academy Award for the Best Actress in a Leading Role. I agree on the fact that she's amazing in the film, but I really liked Macy's performance much more. There's still one role performance to mention and that is the role of Carl Showalter, other one of the two thugs, which is performed superbly by Steve Buscemi. That is by far Buscemi's best role performance yet to date and I've always honestly thought that Steve's more of a comedian sort of type, but the role of Showalter is a perfect example that he can do drama as well, though the character's is actually hilarious in certain parts of the movie, cooperated nicely by Peter Stormare in the role of the other thug Gaear Grimsrud. Stormare's performance compliments the whole performance of Buscemi, and to me Stormare is always enjoyable, no matter what the role was.'Fargo' is, all in all, a great movie. It's thrilling, very well progressing and it's filled with great characters performed by fantastic actors. It is definitely a thriller/drama to watch if you're looking for something consisting of those genres. It's exciting, it's serious and it's a fine example how true stories should be translated on the big screen. Very nice indeed.",8,0,0,7 May 2007
Léon: The Professional," Simply an amazing movie
","I had never seen this film before two days ago when I got my hands on it. I was very interested of it, so I was pretty much expecting a great movie experience. The movie tells about an Italian professional hit-man Léon who lives in peace and quiet with his plant. He doesn't have any friends besides Tony who hires him for hit-man jobs and that's pretty much what his life is; Nothing special, boring to be exact, besides the jobs he does. His neighbour is a drug dealer who's working with crooked DEA officers. This neighbour has a wife and three kids, and one of those kids is a 12 year old girl named Mathilda who Léon occasionally speaks to in the hall way. Mathilda's life is pretty much miserable, his father being a drug dealer who sometimes hits her and the rest of his family being just mean and ignorant besides his four year old little brother who is the only friend of her's. One day Mathilda leaves to the grocery store and in the meantime her whole family is killed by the DEA officers. When she comes back and walks along the hall way she sees her family's dead bodies and keeps on walking towards Léon's door. Léon lets her into his apartment and at the same time into his life as well.There's honestly so much more in the story, but I just don't want to give away any spoilers, as the movie's whole storyline is so brilliant. The story is very well written by Luc Besson who has also directed the movie. It's really more than just an action movie, there's so much drama in it as well. An odd relationship forms between Léon and Mathilda in a way that's just so beautiful. The whole build up of it, the progression and forming of this odd friendship is so compelling with its mixtures of great humour and beautiful drama. The movie reminds a lot of 'The Fifth Element', which is also a great film but still nothing near this movie. Both movies are from the same director and writer after all, and the music is also almost identical in both of the movies as well. Composed by Eric Serra it gives more of that Luc Besson -edge for the movies he does. It's dark and it's there for building up the tension. The cinematography is also almost identical in both of the movies, quick and swift camera movements and humorous close-ups of characters on the screen. I guess that is Luc Besson's vision and it also works really well, especially when it comes to movies like these. All in all, 'Léon' and 'The Fifth Element' could be described as brothers, only that the stories are completely different. 'Léon' just tends to go a bit deeper, having so much more depth in the story.To me the cast was brilliant and the acting was superb. Léon is played by the always enjoyable Jean Reno, who I've never really seen in a better role than in the role Léon and to be honest it's his best role performance yet to date as well. Although really being french, playing an Italian hit-man really suits him and he really is the whole character with his essence. Mathilda is played by the brilliant Natalie Portman and I was so surprised and amazed of the fact that she was a superb actress even back when she was only 12 years old! The acting she does is once again so pure and the work between her and Reno is really admirable, they really have this connection together and the dialogue between the characters just shines with its wit and the even better acting. Gary Oldman as the head DEA officer Stansfield is one of the most perfect villains I've ever seen on screen, giving that mad look and having a madness inside him. He just can look so intimidating that it almost scares me. And then there's last but not the least Danny Aiello as Tony, who's performance isn't particularly phenomenal, but he sure is perfect for the role.All in all 'Léon' offers you a fantastic movie experience. It has action, it has drama and it also has a bit romance in it too, in an odd but a beautiful way. Even when Léon is a hit-man, the viewer does feel sympathy for him, which is caused by the genius character writing. This is an excellent movie and it is not praised for nothing. When the magnificent action scenes take part you realize saying two words to yourself; 'Yeah..' continued by '.. Awesome' I guess the movie is aimed more for the male audience, but I think the female ones will be satisfied as well. The movie has that famous man power at its best and despite the fact that Jean Reno's character is a bit stereotypical as a hit-man, the character itself has more than that in it, it has depth and it has originality, a simple man who's just really seeking for approval and a true friend. 'Léon' is a movie to watch without a doubt, a definite recommendation for everyone, especially for the male audience who are looking for action and thrill in a very successful package.",9,1,4,31 May 2007
American Beauty," Kevin Spacey - Need I say more?
","I remember seeing this film back in the year 2000 or so and as I didn't remember so much about it, I decided to have another go and I watched it again two days ago, after 7 years. I actually remembered a lot more than I thought, which was a shame really as I seemed to remember all the crucial parts which were significant for the whole plot. Anyway, it is still a great movie and I can imagine it is one of those movies you can watch all over again, as it's just so easy to watch. The movie itself tells a stereotypical story of a middle aged man named Lester Burnham and how his life is pretty much as boring as it gets. His daughter and wife thinks he's a loser and he also pretty much agrees with that. He's depressed, but suddenly one day he feels this desire of love and another life when he sees his daughter Jane's friend Angela for the first time. He decides to turn his life around and finally start living it.To be honest, the beginning arrangements of the plot aren't so original. There has been so much movies with a middle aged man who's in a life crisis and decides to take over his life and so on and so on. Despite that, this movie actually does it in a pretty good way and the whole storyline is so brilliant when it builds up. It's hilarious and it's dramatic, both well done and in the same package. It's not just the story which makes it so good, it's the characters who are pretty much stereotypical yet performed by an amazing cast. I've been watching a lot of Kevin Spacey -movies recently and I must say that the role of Lester Burnham is one of the best fitting roles I've seen him doing. He's just so excellent in the role and he even got a well deserved Academy Award of it. There's just something about Kevin Spacey I like, I don't know if it's the whole personality and substance or is it that perfect, I wouldn't say monotonic, but a flat voice which just has this certain charisma and credibility. Spacey also narrates the movie as Lester and the voice and the way he speaks is just so superb when you're looking at the whole main theme of the movie. Kevin Spacey is without a doubt the best thing the movie has to offer.The man responsible for the music is Thomas Newman, who I haven't heard composing even anything near average, his music is always top notch no matter what the movie was. I'd say there are two different music themes in 'American Beauty', one taking place when the funny comedic scenes take part and the other one being beautiful and slow when the dramatic scenes take part. The music sort of transports the whole movie forward, being so necessary for the plot as well. I shouldn't just praise Spacey's performance yet he surely takes the cake by far. Like I mentioned before, the whole cast is amazing. Lester's wife Carolyn played by Annette Bening, who I really haven't enjoyed as much as in 'American Beauty'. Being a total hypocrite dreaming of a better luxurious life it makes the role of Carolyn a spot on for Bening. Then there's Thora Birch as Lester's daughter Jane, who's an insecure teenager, Wes Bentley as Ricky Fits the real estate king and Mena Suvari as the school's dream girl and Jane's friend Angela who Lester fixes his eyes on. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Scott Bakula in a so surreal role as one of the gay neighbours after seeing him constantly on the cult classic 'Quantum Leap'.Although the movie being very good I think it still is pretty overrated. There's actually nothing particularly unique in the movie, expect those amazing role performances. It really doesn't offer anything mind blowing as even when it has originality it still is more like a stereotypical image of life seen many times on the screen. I wouldn't say I'm bored of it, but more like just wanting someone to invent something really new and unique even when having stereotypical beginning arrangements on the plot. This movie is a pretty good achievement in that category but like said it still isn't as unique as you could imagine. This might be just because I had seen the movie before and I remembered all the twists of the plot unconsciously. It's a real pity as this might have been a total different review if I'd seen it for the first time. Somehow it still manages to be a great movie and despite me jumping all over the negative and positive sides of the movie it still is a definite recommendation and because of the flow it is really easy to watch. Kevin Spacey is starting to be one of my all time favourite actors and not just because of this movie, but the amazing work he always does.",8,1,2,1 June 2007
The Usual Suspects," One of the best thrillers I've ever seen, including a story which consists of twists that will amaze you
","'The Usual Suspects' is by far one of the best thrillers I've ever seen. The movie tells about 5 crooks, who are brought together for questioning because of a truck hijack in New York. This is followed by a period of events and eventually they all are left with a mission, which a criminal mastermind named Keyser Soze has arranged for them because they all have wronged Soze in certain points of their criminal careers. They have no other choice than do the mission, because they're obviously being blackmailed and also because they just simply have to pay back what they've done in the past. It doesn't go as planned and the whole story is told by one of the crooks, Roger 'Verbal' Kint. What really happened on the job and is there even a man named Keyser Soze?The screenplay's just amazing, the whole plot consists of twists that are just so surprising that it makes you stare at the emptiness leaving you dribbling all over the place like you were being in a some kind of a mental institution. It progresses in a definite flow, leaving you concentrating so much that you don't want to miss one second of the movie itself. It's interesting, it's exciting, it's thrilling and it's just brilliant. The directing compliments the whole screenplay, by being so witty that it feels like you were watching a real live action crime happening, having a very nice cinematography as a backup. Some of the angles and the ways how some things are shot is just so significant for the movie that it's just, like mentioned above, so brilliant.The music isn't beautiful and phenomenal in purpose to make you cry, it's in purpose of giving you a guaranteed entertainment and a thrilling motion picture experience, composed by John Ottman. I mean, the music's just so fitting that it gives you this specific familiar smile on your face which says 'Yeah, awesome, that's how you do it.' Well, you get the point, it's the kind of music you want for a thriller, giving the movie that required thriller edge to it.Despite the amazing screenplay, the things that make this movie so fantastic are the characters and the role performances done by the actors. Taking for example the five crooks, there's the bad ass Michael McManus, played by Stephen Baldwin, who I haven't actually seen doing a better role performance than as McManus. Then there's the cold and intelligent Dean Keaton, played by Gabriel Byrne, who really fits for the role like a strawberry for a pancake. Then there's Fred Fenster, the associate of McManus and the one 'with the looks', played by Benicio Del Toro, who's always enjoyable, yet usually in a weird role. Then there's Todd Hockney, the explosions expert and the one who just doesn't give a damn about anyone, played by Kevin Pollack, doing one of his best role performances yet to date. And finally, there is Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a cripple man who is in no use for anyone, being irrelevant, wanting to be a better crook, played by Kevin Spacey, who also does one of his best (if not The Best) role performances yet to date. Spacey's just so good that he's the movie's essence. Those are a few characters to name, but there are a whole bunch of others, played by actors who are at their best, making the movie so fantastic in every aspect.All in all 'The Usual Suspects' is a fantastic film everyone should see. It has some of the best story twists ever written to a motion picture, making you that mental institution patient right till the end titles, where you keep on being that patient until you wake up in the real world realising that the movie's a celebration of fantastic characters and actors, an amazing screenplay and superb directing. Great.",9,2,5,8 May 2007
Before Sunset," Excellent screenplay, fantastic role performances, sweet and original. Great.
","This movie is just genius in its own genre. It's a romantic drama not like any other I've seen. I have to admit that I've never seen the first one (Before Sunrise), but I know things about it and pretty much the whole plot to be honest. This movie got me interested on the first one, so I'm probably going to watch it when I get my hands on it.The acting is just excellent in this film. The whole movie focuses on these two characters Jesse and Celine, played superbly by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. The chemistry between is just so close to excellence. What makes this movie interesting is that these two characters just simply discuss about everything, something which is just normal for people to talk about and they don't hold onto one subject, as the subject of their conversations changes all the time. It just makes the movie so real and you forget about all the acting, it's like that those two characters would in fact be real persons and not made up ones. This brings me to the dialog, which is by far one of the best ones I've seen on screen, it just feels so real. The flow between the conversations, the whole dialog, is just fantastic.The movie lasts for 1 hour and 20 minutes, which feels like the whole plot is based on that lenght, it's just so flowing. I mean it's like the two characters would actually hang around for just one hour and those 20 minutes. They just move from one place to another and there is no other characters interrupting their conversations or anything, the whole movie just focuses on the two characters which have this certain tension between them. There is no other essential characters, which is kinda intelligent, or at least for me. I like to think that Jesse is more of an aggressive type between the conversations of the characters, though they're both are feeling a bit ashamed in a certain level, because of what happened 9 years before. Jesse's making these references to for example sex and the night which they spent together 9 years ago and so is Celine, but not as much as Jesse, who quickly changes the references to fooling around and joking, using it as a certain self-defense. Or at least that is what I think of it.There isn't one single unnecessary scene in this movie, every scene is there for a reason, which brings me to the conclusion that the screenplay's just excellent. Though the movie is a romantic drama, it isn't cliché at all, so I can recommend this movie to everyone. It's original, interesting and entertaining in its own way and it is a surprisingly pleasant movie to watch although there isn't actually anything mind breaking happening, just a movie about normal people in normal circumstances and it just does it so realistically. Just great.",8,0,0,26 April 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A timeless tale about love and honour, an unmistakable masterpiece
","'Wo hu cang long' aka 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a timeless adventure tale, which takes place in ancient China, the eternal empire of heroes, gods and miracles. Li Mu Bai is a great warrior whose good deeds are known all around East. He decides to give his magical jade sword to an old friend of his, but a mysterious martial arts expert manages to steal the ancient weapon. Li must find out the identity of the thief and find his precious sword. But, the way of a warrior isn't as straightforward - love and honour have their own demands.I'm a big fan of Asian film making and to really watch Asian films you need this certain perspective, especially when it comes to these zen-films. Nevertheless this movie isn't a typical Asian film, as I'd more describe it as a film where Asian film making and Hollywood collide. You could think that it all goes wrong in the Hollywood -part, but for your surprise it doesn't. Ang Lee has created a fine piece of quality style, where you can sense both Asian and Hollywood which blend together like butter for a bread. The story, originally written by Du Lu Wang and turned into a screenplay by three writers, is absolutely beautiful, it includes twists and turns, it's dramatic and romantic, it's even thrilling and it has spectacular fighting sequences. To me the reason why this stands out from an usual eastern movie and where you can really know it's also Hollywood is the somehow different, even better, flow in the story and the amount of fighting sequences. Despite that I think this movie is suitable for both Asian and American audience, not forgetting the rest of the world. Each one gets satisfaction and you don't have to be a fan of Asian films or know anything about the history behind zen-movies, although you really need to be open minded.This leads me to, once again, the one thing I think Asian directors are better than any other directors of different nationalities; The cinematography. If you'd think there isn't anything Asian in this film, you can't deny the fact that the cinematography is. Once again we are shown endless landscapes, mind painted sceneries and this undeniable and precise harmony of professional operation of the camera, which is to me just amazing. It holds this beauty which you can't compare to anything else and that, if something, is the real heart of true dedication of Asian film makers. You can't really do anything else than just thank them about it, but it's enough that you know it yourself. These landscapes are complimented with the utterly tremendous music composed by Tan Dun, who has composed a main theme that'll melt the heart of even the most cynical person. For Asian film making it's very common to fit the music with the cinematography and the story, but I just can't get enough of it, it's always just that good and you just don't get bored of it. The best thing about the music is that you can't hear music like it in any other films, so it's always fresh for your ears if you've only watched movies from Hollywood. Asian instruments are always strong and compelling, being really significant for the overall feeling of the film and what's left after it.Even the role performances are excellent, so you'll get a full quality package. I think Yun-Fat Chow as Li Mu Bai makes his best role performance yet to date and Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien makes some pretty damn fine job as well. Ziyi Zhang is again the beautiful herself, being also a great actress as well, which makes her one of my favourite Asian actresses at the moment. Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh have a really good chemistry with each other, which is somehow reflected as the chemistry between Ziyi Zhang and her co-star Chen Chang. Both couples work with each other superbly on screen, so the movie isn't a let down even in that department. When you get along with film you realise that these couples are sort of equal to each other, only that the characters have different names and the stories behind them are different; It's all about love in the end and when we finally get to the end there's an astonishing solution where tears won't be spared. When love and honour have their own demands they will become equal to each other, love will become honour and vice versa. It's really hard to explain and even harder to find out, but in any case the viewer isn't left without answers. You can make up your own mind about the ending though, so it's also really clever.'Wo hu cang long' is without a doubt one of the best Asian films I've ever seen, everything in it matches and clicks, everything just gets along. The film isn't perfect, but to be honest it's really close in being one. It doesn't really have any major flaws and even the minor ones can't be explained. Like mentioned before you really need a certain perspective, or you need to be at least open minded, because let's face it; A film like this isn't for everyone. If you can't stand any films which define the laws of physics or which are somehow surreal I wouldn't really recommend this film to you. If you're just slightly open minded or at least have some remains of an open mind then please do watch it, as I'd say you won't be disappointed. 'Wo hu cang long' even won a total of four Academy Awards, which is really an achievement for a foreign film. Just to name two, it won Oscars from the best cinematography and music, so I'm really not praising them for nothing. Just see this film. You even may be surprised by its magic and its affect on you.",9,5,9,28 September 2007
Good Will Hunting," Basic drama writing at its very best
","Will Hunting is a troubled young man who spends his free time hanging around bars and cleaning the floors of a university. However, Will isn't a typical youngster as he has unbelievable mathematic abilities and an outstanding photographic memory. Will soon gets into trouble but a professor who's seen what he's capable of makes a proposition which includes Will to see a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist after another refuses to see Will anymore as he's so uncooperative. Will eventually meets his match, a psychiatrist Sean McGuire, who finally makes Will to open up his mind and think about what he wants to do with his life.'Good Will Hunting' is a feel good movie. Though it is kind of a basic drama, it is still drama at its best. This is really what the drama -genre should be, as the film doesn't really go into other genres at all, it follows the pattern of a great drama, but it somehow manages to be surprisingly good. The story's interesting, though it isn't that unique after all, but it captures your attention right from the start. It's just something that's easy for your eyes and it's a real pleasure to watch. You don't feel stressed at any part of the film, every scene matters and there isn't anything unnecessary anywhere. Screenplay's written by Matt Damon and Ben Affleck and it is indeed very well written and you can really see where they were heading at with it. It hasn't really got any amazing twists and turns, it's just brilliant on its own. I'd like to see Damon and Affleck collaborate some more in the future, as this is what a true drama is really, and after all, about.The film also includes great role performances, so that may be one of the reasons why it's also so surprisingly good. Matt Damon is great as Will Hunting, the main character. Stellan Skarsgård is perfect for the role of the professor Gerald Lambeau and his role performance is solid. Ben Affleck also does his job flawlessly, and I really think he is in fact a good actor but people just don't seem to get it because of what movies he's been in in the past. He doesn't get the chance of a perfect role for him, but hopefully that will also change in the near future. Just stop slaying the guy and let's see how far can he really go. Minnie Driver fits for the role of Skylar, the girlfriend of Will Hunting, and she has an incredible chemistry with Damon. All of the scenes where they are with each other are really strong and powerful, you can really see or sense these sincere emotions between them. Those scenes really speak for themselves and what is true drama acting at its best, as there happens the unquestionable and respected tearing away the actor from the character itself, which makes it seem like there is no acting involved at all. That's just how real it feels and looks like.Despite that, that is not the best thing the film has to offer, as there is one actor above everyone else and that is Robin Williams, who's in the supporting role of the psychiatrist Sean McGuire. Williams is pure excellence, he's just absolute perfection and without a doubt the best thing you see in the entire film. McGuire is also a man with a troubled past, so the characters of Sean McGuire and Will Hunting find something in common, which firstly leads to an odd friendship, but then transforms itself into a true beauty where the word 'friendship' gets a whole new meaning. The dialog between Williams and Damon is fantastic, being sometimes hilarious yet being smart and clever all of the time. Robin Williams even won an Academy Award from this devotion to the character, IE the best actor in the supporting role, which is a more than a deserved win. Overall I must say that the film shines with magnificent actors in the right roles, so the casting did pretty much a flawless job.Although 'Good Will Hunting' is also, as mentioned, hilarious at some points it's also very dramatic, so it slightly mixes up drama with comedy, although maintaining the main perspective in the drama -genre. It's definitely worth a watch after all. Movies like these with this kind of a special flow, which means you don't want it to end but you want it move along as well as it is just so entertaining all the time, don't come out too often. You just can't wait what will happen next. Directing is done by Gus Van Sant, who I think hasn't really done anything that amazing before or after 'Good Will Hunting'. Yes, the directing is great, but you can't really direct a bad movie if the screenplay's this good. Damon and Affleck even won an Academy Award from it, so question is why not write something together in the near future? The Academy Award really speaks for itself, ensuring the fact that writing together again would be a good idea. It would probably be worthwhile.",8,1,4,6 October 2007
The Man Who Would Be King," Sean Connery and Micheal Caine equals a chemistry which can not be described with words
","I saw this movie about two weeks ago. By being a movie where the lead actors are Sean Connery and Michael Caine it can't be bad, now can it? Well, it can't and it wasn't. To be honest the movie wasn't quite what I expected it to be, but it sure was a great movie. The movie tells about two men, Daniel Dravot and Peachy Carnehan, who decide to resign from the Army and travel to Kafiristan to become kings. No white man has set foot in Kafiristan since Alexander, but as ambitious as Daniel and Peachy are they decide to give it a go and leave on the adventure.Being a story by Rudyard Kipling it has all the right ingredients what an adventure movie requires. The film wisely uses those ingredients, but after I had seen the movie I honestly thought it could have been better. The film just has this certain style of telling the story, which can sometimes be a bit long-winded. It does seem that sometimes there isn't that much happening and it may be unbearable for some viewers. Well it is a movie from the 70's and movies were different even back then, though it isn't a long time ago at all. Despite that it's still a great adventure movie throughout and when it's directed by John Huston (who has also written the screenplay with Gladys Hill) it is indeed guaranteed quality. The cinematography's used how it's supposed to, when shooting in exotic locations you must shoot the beautiful landscapes as well to give the viewer that certain feeling of a real adventure. We see all kinds of astonishing sceneries throughout the movie and overall the movie is shot incredibly well by using every resource the milieu has to offer.What makes this movie so great, despite the already mentioned and complimented story, directing and cinematography, is undeniably the chemistry between Sean Connery and Michael Caine. If the movie doesn't interest you at all, try at least for god sakes watch it for Connery and Caine. There's just this unspeakable chemistry which can not be described with words, undeniably one of the best I've ever seen in a motion picture. Both, Connery and Caine, have this certain charisma which can only be accomplished by just a few actors. And by putting all that charisma together, uniting it, you see a charisma which is more than you expect it to be. Sean Connery as Daniel Dravot performs the role flawlessly and same goes with Michael Caine who plays Peachy Carnehan. Just perfect. There is also a clever dialog between Dravot and Carnehan, which is a real treat for the fans. And when there's written this familiar witty sarcasm throughout the screenplay there honestly couldn't be better lead actors doing it, Connery and Caine exceed it.'The Man Who Would Be King' is more than just an adventure movie. It also tells a story about a true friendship, how friends should help each other in tight situations and what a real friendship is all about. This evolves the movie into a beautiful story which also makes it surprisingly dramatic. Backed up by the fantastic music by Maurice Jarre it really makes you shed a tear, even tears. Despite the movie having an opportunity to be something much better it still hangs on to be a great movie by having such magnificent lead actors in it. When each other area works really well too the movie is much better than the ingredients given to it. Sean Connery and Michael Caine can't become kings, as they already are kings. If not actual kings, then at least kings in our hearts. My heart says they are.",8,3,6,26 July 2007
Hero," Eloquent beauty in a flawlessly composed tranquility
","I remember watching this movie many times before, but only clips from it, so I had never seen it all the way through. Now, as the proud owner of the DVD, I finally saw it straight through and I was also very pleased on the overall result. 'Ying xiong' aka 'Hero' is indeed a great movie and a startlingly beautiful one as well. The story is based in ancient China, before the reign of the first emperor, warring factions throughout the Six Kingdoms plot to assassinate the most powerful ruler, Qin. When a minor official defeats Qin's three principal enemies, he is summoned to the palace to tell Qin the story of his surprising victory.The story, with all its twists and turns, is very well written and it's a true epic, in a way that I personally love. It has a very good catch and you can't really see what'll be the final solution before the very end of the movie. There's also this unique way of using colours; Every time a same, but somehow different, story is told it is also told with different colours, which already by its own gives the movie this 'hook' to keep the viewer interested. It's very original and prominent, being also visually so effective. The movie is throughout a visual masterpiece and the cinematography is absolutely amazing. As a fan of Asian cinematography I thought some of the scenes were so beautifully shot that it almost made my skin tremble - Those endless landscapes and soothing images truly gives you this heart warming feeling. You just keep on staring the screen because of the unquestionable beauty that flashes through your eyes. Marvellous.'Hero' also has all in all very solid role performances. Despite the fact of people saying Jet Li can only do martial arts I still think he is great as an actor as well. Look at for example 'Danny the Dog' (2005) where Jet Li pulled off an amazing role performance. The film industry doesn't let us see that he actually has great acting capabilities, it's just that he doesn't get the opportunity to use them very often. Jet Li was indeed at his best in 'Hero', both acting and martial arts wise. The rest of the cast does a pretty satisfying job as well, so there isn't anything worth complaining when it comes to that department. The romantic story between Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Maggie Cheung works really well with the main story and the chemistry between them is undeniably a real treat. Ziyi Zhang is the beautiful herself, giving the movie a touch of sensitivity although her character being sometimes filled with anger and hate. Donnie Yen as 'Sky' does his part and Daoming Chen as the 'King of Qin' does his, so the role performances the movie offers are handled pretty well and they are also very significant for the whole progress of the film, keeping it in a tight package throughout.The movie is mixed between nice storytelling and phenomenal fighting sequences, that real Asian specimen of skill. I once again thought that the battle scenes (or action scenes if you might call them that) were stunning and truly entertaining. They aren't really actual 'action' scenes, as all of them are shot in sort of a calm and peaceful way, which fits with the main theme incredibly well. I'm certainly not forgetting the whole beauty of them, as even when the fighting proceeds itself into a fast phased rhythm it's still so serene and when accompanied with the absolutely gorgeous soundtrack composed by Tan Dun it's something that's not easily forgotten. It's like the cinematography; Beautiful, soothing, precise and detailed. Both, the fighting and the cinematography, follow each other in a compelling way and it's really absorbing, a fine achievement indeed.'Ying xiong' is definitely not an action movie, so everyone who's expecting a mindless action flick will most certainly be disappointed. The film is an excellent example of how great a movie mixed with an epic, dramatic story and outstanding action can be, working really well on both sides and not forgetting either one of the sides to a minor role. It balances both of them and that, if something, deserves an enormous appreciation from me. The movie includes solid performances, mind blowing cinematography, detailed directing, an unique way on how to use storytelling not only as what we've used to but also as a visual way of making the movie itself lively and vivid, giving it an original, yet well crafted out touch. 'Hero' isn't perfect, but it's still a strong milestone in the Asian film industry and will probably be referred to in the future. Everything still works in a fluent way, so this is one of those fine pieces of film making that everyone should see, hence the 'Asian Masterpieces' -title in my four-movies-together DVD-box. I personally think this is one of the best Asian pictures made in the 21st century. You may be surprised or you may be not, but in the end you can't deny the beauty of it.",8,0,0,4 September 2007
Children of Men," Absolutely phenomenal, I am stunned
","I had seen this movie before but I had to memorize things from it for reviewing so I watched it again 4 days ago. It still is as excellent as a movie can pretty much get. I actually had to shorten this review as it passed the 1000 word -limit, so I apologize as some things are obviously and sadly left out. For example comments on Julianne Moore, the plot and a more detailed commenting on the story's depth. So don't get frustrated, as you may find some parts of this review simply missing something.The best thing about this film is how incredibly well it's made. The way the futuristic world is made is probably the best I've ever seen in a motion picture. It is so detailed and so believable. All the visible corruption, trash all over the street, ruins of buildings and this darkness and sadness is just so top notch it makes you wonder how the hell did they make it. I mean, it's just so realistic that it makes the movie one of those movies that leave you with your mouth open. The visual side of the movie is just so effective.I am very happy to say that Clive Owen finally has the perfect role for him. To be honest I've never liked Clive Owen before as he has always been sort of tense and annoyingly stiff, and that deep voice he has hasn't really helped him in his past roles either. Owen does an astonishing role performance as Theo Faron and he is just perfect in the role, he in fact is the character itself. I especially liked the verbal work he did, it sort of boosted up the character and really gave it a true soul. Then there was the great Michael Caine, who is by the way one of my favourite actors of all time. To me the role of Jasper Palmer, an aging hippie selling his own self grown weed, was so ideal yet so surreal for Caine and he did a truly amazing role performance. Caine surely was at his best and if you ask me, the role performance was so good that it should have been at least worth an Academy Award nomination for best actor in a supporting role, but sadly he never wasn't nominated for it.The brilliance of this movie doesn't end here, as it also includes surely one of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a motion picture. Probably even the best one. Most of it is hand-held, but there are still shots as well, which kinda balances the whole overall cinematography a bit so it won't be a 'shaking ride' throughout. Usually hand-held cinematography these days is used for symbolizing depressing moments and it gives the actors more room for improvising, which we've seen over and over again, and happily that isn't the case of the cinematography in 'Children of Men'. Hand-held is also a very effective way of shooting when it comes to war movies and the action scenes in them, it gives that true edge of a real battle and the viewer feels like he is in fact in a middle of a massive fight. Not only using hand-held to figure the action scenes, 'Children of Men' does more than that with it. It kind of makes it feel like a real future, so it makes the whole sci-fi thing something that could actually take place some day, so it makes the movie even more believable and it also high-lights the whole theme of sorrow and sadness. It makes it reality. A truly superior achievement indeed.The story in its wholeness is simply stunning. The screenplay written by Alfonso Cuarón, Timothy J. Sexton, David Arata, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby is very well written and I could presume that Alfonso Cuarón as also the director of 'Children of Men' has been the head writer of the movie. Of course I can't be sure, so I can't really praise it as Cuarón's work, but I can harmlessly praise it as the work of the writer of the original novel written by P.D. James. She has invented a dramatic, a true and a real story with a depth that can not be measured. It is just so deep and so detailed. There's so much tension and intensity in it as well, which also makes the movie a very thrilling thriller, backed up by the totally terrific directing by Alfonso Cuarón. This is complimented by the fantastic music the movie has to offer. It mainly consists of these songs that are just so fitting for the main theme of the movie, but there is also this relaxing and absolutely beautiful opera/new age -song which is repeated several times throughout the movie, making the film overall a soothing, peaceful experience despite its actual focus on the action and the thrill.'Children of Men' shines with excellence and to me it is all in all just so perfect. It has a very original, unique story which I can't honestly imagine being a disappointment to anyone, though some viewers may find it slightly disturbing. In my opinion, the overall attention the movie got wasn't nearly what it deserved and it should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award for the best motion picture of the year. You don't see me giving 10's so often, but this movie deserves the highest score without a doubt. It is one of the best visions of the future ever translated on the big screen being that provoking and effective itself and it will most certainly climb up to my personal Top 5 Movies of All Time -list. I just love this movie, it is simply superb and I feel ashamed that I can not compliment it enough. There were many great movies last year, but if you ask me, this was the best one.",10,4,12,5 June 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," As a movie it lacks some emotion, but as a documentary it's almost perfect
","An important film the Americans say, which I'm not doubting at all. A movie about courage to stand out, even if you're outnumbered. The movie is based on real events and I guess it's pretty accurate when it comes to that. A fear of communism was at its highest point at the 1950's and a man embracing those fears was a controversial Senator called Joseph McCarthy. CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow and his close friend, also his producer, Fred Friendly decide to challenge the Senator and his beliefs by making it all public in Murrow's own talk show. A stubborn, yet a very clever exposé done.One thing that probably makes this movie stand out the most is the casting. There's honestly all the right actors for the right roles and it gives the movie more of this feeling of it being so real. That said, the film is overall more like a documentary acted out than an actual movie. One hell of a good documentary though. What comes to role performances, there's really one man that stands out the most and he is an actor named David Strathairn who plays the role of Edward R. Murrow. As I am myself in a young age, I can't remember how Mr. Murrow actually was like, but what I've heard I think Strathairn is almost the perfect mirror image of Murrow. And I must say he does some really fine job, well worth Academy Award Nomination. There's just something so powerful in his voice that it just makes the character feel so real and every word spoken by Strathairn is there for a reason, every word has its own purpose. Magnificent role performance indeed.The movie is directed by George Clooney, who also co-stars in the movie as the producer Fred Friendly. His role performance is also great and he just fits for the role, but it's still nothing near Strathairn's performance. This movie is a very good example of the fact that Clooney can also direct, as the directing really is good along the whole cinematography. I'd say it was a pretty bold choice to shoot the movie totally in black and white, but it does fit very well if you ask me. It captures the real essence of the 1950's and makes it also a bit darker, as it really was a dark period back then. Nicely done. The screenplay is well written, overall the movie has a pretty good flow and it progresses itself in a nice tempo. I wouldn't say there is so much nonsense, because as far as I can see it, every scene does its justice by being there which also makes the movie a bit short. Everything is over in just 1 hour and slightly over 20 minutes. The lenght it good though, as if there had been more stuff it may had caused the movie to be a bit boring.For me as a Finnish person and as a person at my 20's, it's pretty obvious that I can't remember anything from the 1950's and the whole fear of communism at the US. That's why the movie is also a bit hard for me to understand, though I know a few things here and there. I would have hoped the movie to be more emotional, as now it just comes and goes without waking up some real emotions in me. A pity, as the movie is good, but it would have been much better that way. Clooney could have dramatized some situations, but it may have made the movie too cliché though. But as it is a historical event and more importantly an important historical event, it could have been an emotional-packed-ride. Like I mentioned before; As the way the movie is now, it does feel more like a documentary. Overall it's a nice movie despite this negative feedback, so I can recommend it to everyone. It's not a masterpiece, but it's well worth watching, especially if you're interested in that specific period of time and how all the people working around it reacted to Murrow's 'statements' and how people were scared. Above a decent movie, nice one indeed.",7,2,3,3 May 2007
Life Is Beautiful," A superb role performance by Roberto Benigni, who offers you true love and real happiness in the same beautiful package
","'La Vita é Bella' is a beautiful story about love, courage and life's little things. The movie tells about a man named Guido Orefice, who with his original personality falls in love with a schoolteacher Dora. Although Dora being currently with another man, Guido still fights for her and after 5 years he and Dora are married together and have a son, Giosué. While Guido is living his fairy tale life, not caring about the bad things in life, Italy is suddenly occupied by the German forces during the World War II. Guido and his son are taken to a concentration camp where Dora voluntarily follows them. In the camp men and women are naturally separated from each other, but Guido somehow finds a way to communicate with his wife and protect his son. Although the movie also tells about war and its sad consequences, it tells about it in a so beautiful and a happy way I've never seen before.The one thing above everything else which makes this movie so astonishing is Roberto Benigni, who plays Guido and who is also the director and the second writer of the movie. The movie got 7 Academy Award nominations and won 3 of them, you don't hear a foreign movie doing that every day, so it's a pretty huge achievement I'd say. Roberto Benigni won the Oscar of the Best Actor in a Leading Role, an Oscar more than deserved indeed. I remember Benigni saying somewhere something like it's a pretty funny thing to win an Oscar from playing yourself. If Benigni is really like Guido, then we need more people like that in the world. The character of Benigni has this unique, vivid personality which can not be described. It's like he wants everyone else to feel better than himself and he cares about his wife and son more than himself. Although the character being slightly surreal Benigni does the impossible by making the character reality, making it so believable. He is so likable, sympathetic and simply happy in a way that just makes you smile throughout the movie. An amazing role performance indeed, if I'd have three thumbs I'd put them all up.OK, if we forget about the main character in the movie the story isn't so original after all. A family driven apart during the war, forced into a concentration camp, doesn't sound so original anymore now does it? The movie pretty much hangs in the hands of the character Guido Orefice, which just makes the whole movie so brilliant, not forgetting the fantastic dialogue between the main character and other characters. This makes the screenplay very good, telling an already heard story which is always a treat for you if done well, but adding this overwhelmingly superior character to it, raising the whole movie from good to brilliant. This is complimented by the excellent music composed by Nicola Piovani, who won an Oscar from it as well. Adding so much more beauty to the story, making the funny and hilarious scenes also so dramatic and beautiful.'La Vita é Bella' is all in all a brilliant film. It translates the sadness to happiness and beauty in an already mentioned way, a way that can not be described. The movie isn't just playing a fool on screen and getting some recognition from it, it's about true love and real courage evolving as we understand it. This is without a doubt all in all one of the happiest movies I've ever seen in my entire life. There is sort of mixed comedy and drama, but the real focus being on the drama after all, although the comedy side being absolutely hilarious and making you laugh. If someone succeeds in making you laugh and making you emotional at the same time that is always an achievement worth mentioning. This is a movie recommendation to everyone and for god sakes please watch the original Italian version, as I like to think that dubbed versions are more like a sin. Especially when the movie includes a role performance this amazing. Roberto Benigni is a genius.",9,1,4,7 June 2007
The Untouchables," It's evolving, it's captivating and it's full of emotions. Man power at its best
","I had never seen this movie before last night when I had the chance to watch it and I must say I was pretty damn impressed. The movie takes place in the 1920's when the mob warlord Al Capone ruled Prohibition-era Chicago. Federal agent Elliot Ness, quoting one of the plot outlines, assembles a personal team of mob fighters to bring Chicago crime boss Al Capone to justice using unconventional means. This team becomes known as 'The Untouchables'. This is by far the best movie I've seen from Brian De Palma. I knew it was going to be good, but I was surprised that it was even better.The screenplay, the whole story, is just brilliant. It has this absolute flow, which I think was more normal back then, as it seems to me that less newer movies have that specific flow nowadays. The progress and the twists in the plot are just excellent and they keep you concentrated throughout the whole movie. The way the movie progresses itself is just pure glory for your eyes and it also compliments the directing. The directing is just so fitting with the screenplay that it's even better than it actually is, though it is honestly very good. De Palma has captured the soul and the whole feeling of the 1920's, making 'The Untouchables' a real masterpiece of a movie and I can't believe I've missed it before. The music is superb, despite the fact that it has that cheesy 80's feeling in it at times. No wonder the music's so superb, as the composer is the master Ennio Morricone himself. He does compositions that are so recognizable that you just know it's Morricone behind the music.What comes to role performances, well there's one above everyone else and that is no-one else than Sean Connery himself, at his best. I just can't believe the work he has done, as it seems to me that every role he plays he does it perfectly. I can't do nothing else than admire him, there's just something so charismatic about him that it always makes me stare in amazement. In 'The Untouchables' he plays a veteran patrolman who teaches Ness how to beat Capone and he just does it so believably that.. Well, read what said above. The role performance he does is just excellent and it is no wonder that he even won an Oscar from it. Robert De Niro is very fitting in the role of Al Capone; I honestly couldn't imagine anyone else doing it. I have to admit that I don't know much about Capone's real behavior, but to me Capone is everything De Niro does in this movie. The movie actually shines with the whole cast as well, including for example Kevin Costner as the tough Elliot Ness and Andy Garcia as one of the untouchables, master shooter George Stone. Everyone performs their roles so well that the whole movie is a real pleasure for eyes throughout.'The Untouchables' is a must-see-masterpiece. I think it's highly underrated, as I was so surprised how good it actually was even when I have really never liked mob-movies so much. It has superb role performances, excellent directing, a brilliant story and it is all in all, a great movie. A recommendation for everyone who haven't seen it! Everything just works so well together, giving it that flow and making it click in every aspect. The movie has this excitement and tension, this real feeling of pure man power, in a way that can not be described. A great movie indeed.",9,0,2,19 May 2007
The Fountain," Beautiful, captivating, unique.. Not enough words to describe this movie
","There is something in this movie. Something very powerful, which is the whole beauty of it. The movie tells about 3 different stories about love spanning over one thousand years and though it is complicated, philosophical, it's pure glory for your eyes.The director Darren Aronofsky does something so beautiful it's really hard to describe. Images after another, your eyes flow into an endless void filled with pure beauty. To me the directing is excellent in this film and it's also so beautifully shot though many of the landscapes are made with computers. This movie also shines with amazing role performances; One of my favourite actors Hugh Jackman and the always beautiful Rachel Weisz have this chemistry between them on the screen which just makes my skin tremble. It's so real, yet so surreal in a some kind of a way. All the words spoken by Jackman are so powerful and so very important for the movie itself. The dialog between him and Weisz is just perfection in its purest form.The movie is very unique, not like any other I've seen before. I already mentioned the cinematography; In its wholeness it's superb, the use of colors just amaze you and what you see from the screen is so special it makes you smile. The music composed by Clint Mansell just flows with the movie so well it's just magnificent. From the sad and depressive to the beautiful and harmonic compositions it just fills the gaps in a special way and it simply fits for the whole main theme of the film.The film has this hook in it which keeps you concentrated throughout it and it's just so interesting that you want to see where it all ends. So much is left for the viewer, so few answers and so many questions, genius in its own way I'd say. I want to see this movie again, as I really think this is one of those movies you have to see many times through before you understand everything in it, if you even have to understand it all. Maybe it's the movie's purpose to leave the viewer sitting in amazement with all those questions rolling in his/her mind. If it isn't, well then I just may be the wrong person to review this movie. The word 'understanding' will have a whole new meaning for it after you've seen this movie. Brilliant.'Together we will live forever.'",8,1,2,2 May 2007
The Departed," Over-hyped, yet an intelligent and an entertaining movie. More than a deserved thumbs up for Martin Scorsese's achievement
","I had seen this movie before, but I watched it again last night because I was honestly left a bit disappointed at the first time. Well actually, the movie was better when I watched it again, but it still isn't anything phenomenal like everyone says. The movie was over-hyped and I had huge expectations on it, so that's probably the reason why I am a bit disappointed. It won an Academy Award for the Best Picture, but if you ask me, I'd chosen 'Little Miss Sunshine' for the Best Picture. Don't get me wrong, the movie's good but I just would have hoped more of it.Martin Scorsese won an Academy Award for the Best Achievement in Directing and I must say it was more than a well deserved Oscar indeed. The movie has, without a doubt, excellent directing, very close to perfection. When I was watching the Academy Awards I literally jumped off from my seat, screaming and giving a big applause when I heard the name 'Martin Scorsese' at the point where they were announcing the Oscar for the Best Achievement in Directing. That has been by far the most exciting experience I've had when watching the Academy Awards. Anyway, back to the film itself: The movie has a very good flow and the screenplay's very well progressing and good enough, but I think the movie could have been a little bit shorter, as now it's just a bit too long. The last 30 minutes of the movie are, I wouldn't say boring, but slightly too much. Still, the movie's enjoyable from the beginning till the end, just to say that as I don't want to sound too harsh. And to add to that I haven't seen the original movie, 'Mou gaan dou' aka 'Infernal Affairs', so I can't really compare these two movies together.What comes to role performances the one who takes the cake is no other than Jack Nicholson. I must admit that I've never really liked Jack Nicholson that much, but in this movie he's just phenomenal, he's just simply perfect for the role. Being that mad dirty mouthed himself. What comes to other performances, well, the whole cast is just superbly chosen and there is one amazing actor after another. Leonardo DiCaprio, who is one of my favourite actors, is the excellent himself as always. Matt Damon does his job flawlessly, Mark Wahlberg is a rather surreal choice for a bad ass cop, which makes him also hilarious, yet an excellent choice. Alec Baldwin does one of his most fitting roles ever, being surprisingly enjoyable and Martin Sheen is the legend who's the last touch for the movie.This is a good movie and good entertainment with its twisty plot and witty, even sarcastic, humour. A fine piece indeed. Still, it is a bit disappointing for those who are looking for an amazing movie, as it just was honestly too over-hyped when it came out and it still is too over-hyped. Despite that, the movie is definitely worth watching and I'm recommending it to everyone. It includes great characters who are performed by amazing actors, a top notch direction, a story with a very entertaining flow and music that just gives that last touch of a great guaranteed movie experience. Martin Scorsese, I salute you. Now all hail Scorsese.",7,0,1,10 May 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," An original story, being funny and dramatic at the same time, a celebration of Will Ferrell indeed
","I had seen this movie before, but as it was so good at the first time, I decided to watch it another time to see if it's still that good. Oh yes, it was. 'Stranger Than Fiction' tells about an IRS agent Harold Crick, whose life is pretty much dependent on his wristwatch. He's precise in everything, from brushing his teeth to his coffee breaks at work, every day is the same and Harold's whole life is repetitive. All of a sudden, he starts to hear a narration of a story in his head, telling about Harold's life, being right in everything he does. Obviously the narration starts to affect his life as well.The screenplay is very well written, it's very unique and original, like no other I've seen before. It's so sweet in a way that it just makes you smile. The whole story telling is just marvellous, progressing with comedy and drama mixed up together, it makes you laugh and it makes you sad, so this is not just a comedy. For me, it's more like a drama and though it is actually, quoting the movie title, stranger than fiction it is after all some way so believable, although you know it can't be true. That's why the screenplay's so fantastic, making something fictional to seem like something like it could actually happen. The directing makes the screenplay even better, by being accurate and precise. It's nothing phenomenal, but still deserves a big plus.Will Ferrell does his best role performance yet to date, by far. The movie's a perfect example of the fact that Ferrell can do drama as well besides the usual comedy. He's also just so fitting for the role itself, he actually looks like Harold Crick, being the character by his substance. A big applause for Mr. Ferrell indeed, just perfect. What comes to other role performances, well, there couldn't be better actors doing them. Dustin Hoffman plays a professor named Jules Hilbert and he's just so incredibly funny in the role as well, being that enjoyable himself he always is. Emma Thompson is the narrator and the author, doing it perfectly. A little bit different role from Thompson which also makes it rather surreal, but oh well, she's one of those actresses who can actually perform any role. Great. Despite the excellent performances of Hoffman and Thompson, the one who takes the cake is Ferrell. We've seen comedians doing dramas in the past and to just name a few excellent ones there's Jim Carrey with 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', there's Steve Carrell with 'Little Miss Sunshine and there's Robin Williams who has done it a million times, yet perfectly every time. Will Ferrell belongs to that group of comedians now and he is more than warmly welcome.All in all, 'Stranger Than Fiction' is a great movie. It's very enjoyable, it's funny and it's surprisingly dramatic, including an excellent scene which actually made me shed a tear. That's what is so surprising in it being so dramatic, there's the hilarious Will Ferrell, who can obviously break hearts as well. This just makes me waiting more of dramatic roles from Ferrell, as he just was so good in this movie. Hopefully he'll be doing more drama, as when it comes to comedy that's guaranteed from Ferrell. Anyways, the movie's great, no matter what your aspect is. Just watch it and most certainly enjoy it. It puts a smile on your face.",8,1,2,9 May 2007
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," A breath-taking ride from the beginning till the end by scratching the surface of perfection.
","This movie was simply an amazing film! This movie sets mark for all war movies, this is how war movies should be made! This is one of the best (if not the best) war films I've ever seen, honestly..OK, first of all, the movie is almost perfect in every aspect. It doesn't fail you in any imaginable way, it's just that good. Everything just simply flows in a harmonic way in this movie, it amazes you more and more, every minute. The directing is superb, the cinematography is excellent, the screenplay is brilliant and the story has some originality in it too, so this is not just another war movie. It's also a very touching movie besides the action in it, so it doesn't even go wrong there.I have to mention the battle scenes, they are simply great. I haven't seen battle scenes like that since 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band of Brothers'. You will be entertained and you will be amazed, again and again, not forgetting the whole story, drama-wise. The role performances of the lead actors, Dong-Kun Jang and Bin Won, are simply mind blowing. In the movie they are brothers and they just handle the job perfectly, without any flaws and it is a real pleasure to watch those two actors working together, they really have chemistry between them, just great.Oh yeah, and the music. It's simply beautiful and will blow your mind away as well, it's just that good. The whole soundtrack is just fantastic though the composer Dong-jun Lee is unfamiliar to me, but hopefully I'll be hearing some of his music in the near future movies as it sounded so good in this one. I'd give this movie 9.5/10, but as that is 'impossible', I will sadly have to drop the number to 9. It probably deserves more than that, but this is the decision now. What am I talking here anymore? Just see this movie, it's just that brilliant! Recommending to everyone.",9,6,7,23 April 2007
The Shawshank Redemption," Enjoy the excellence and perfection
","Year after another this movie has defended its place on IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time -list and it has done in at the second place. Is there anyone who finds it kinda odd that it's on the second place rather than the first one? I mean, at the Top 250 -list this and 'Godfather' has the rating of 9.1, but when you click on 'The Shawshank Redemption' it seems to have the rating of 9.2 and even more votes than 'Godfather'. Is it just that the staff at IMDb has just simply forgotten to update the list? Well anyways, to the review itself. I just watched this movie last night and I've seen it once before as well, as I am indeed the proud owner of the DVD. The movie is just pure excellence, or at least for me and it is no wonder it's ranked so high at IMDb. A perfect example of the fact that Stephen King is not just a writer of horror.What probably amazes me the most in this movie is that it's just so very well written. I mean, I think that a screenplay couldn't be more perfect than it is in this movie. It's just so good that it makes you smile throughout the movie, it just flows through so smoothly that it makes you think 'How on earth can it be this good?' Pieces of the puzzle connect together in a rhythmic way, which make your eyes freeze because of the harmonic perfection it provides, it makes you show your emotions: It makes you sad, it makes you angry and it makes you laugh. It's just so good you don't want it to end. Just pure completeness.The cast is just superb, every right actor for the right role. I must admit that I've never liked Tim Robbins so much, but in this movie the role given to him is just perfect and the role performance he does is his best yet to date. No other person can make that cold glance he does with his eyes, the whole cold substance he has. There is just something so spooky in him. Even when Tim Robbins does a great job, even more greater job does the all mighty Morgan Freeman, who I think is one of the best actors in the history of the movies. The man just doesn't have a bad role performance, maybe even not an average one. His role performance as 'Red', the provider of things at Shawshank prison, is for me just so ideal. I think that the choice of him being the narrator in the monologue is just brilliant. Morgan Freeman's voice is just so fitting to this movie that it almost makes your skin tremble. The monologue itself is also very well written and it progresses itself among the whole screenplay in a so magnificent way that.. Well, I already told you about the completeness.The one who is in charge of the music is the composer Thomas Newman, who I think is the perfect choice for composing the music to a movie like this. If I had to choose someone else, I think the closest one would be Micheal Giacchino, but I can't even think about that so much as the music in this movie is just so amazing in the way it is. The main theme of the composition is just beautiful and the whole soundtrack just simple blows you away. The chords build up this entirety and changing variations throughout the movie which can only be envied because of the beauty of it. Just brilliant.I can't praise this movie enough, I feel like I'm still not complimenting it enough, but in the matter of fact that's all I've done in this review. I have to mention the directing as well. It's just so smooth it collaborates with the screenplay so well, that it just is a real pleasure for the eyes. The director Frank Darabont really, quoting all the cliché's of complimenting, really captures the essence of this movie. It's just not the parts which make you the most amazed, it's honestly the whole movie. I can't say directing could be more perfect because it just is. In my opinion anyways.If you haven't seen this movie, you've really missed a masterpiece in the history of movies. I tried to write this review without giving away any spoilers, as the plot has some twists and tweaks in it as well, so it's also very original. Just see this movie and you will finally understand how it is on the second place at IMDb.The Shawshank Redemption shines even after 13 years.",10,0,0,28 April 2007
Ben-Hur," 48 years after - It's still excellent
","I bought 'Ben-Hur' on DVD more than one month ago. I had never seen the film, but as hearing so much good things about it and my brother literally praising it, it couldn't be that bad, now could it? I decided to watch it when I really had the time for it, the movie lasts for more than 3 and a half hours after all and it is said to be one of the finest movies in the whole history of motion pictures. That is something that really grows up the pressure of the viewer; You just can't start watching it whenever you want to and without having any expectations on it, it's just that simple. Well anyways, I finally looked up a free spot on my calendar and decided the day when I'd watch it. So, I took my time and watched it like a week or two ago and to be honest I was in a pretty good mood too so nothing could go wrong. Well, I am glad to say that even after 48 years, still to this day, 'Ben-Hur' is an entertaining, fine diamond and an excellent motion picture. You really have to relate to the time when it was made, but even without relating it's surprisingly good. Considering its age some of the things occurring in the movie are just mind blowing.The story in its wholeness is outstanding, it has everything an epic movie needs; Adventure, thrill, drama, romance, tragedy, just everything. And this is, indeed, an epic movie among the best. The story itself isn't just what described in the plot outlines; It has so many more levels of incomprehensible depth, so much power which takes it to an unexpected direction and based on what I saw I'd say it's undeniably one of the best epic stories ever seen or told on the big screen. Based on the novel by Lew Wallace, translated to a screenplay by Karl Tunberg it's quality writing and storytelling in an incredible level, from the beginning till the end. The film does get a bit heavy after the 2 and a half hours, which is really disappointing, as until that point it has a very good flow and the viewer doesn't get bored, but after that point it's slightly long-winded. Despite that the movie manages to be highly entertaining, so for the final rating and your overall opinion the heaviness isn't exactly as crucial as you may think. The music composed by Miklós Rózsa creates tension and comprehension while we progress throughout the movie and though it is as much as any other music in the movies made in the late 50's or early 60's it's still pretty awesome and it can not be ignored.The one significant thing above everything else is how well the whole movie is made, especially when considering its age. It's simply phenomenal how much time and effort has been put to this movie and it can definitely be seen from every single scene streaming across the screen, one after another. The props, the dressing, basically everything is an achievement like no other and the numbers just speak for themselves; 100 000 costumes, 8000 assistants, 300 props and the biggest budget at its era. This all, and more, brought the movie 11 Oscars and it was the first movie to win such many of them. No other than two movies have achieved that to this day; 'Titanic' (1997) and 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003). You have to bear in mind that back in 1959 there wasn't any kind of possibility for a such thing as CGI so basically everything you see on the screen has really happened and has been shot, so even that alone is a huge achievement which really deserves all the attention this movie has. There was this one particular scene that I will most certainly remember forever and that was the scene which probably awoke contradictory opinions and views back then because of its bloody yet realistic violence - The horse race scene. That is a scene I think everyone has heard of and I am one of those people who were left mouth open, as it is indeed fantastic. Honestly, I stood up from the sofa and gave a little applause after the scene ended.Judah Ben-Hur and Messala, played by Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, are very memorable characters and the chemistry between those two legendary actors is unspeakably overwhelming, as if the opposite personalities of the characters would compensate each other, which then forms that chemistry. Stephen Boyd is excellent as Messala, but Charlton Heston is even better as Ben-Hur and the role even brought him an Academy Award for the best actor in a leading role. It is no wonder. Like I've said before when I've reviewed older movies; The acting is totally different from the acting these days. It's a totally different art form of it's own and it just can not be compared to the acting this day. There is that certain extravagance if I may say it, it requires that relating to the age again, but it's still a real treat for your eyes and ears, giving you something different. It's like a fresh summer breeze.'Ben-Hur' is definitely a movie worth watching, when first making sure you have the time for it, a movie which you can not stop and continue the next day. Though it does get a bit heavy like mentioned, it's still worth it in the end. The heaviness is the only reason why I'm not going to give this motion picture a perfect score. The film includes brilliant role performances, fantastic story and superior art direction, set decoration and costume design. If a movie like this was made now it would still work as butter on a bread, and that's really something, isn't it?",9,5,10,28 August 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," One of the coolest characters ever seen on the screen makes a very successful and satisfying comeback
","I went to see the newest installment of the Die Hard series in the cinemas a while back and to be honest I pretty much got what I wanted, so I was very pleased on the overall result the movie had to offer. I was so glad that it didn't suck. First of all, the plot is rather cheesy or at some parts it is, so it's nothing that great but despite that it has a good catch which involves a couple of great twists here and there. When an internet-based terrorist organization attacks the United States by first hacking into the computers at the FBI's Cyber Crime Division to bring down the whole computer and technological structure that supports the economy of the country, no other man than the legendary John McClane has to take them on and bring justice to the world once again. With help of a hacker he fights against the organization through the cyber world and the real world. Sure, it is corny, but it sure is entertaining as well. Blood won't be spared.After twelve years one of the coolest characters ever seen on the big screen hits back to us and by the outstanding essence of Bruce Willis it is done with style. Undeniably the best thing this movie has to offer is Bruce Willis as John McClane, no other actor could do the same as Willis does. The first time I saw Willis on the screen I felt like applauding, insanely clapping my hands together, that's just how cool he still is. When things naturally go over the top you just realise saying to yourself 'No other than John McClane. It's John McClane, it's possible' I'm pretty convinced when I say that the hardcore Die Hard fans won't be disappointed, as John McClane still is as cool as he was twelve years ago. Although Bruce Willis is already 52 years old he still kicks ass and when he does it with such credibility you just have to appreciate that. That famous two thumbs up takes place once again. Despite the fact of Willis being the true heart and soul of this movie, the other cast does a pretty flawless job as well. Timothy Olyphant is a spot on pick as the main villain, as having those fierce eyes he does what an evil character should. Even Justin Long is convincing as Matt Farrell, the hacker, as he wasn't even near the annoy level I was expecting. Overall the cast is picked out well and there's not much to complain when it comes to role performances.The film is throughout a celebration of guaranteed quality action, they don't seem to make action movies like these anymore. The real essence of the old Die Hard's have remained - What those movies were all about and how the almost superhero like but realistic main character affected people, not forgetting the absolute punchlines of John McClane. When the movie has its cliché moments the writers have replaced those moments with the sarcasm of McClane who kind of saves that entire over the top -theme the movie has, clever I'd say. The action scenes are all in all simply mind blowing and the entertain level I was looking for was more than filled. As a movie having so much action; Gun shots, explosions, car chases, fist fights, everything imaginable, it's a must-see for every action fan there is. I went to see the movie with my brother and I remember asking him how many times there will be a moment in the movie where you have to say 'Yeah, awesome' My brother bet on seven times and I bet on ten times. Even the ten times were probably exceeded. That is how awesome the movie is.'Die Hard 4.0' is one of the best action movies I've seen in a while. It offers the viewer a thrilling ride throughout, action packed sequences and most importantly John McClane, who makes an outstanding comeback to the big screen without the movie being just a lame sequel. When I heard that the director was Len Wiseman I was kind of afraid that the movie wouldn't stand out in any way, though Len Wiseman's previous 'Underworld' -movies have been well crafted out when it came to the action scenes. I didn't like the actual movies though, but as I said, the action parts had potential. I'm glad that Wiseman did a satisfying job as the director. Though this probably final part of the Die Hard series is corny, it actually stays in a pretty tight package throughout and it doesn't lose the pieces as you could have imagined. You'll have a smile on your face, if not because of the absolutely hilarious punchlines by McClane then just because of the fact that you're watching a Die Hard -movie, a fresh new one. Live Free.. or Die Hard.",7,1,3,31 July 2007
Munich," A movie with the right amount of tension and excitement, one of Spielberg's best
","I had seen this movie before like over a year ago and now I watched it again last night. I like to think this is one of Spielberg's best works yet to date. Well it can be a bit dull at places, but it's still a great movie.There's this certain tension throughout the movie, it's exciting and interesting. The whole story is very well put together and it has great characters. What comes to the role performances I think it's Eric Bana's best role performance yet to date. He also fits in the role like a blanket on a bed, he's pretty perfect in it. In my opinion the whole casting is succeeded very well. Other Mossad group members are played by Daniel Craig, Ciarán Hinds, Mathieu Kassovitz and Hanns Zischler and they seem to be just the right actors for the right parts. We also see Geoffrey Rush in the role of Ephraim, which is pretty nice after constantly remembering him as Barbossa from some kind of a reason.The plot has enough twists and tweaks in it and though it's not of course so exciting as for the first time, I still enjoyed it very much. It's very believable, realistic. It's also intelligent with its twists and as we go towards the ending, it still has this certain energy, tension and surprises to keep you interested all the time. The screenplay's very good, but it's still nothing phenomenal, because of its (sad to say) dullness in places. Could be because I had seen the movie before, but I still would have liked some fillings here and there. Is it even necessary to talk about the directing? Well, it's Steven Spielberg and once again I think the directing is fantastic. Some of the parts are just so exciting you stand up and watch the whole scene without even blinking an eye. Just superb.The movie was nominated for 5 Oscars: For 'Best Achievement in Directing', 'Best Achievement in Editing', 'Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures (Original Score)', 'Best Motion Picture of the Year' and 'Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay' and it still makes me sad that it didn't win any of the categories. It sure would have deserved at least one Oscar, as if you look at the movie in its wholeness, the pieces are put together very well and the movie doesn't struggle in any way imaginable. The music is composed by the all mighty John Williams and you can't go wrong there now can you? The music's still not in so big role after all, but it's still in the right places and it's great. There's no actual main theme or beauty worth mentioning in the music, it just fits in the movie in its own way so well that it just makes your heart beat faster. Especially in the so called 'action' -parts there's this same music always playing, building up the tension when the other sound is cleverly put in the background. Even when the music's so simple in those parts, it's still so great.This is definitely a movie worth seeing. I agree that I should have reviewed this back then when I watched it for the first time, but later's better than never, right? Anyways, if you want to enjoy a good Drama/Thriller, then this's the movie you want to watch. It is very successful when it comes to those genres, both Drama and Thriller. There's some action in it too, but it still doesn't make it an action movie, or at least in my opinion it doesn't. It's just a great movie.",8,2,4,29 April 2007
Heat," Robert De Niro and Al Pacino at their best
","I saw this movie for the first time over two weeks ago and I was quite pleased on the overall result. 'Heat' is an exciting thriller and it tells cleverly, quoting one of the plot outlines, about two men on opposite sides of the law - One being a detective and one being a thief. The movie starts off with a robbery, which is arranged by Neil McCauley, the thief, and his criminal crew. This brings Vincent Hanna, the detective, and his crew to investigation which leads up to a hunt, Hanna being the hunter and McCauley being the prey. The movie wisely mixes up with the two lives of these two men, making the viewer feel sympathy towards both ends.First of all I must say that the screenplay is fantastic, it's very well written and despite the fact of the movie being a bit long-winded it still keeps the viewer interested all the way trough. It's exciting and includes great plot twists, having also some real depth in the whole background story. Emotions and feelings jump between happiness and sadness, having sympathy and hatred blended together with a really nice flow, although the flow sometimes not progressing as much as it should. It's just that sometimes it feels like the movie doesn't move towards, it just stops and stays there for a short period of time, which can be a bit irritating for some viewers. I guess those moments are there for building up the tension, but they could have been crafted out more carefully by considering the whole overall flow of the movie.The movie has some great characters in it and above all of them are the characters of Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna. These two characters who are played by such amazing actors are the characters which really make the movie what it is. Despite the movie having so much great characters some of them are sadly in need of some real depth, as those characters are sort of left out only as to be in minor roles, although they'd be important for the story itself. You really couldn't choose better actors for the roles of McCauley and Hanna, as they are played by the legendary actors Rober De Niro and Al Pacino, De Niro in the role of McCauley and Pacino in the role of Hanna. This is the reason why the role performances are what you expect them to be - Excellent. Other roles are played by such actors like Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore and also Dennis Haysbert and young Natalie Portman. Still, neither one of them reach on the same level as De Niro and Pacino. It's pretty obvious though. The movie also includes this superb scene between Pacino and De Niro, which is undeniably the best scene in the movie and probably one of the best tension-packed scenes in the history of movies. Although they just talk with each other it's still so exciting and it's pure candy for your eyes, as it is indeed a great pleasure to see such legendary actors working together in the same scene. By just the glance of their eyes De Niro and Pacino make a beautiful scene which couldn't be better in any way. Those who have seen the movie probably know what I'm talking about. Just superb.Directed by Michael Mann it sure has that tension his movies seem to have. To me the directing is pretty much flawless and it's what directing should be in thriller/detective movies, it has this certain style of showing things on the screen and leaving some of the questions for the viewer to answer. Cinematography compliments the whole thing by being also what you expect it to be in a detective movie, precise and detailed, followed by the astonishing music. Composed by Elliot Goldenthal, who I haven't honestly heard of before, it is perfect for the movie and fits so well with the main theme as well. Music is a crucial instrument when it comes to thrillers as it is supposed to be significant for the tension a thriller should have. I am glad to say the music manages itself brilliantly in 'Heat' All this; The directing, cinematography and the music makes 'Heat' an exciting thriller, each area compliments each other.'Heat' is a great movie but it could be better, as in the way it is now it's a bit too long and not so progressing it could be. The film is still definitely worth watching, especially for the thriller and Michael Mann fans, as those fans won't be disappointed. It's just that the progress sometimes gets so slow that it interferes with the flow. Well that may sound a bit too harsh, as it isn't actually so remarkable in the end, as you won't be left with a bad taste in your mouth after all. De Niro and Pacino are simply at their best and you just can't go wrong with them now can you? A great thriller which appeals to the feelings of the viewer surprisingly well by having also waterproof drama in it.",8,0,1,24 July 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The word 'laughter' will have a whole new meaning
","I'm not a fan of Monty Python and that is only because of one reason, I've never actually seen the series more than a couple of times, and neither one of the movies. Despite from that, I'm familiar with its humour and I do know how legendary it is in the history of comedy. I just saw 'Monthy Python and the Holy Grail' this night and I can't believe I've missed a masterpiece of a quality comedy. I mean, I haven't laughed that hard in ages, probably never that hard before this movie. It is so hilarious that you just can't stop laughing in certain parts of the movie and it is a definite celebration of comedy throughout, right from the beginning right to the end.I don't know where to start. When I've reviewed movies before, I've judged it by all the usual things; Directing, screenplay, role performances, cinematography and all that, but when it comes to this movie those categories can't be described with words, they just can't be described reasonably. I could always try, but I guess that just wouldn't make any sense. The movie's just so silly that simple rules of how movies are made don't apply. Stupid some may say, but I say it's just genius.Although I just mentioned above that this movie can't be reviewed like ordinary movies, I will try. Just for the fun of it. What comes to directing, well, it isn't something you pay attention to, as it just isn't even so important for the film itself. The things you see on the screen are the only things that matter. What comes to role performances, well, there actually aren't any actual 'performances'. Every actor is excellent and do what they are supposed to do, taking it slightly too far than it's meant to. I know, it's a bit tricky, but that's the purpose of it. An intelligent purpose that is.The screenplay is in this case very hard to judge, because you don't actually know if there exists an actual 'screenplay'. According to IMDb there is and no else than the Monty Python boys themselves have written it; Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Obviously they all are starring in the movie as well. There are two options when it comes to the screenplay: Either it's the longest damn script after the script of 'The Return of the King' ever written or then it's the shortest one. What I mean is that you just can't know if the scenes are improvised, because by judging what I saw, the whole movie could be improvised. There's just stuff in it which no other than the Monty Python boys could come up with, just brilliant. I'm not going to analyse the screenplay more specifically, because I don't want to give away any spoilers for those who haven't seen the movie yet. One thing is certain and it is that the movie's just mad in any imaginable way, it's so ridiculous it's beyond ridiculous and that is what makes it so damn good.'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is among the best (if not The Best) comedies I've ever laid my eyes on, it's a movie you can not describe with words, it's a movie you have to see with your own eyes. Your lungs's air capacity will empty, scene after a scene. Surely mine did. I'm recommending the movie for everyone, for the fans, for those who just like Monty Python and especially for those who haven't seen any Monty Python's before. Believe me, I immediately felt this huge filling in my knowing-of-comedy -gap, a must see film indeed.",9,0,1,6 May 2007
Braveheart," A legend standing on the mighty hill of perfection
","Is there anyone who wouldn't have seen this film? I like to think there isn't. If there actually is, then you've missed a masterpiece, you must go and watch the movie and see the excellence with your own eyes. This movie was a born legend when it came out and the soul of it will never die. A story about courage, love and freedom.I've seen this movie many times before and this night I watched it again, as I am the proud owner of the DVD. It's definitely in my personal Top 10 movies of all time -list. This movie's just perfect, honestly in any imaginable way. Mel Gibson's best role performance yet to date and also his best directing yet to date. Talking about the acting, this movie shines with amazing role performances from everyone who's in it. Mel Gibson as William Wallace the Braveheart himself, Patrick McGoohan as the mean evil king, Sophie Marceau as the princess whose desire of love makes her so likable, everyone in this movie performs their roles flawlessly, a real pleasure for the eyes indeed.This movie has one of the best soundtracks ever composed to a motion picture, composed by the all mighty James Horner. That legendary bagpipe music makes my skin tremble every time I hear it and it's just so beautiful and fantastic it almost makes you cry. It's used in the exactly right places, with its raises and lowerings, just superb.Not forgetting the battle scenes, which are among the best I've ever seen in a motion picture. They're just shot so realistically that your eyes freeze and you can't miss a second from them. From the emotional shoutings to weapons colliding together, from the Scottish bravery to the English strategies. The battle scenes are definitely not forced to be in the movie, they're also remarkable when it comes to the plot. Not just any fight scenes which would make the movie look like it's cooler, they really are in an important role. Just brilliant.The screenplay is very well written, which makes the whole story so excellent. Almost 3 hours of excellence go in a blink of an eye. From loosing a loved one to fighting against England for freedom and for the whole Scotland it just progresses itself in a brilliant way. The movie is also very emotional and touching, the ending is genius in its own way and after all I like to think that the movie ends in a happy way rather than a sad way.All in all, this movie is perfect, or at least for me. How courage is described through the screen is just one of the best ones I've ever seen, all the emotions connected to it just makes it so magnificent. How it is to fight for something you really desire, it's just shot in a perfect way. Mel Gibson's directing won't let you down, as all the scenes are significant for the film itself. It's just so odd I haven't got a single bad word about this movie, usually there is something, but in this case it's so far from any bad word. If you haven't seen this movie, just do it already and stop wasting your time reading my review. Do it.",10,3,5,26 April 2007
Gladiator," A massive epic, Ridley Scott's work of art - Simply a masterpiece
","'Gladiator' is, to me, one of the best films ever made, probably even in my personal Top 10 Movies of All Time -list. It's a massive epic motion picture that pleases your eyes and ears with effective visuality, drama, romance and more. The story tells about a Roman general Maximus who gets betrayed by an evil prince. By the acts of the prince, Maximus's family gets murdered and he wanders into sorrow where tears won't be spared. He then finds himself captured to become a gladiator among other slaves, but he still seeks for revenge. Maximus tries to keep himself alive in battles which he is forced into, only that he might someday take his revenge against the evil prince. The story has so much more in it, but I'll just leave the rest of it for the viewers, as I certainly do not want to give away any spoilers.Like I already said, the story is simply fantastic. It's so deep and touching, being very original at the same time. Despite of the movie being a massive epic one it still isn't clichÃ© at all, it just maintains the level of drama in a level that doesn't go over the top. It has a nice flow too and there is no boring scene in any part of the movie, every scene matters and every scene is significant in its own way, that's just how incredible the storytelling is. The building of the main character, the whole theme from victorious to sad, from sad to anger and from anger to a satisfying ending, everything goes like it's supposed to. The creation of the world has been achieved terrificly well; The sets, the dressing, all the details, basically everything. Although there was a lot of CGI used in the creation of the world, the CGI department deserves a big plus on making everything so believable and realistic. Everything looks smooth and soothing, just the way you want it to look like. You can't complain, really.What comes to role performances, well, in my opinion Russell Crowe does an absolutely phenomenal role performance as Maximus. The anger, the sorrow, all the expressions and body language, just great. I don't care if Crowe is an asshole in real life, because whatever they say in the press he still is an amazing actor. He has actually become one of my favourite actors because of his past role performances, he is just everything a director wants from an actor, performing every role flawlessly. He does have that sort of a rough appearance, but he can play a nice guy too. What comes to other role performances there is one more to mention; Joaquin Phoenix. To be honest, I've never liked Phoenix that much, don't know why, but I have to admit that he is too an amazing actor. As the evil prince Commodus he is that brilliant fierce himself again, a perfect actor for an evil role.This is by far Ridley Scott's best film yet to date and when Hans Zimmer's music is put on top of the cake you just can't go wrong with that. The directing is superb and the music is magnificent. Like mentioned above the directing consists of mixtures of genres; Drama, romance, adventure and action. Every department is handled in superior way, in a way that leaves your notebook blank on the side of the faults the movie would suffer from. The music has this main theme in it, which is beautifully composed, including that beauty and also thrill and intensity. 'Gladiator' is all in all a tremendous motion picture which everyone should see, a born legend some could say. Fantastic story, phenomenal role performance by the lead actor, superb directing and beautiful music; All this compile a film that I can't imagine to be a disappointment to anyone, a definite 9 out of 10.",9,3,5,15 August 2007
Donnie Darko," An excellent blend of Sci-Fi, Drama and Mystery
","I bought this movie on DVD like 2 months before I watched it. The reason why I didn't watch it was that I was expecting one of the most disturbing films ever, so I never wasn't really 'in the mood' so to speak. I wanted to see it, but it seemed like there never wasn't time for a movie like it. So one day I decided 'What the heck? I have to see it in some point anyways..' so I watched it with my brother and friend. Looking at the trailers, the reviews, the plot outlines and everything it had to be sick, right? Well, the disturbance level wasn't even near the level I personally was expecting. Honestly, it isn't even disturbing apart from a couple of scenes.The movie tells about what the title says, a teenager named Donnie Darko. Donnie may seem like an ordinary American guy, who lives with his family in a sleepy suburb. Nothing could be farther away from the truth; 18-year old Donnie has a large bunny rabbit named Frank as his imaginary friend, who inspires Donnie to do things which seem to be unreasonable. Frank saves Donnie's life when a huge aeroplane's engine falls in middle of the boy's room. Donnie 'investigates' the bizarre accident and finds out unbelievable things that lets him to manipulate the streams of time and space. Donnie travels through daring and secret paths, he tries to understand the chaotic, raging universe around him and he finally sees the truth; Even the smallest acts can have serious consequences.The film itself is a great blend of science fiction, mystery and drama. It cleverly leaps between the real world and the imaginary world, and it does it with such a credibility that the viewer won't get lost in any part of the movie, it stays in a tight package throughout. The screenplay is fantastic, it doesn't bother you with any unnecessary or pointless subplots or scenes, it stays in the main theme all the time and the end solution is just brilliant. Through the vision of Richard Kelly, who has written and directed the film, 'Donnie Darko' offers you an intensive and interesting movie experience, which can not be compared to any other films because it's also original and pretty unique in its own genre. Although the film is pretty dark and gloomy, it still doesn't affect you as much as you could imagine, as the story's just so interesting you'll get hooked to it and instead of thinking how dark the movie is you keep on thinking of the twists and turns, and how brilliant the movie itself is.Donnie is played by Jake Gyllenhaal who is outstanding in the role. Just like the leaping between the real world and the imaginary world in the story, also the character itself changes between these leaps which makes it pretty enjoyable to watch because of Gyllenhaal's strength on the screen. The character progresses really well too, as when we start off the movie the character is totally different in both of the 'worlds' but as we move along the character crafts into a person who's surprisingly similar in the real world and the imaginary one. There are good actors in other roles too, for example Maggie Gyllenhaal, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Katharine Ross, but they are left out in minor roles as the film concentrates on Donnie after all. These characters of the supporting actors do not have that depth like the main character does, but their purpose is in fact more like complimenting the character of Donnie, which is also pretty genius. Soundtrack is also marvellous; The music's composed by Michael Andrews and like the movie itself the music also mixes between soft and dark pieces of fine compositions. It's sometimes beautiful and it's sometimes really dark like the main theme, which works really well with the build-up of the film.'Donnie Darko' is definitely one to watch, but only if you're open minded with films or if you just happen to be a sci-fi addict. If you're expecting heavy disturbance like I was don't be fooled, as even when you get something disturbing it isn't nearly as disturbing as you could imagine, so don't let the plot outlines or trailers fool you. To me 'Donnie Darko' is all in all a great movie and at times it's pretty thrilling as well. It isn't sick or gross, it's a fine piece of film making which works really well in all of its styles, drama, mystery and sci-fi. Although it is a short film you should watch it when you really have the time for it, as it's just not one of those movies you can watch when ever you want to, it requires that certain mood which I was telling you about. Even when this is a movie which probably (and still) gets mixed opinions from really negative to really positive you should just see it yourself and make up your own mind. No-one's going to make it up for you anyways, so it's your decision.",8,2,6,18 September 2007
Goodfellas," A movie including amazing role performances and a brilliant story but sadly being a bit dull in places
","'Goodfellas' is Martin Scorsese's highest ranked movie over at IMDb. I had never seen it before 2 days ago and to be honest it wasn't what I expected it to be. Don't get me wrong, it is all in all a great movie, but like Scorsese's movies usually it's over-hyped. 'Goodfellas' is based on a true story and it tells a story about Henry Hill who grows up to be a gangster, a part of the mob. Along with his friends, other wiseguys Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, the movie tells about how organized the mafia really is and follows the rise and fall of Henry Hill from the beginning till the end.The movie progresses very well with the narration of Henry Hill, who's played by Ray Liotta. The narration's excellent and keeps the movie going in a good flow with it's precise use of words and witty sarcasm. I've never been so impressed of Liotta's performance than I was after this movie, he does his best role performance yet to date and does it by far. Liotta evolves the character so realistically, by emotions and doing the whole progress of the character's corruption in a so believable way. The role of Tommy DeVito is played by Joe Pesci who has always been enjoyable for me, he has that personal voice and essence which can't be compared to any actor. I've never seen Joe Pesci in such a serious role before and to me he did some fine job in it. He also does his best role performance yet to date. Then there's the mighty Robert De Niro, who plays the role of Jimmy Conway, and you can't go wrong with De Niro now can you? He is perfect for the role and to be honest the whole cast is chosen very specifically, each right actor/actress for the right role. Amazing role performances indeed.The screenplay is brilliant, the story in its wholeness is a real treat for you and that's one of the reasons why you can't miss this movie. Sadly, the movie suffers from one significant problem; It's too long and that is pretty much the only reason why it doesn't deserve a 10. The first hour goes very smoothly and things keep on going all the time, you don't get bored in any part. After that it kinda stops, I wouldn't say it's downhill after that but I'd say it just stops the whole smoothness and the flow. I hate to say this, but it does get slightly too boring, hence why I said it's too long. I feel so bad because of it as this would have been a perfect movie without it being too long. The second hour just isn't nearly as interesting as the first, a real shame indeed. What comes to direction, well it's Scorsese and to me it's pretty much as excellent as it can get. You just have to admire that style of his, being oddly joyful in parts where sadness should take place. The whole soundtrack is also very Martin Scorsese stylish, not including any beautiful compositions but some really groovy and great tracks, which also play an important role in the whole progress of the movie.'Goodfellas' is a great movie, but for me personally it was rather disappointing. Having an average rating of 8.7 at IMDb it should be amazing, shouldn't it? Maybe the slight disappointment is because of the movie being over-hyped, yeah, most certainly. Despite it being a slight disappointment for me it's still a definite recommendation for all of you who love great movies. You don't have to like mob movies in general, as this movie gives the whole mob thing some real depth in it, giving a realistic sort of an inside-look of it. It's not phenomenal, but it's definitely a great movie.",8,1,3,26 May 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Non-stop laughs after non-stop laughing.
","I just saw 'The Simpsons Movie' yesterday when I went to the cinemas. No matter how bad ratings and reviews it would have had I personally would have gone and see it anyways, as I have always loved the series. I've never really been a HUGE fan, but I'm one of those people who do not change the channel if Simpsons are on. I certainly don't want to give away any spoilers on the story, so I'll just leave my usual writing of the plot out, as in this case it's pretty crucial. All I can say about the plot is that it was a surprise to me how good it actually was and it certainly won't be a disappointment to any Simpsons fan there is.Before this movie was out I heard people saying how the series had ran out of jokes and the movie can't be that good either. Well, it would be pretty obvious if the series ran out of jokes, but to me that has never been the case. I actually like the newer Simpsons more than the older ones, so I'm again one of those people. I can agree with everyone when I say that when watching this movie it felt like watching a longer episode of the series, but what made it more movie -like was the transferring to the big screen. I especially loved the animation; Though there is also 3D animation used besides the usual 2D, it still had that same heart as we all know the Simpsons of. This movie was most definitely one of the best 'episodes' I've seen from the Simpsons. I guess the makers had lots of pressure on making a movie after the series had been on TV for 18 years and that is natural, but the way they have done it deserves an enormous appreciation as despite the pressure the makers have made a very successful from TV to a movie -translation. Probably the best we've ever seen.The humor. Oh my, the humor. I'm being as honest as I can when I say that I haven't laughed that hard in ages, as the movie is throughout non-stop laughing and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Actually, there were only like 2 - 4 parts in the movie where there was a 30 second - 1 minute period of some drama where you didn't laugh, and that is so little time that you just can't complain. I myself found those parts entertaining as well and they were also surprisingly serious which caused moments that made you relate to the Simpsons, just like any other family. Anyway, despite those moments it was indeed non-stop laughing. Unluckily, I just felt that I was sitting in the wrong audience as I felt like laughing at parts where no-one else was laughing. I can see no other reason than the rest of the audience 'not getting' the jokes, as there were also so much jokes only the Americans find funny. Or if you are a person who know about the current situation in the USA you'll be finding those jokes funny as well. There were also so much jokes, or more like hints I'd say, about the American politics nowadays which I found hilarious but the rest of the audience just didn't laugh and that to me was a disappointment. I didn't let it affect me so I continued to watch the movie without caring what the rest of the audience was laughing at or not.Getting back to the story I found it very entertaining. It was actually a little bit different than the episodes of the series, as there was a real message in it and I also found it heart warming in a way that I've never seen the Simpsons before. Comedies like these are really hard to make, as when having so much humor throughout it usually tends to get a bit repetitive and boring. The Simpsons had one advance on their side and that was the fan base that had been growing for 18 years. But that doesn't make the movie an easy thing to do though, as that also increases the pressure on the makers's shoulders. What I mean by the fan base is that people have got known the Simpsons over the years and the movie wouldn't probably be even that funny without the series, obviously. For example every time Homer was on screen you just sensed the atmosphere it caused in the audience and people were stand-by for laughing, just because it was Homer Simpson. The humor doesn't get repetitive or boring at any part, which is a real achievement, as how many movies are there where you can honestly laugh from the beginning till the end? Yeah, not so many.'The Simpsons Movie' does the impossible; By being a movie made from series it just doesn't disappoint you. Or at least I can't imagine it to be a disappointment to anyone. How many times you can honestly say that? Yeah, again, not so many. I don't care if I felt like watching a long episode of The Simpsons, as when laughing that hard throughout you can't really complain. It was an absolutely hilarious film, it makes history in the history of the comedy genre and it is a definite recommendation for every Simpsons fan there is. You don't see me giving 10's so much, but in this case I honestly have no other option. The movie is indeed as excellent and perfect as a comedy can pretty much get. Thanks for The Simpsons and thanks for the makers.",10,5,12,2 August 2007
