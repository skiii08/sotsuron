Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thus it begins....
","In a single word... Awesome!  Without giving any of the movie away for those few who might not have seen it yet, Episode I is right there with the other Star Wars movies.  In fact, this movie may actually answer some of the more trivial questions which fans might have been wondering about throughout the three first movies.  The story is very well put together and the special effects are simply out of this world.  I truly recommend this movie to all who enjoy action and sci-fi movies.May the force be with you!",10,0,0,21 May 1999
