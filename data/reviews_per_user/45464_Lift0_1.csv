The Ring," Splended!
","My first thought of it was that this is going to be a real horror classic! The colorsetting and object view on this film I think is magnificant. The sound got me even more scared. I got shudderings all the time. Exacly what an horror movie should present. I even thought that this movie hadn't any special effect's, but when i really came, it was superb. Though I thought the actors did not do a master-piece job but nearly.If you're going to watch this movie, have a good sound installed and turn it loud!I gave it 8/10.",8,0,0,22 February 2003
