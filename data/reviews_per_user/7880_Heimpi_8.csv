The Ring," A waste of time and money
","Please take your time to read this review, as it could save you from throwing your money away! As a fan of horror movies, I think I can safely say that The Ring was, frankly, one of the worst horror movies (or any movie really!) that I've seen in many years. Just when you think the horror movie cinema can't get any worse, it just did! This movie might have been all right if it turned out that the truth behind the killer videotape was a murderer of some sort (who is still alive, and not a ghost like Samara!) trying to get some kind of revenge on someone. But an evil little girl that died a few decades ago, was, frankly a stupid idea.This was not a horror movie, or even a scary movie, there are only loud noises and supernatural goings-on, which are cheap scares that are predictable. The scenes that were intended to be scary were too exaggerated right to the point where they stop being scary and caused people to laugh. It's amazing, what kind of things people will do to try and make a movie scary, only resulting in making it look stupid. People with the slightest common sense should not get scared by trash like this.Naomi Watts is a good actress and quite pretty too, so she shouldn't waste her time making movies like this. See her in King Kong instead. If you have nothing to do on a lazy Saturday afternoon and would like to waste your time and money, then The Ring may be for you.The movie also leaves hundreds of unanswered questions. Who exactly is this little girl? How did she come to exist? And why did she make a killer videotape in the first place? The ending that it ended up with did not even exist! Gore Verbinski has taken an, I admit it, rather interesting twist ending from the original Japanese film Ringu, and turned it into something empty and incomplete, that will never ever be complete again, not if they make a thousand ring movies. They should have just made them solve the mystery, and just leave it at that. There is no need to carry on. You will wait and wait to see what will happen next, and in the end, nothing will, and you will realise that you have been wasting two hours of something that does not have a point to it. Luckily David Zucker, who I personally think is a great director, was there with 2000's Scary Movie 3, to give it a somewhat satisfactory enough ending, even if it was mixed in with other similar horror movie genres. The Ring is basically insulting horror movies of the past, for example Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, that are worth seeing.A stupid plot like this can not possibly make a good movie, not even if they had made an interesting ending, (although that might have made it better), and I think that the directors should just give up trying to make a good movie because it just seems to be getting worse with each sequel.I understand that some of you might want to ignore this review and judge this movie for yourselves, but just take this advice from me: don't bother! Watch a decent horror film that is actually worth watching like Gothika instead, that has a satisfactory plot and ending.The only thing to praise about this film is that it has a promising beginning that might make you eager to continue watching (that actually results in nothing, of course!), and some interesting special effects, but it's all a rather pointless exercise.I hope I have saved some people their time and money! My rating: minus 500 out of 10, and that's still not low enough!",Null,1,4,27 May 2006
The Shining," OK-ish movie - brilliant directing and with a great actor, but the rest is rather disappointing
","Things I liked about this film: I give this movie 4/10 stars because the directing was brilliant, since it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, and also because Jack Nicholson is a very good actor and excellent with his role of Jack Torrance.Things I didn't like: But apart from that, this movie fails to impress me. I think that overall it was quite a ridiculous excuse for a horror film. Lots of parts made me laugh, for example the bathroom scene with the young woman turning into the old woman was quite stupid.This film was, I admit it, one of the scariest I have seen in a long time, but it just doesn't scare me quite as much as it might some other people who thought this was a better film.The movie overdid it with all the ghosts and blood and that sort of thing. And the little boy getting all these visions was another ridiculous aspect of this film. The only interesting part was the end, it's nice to see how they're trying to escape, and the ending was kind of satisfactory. They escaped and he died, so what had happened those years ago was reversed, let's say, but still I think it would have worked better if (I can't believe I'm saying this!) the movie had followed the Amityville Horror's example and made Jack go sane again once he left the hotel.The ending could have been improved by making Jack return to sanity again once he escaped from the hotel, and the spirits from the hotel were coming after the family or something like that. That would have worked much better and would have helped me to enjoy it more, but like I said, this film is not a good horror film and I do not enjoy thrillers with supernatural happenings involved in them. I much better prefer thrillers with actual murderers.So, all in all, I only recommend this film for people who would like to get pretty freaked out, but if you're not in that kind of mood, or if you're not in the mood to watch a supernatural thriller, then don't watch this film. If you don't get scared easily by movies, and are like me, who think that supernatural thrillers are all rather pointless and stupid, then The Shining is not for you. It's not a 'good' horror film, but if you do watch it, make sure you don't watch it alone!",Null,0,1,4 June 2006
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Utterly worthless
","'Salò' is vile, the most disgusting, repulsive and worthless thing I have ever seen, a literal pile of sh*t. I recommend that anyone who thinks this movie is 'art' should get their heads examined. That anyone can see anything in this 'film', if I can even call it that, of any value or artistic merit is shocking.Marquis de Sade was a sick and twisted individual, but it takes a pretty sick and twisted mind to make his work into a film. The director pretends that it has some kind of political connotations, and that also is shocking, a weak and lame excuse to justify his execrable pornography. All the film shows is the workings of a bunch of people sick and disturbed beyond all comprehension, and it took everything I had and didn't have to continue watching the despicable tortures to the end. There are films that are disgusting but compelling, others that are disgusting but watchable up to a point. This is almost unbearable from the first viewing. Yes, art can disgust us and shock us. But this, almost two hours of cinematic crap, with absolutely no 'deeper meaning' is the furthest removed thing from 'art' I have ever seen, and anyone who appreciates real art should certainly not appreciate this.To anyone who wants to watch this - certainly do so if you wish, and judge for yourselves. But just make sure you're not eating while doing so.",Null,4,11,15 August 2009
Psycho," There have been lots of Psychos, but only one immortal masterpiece
","This movie was by far the best horror movie I have ever seen in my life. I watched it for the first time a few months ago, and I got addicted to it and everything connected with it - I've even written some stories about it.Alfred Hitchcock is a genius and in this movie he does not fail to show it. This movie has so many deeper meanings, it's impossible to list them all. Some people even think that in the scene where Norman walks down the hill to greet Marion and even though it's raining he doesn't have his umbrella open, is a sign that Norman is impotent! Well, I don't know about that, but it's possible! I loved the twist at the end, and that smile...it's stuck in my mind. The movie has so much suspense it's amazing. It will keep you guessing right until the end. And you can really sympathise with Norman while watching it...it really makes you think that he's innocent. In fact, he seems very sweet to me.There is absolutely nothing bad about this film, and it is my all-time favourite film. Every person who likes watching a true classic horror film, this should be at the top of your list.Shot in glorious black and white, the cinematography, music and suspense in this film are all filmed to perfection. I'm shocked Hitch didn't get any awards for this amazing film.I saw the film in May, and I am now waiting with anticipation to read the novel! This movie is highly recommended, I am sure you will love it. Watch this before anything else!!! 11/10, but since this is not an option, I'll stick with ten! My all-time favourite film.Don't forget: there are lots of imitations of Psycho, but there's only one masterpiece! The only decent attempt to 'do a Hitchcock' has been Brian De Palma's 'Dressed To Kill,' which is decent, but no one will ever match The Master.",Null,0,1,29 May 2006
Rosemary's Baby," Awful
","Let me first start by saying that I am not a fan of Roman Polanski films. I find them all incredibly dull and very very strange. And this one was no better. The plot was absolutely ridiculous and the ending was horrible. A woman has a baby that turns out to be Satan...what kind of 'classic' horror film plot is this? Mia Farrow is a great actress, but eve she can't save this pathetic excuse for a psychological horror film. I don't care what others say about this film, but I hated it more than any of Polanski's films and it is most definitely not a classic in my eyes. It's all incredibly boring and I almost fell asleep twice while watching it. It was too long, and for the whole film you were just waiting for something more exciting to happen, but it didn't, just like it never does with any of Polanski's films.1/10 - don't waste your time.",Null,6,16,3 March 2007
Casino Royale," Good action film? Yes. Good Bond film? NO.
","This film was awful. Firstly, Daniel Craig is a pathetic Bond. In the end he was actually willing to resign for a girl. James Bond would NEVER do that. He would never fall in love, I know that for a fact. Secondly, there are no gadgets in the film either. I expected there to be many more. The movie also dragged on for way too long, and it didn't get any more interesting either. It was boring from the first second, and it stayed that way until the end. From the first five minutes I was already begging for it to finish.The story is extremely confusing and very difficult to follow, and the romance between Bond and Vesper seemed ridiculous because there was no chemistry between them at all. Daniel Craig is not the James Bond I know, he's an impostor. Blond, unattractive, and most importantly he's weak and screams when he's being tortured, he doesn't try to escape in an ingenious way. And he doesn't give a damn about how he wants his Martini! Casino Royale is a good action film in itself, but it is most definitely NOT a Bond film. If they hadn't tried to make it as one, it would have been great. It really is a shame. I really don't see what all the fuss about this film is about. I wouldn't waste my time or my money with this.",Null,27,52,30 April 2007
Signs," OK movie...good for a lazy Sunday afternoon
","I rented this movie a few weeks ago and I thought it was quite good. OK, so it was not the best of horror movies, I've seen much better, but it was still a good attempt.The suspense really builds up a lot towards the end while the aliens are getting closer, but one thing that was not so good about the movie was the ending. It was not quite so satisfactory as I had expected it to be. The only thing that happened was the father trying to save the boy who had asthma, and I don't think that was really enough. It was just sort of trying to show that God saved him or something like that, but the movie did not manage that very well, because technically it was not really God that saved him, and it just showed the family doing things to try and save him. That's what I think. Anyway, it was an OK movie because at least it has an ending! I think Signs is trying to ask you what kind of person we are, if you are a person who believes in God and miracles and things like that, or if you're the kind of person who believes that people just get lucky. I think the movie gives out that message in a pretty good way, and I congratulate Mr Shyamalan for that.Overall, it was an 'average' movie that is worth watching and quite enjoyable.5/10",Null,0,2,29 May 2006
The Sixth Sense," Mediocre and slightly unsatisfactory
","This movie was creepy and not as bad as some I have seen, but still it was far from what I call a 'good' horror movie. It was basically just about a boy who sees dead people, and the twist at the end was rather confusing.The actors are all a bit depressing, and maybe the movie is supposed to be like that or something, but M. Night Shyamalan has made much better movies than this, and I think the ghost scenes were all a little too exaggerated.This movie would have worked a lot better if it was a psychological thriller, not with supernatural events, like it could have turned out that Cole's condition might have had something to do with his mind, like he thinks that he is seeing dead people, or something like that, something similar to what Gothika is based on.This movie is OK to watch, and can get a little scary in places, but I still think it could have been a lot better without all these supernatural events actually being for real, it would have helped me to enjoy it a lot more, and the ending could have been a much better one, for example Malcolm helps Cole but realises that he's not actually dead and then gets reconciled with his wife or something. (I know this sounds confusing, but bear with me because I'm not a very good critic!). Anyway,I would like it if he talked with his wife at the end and then got reconciled with her, and it ended out that he's not dead. I would have liked that much better.OK - 4/10 stars but I've seen much better",Null,0,1,29 May 2006
