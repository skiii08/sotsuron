Blade Runner 2049," Disappointing Plot
","Watched it recently on HBO, and I must say this movie was a complete waste of my time. The original was so superior in so many ways, even the original directors cut version (without the voice over) blows these stale uninteresting characters away. Four stars for visuals and even that lacked the creative uniquiness of Syd Mead's original. ( The cars in this are a joke) Plus too bad the great Vangelis is gone. The sad attempt at replicating his score fell flat. I'd take a pass on this dog,",4,3,5,4 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Bombastic Disney Garbage!!!
","Come on, what the F happened to the Star Wars franchise? The whole film was an absolute disjointed mess... it has lost its shine, its spark, its wonder to reach out with our feelings, the fun of identifying with the characters but mostly the loss of the unique message that the Force was once more than just a weapon against the Dark Side. Instead the betrayal and misdirection lead to character assassination along with the obvious metaphorical references that have sadly become rather redundantly stale and overused. So is Disney to blame? Are they simply slapping any old thing together to fill their coffers with as much money as they can without any regard for the legacy they are destroying? Me thinks YES!",2,4,7,3 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," What Did You All Expect?
","I read many negative reviewers on here that refuse to get it. This movie was never meant for us super fans in the first place. When I saw A New Hope back in 1977, I knew that it had a limited life span that Hollywood would exploit and reboot after Lucas' brilliant original trilogy had finished. He knew that as well. In fact, it all went downhill for me after The Empire Strikes Back with Return of The Jedi getting a little too childish for my taste or was it really that I was I aging, maturing, while the story remained true for the intended target audience, the under 20 crowd? Yes, we grew up, and we expected Stars Wars to age & mature along with us. Well it hadn't and that was intentional. Now please, move on with your ridiculous ridicule that the plot was too similar to A New Hope, or the story had too many holes, or it wasn't true to George's vision. When you try and actually do better, then get back to me. Now for my review: Although I found it very visually entertaining, some of the performances were not very convincing. But I enjoyed the retro look very much, with the camera work nearly duplicating Gilbert Taylor's lighting and angles, the throw back watering hole bar scene, the cartoonish costumes, and seeing my favorite spaceship of all time, the MF. I find it very amusing that many naysayers missed a very important aspect. They complained about Ray, that how could this 'female' with no Jedi training defeat Kylo Ren? The reason that Ray could defeat Kylo Ren was that he intentionally wished it, so he telepathically showed her the way to The Force so that he would indeed be defeated by her.. an intentional plot hole like so many others to be answered in good time. Was it out of guilt for killing his father, which by the way, he didn't intend to do until the Light of the Sun was sucked dark... which prompted his sword, (granted, this scene was not properly directed) or was it part of an unknown Master plan? We'll see. Clearly JJ tried to do the impossible, to make everyone happy, from the studio bosses to the Super Fans, with whom he apparently failed, with one exception, me! But he nailed it with his TRUE intended audience once again, the more sophisticated yet still youthful elementary school kids all over the globe and that, my friends, is called good business.",7,5,15,28 September 2016
Alien: Covenant," File This One Under S for -hit
","Do you feel you have been taken for a fool? Well you have been. Did you expect the Alien script would mature along with you as you aged? Well you would be mistaken. Predictable?... hell yes. Visually stunning?... sure. Nausiatingly played out?... you bet... sadly Ridley clearly sold out his creative gift for the almighty cheap thrill buck. I personally wish to see vast forces of Aliens in an ALL OUT direct battle with the combined military forces of the nations of planet Earth... on EARTH! Bring back James Cameron if need be, he needs a break fron that Avatar thing that's never coming anyway. Four stars for the typical visuals.",4,1,2,4 March 2018
