The Blair Witch Project," One of the best horror films ever made!
","I saw The Blair Witch Project on the opening night, and like other people, i was expecting a huge anti-climax. I was so wrong! From the opening scene, i was absolute terrified. This film is a must see for all horror lovers. I just hope the makers don't ruin this classic movie by making a heap of crap sequels, like Scream.",9,1,2,30 October 1999
