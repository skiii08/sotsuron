Raiders of the Lost Ark," Badass
","Indiana Jones is the best movie character of all time. He has a whip, a revolver, a fedora, charismatic, looks like young Harrison Ford, has a leather jacket, AND fights Nazis? Wow",9,3,5,17 August 2019

There Will Be Blood," 120%
",Can you give a movie more than 10/10? If you can the rating shall go to none other than There Will Be Blood. It is a perfect movie in every sense of the word. The writing? Phenomenal! The cinematography? Superb! The directing? Unbeatable! The story? Incredible! The acting? The GREATEST I've ever seen! Paul Thomas Anderson's writing mixed with Daniel Day-Lewis' acting skills are super. His control and lack there of in this movie make it what it is today. Day-Lewis' best performance by far. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone I see and will forever! Almost nothing beats this movie!,10,2,2,6 April 2020

",An amazing performance by all actors. A great story. While watching keep in mind Willem Dafoe is Jesus and Tom Berenger is Judas,10,2,4,16 August 2019
The Deer Hunter," Perfect movie
",The Deer Hunter is a perfect movie about how war changes everyone. Things change mostly for the worse. Acting by Robert De Neiro is perfect (as always) and Christopher Walken in his most believable performance. Perfect.,10,3,6,17 August 2019
