Lucky Number Slevin," Fantastic twist filled thriller
","Don't listen to the butthurt movie snobs who have rated this moviely totally unfairly simply because it's borrowed some principles from other movies.This movie is fun, enthralling and keeps you guessing the whole way through. Give it a watch if you're not a jumped up movie nerd who would rather go seeking unfair criticism of a film than sit back and enjoy it.",9,0,0,3 March 2019
