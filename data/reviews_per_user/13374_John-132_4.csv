The Devil's Advocate," Entertaining Urban Fantasy
","I didn't expect to enjoy this film. Keanu Reeves is not the greatest actor on the planet and while Al Pacino may have been at one time, his choice of work has been a bit mixed of late. None the less, the pairing works and the fantasy/horror elements were nicely underplayed. The plot is relatively simple and is reminiscent of Wall Street in many ways, where an older city wise mentor advances and corrupts his young protege, but there are a couple of genuine surprises in there as well. The only real disappointment is in the final denouement where I was left with the feeling that American test screenings had resulted in some hasty revisions.",7,0,1,27 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," funny...very silly, very rude, but funny
","Much like it says in the title, its the TV show, but bigger longer and uncut. Oh yes and there are some excellent, sing a long songs that you definitely don't want to catch yourself singing on the bus.",6,2,4,20 September 1999
The Matrix," Excellent science fiction-action
","With special effects to rival Terminator 2 (better but with the same impact) and a plot that is intelligent, original and well told, 'The Matrix' could well be  the best Science Fiction movie of the year.(I haven't seen Star Wars Episode 1 yet...).The basic story is based on the concept of a world where everyone unwittingly shares a common 'virtual' reality and the attempts of a band of outsiders to disrupt/challenge the existing regime. The theme is far from new, obviously, going back to Brave New World, 1984 and a host of outsider 'heroes' struggling against a dystopian future.There are also some interesting sub-texts :- The ritualistic rite of passage to illumination, the nature of prophecy and perhaps the most searching question 'Is it better to live 'free' and in squalor or to experience a better seeming fantasy life ?'Unlike many effects driven science fiction movies, the acting, plot and dialogue are all top notch and I heartily recommend going to see this film.",8,0,0,15 June 1999
The Thin Red Line," Overlong and overblown. Very pretty in places.
","I'd read rave reviews of this film and unfortunately this led to an enormous sense of disappointment. Articles in the press have speculated about the whereabouts of Terence Malick over the last 20 years or so. He certainly hasn't been to the cinema. The film, while beautifully shot in places, was an exercise in self indulgence and cinematic excess. The pacing is certainly more reminiscent of Apocalypse Now than Saving Private Ryan. The plot (such as it exists) leaves the viewer detached and ultimately uninterested in the plight of the poorly sketched characters. While some may argue that the feeling of detachment echoes that of the participants, it is not good cinema. The film has three main sections, the first a long and rambling introduction to the characters and background. Given that this lasts for 45 minutes or so, it is surprising how little one knows or cares for either by the end of it. The second section deals with the 'action' of taking the hill and is the closest that the film comes to having a plot, characters or indeed anything of interest  to absorb the eyes and mind other than the scenery. Shot at times like a Kurosawa epic, but lacking that directors feel for emotion and drama, the action is played out by such anonymous characters that the effect is wasted. The third section of the film has a feeling of denouement, but lasts over an hour. This is the longest and most drawn out segment and occurring as it does after nearly 1hr 45 mins the effect was literally numbing, to the bum as much as to the mind.The final parallel between this artistic endeavour and the war it portrays was the relief felt by all parties when it was finally over.",2,0,0,20 March 1999
