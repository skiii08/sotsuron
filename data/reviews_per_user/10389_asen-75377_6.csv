Ford v Ferrari," We're lighter, we're faster, and if that doesn't work, then we're nastier
","One of the best sport drama movies I have ever seen. This movie is mainly about Le Mans racing of 1966 and the feud between Ford Motors and Ferrari. Christian Bale and Matt damon as Ken Miles, British race car driver and Carroll Shelby, American automobiles designer have done a perfect job respectively.
This movie is not only for racing fans. Casual movigoers also definitely would enjoy the movie. The thrills, emotions, love, passion are balanced equally. Overall this is a perfect crowd pleaser.
At last, great work done by sound department and the racing sequences were shot very nicely.",8,1,2,1 February 2020
The Irishman," I say it's dream come true for cinephiles
","Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is a magisterial mob epic...this movie is reflective more about greatness and losses. Finally Scorsese has brought the lost charm of gangster movies after so many years...but don't expect that this movie is treated with the same manner of Goodfellas..and the violence in this movie is not as extreme compared to his other movies in this genre, it's mainly focuses on the relation between Frank Sheeran and his boss Jimmy Hoffa..more like I say this is the ultimate gratitude to mob or gangster genre from the greatest living director with his competency.Robert De Niro gave his best performance in years..Pacino is electric, hope he will get his long deserved 2nd Oscar..Joe Pesci is real deal, he is not the desperado like in his other movies, in it he is sharp-witted quite sensible guy...when you see on these guys on screen you see the true power of art..The other cast members are also great.The film's first 30 or 40 minutes may be felt slow by some people but from when Hoffa kicks in, there is no turning back..The Irishman is the best movie of the year for me so far and 2019 is going to be one of the greatest years in movie history.",9,199,386,28 November 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A tribute to Hollywood from Mr. Tarantino
","I think this movie is pretty good...yeah it's not like his other movies..this is a beautiful comedy drama but it's slow paced..you have to keep patience to enjoy it fully.
The movie's main character Rick Dalton, who is a faded star are trying to connect with the new phase of Hollywood...now he got only typecast villian roles in tv series and movies and he also trying to adjust with the new Hollywood and the other side we got Cliff Booth,who is Rick Dalton's stuntman and a very close friend..and I like his story better than Rick's...and we also got Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, that time Roman Polanski's wife..she had a very little role in the film. Brad Pitt and Leonardo Caprio both are terrific..and Quentin as always his direction is great..and I loved it how he connectd the Hollywood with the Manson family to add some familiar Tarantino staff..
I love this movie..ah one point some people don't like Bruce Lee-Cliff Booth crossover thinks that it is a insult to the greatest Bruce Lee...I don't think that,I see the tribute Quentin gives to Bruce Lee with this funny scene with Booth..there is nothing disrespectful to Bruce Lee.
The actor playing Bruce Lee is amazing and I have a issue if I could see little more Pacino...ok that's it.",8,2,4,26 November 2019
1917," A Technical masterpiece and something new to the war genre
",1917 tells you the story of two soldiers who are assigned to race against time and deliver a message that will stop more than thousand soldiers from walking into a trap which may cause their lives..specially it shows you the journey of two soldiers through the enemy territory to their destination..and this movie totally made with one take..and you can always feel that you are also with these soldiers throughout this movie...all credit goes to Sir Roger Deakins and director Sam Mendes..I would like to give it one more star if there was little bit of more character development..though I will reconsider it..overall you should watch this movie...a visual and technical achievement in cinemas...oh the song near the end of this movie is just beautiful..love it.,8,0,1,14 March 2020
Marriage Story," Baumbach's best work till date...a perfect movie about divorce
","Marriage Story isn't necessarily a tragedy about a relationship; it's about the divorce and how it can poison whatever noble intentions the involved parties had about remaining amicable.This movie shows the struggle,pain and how the couples put themselves to their extremes when they go through a divorce..after all this movie is heart-rending but it also has a comedic touch. Noah Baumbach's Marriage story is a insightful and solicitous look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together.Scarlett Johansson gave her career best performance I think ..Adam Driver's performance is terrific and probably most notable,as he plays every card in his deck. His rendition of 'being alive' is movie's real standout moment...definitely the frontrunner along with Joaquin Phoenix for Best actor category in Oscars. The other supporting casts had also done a great job.Perfect movie of the year and definitely worthy of your time.",8,5,7,7 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," A good try to show the time 2nd WW from a kid's perspective
","Just like Life Is Beautiful this movie showed us 2nd WW time in a comical way...when Taika is the director you don't have to worry about the humor. The color and the cinematography of this movie are just brilliant ..Roman did a great job as the child who has Hitler as a imaginery friend and Taika as Hitler is superb..and obviously Sam Rockwell , whichever role he play done with the utmost perfection..such a brilliant actor..so, what I don't like then it is the 1st half of the movie...It is even for this type of movie feels very slow and the dialogues could be better...but the 2nd half is totally worth it..I say you should give it a try.",7,1,2,8 February 2020
