The Avengers," Amazing mix of heroes, nothing short of sublime
","Here is the movie they were preparing us for. 'Iron Man'. 'Captain America'. 'Thor'. This was where they would eventually go. And brother, it didn't disappoint. Joss Whedon's magnum opus boasts more stars than the paramount logo and more capable direction and a more taut script than most of the so-called 'superhero' movies made. The movie featured an interesting mix of Marvel heroes coming together as a team when the Earth is in crisis, to save the world. From a spectacular intro where Loki arrives unexpectedly at SHIELD hq to the brilliant final showdown, 'Avengers' is a thrill ride, never letting go. This is *the* summer blockbuster that people should be lining up to see. Lots of action, lots of thrills, superheroes and and a badass villain. Every scene of the film is dripping with homages to superhero fiction. The one liners are numerous and never seem forced. Iron man's quips are just as well timed as always. Enhancing the action and thrills is the soul of the film which lies in its subtle use of emotions. Joss Whedon has done a remarkable job in adding a huge wave of emotion that runs over the film. Iron man is the machine with a heart, who never shows it. the Hulk is the definition of all heart and no mind to control it. And most surprising of all, Black Widow comes with a beautifully nuanced performance. All hints of fear, love and hatred evident in her subtle reactions. Scarlett Johansson is a casting choice to be applauded, as is Mark Ruffalo since I now cannot imagine anyone doing better justice to the role. The only flaw I could think up was the Marvel universe as such. I don't understand why the X-men weren't considered for the Avengers program (legal rights to the characters issues). But the movie is a wonderful viewing experience and by all means, a treasure. Must see for the summer of 2012.",9,9,19,28 April 2012
