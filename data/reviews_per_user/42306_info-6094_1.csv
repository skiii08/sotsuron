"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," whats not to love...
","I ordered this movie soon after seeing it on TV and how glad I am I did so. I did not make the connection with 'superman', 'matrix' or even 'the time machine', being the actors other movies they have been in, but knowing so makes this even more special knowing how well they gave of themselves to make this believable. You can really feel yourself there going through their experiences. It's more than just a movie of two dragqueens and a transsexual, as it conveys 'three lives' intertwined through comedy, raw life and just pure love and respect for one another. The acting, plot,costumes, score and overall charm of this movie can't be overstated, and I just want to say for the record :Thanks to the entire cast for brightening my world.I went into the movie feeling myself just part of another day. Three friends take 'who' they really are on the road for the world to see and enjoy, and become better for the sharing. I came out of the movie somewhat sad because of the good memories it stirred up of days in the bars with people I knew then, but also with a renewed zest, reminding me that part of who I am is still here and doesn't want to be forgotten.In the end we are to take from this movie the age old philosophy of be yourself and be happy, amongst good friends and good times.I wholeheartedly accept and so should you ;-)",10,4,7,29 September 2005
