Blade Runner 2049," Tired of the Hollywood Hype Machine
","I made sure to re-watch the original the day before we saw 2049. I can't imagine how lost or uninterested an audience member must have been if they've never seen the first installment.I can write a review conveying how shockingly slow and dull this movie is, but it looks like there are plenty of review writers who have already done that. Yes, there are some occasional brilliant scenes and cutting edge sci-fi, but for the most part,'excruciating' is the word that comes to mind.For me, however, the real issue is I am tired of the hype machine. The last three movies I have seen in the cinema this year are Planet of the Apes, Logan Lucky, and Blade Runner. Each and every one was lavished with stellar reviews and praise from IMDb users, Metacritic reviews, and various magazines and websites. All three were terrible. I am sick and tired of the phony reviews and the complicit media trying to prop up the movie industry, and will now be much more skeptical before rushing to the cinema to spend my hard-earned money.",5,23,50,8 October 2017
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not that shocking, not that funny
","Rushed out to the cinema after hearing this is one of the most shocking, offensive, and hilarious movies ever made. I thought it was far less offensive than an average South Park rerun, and about as funny as a weak Seinfeld episode. Oh, it's a decent movie, but after having my expectations pegged that high, it was a HUGE letdown. I think this is perhaps the most over-hyped movie ever. I think I'm pretty unique in giving this movie a 7 - it seems like everyone either loves it or despises it, but the reality is it's just OK. Additionally, the movie has been so hyped, I felt like I was already familiar with every gag before it transpired. Decent movie, just wait for it to come out on video.",7,1,5,18 November 2006
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Magic...Gone, It Is
","Yes, these last two Star Wars installments have been moderately entertaining. How can they not be? They are practically duplicating the classics of the 1970s.But where is the magic? I'm not even a big Star Wars fan, but if I tried to recollect magical and memorable scenes and characters from the previous six movies off the top of my head, the list is endless:<ul><li>The Cantina - Yoda - Chewbacca - 'your powers are weak old man' - The Trash Compactor - 'Luke, I am your father' - The battle with Darth Maul - Jedi mind tricks - General Grevious - 'Arise, Lord Vader...'</li></ul>And I'm just getting warmed up.Can someone please cite one character, one line of dialogue, or one solitary moment from these last two movies that is noteworthy in the slightest (and is not a complete duplicate from the 1970s)?So there you have it. One of the greatest franchises in the history of cinema with all the money and movie-making resources on planet earth, and the best they have to offer is...what? A mildly snarky drone who vaguely resembles Sheldon Cooper? Anyway, you know you're going to go see it, so go. Pay your money, sit back and enjoy 1977 all over again. Just don't tell me there's any creativity or movie-making excellence at work here.",7,8,16,16 December 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," It was great, but....
","Yes, 'Into Darkness' was a very entertaining movie. But of course it was. When you have this terrific cast (including the menacing Cumberbatch), the directing talents of JJ Abrahms, the 'Star Trek' franchise at your disposal, and a $100 zillion budget, then you darn well better make a great movie.And the movie was great. It was visually superb, and this cast has achieved a riveting synergy among each other. But by the end, the genuine fan must have walked away slightly disappointed. The point of the first installment of the movie was a complete reboot of the franchise, meaning they can do anything plot-wise and character-wise. And yet, here we are reliving a Star Trek saga I feel like we've seen a hundred times.TOTAL SPOILERS AHEAD Who could not see the 'let's bring Kirk back to life with the super-duper blood' shtick coming? How many times do we have to watch a decimated Enterprise come crashing down upon a planet? Why do we even need to revamp Khan to begin with? Hasn't it been done enough? Oh well. Bottom line, pay your money, buy your popcorn and enjoy the impressive sci-fi scenery and superb performances.",7,1,6,26 May 2013
Thor: Ragnarok," It's Safe To Go Back In The Theater...
","In recent reviews, I've called attention to the fact that 2017 has been a pretty dismal year for movies. Recently, I've seen 'Planet of the Apes,' 'Logan Lucky,' and 'Blade Runner.' What do these three seemingly disparate movies have in common? They all received outstanding reviews across the board, and all three were TERRIBLE.I was certainly beginning to lose faith in this whole 'Hollywood' thing and this whole 'paying $40 for my family to watch a crappy movie when we could be home watching NETFLIX' thing. Fear not, movie-lovers. As usual, Marvel has delivered the goods.'Ragnarok' is the vehicle that will elevate Hemsworth from a star to a hyper-star. He is simply electrifying, and the movie is loads of fun. My only complaint is I wish they didn't use El Grande Verde in the marketing material. It would have been even better if his appearance was a complete surprise, which obviously it was not.Bottom line, Marvel is just running circles around the rest of Hollywood. If you have been burned by the appallingly lousy movies of 2017, set your fears aside and go see Ragnarok. You will love it.",9,11,22,6 November 2017
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Absolutely, Positively, the Most Underated Movie Ever Made
","Seven years ago I wrote a review of 'Dewey Cox' in which I gave it eight stars, and conceded it was probably not a movie for everyone. Since that time, I've had the opportunity to rewatch it numerous times, and with each viewing, I like this movie even more. Bottom line:THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. IT IS THE MOST UNDERRATED MOVIE EVER MADE.I can write a thousand words about why this movie is so good. The acting, the original songs, the humor, the unbelievable cast, the costumes, the cinematography, the creativity, etc. Everything looks so authentic, there are moments in which you genuinely forget you are NOT really watching historical footage from 1966, or watching a cheesy 1978 variety show. By the end, when viewing the 'Lifetime Achievement Award,' you may actually find yourself forgetting Dewey Cox is a fictional creation.A much more interesting discussion, however, is WHY DID THIS MOVIE BOMB? Why has it received so many poor reviews, and why has it been relegated to complete obscurity, when compared to its 'peers' such as Talladega Nights and Superbad? Let's toss out some theories:1. You really need to be a music fan to enjoy this movie at the level it's meant to be enjoyed, especially classic rock. You have to be able to appreciate the parodies of Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, Buddy Holly, the Beatles, George Jones, etc.
2. You really need to be familiar with Ray and Walk the Line to appreciate all the jokes.
3. As a Judd Apatow movie, this movie was probably primarily viewed in the theater by young people who couldn't appreciate all the Baby Boomer humor.
4. Face it, full-frontal dude nudity freaks people out.
5. Some people will find this movie too offensive, and too tasteless. They are pretty shameless with the 'Cox' double entendres. Additionally, some may feel they are crassly ridiculing Johnny Cash's tragedy, or Ray Charles' blindness.Bottom line, never has pop culture been so thoroughly skewered in such a creative, hilarious fashion. John C. Reilly gives what very well might be the greatest comedic performance OF ALL TIME.THE RIGHT KID LIVED!",10,2,2,17 October 2011
The Dark Knight," One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made
","I imagine one of the last things in the world IMDb needs is another Dark Knight user review, but I can't help myself. Every time I am channel surfing and come across it, I'm overwhelmed by how good this movie is.I am genuinely surprised by how many detractors this movie has. It is utterly fantastic. It's important to approach it with the right perspective. This is a SUPER HERO FANTASY FILM! You can sit here all day and talk about how stupid it is no one can recognize Bruce Wayne, and how implausible the Jokers' mega-crimes are and how ridiculous Batman's Hong Kong extraction was, but then you are missing the joy. In reality there are no bullet-proof flying do-gooders from other planets in big red capes, and there are no hapless kids swinging through the air after being bit by radioactive spiders. Similarly, you have to dispense with a certain amount of credulity to love the Batman saga.I can't imagine what else needs to be said about Heath Ledger's Joker, but yes, he is that good. My only complaint about the movie is there is so much content and action here they could have easily added 20 minutes of filler fluff and made 2 separate movies out of it (hardly a legitimate complaint however). One of the all-time greats.",10,3,6,22 February 2012
Alice in Wonderland," If you've seen the preview trailer....
","If you've seen the trailer then you know Johnny Depp looks really cool as the Hatter. You know that the Red Queen has a big funny head and likes to say 'off with his head!' a whole lot. And then.........ummmm....well, that's about the entire movie. It's just a very mediocre, run-of-the-mill fantasy yarn that disappoints on many levels. I think everyone expected quite a bit from Tim Burton, but I was left pretty empty. The movie was so bland and uninteresting that I'm having difficulty writing a decent 10-line review. It all just struck me as a lame 'Narnia' knock-off. Definitely one of Tim's most forgettable efforts.",6,2,7,7 March 2010
Beauty and the Beast," Pretty Tough to Assign a Grade
","Let's stipulate to the fact that the animated version of Beauty and the Beast (and subsequent live musical productions)are absolute masterpieces. Beauty and the Beast may just be the greatest musical of all time.So, let's also stipulate to the fact that the 2017 movie production is also pretty good. You can't take an established masterpiece, apply a Disney-sized budget and an all-star cast, and come out with a bad movie. The question is, did they come away with a great movie? Mmm...not really.Is there anything about this extravagant production that improved upon the animated version? Well, there's new songs that are...um...pretty weak. There's the new version of LeFou, and he's umm...umm...there's the reimagined Maurice who is terribly miscast, drab, and lifeless. There's the new, not-especially-appealing, time-travel Paris schtick. And umm...did we mention LeFou loves Gaston? Amazing, huh?So there you have it. It's live-action Beauty and the Beast on the big screen. It frequently looks wonderful, it's got the great songs that you love, Lumiere is terrific, but a great movie? There must be more than this provincial life.",7,0,5,19 March 2017
Despicable Me," Pretty Weak
","The problem with animated family fare is the bar is set very high by cable TV. There is a ton of great humorous animated shows out there--Penguins of Madagascar, Phineas and Ferb, Fairly Odd Parents, Dexter's Lab, Powerpuff Girls, SpongeBob...just to name a few. Additionally, Pixar can do no wrong. So when Hollywood invites America's families to drop $40 at the multiplex to watch a cartoon, they'd better bring it strong, and in my opinion, Despicable Me didn't deliver. Yes, it was mildly entertaining and the audience seemed to enjoy it, but overall it just kind of bored me. Like so many movies nowadays, it seems like we've already seen every funny bit in the previews. What bothered me the most however is absolutely EVERYTHING in this movie seems to be derived from something else or is a cheap imitation. Dr Gru talks like the kid from Dexters Lab and looks like Monty Burns. His nemesis looks like Dexter's nemesis Mandark. The minions all sound like Wall-E. So bottom line, you and your family won't storm out of the theater and demand your money back, but you would probably find more innovative animated humor at home on your TV.",5,21,46,18 July 2010
Black Panther," Plenty to Like, Plenty to Dislike
","Like most movies, there are plenty of things to like about Black Panther, and plenty of things to dislike.LIKE:
1. It's Marvel. Even a middling MCU venture is still worth the price of admission.
2. It looks sensational. Everything just looked really, really cool. The city, the technology, the natural splendor, the costumes, etc. Very, very cool.
3. It's something different. Basing a movie and a superhero franchise in Africa is refreshingly different.
4. Little sister. The 'Q' of Black Panther. Tough not to love her.
5. Angela Basset is as lovely as ever. Lead actor was terrific.
6. Pretty good plot twist.DISLIKE:
1. I fear this whole superhero genre is starting to reach the end of its tether. All of the story elements are just starting to feel a little stale.
2. Although very good, Black Panther is nowhere near as good as X-Men, Avengers, Ragnarok, Spider-Man, and almost any other MCU production.
3. It seemed like it was pretty difficult to break away from the tentacles of The Lion King. It was really tough not to be thinking about it though the movie.
4. The racial elements seemed a little heavy-handed and clumsy.
5. I think I'm getting Forrest Whitaker fatigue.
6. These superhero flicks really need to reevaluate what a climactic fight scene is supposed to be. I was getting bored out of my mind during the last twenty minutes.
7. The opening weekend hype was pretty ridiculous.Overall though, another trophy on Marvel's overflowing, jam-packed shelf. Go see it, if and when you have the time. Just bear in mind it's nowhere as good as the public was led to believe.",7,45,98,18 February 2018
Spectre," Stunned by the Good Reviews
","I am absolutely stunned by how good the professional and IMDb user reviews are for this movie. This was absolutely the worst offering of the Daniel Craig quartet of Bond movies, and it is a serious contender for the worst Bond movie in 50 years.Believe me, I love the franchise. I think Craig is easily the best Bond ever. I thought Casino Royale wasn't just the best Bond movie of all time -- I thought it was one of the 25 best movies ever made. I even liked Quantum, and thought it was unfairly disparaged.But this? Holy crap, they are just mailing it in. I could write 3 pages about how every scene, every interaction, every plot development, every character....EVERYTHING is just forced, contrived, insincere, uninteresting, poorly thought out, rushed, underdeveloped and just lame. Nothing is funny, nothing is romantic, nothing is convincing. I was intensely bored by the second half of the movie, and by the end the plot was so pathetic I felt like I was watching Austin Powers.In the end it still gets 5 stars because Daniel Craig is the best Bond and the Mexico City opening is pretty good. But wow, just wow. It is unbelievable this is the same franchise that brought Casino Royale to the world.",3,6,13,8 November 2015
Draft Day," Great Concept, Should Have Been Better
","Few things hold quite as much fascination for Americans than the NFL, and rightfully so. The competition, the athleticism, the violence, the personalities, the glamor, the rags to riches, the emotions, the obscene money at stake...well. It is an amazing world. And all of the extremes of this world are borne out on one day like no other...draft day.As such, the NFL draft is such a powerful premise for a movie, it should have been quite easy to crank out a terrific story. Draft Day had the right idea and the right set-up: A desperate team led by a desperate GM, a needy, demanding owner, a head coach and GM who hate each other, angry fans screaming for change, top-talent players with their own agents and agendas, dirt-digging private investigators evaluating every inch of a player's life, and franchise-shattering, blockbuster trades on the table.Wow. The movie should have blown us out of our seats, but just didn't quite deliver. One part 'MoneyBall' and one part 'Any Given Sunday', the recipe was terrific, but the execution was flawed. The fatal flaw in my opinion is the trades executed and the conduct of the GMs were just too implausible to be believed. Minor tweaks to the storyline could have paid huge dividends.All in all an enjoyable movie that borders on a big fat advertisement for the NFL. Definitely worth seeing, but definitely could have been so much better.",7,2,5,18 April 2014
