Casablanca," Rick Blaine - eternal hero
","Casablanca... This picture really is one of the greatest of all time. I was blown away the first time I saw Casablanca. I felt so good after watching it, I almost couldn't believe it... In deed, no other great movie made me feel the way Casablanca did. The power of each and every emotion through this film is simply amazing. Since then, I saw this masterpiece five or six times and every time I watched it, whether alone or with friends, I found something new, something different, something great... The brilliance of Casablanca is undisputed, and the Humprey Bogart's character, Rick Blaine -- the greatest ever. I mean, to do what he did... It's unbelievable! He is a definition of a great man. A man in love. Think about the person you love the most for a second, and imagine yourself in that particular situation. What would you do?",10,1,2,7 January 2014
