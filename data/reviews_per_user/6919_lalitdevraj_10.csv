The Avengers," The Avengers is worth it!
","Where to begin?! The Avengers is where multiple superheroes come together to go against one force. From a fan's point of view, the movie hit the spot especially considering that there were references to events which occurred in comic books which were not previously filmed. From my point of view, a non-fanatic yet sucked into the hype,I had the inclination to watch those movies, which I hadn't watched yet, with the superheroes in the Avengers and trust me it was worth it! Apart from the fact that a viewer would not know a particular superhero's past, there is a minute back story which is worth noting from the previous movies so as to feel at ease with the continuation of the story which is seen in The Avengers.Casting was appropriate as most were from the previous films but even roles such as the one which Cobie Smulders (some of you may know her as Robin from 'How I Met Your Mother') played, though small, were significant. Screenplay cannot be argued and the fact that this movie had a USP of 3D motion picture, the effect changed the experience.Action is dominant in this film but with numerous combinations of enemies, as not all fights are against 'the bad guy' in particular, it is exciting as well as interesting with the question of not only who is going to win, but how? Comedy, interestingly, was present, I feel mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. but others were important factors.This movie was not very dialogue-heavy but more straight to the point. Script-wise, the dialogues were indeed effective as well as pulsating for the the viewer.With an approx 2hr 30min running time, there are hardly any parts which one would find unnecessary and although it may appear as a one-time-watch there are particular scenes which really make you look for them on Youtube and such.With bursts of excitement at random intervals and sometimes loads of adrenaline in more than just a couple of scenes, The Avengers took me by surprise, and I hope it does the same to you.P.S. I saw the ranking being extremely high, an 8.9 on IMDb, before viewing it and now I can see why it was so high.",9,2,6,27 April 2012
Men in Black 3," A well structured movie but depends on how you look at it
","Being a 17 year old, I watched the first two MIBs when I was quite young. I'm a Will Smith fan, but I still didn't watch the first two immediately prior to this one hence I had these Deja vu moments whilst observing, for example,the 'neuralizer' and certain other specific aspects specific to the Men in Black series.I rate this an 8 primarily because of the structure of a 'proper' movie. Although it may not be a direct sequel,it was quite well knit with the MIB back story and the basic background of the whole trilogy (not that there will not be any other MIB, but let's see).I missed Will Smith as I was watching the movie. He reminded me of the Will Smith I was acquainted to when I was young, characteristics that most of his new work does not explicitly express.MIB 3 was definitely better than I expected. There was flow as mentioned implicitly before. Dialogue heavy at times, it makes one wonder 'Why?' but it does make the whole atmosphere of the scene more profound.Casting wise, the original lead cast members were intact (which in my view was a definite USP for the movie). The casting in general permitted a fluid experience hence it is redundant to say 'it could've been better' as this is not exactly the case. The script was interesting with certain ways of making the audience try to understand what a character was saying which only made the experience a better one. Mind you, MIB 3 does not make one think too hard whilst watching the movie, but intrigues one really.The 3D viewing, honestly, wasn't a big point to stress on. Yes, one or two scenes of course make it worthwhile, but with a 1 hour and 40 minutes duration, I highly doubt that two and a half minutes of screen time which utilized the 3D effect to it's potential is worth skipping the opportunity of a 2D viewing to wait for a 3D one.Two words: Time Travel. The concept, new or old, does obviously impact the story a significant amount. To revolve about this concept may not appeal to some but hey, it all depends on you.The movie does have it's moments but not a surplus amount like in 'Harry Potter 7 Part 2' or 'The Avengers' for example. In other words, MIB 3 does not appear to try that hard, which in reality, only helped give the movie a serene atmosphere, and again I stress, one that flowed smoothly.Ultimately, I recommend this movie, and if some of you are wondering, no you do not need to watch the first two to understand this, but it definitely helps. Worth a watch, maybe two if you're that big of a fan. I would not watch it twice immediately but that's just me.Interestingly, I want to watch the first two now! 8/10 suggests that it's worth it,so have fun! If you watched it already, hope you liked this review!",8,4,14,25 May 2012
Sucker Punch," Drawn between good or bad
","This was movie was a doozy to rate as I was in a fix as to which aspects offered the stars. Yes, there was a grand effort to make a USP of this movie the titillation factor given by the actresses. With a different way of capturing the story expressed, this movie excelled in being unique. The efficacy of graphics and action sequences would have made this movie an excellent one except the unfortunate aspect of- women. To be clear, it is not because the women are participating in the action, but rather are dressed as they are and attack as they do. One borders along the line of wondering whether to be 'turned on' or enjoy the action. Indeed, for those who cherish a woman who can fight, this movie is on to adore, but for people more of my liking this was a blunder. Suckerpunch offers a new way of looking at a story, but confuses the viewer on many levels. Although it may be apparent what is being headed towards, this movie strikes up many questions, for example, why are we watching this/ what is the message trying to be expressed/ what can be learned? Note: It is not that movies cannot be meant for time-pass, but it feels very different to most movies. Watch it if you must, but do not except to be mind-blown as more of a journey is considered as opposed to twists and turns along a straight path to the climax like most movies.",4,1,4,8 February 2012
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Not a Twilight fan, but I didn't hate it.
","As I am not an aficionado of this series, I feel there would be lesser bias in terms of judging this movie. I feel that this movie was rather interesting due to the twist and turns expressed in decent fashion on screen. The effects were above par, and make up for particular scenes above expectations. Screenplay was fine and the casting has pretty much remained stable due to the same characters being portrayed within a series.The beginning was ridiculous. No offense Twilight fans but indeed the initial 30 minute wedding scene + sex scene did not need to be so extended in detail, bland chatter, and overall boredom. The reason this cinema still achieves a 5 out of 10 is because the action sequences and flow were good such that by the end, with the build up and all, it felt as if I wanted to watch the second half as opposed to merely blowing off the idea of watching it. The casting since it is fixed and cannot be altered is a point to bear with as honestly two of the leads do not appear to fit the character profile other than the physical rendition. Taylor Lautner is an actor who, physically, achieved success for the role and as per the acting part, he is better than the other two, but unfortunately does not have much screen time, comparatively.Overall, this movie did not strike me as one that is a must to be watched, but yes, the Twilight fans out there would not bypass this opportunity hence it is almost redundant to say this as most either hate/like/don't care/are too old to consider watching this movie.",5,1,7,9 February 2012
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Crazy Stupid Love, thats what it is
","Funny and intriguing at the same time is what I have to say about this movie. It's interesting to see how dots connect in a different field of our society, where a younger person teaches a middle aged man how to discover something he is not familiar with.Definitely a thumbs up for the comedy which although not always 'laugh out loud' type comedy, but definitely puts a smug grin on your face. The screenplay was vivid with no sense of interruption with aspects diverting away from the point of the story. One is glued really to the screen as it curiosity is raised as to what happens next.Casting for the roles could not have been better. With Ryan Gosling playing a more jocund character than normal and Steve Carell being himself, the combination is ecstatic.This movie cannot be missed for those comedy aficionados and neither for the fans of these two stars. To put it a better way: This movie cannot be missed unless your looking for a horror movie concept to lurk into this movie!",8,1,2,10 February 2012
"I Love You, Man"," Truly a movie to be watched
","Whether this type of story may be a possibility or not the fact is that this movie is simple yet highly gripping. Casting for the main lead, a part from Jason Segel, could have been better but as per expression of the story with what casting was made, the story was beautifully iterated. Screenplay was great for this type of movie. Interestingly due to the fact of this movie not being a more comedy oriented flick with the inclusion of a 'rom com' type of genre inculcated, it easily appeals to the whole target audience above the age of 17.An important factor is the variation in role given to Jason Segel for those who watch How I Met your Mother. True, he plays a comic role but the difference is that with the addition of language which one has not seen him say before and the extended liberty present for this character to be played, Jason Segel grasps the opportunity and performs well.Overall, this movie, yes, can be missed, but definitely if your bored, a movie fanatic, Jason Segel fan, genre of comedy fan, or any other relevant group, this is a movie which would not only entertain you because although one may not remember particular aspects of the movie, a feeling of content is experienced, which is by far a highly regarded feeling to have after the viewing of a movie.",8,0,0,8 February 2012
Forrest Gump," Better than I expected
","Forrest Gump was one of those movies which I thought would be 'alright', but turned out to be better than that. The role Tom Hanks plays and how he does justice to the character is impressive. Throughout a multitude of scenarios, the story of Forrest Gump truly keeps one entertained if not excited about what will happen next. Interestingly, a rather long movie, it did not make me feel 'When will this get over?'. Not that I always ask this rhetoric question, mind you, but overall time passes without consideration of a break.With rather random occurrences, it is quite instigating to the viewer what is going to happen next. By not out of the blue but a frenzy of events which are not to be thought would happen in that chronological manner, this movie not only surprises but changes viewpoints. It delves with multiple issue, no matter how discreet and implicated.Generally, the genre of this movie applies to me but to see these genres posed like this truly enlightened me and rather than judging it harshly, made me reconsider to what extents the listed genres may apply to all cinema.",8,0,0,9 February 2012
21 Jump Street," Didn't expect that!
","Honestly, it wasn't like most high school related comedy flicks. Definitely struck a chord with me after watching the string of American Pies and random similar movies such as The Inbetweeners. The thing is, this movie really was well structured unlike most others of this specific genre within comedy.Before this movie I never really heard about Channing Tatum and after watching it, it is fixed in my mind that he is an intriguing actor. Although he may apply commonplace techniques, there is an aura which he creates as a part of his role which makes one feel glad and at times feel like they can't hold in their laughter, no matter how stupid or not he acts.My personal view is that without Ice Cube being in the role that he was in, this movie's flair wouldn't have been as grand. His role, though of less screen time, definitely impacts the movie in a large way.Coming to the aforementioned structure, there weren't as many random events which occur so spontaneously as other high-school based comedies. That being said, there was a decent flow of chronology and not too much of 'I can't believe that simple thing led to this huge situation'. Although this review may not justify an 8, I honestly had a good time watching the movie as opposed to having more than needed time to analyze peripheral matter in the movie, which a good sign in this context.In general, this movie offers one a good time, a good laugh, and a good reason to feel content. The story being particularly different appealed to me, which is something one may want to remember whilst watching.",8,0,2,29 April 2012
The Shawshank Redemption," What a movie
","Having not read the book initially, this movie blew me away. With such intricacy to detail and screenplay which kept the viewer gripped The Shawshank Redemption was one movie which ranks as most appealing to me.The whole time I, as a viewer, did not expect that the ending was going to be like that, to that extent. The acting was indeed superb and the way of expressing the changes in character and settings was impeccable.To reiterate to an audience what was occurring inside of the jail, and to depict changes in emotions and feeling with such clarity definitely justifies that the director of this movie was more than the average one in Hollywood.1994, 18 years ago, was when this movie was made but to the level to which it takes one is truly outstanding. One is absorbed by it, and there is no confusion about what is happening but rather thoughts in the viewers' minds about 'What is gonna happen next?' These thoughts are present when watching a horror/ thriller movie for the most part, but for aficionados of different genres to all like this movie proves that this was one heck of a movie.Cannot miss this movie; it is one that makes one think, learn, and be entertained simultaneously.",8,0,1,10 February 2012
Fast Five," A shouldn't miss for 'Fast and the Furious' fans!
","Honestly, this is the third 'Fast and the Furious' movie I have seen but by far was this the best one! With an amalgamation of genres, this movie would possibly appeal to all types of viewers except those who love ROM-COMs! I loved how everyone came together to do the job; the same people I loved in the movies which I saw together made my day as there was so much to relate to! Not much racing as the others, but what is there truly keeps you glued to your seat. Screenplay was interesting, locations eye-catching and casting, already stated! It's one of those movies which you like a lot while watching it and then later think about what happened within it at random times. Yes, you may not want to give it a second view immediately or even soon after, but you just may replay those highlighted scenes, for example, when Vin Diesel and 'The Rock' face off. That fight was intense and boy, was it gripping!Overall, an enjoyable movie but the 9-10 band cannot include this movie. Why? You'll agree with your own reasons after you watch it. Simply a great movie, but great to that extent, not really.",8,13,15,2 February 2012
