Skyfall," Best Bond ever, Worst Bond ever, everyone's an expert!
","Best Bond ever worst Bond ever dull and boring exciting poor direction great direction, everyone seems to be an expert on how to make a James Bond film! First time I watched Skyfall I loved it but there was a sense of disappointment at the end but I didn't know why? Second time was better I picked up on bits I had missed first time but still that sense of, have just been to see it for a third time not something I would normally do no matter how much I enjoy a film but Skyfall really is that repeatable, this time I realised why I had a sense of disappointment the truth is this film is that good I just didn't want it to end it was as though there was more to come even though it had a definitive ending. Third viewing again I picked up on things I had missed previous, watch and listen carefully everything really is tied up nicely. The appearance of the DB5 makes no sense whatsoever when you think about it but it is actually one of the great moments of any Bond film and a brilliant turning point in this film each viewing the audience got very excited at this scene which set us up for what is a cracking showdown in the Scottish Highlands. Skyfall is a credit to the people who do know how to make a Bond film, definitely something a bit different from what's gone before but surly this can only be a good thing? I won't be seeing it a fourth time at the cinema but I was left wanting more and can only hope we don't have to wait too long for James Bond to Return.",10,4,13,14 November 2012
