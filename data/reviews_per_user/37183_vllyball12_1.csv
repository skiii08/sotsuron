The Legend of Bagger Vance," A Classic for Today's Generation
","I'm not the biggest golf fan or even a player to begin with, but this movie is one of my all-time favorite movies made within my lifetime. Robert Redford's charming take on the movie is absolutely perfect. The cast plays some of their best roles yet and the story line is terrific. This movie beautifully portrays a lost era in film making. Attention to detail can be noticed in every beautiful scene that jumps out at you. And unlike many movies that are made today that tell a story that took place a long time ago, the story remains classic and timeless as the 1930s and never once does a character fall out of role. Superb!!!",9,0,1,22 December 2001
