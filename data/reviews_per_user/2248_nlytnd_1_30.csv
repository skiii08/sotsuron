The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Not a Set Movie - The 3rd Book is Just Extremely Boring, the 2nd Part Will Be Equally Dull
","The movie does as good of a job as it possibly could have, given the material it had to work with from the 3rd book. To break it down to the non book readers, the 2nd part of the 3rd book is even more dull, so get ready. It's just really bad material and it was a painful book to get through. Most people didn't like the 3rd book and those that did are kidding themselves. Prior to the 2nd movie being released, I knew it was going to be a really good movie because the 2nd book had a really entertaining story line. This movie on the other hand had a 0% chance of being good and to score a 6 is actually an awesome achievement...awesome job with the movie! The production crew had a really tough decision. Do you break from the 3rd book since it is soo bad or do you keep the book Nazis happy? They let everyone know after Catching Fire that they would stay true to the book (based on their demeanor and response I say they weren't thrilled about it). The only way this 3rd move stood a chance is if they spent at least 1/3 of the movie going into the back story of Haymitch. It was understandably something that had to be cut out of the 2nd movie, due to both budget and time. Basically, as Katniss and Petah are preparing for the 75th Hunger Games they watch/study several of the previous Hunger Games, including Haymitch's. They watch his interviews and how he won etc. This would require a new Hunger Game Arena etc., but the 3rd book doesn't have a whole lot of entertaining material and they split it into two parts, so the Haymitch idea would have filled half of this first part perfectly. That would still leave 3 hours to cover the 3rd book which is more then enough. I can't even begin to imagine how they are going to fill the time for the 2nd part. I mean there is very little tangible material that I can even think of except for the end.",6,3,6,4 July 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Beginning of the Greatest Disappointment in the History of Cinema (Prequel 1-3)!
","So you have the largest franchise of all time and you have at least 10 years to come up with 3 prequels with an infinite budget that are guaranteed to make multi billion's of dollars. I guarantee you that Lucas allowed 0 input from anyone. There's no way that anyone would go along with the elementary level dialogue that Lucas wrote... I mean it's really embarrassing (especially in part 2). Like I said, you're essentially making a movie with an infinite budget that can go no wrong. Could he have at least got a writing crew together to hash out the dialogue? The jackhole could still tell the story he wanted too and even select what dialogue/story worked best from the several writers that would come up with it. This was such a colossal failure! It really doesn't get worse then this. Taking the budget into account the 3 star wars prequels are the worst movies ever made and that's not a far fetched statement.",3,1,4,4 July 2015
War Dogs," Pleasantly Surprised! Very Entertaining!
","Not a huge explanation or anything, but I was surprised, although the movie is rated decent, I found it to be much more enjoyable than the ratings suggest.
Spoilers below
A slight critique. The wife used in the movie is way too hot. I'm down for hot chicks in movie roles, but that chick is supernaturally hot, thus giving it an unnecessary fake vibe. Don't get me wrong, I'll take fairy tale wife over something like Point break for instance where we have to pretend that Keanue Reeves is madly into this chick who is unbangable to the vast vast majority of the population.The info below is just ramble about the actual actions of those involved, rather than any critique's pertaining to the movie.
Aside from Efrain's insane lack of ethics (to say the least), the only thing slightly criminal was selling Chinese ammunition to the US government and disguising it as Albanian or Russian ammo. I theorize the US government was fine being in the dark as to the actual point of origin, but was forced to react when the man heading the workers in charge of repacking all the bullets got stiffed and outed them. I wouldn't be surprised if the US gov. organized it in the first place, however, since when is the government trying to cut down on spending, so who knows?I take these shows based on true events with a grain of salt, however all of the points that check out make this Effraim guy about as shady of a human being as one can get. Cutting the Albanian workers out of their money is biggest example as to just how bad of a person this Effraim dude is, but to cut your partner out of his 30% and to cut the dozens of workers who slaved to repackage the bullets for however many weeks over a measly 100k (allowing you to make several million more) is beyond criminal. It's one of the worst things I've ever observed. I would have still been pissed if he only ended up paying him the 100k, which was such an insanely low amount as it was, but to stiff the workers is such a shady act and to stiff the workers was so painfully stupid. Oye Vey!
So, the way the movie ends is a mixed bag. I liked that David Packouz didn't have to do jail time and that the sweedish dude paid him his cut in the end (in real life Effraim kept all of the profits and they added Packouz getting a payday). Anways, not really a review, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but the level of crooked by the Effraim dude I found a bit disturbing. I don't even find killers as disturbing.",9,0,2,22 November 2018
It," Wastes of lot of time on unnecessary/repetitive dialogue. Most of the humor falls sooooo flat!
","There were some things I liked about the movie, but I will just make mention of a couple things that sucked! 
Alright! We get it! Eddie is a hypochondriac! I don't understand why the movie dedicates 1/4 of it's total run time on dialogue and scenes related to Eddie being a hypochondriac.So, we already get a full dose of it while we're at Eddie's house. Now it cuts to them talking before coming up to the sewer/tunnel and the conversation is something along the lines of Eddie thinking every plant is poison ivy. The hypochondriac talk continues the entire time while they stand in the entrance and while some of the kids proceed a little ways into the tunnel (several minutes). I can't believe that they didn't catch this in the cutting room floor. Not only did they not catch it, the very next scene after they leave the tunnel cuts to them ridding their bikes and they have the balls to dub in more dialogue of Eddie being a hypocondriac. AT this point it's already soooo insanely old, but that's only the tip of the iceburgh. 
What were they thinking? Did they think this was humorous? Is performing a rendition of the same joke several dozen times funny? Which takes me to how unfunny this director must be. The movie utilizes Richie for most of the movies so called jokes. Early on Richie has a couple chuckle worthy one liners, but after that the jokes fall so insanely flat... they bomb so hard that they're cringe worthy. It's so bad that you would think that this movie was directed by a foreigner. If you're not familiar, humor almost always does not convert well when people learn a new language, then write jokes in that language regardless of how well they know that 2nd language. That's how most of the humor plays out in this movie.",6,1,1,2 February 2018
Wind River," Unoriginal Movie that becomes so silly it would make Rambo III cringe.
","The movie initially tricks us into thinking that it has a creative logical solution to it's premise, but as the movie unfolds we realize that we've been bamboozled. It's as if they had the premise for the movie, then they handed the baton to Tommy Wiseau to finish writing the script.There are so many amateurish aspects to this movie I couldn't begin to bullet point them all, but below are a few that come to mind.Did you know that in really cold temperatures you can have a prolonged conversation, but if you run for approx 50 meters your lungs will explode? Now I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and pretend that it's much colder than it obviously was.... but it wasn't cold enough for Corey to cover his face and hands when he rode his snow mobile. My money would have easily been on the guy running 6 miles in the snow to safety. I guess I've seen one too many episodes of I shouldn't be alive. People achieve that with broken arms/legs and feet. I can't believe something so nonsensical made it past the cutting room floor. Shows how little respect the writer/director has for their audience.And I just love the scene where nearly everyone was just shot dead and Corey finds the FBI chick under the house and smiles at her and asks if she's ok, as if he came from another set where a bunch of people hadn't just been shot to death (some of whom were his friends).
Also, when the movie reveals what led to the victims demise, it's such a silly circumstance. Whoever wrote it was very uncreative and out of touch in the realm of human observation.I picked up on a decent amount of symbolism throughout the movie and had the movie been half way decent this would have been worth looking into... however it's a bit delusional to think this movie was worthy of such a thing.",4,12,28,10 March 2018
Memento," Decent movie that fools the audience to believe it's deeper then it actually is!
","This is a decent movie, it's in no way a masterpiece/classic! People rating this a 10 or a 4 star movie have been fooled to believe the movie is somehow deeper then it actually is. It's actually a very simple movie. When you first watch the movie you aren't sure what's going on (confusion is the intent to kind of give the viewer Leonard's perspective), you believe it's a mystery and are trying to piece things together, but in all actuality, it's not a mystery and there is nothing to really piece together, which is fine, just don't kid yourself that it's some type of mind bender that you as a viewer must figure out. Spoilers At the end of the day, Leonard is constructing these endeavors to give his life meaning...that's the big ahhah moment! So the whole time you're trying to figure out what's going on, the answer is; Leonard is just giving himself something to do. Not that big of a deal. Not a biggie, but the scene where Leonard found out that the Motel Clerk was ripping him off was kind of lame. Wouldn't that be something worth writing down, rather then chuckling about? It's kind of a big deal.",7,2,3,17 September 2013
This Is the End," Misleading Trailers! Bad Directing, characters lacked authenticity!
","They definitely tried to make a good film and I'm sure this was a fun movie to make, but it unfortunately fails. Bummed I was looking forward to this movie! The only reason why I give this a 3 instead of a 1 is Danny McBride's performance. It's one of those movies where you know it sucks early on and there's nothing it could do to redeem itself. If there was a way to calculate how many people walked out of the theater, I have little doubt this would hold the all-time record. It's because of the style, which I would imagine lays blame mostly on the directors. I liked the trailers, because it made the movie seem as though it was going to have that element of authenticity/realism with the characters, while being a far-fetched comedy, but the character style is beyond over the top stupid. Here's a thought, why not just make the movie the way you want to present the movie in the trailer? If it wasn't for the trailer I would have thought that they intended to make what they ended up with. A stupid comedy can work if it has an element of authenticity in the characters a decent portion of the time. This movie starts off like it could be that way, but early on the characters just... oy vey!!! Which BTW, has nothing to do with the story transitioning into craziness, but that's about the time when the characters turn over the top stupid. The whole, 'playing themselves', was totally for marketing this movie (technically they used their real names). Even if the actors played over the top far-fetched versions of themselves this movie probably would have been good.It's generally true that comedy works when you have that certain element of authenticity in the characters (to varying degrees). With the exception of Airplane, Naked Gun and Spaceballs, which has the intentions to be stupid on stupid throughout, although those worked, generally they don't, like this movie. This may seem like random movie drops, but it's a rip on the degree of the stupid on stupid nature of this movie, being that it's much more comparable to those then it is to a movie like Superbad. I loved the movie Superbad, because the characters had that believability. On the other hand if you liked Pineapple Express (which I hated, for the same reasons), you may like this movie, although several reviewers said they liked PExpress and hated this movie). Just to pull another unrelated random comedy out of my butthole; Dumb & Dumber (which I consider a classic) is a movie one may think would fall into my stupid on stupid category, but Lloyd and Harry had a fairly realistic world interacting and operating around them, which was part of the reason their over the top antics had credibility. Nothing against 'This Is the Ends' crazy world, but they had a lot more flexibility with their characters to achieve such credibility. There were a handful of scenes that still made me laugh. All of them involved Danny McBride (had no opinion prior, other than two dreadful movies I saw him in, PExpress & Hot Rod). Just about every scene Danny had, he at least did something that gave it a chuckle. Going back to the whole realism thing, Danny has that authenticity/believability (while different, his ability to be believable when being surrounded by and doing far-fetched things reminds me of Zach Galifianakis), which makes his scenes in the movie funny that few others with the same lines could pull off. This dude has talent; he needs to be cast in some leading or significant supporting roles. If McBride's stock isn't soaring yet, I definitely want to buy some. Spoilers Scene - everyone wakes up and they give Danny the spiel about all the crazy things that happened. He then proceeds to give this logical breakdown that they were tripping on Acid and goes down the list of people based on their appearance. Hilarious! It actually made me question it, until the head falls off. Scene - the sticky magazine scene. Danny should win some type of academy award for that scene. Seriously! Franco also does a good job. There's one point where Seth Rogan is busting up, so they cut to a back shot and you can totally tell he's laughing. The Pilgrim line particularly cracked me up. Scene – A subtle line, but it caused me to laugh the hardest. The part after Danny drinks the water, Grabs Franco's gun and puts it in his mouth, takes it out and pushes Franco's arm down, 'That's what I thought nerd.' It's not funny in writing, but it's my favorite part in practice. Scene – I went back through and virtually every scene with McBride, he does something that's at least subtly funny. The whole Emma Watson incidental rape discussion scene is funny on paper, which turned out semi funny in practice, but it's Danny's sincerity throughout that makes it funny. Then up in the interview room when he says, Herminey took are crap (it's the way he says it) good stuff! There are a couple other scenes as well. I like virtually every actor that's in this movie in general. Jonah Hill is one of my favorite actors (his role in this sucked). I don't understand why directors don't get it. Perhaps they strive for character authenticity and they turn out stupid, or maybe it's something that's difficult to achieve (I don't know I'm not a director)? I really hope it's not by choice. Sure there are people out there that like stupid on stupid, but there are far more people out there that like some element of realism in the characters with their stupid and you won't even lose the stupid on stupid crowd as a fan base, so in the end it seems like a win win.",3,8,17,6 October 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," HORRIBLE! This movie fails in just about every way a movie can!
","How this movie got good reviews, I will never know. And how people got tricked into liking this movie, is mind boggling. Just a note, I really liked Get Him to The Greek & I Love You Man, so I usually enjoy this realm of comedy. But the comedy in this movie is weak and falls flat. In hindsight, I try to think of one funny moment in this movie and I honestly can't. Well then; the story line must be good and/or entertaining... nope, not at all. The 2 main characters are undeveloped and unlikeable as well. The main character Peter (Jason Segel) is really good in I love you man, so it was obviously the directer and the story line that sucked. Mila Kunis (Rachel) has some like-ability. I also like the Aldous Snow character, but that can't even come close to making up for this pathetic excuse for a movie. It's not only humorless, but approx 3/4 of this movie are uncomfortable to watch and at no point are they situations that are uncomfortable in a funny way. I don't always dock a movie because of predictability, but from the moment Peter get's to his vacation destination, you know exactly how this movie will play out. Some things in life are unexplainable; for example, the Pyramids and how people got tricked into liking this movie. It's uncompromisable & mind boggling! As badly as I would like to rate this movie a 1 out of 10. I will give it an honest rating, which is a 3 out of 10.",1,5,8,30 January 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Flawless comedy! A lot of good laughs and very entertaining!!!
","Once in a great while I watch a movie that I really enjoy... this is that movie. The actors in this movie are great! Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite actors now. Prior to this I had only seen him in Drive, The Believer and Lars and the Real girl. Just on those 4 movies alone, talk about a diverse spectrum of roles. The confident all around cool guy is the role you would almost expect him to get type casted into, but this is the first time I've seen him play that type of character. Coming from a hedro, he's one sexy bitch!!! Emma stone plays her same character, which I totally dig... and why not, no ones better with the sarcasm then she is. Marisa Tomei is classic in this movie. Hilarious!! For me it's the best role I've ever seen her in. They must have been dying on the set, when she was busting her stuff out. The movie is well written, the story line is nothing new, but never done this well. It's basically just a love triangle that comes to a head. The message that the movie leaves us with is kind of lame and borderline stalker. Anyways, This is a great movie in any setting. Highly recommended!!!",10,9,12,10 October 2012
The Mummy," One of the worst, if not the worst movies I've ever seen
","I guess I'll keep it brief. For one, I barely even remember it at this point, as I've blocked out much of this traumatic experience. I saw this in the theater at the time of it's release.The style of dialogue was so horrendous, which I detected 5 minutes into the movie. Similar to a cartoon or a comic book. Very slapstick and not funny at all (it's probably fair to say that it's unanimously not funny). It's the worst of all worlds. It doesn't take the serious route, moderately serious route, or even a route that's capable of producing at least 1 chuckle, rather a route of a complete garbage. Why would you even take a slap stick cartoon route with such a gargantuan movie budget? Well, I guess they got the last laugh, because this movie somehow made a fortune. Obviously, that's all they were going for, which is understandable and fine, but I would imagine most directors would want to make something they were proud of as well... not Stephen Sommers and his ridiculously bad filmography proves it. A complete Schlock director. This movie may as well have taken the special effects and flushed it down the toilet. It's the equivalent of writing am energetic comedy act and giving it to Ben Stein to perform. Of course that would have some potential to have reverse laughter. Unlike other movies that rank as the worst of all time (The Room, Troll 2, The Wicker Man etc), which are funny and worth watching because they are so bad, The Mummy is a 100% painful viewing experience. So, the Mummy is honestly the worst movie I have ever seen and I've consistently held that position ever since watching this piece of garbage. Perhaps this is a good movie for kids 10 and younger, but it's probably an insult to even their intelligence. It's difficult to harp on actors for being crappy under such bad direction and horrendous dialogue, but with that aside they are ridiculously bad. I'm a fan of John Hannah by the way and he doesn't stand out as being good or bad from what I remember... but the bad guy, the chick, Brendan Fraser and everyone else, words can't describe it. I particularly remember how stupid their facial expressions were.Here is my only spoiler and it wins the award for dumbest scene in the movie, from what little I remember of it. Basically, the bad guy conjures up a tornado and is chasing Fraser (and perhaps others) through the desert with it. As the tornado's about to take him out, the chick standing next to the bad guy (with a really lame facial expression, which she notoriously does throughout the movie) kisses him on the check. This distraction causes the tornado to dissolve and causes the bad guy to get an extremely lame facial expression as well (I can't even describe the facial expressions, because I've never seen anything like it before in my life). So essentially, this quick witted act saved Fraser from certain death. Anywho, it's stupid crap like this that causes this movie to kill brain cells. If you're going to kill brain cells I recommend smoking crack instead of watching this piece of crap, at least you'll get some pleasure in return.",1,1,7,20 March 2013
About Time," Entertaining movie, Good premise! A host of corny/cliche' moments. Excellent secondary characters.
","Upon watching this movie I wanted to dock the s__t out of it for it's corny/cliche moments, so much so that It tricked me into disliking this movie when in fact I was thoroughly entertained.The whole going back in time premise is a fun one for me, especially in this context where the central character has the ability to do so and it's just their secret. I would be cool with this being a genre type premise, which there have been a handful of movies along these lines and I typically enjoy them. This time they did it was a romance theme, so I guess corny and cliche' goes with the territory. 
It has an overabundance of awesome secondary characters as in everyone of them. Which kinda gives me reason to believe that this was entirely/originally a well written story, as in limited cliche' moments that got altered a bit in order to get the approval to be made. Probably went something like this; we're going to need a big name, or up in comer actress for Tim's love interest. So they bring in Rachel McAdams, who is, don't get me wrong a great actress, but holy s__t she doesn't belong in this movie. In conjunction with that the studio likely meddled with the more central story of Tim and Mary, clicheing it up for mass production, thus leaving it surrounded by a record breaking level of awesome secondary characters.The dad, Harry, uncle, Tim's two friends, Mary's friend. I really enjoyed the scene with Tim's uncle, where he tells him that the best day of his life was when Tim's dad said that he loved him at the wedding, so the news of his dad having cancer is probably the worst. It was the manor of the uncle that was portrayed throughout that puts that moment into context. Tim is kind of a mixed bag for me. The guy did a good job as an actor, it was the writing for his character which gave me mixed feelings as to whether or not I liked the guy. He kind of comes across as a bit pompous.On a deeply philosophical note, just be sure to live each day as though it's your last...I can't believe they left us of on such a mundane note. I feel like an abandoned orphan after that. 
Oh we'll, had enough good points to be worth the watch.",8,9,15,6 September 2014
Ready Player One," Hallidays Game/Contest Gets Lost in this Mishmash of a Movie.
","First of all, I listened to source material audio book that this movie is based on and I agree with most of the changes the movie made... book readers are notorious babies when movies make changes to the source material and have a difficult time comprehending that movies are vastly different medians then books and can't get away with many of the storylines that books can get away with in general, however things can get a bit tricky when large amounts of source material get crammed into a 2 hour movie, which is where this movie struggles. Even had I not listened to the audio book this movie would have still seemed like gargantuan chunks had been taken out of the story..
Worst of all, Hallidays Contest was lost in this mishmash of a movie, which is where much of the entertainment would have otherwise been..Instead it was a jumbled disaster that rarely if ever gave us the suspense of competition/race. It's extremely weird and difficult to put into words, but I'd be willing to bet that nearly everyone who watches this movie (like or hate) knows exactly what I mean. It should have been this exciting/suspenseful race throughout the contest, but it seldom gave us that vibe.",5,0,1,21 August 2019
The Beach," I can't believe Leonard Dicaprio took this role! Perhaps it was better on paper, because this is a dreadful movie!!!
","I never watched this movie until now, because of the negative reviews it received. Recently I came across this movie again and noticed that there were several peeps out there who feel as though this movie is some sort of lost gem, so I decided to watch it, to my utmost regret. I honestly don't know how anyone could have liked this movie. This movie is extremely overrated for it to be a 6.5. Anywho, I have a feeling that Dicaprio put his faith in the director Danny Boyle (who directed trainspotting), when he accepted this role. There's just no way this could have been a good script, because the movie is absolutely dreadful. It has no direction, no point and is very boring, just like the beach they find. To sum up some elements of the film that were lame to the point of insanity. Richard (Dicaprio) comes across a crazy dude who gives him a map. He speaks of this tropical beach paradise, never mind the small society who occupies it or the marijuana fields guarded by dudes with machine guns. It couldn't be too great, it drove this dude crazy. Perhaps he too had to stand guard for a period of time in solitude, which is what will later drive Richard crazy for a selective period of time on the beach. Which leads us to another significant point of nonsense. So Richard gives a copy of the map to some surfer tourist dudes he meets while in Bangkok prior to himself knowing for sure if the place exists (not a problem). So why doesn't Richard just say to the psycho chick; 'witch, I gave them the copy of the map prior to knowing as to whether or not this place existed. How the hell was I supposed to know that their would be a small secret society who wanted it to keep the beach a secret?' Anyways, for whatever reason the surfer dudes sit on the map for approx several months before they decide to seek out the beach. When they eventually seek out the beach and are at the approx. 1 mile swim away to get their, they are spotted by the nasty cult leader chick, who then makes Richard keep watch until they arrive on the beach. The period of time that Richard has to keep watch is unknown, but leads one to believe that it's several days to weeks. Why would the surfer dudes camp out for days to weeks across from their beach destination? They can't possibly be afraid of the swim they have surfboards for Fk sake. Anywho, there is so much ridiculousness in the movie I realize that it would be extremely lengthy to point it all out. But yes, it fails on every level. It's has no direction/pointless and it's just plain silly. All of which I could overlook if it wasn't also extremely boring. Even the beach paradise seems boring. This movie is so bad that it's almost worth watching, just to laugh at how awful and nonsensical it is. It's not quite Troll 2 or The Room, but it's not far from it.",4,3,5,8 December 2013
The Town," Not a masterpiece, but still an entertaining movie nonetheless!
","I enjoyed the characters and the acting in this movie. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but there's enough good aspects of the movie that make it a worthwhile movie to watch. Even someone who isn't particularly fond of action movies can still find this movie entertaining. On a side note, I really liked the portrayal of the FBI character in this movie. Movies rarely if ever create an FBI or cop character that's true to a real life one. The guy in this plays one of the most accurate portrayals of an FBI agent I've ever seen on the big screen. He's a straight up scumbag and leaves one with the notion, that the worst criminals you don't have to look to hard to find.",8,0,1,18 October 2012
21 Jump Street," Decent movie, takes a somewhat original spin on several movie cliché's mixed with a little Superbad!
","Even though I have a man crush on Jonah Hill, 21 Jump Street I never considered watching, until I read a little more on it and figured it would be a chance to see some of the Seth character from Superbad (which it had). For one this is a horribly titled movie. Who the hell gives a crap about the late 80's television show 21 Jump Street? When that show was airing, I didn't know a single person who watched it. Also the last character I would want my man crush to play was a cop. There is nothing cool about being a cop and there is nothing ethical about busting people for putting something in their own body. With that said, this movie didn't take the cop role very seriously. Around the time when Doug and Brad had the house party supplying alcohol and drugs to high school peeps I was cool with this movie. There was still the lingering thought of, yeah, but they're going to eventually bust the drug seller and supplier. Well, the movie goes out of it's way to make the ring extremely shady folk, although I could have done without the kid being arrested even though he's a total chode. Anyways, this movie does nothing to promote cops or the drug war, which makes it watchable, at least for me. 21 Jump Street is no masterpiece, but it has some funny moments and is mildly entertaining. I can't believe they're making a second movie though. I'm guessing Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum signed to a sequel in their initial contracts, because there is no way in hell Jonah Hill would have done a sequel to this movie. BTW not really familiar with Channing Tatum prior to this movie, but he's a good actor as well. This movie was full of cliché's, although each cliché has an original spin. The uncoordinated dorky smart guy teams up with the coordinated cool dumb guy. Most of you probably aren't familiar with the movie Class Act, but the names get mixed and the cool kid and nerdy kid switch roles (I'm sure this has been done in several movies over the years). 21 Jump Street takes this cliché and puts enough of it's own spin on it to own it. You also get to see a little of Jonah Hill's Seth character from Superbad, which is good. This movie also doesn't entirely ride out the prom cliché, but it runs through it.I have a hard time with the fine line of believable far fetched comedy (in the generic sense) and stupid far fetched comedy. This movie has it's share of both. When a movie starts killing people like it's a cartoon or a video game it knocks down the genuine comedy feel a couple of notches. Superbad had it's ultra far fetched moments, but maintained a genuine feel throughout the movie, this movie does not. Johny Depp and the other dude from 21 jump street getting killed (could have done without either) in conjunction with the 'bad guys', kind of kills the celebration moment when Doug and Brad 'save the day'. Overall this movie was decent. I would give it a 65-70 out of 100. Jonah Hill must have had a serious payday though to take this role even though he's ordinarily good at passing up money deals to be in quality roles. This was a decent movie decision for Hill, probably a big payday and he lost weight in the process. Part II on the other hand, not good, but I doubt it will have a negative effect on his career at this point.",8,1,2,20 February 2014
Hot Rod," Dreadful movie! Beyond Dumb! Not Funny at all!!!
","Just for the record, I'm a huge fan of Napoleon Dynamite. The only reason why I mention it is; for whatever ridiculous reason some peeps made a comparison about the movie styles being similarthey're not! Normally if I was going to critique the dreadfulness of a movie, I would at least finish watching the entire movie, but I just couldn't do it (I made it through half of it), but it was more painful than the combination of all of Evil Knieval's crashes combined. I would rather staple my nuts to the side of my leg then watch the rest of this movie. I'm utterly perplexed, because there's a decent amount of peeps out there who actually liked this movie. I can't imagine that being possible, even when trying to look at it from all of the varying senses of humor that exist. Sure, there are certain types of humor that just don't do it for me, but I can't imagine this so called humor doing it for anyone. It's just a really bad style that completely falls flat. Even extremely stupid, far-fetched comedies find a way to rope in small amounts of believability in their characters, so the viewer laughs when they do or say something funny. This is just extremely stupid and far- fetched with no believability even when accepted as a stupid comedy. A good friend of mine referred this movie to me. I think I will just take the denial route and pretend I never watched it. Spoiler I did laugh at the part when Rod went tumbling down the hill. Not because Rod went tumbling down the hill, or the scene that led into it, but the visuals of him tumbling were well done. That's really the only way this movie is capable of producing a chuckle or laugh. It sure as hell isn't going to do it with the use of dialogue. I'm going to pretend that watching this dreadful, piece of crap of a move was all just a really bad dream.",1,8,26,23 September 2013
The Revenant," Visually Awesome! Mundane Storyline! Bear Scene is Epic! Overall Worth Watching!
","The one thing that really got me thinking upon completing this film is, how did DiCaprio know that this was going to be a good movie? I can't imagine anything about the script would cause an A list actor to jump on the role. It's essentially a vengeance type film (someone wronged/killed you or your family)... this film adds the extra element that the hero has to achieve this while being on deaths door and has to drudge through insanely beautiful terrain to do it. Also to note, the bear attack scene is unbelievable! It's the best CGI I've ever seen. Anyways, did DiCaprio go to a psychic, or maybe I'm just missing something? I would love to know what caused him to choose this role? I can imagine he wanted the challenge of doing something different from anything he had ever done before. With one of the big challenges in this role being very little dialogue and having to rely on facial expressions etc. Very difficult role and he was excellent as always (I'm not sure if this will get him the best actor nomination, but it may). I can imagine one of the motivating factors was, Dicaprio had just completed Wolf of Wall street, which I wouldn't be surprised if it holds the record for the most dialogue for a character in the history of cinema. So DiCaprio now jumps completely on the opposite side of the spectrum in this film. Overall this movie is worth the watch for most people. As I said, the plot is very simple, but the visuals are perfect. Some nit picks, which has spoilers. Watching the hero of the film drudge around in constant pain gets to be kind of draining. I can take it for a little bit, but dude! And when Hugh (Dicaprio) eventually catches up to the villain dude... I understand they want to make it suspenseful, but to me it comes across really lame and cheesy when everything for the most part had taken the straight arrow realistic movie style to that point only for it to result in your typical hero meets villain final fight scene, with back and forths with both people getting stabbed and beat etc. Hugh had been spot on with the gun up until the final scene where he grazes the villain at point blank range. Now we get to watch Hugh take more abuse...oye very!!! I would have rather the suspense revolve around the villain breaking away from Hugh to were it seems as though he just might be home free only for Hugh to do something drastic in order to find him and/or catch up with him. No need for corny back and forths.",7,1,3,23 January 2016
Warrior," It has it's flaws, but not when it comes to entertainment. I was enthralled throughout the movie..
","Even though I find/found myself critiquing certain aspects of the movie, I can't deny how completely enthralled I was throughout the movie. It's 130 minutes long, but it didn't seem like it. If anything it seemed rushed or trimmed in a couple of areas. If you blink you could miss the training portion and the Segway going into the final fight. Yeah, there's some clichÃ©' elements, but the story build up of the two brothers is enjoyable and does a good job at making us root for both brothers equally (until the last fight when the one brother goes villain).Predictability isn't always a negative attribute and in this instance it's not and doesn't pretend to not be. The movie instead focuses on the story development of the two brothers giving them both equal development time. So the interest is just watching the story evolve into the inevitable conclusion of the final matchup. What we don't know is, how it will evolve, which brother will win and even which brother we'll be rooting for. At first it seems as though it's a no brainer. The homeless veteran Tommy vs. the brother Brendan with a hot wife who may be losing his home. As it develops though we see Brendan as always being the underdog even in their youth and he's definitely established as the underdog in the arena throughout, so it gives a good balance between the two brothers. The movie kind of overdoes it though, by making the younger brother unforgiving towards the older brother to a degree that doesn't make any sense... his extreme animosity towards his brother, particularly in the final match surpasses anything I could possibly reference.The biggest annoyance's throughout pertain to the unusually large periods of time dedicated to the unforgiveness scenes. It's like, we get it, your dad did a bunch of nasty crap and you don't forgive him for it and refuse to have a conversation about anything other than training with him, however you showed up at your dad's house only to then not want to talk to him? And to go through an entire training duration without having a conversation with your dad about anything other than training, must be some kind of Guinness record. I would definitely have trimmed the I don't forgive you interaction time from 40 minutes to about 10 minutes (especially since nothing really happens with it anyways) and split the 30 minutes to more training development time and more Segway going into the final fight. Both brothers win their final match before they face each other, then we blink and they're already in the cage fighting one another (5 minutes to be exact). The buildup for their fight at that point should be milked for all it's worth, especially since everyone in the Warrior world just found out that the two finalists are brothers. I don't understand why such a meaty part would be trimmed out or not included in the movie?Subtle annoyances/flaws.
1. So, Tommy goes from being a lush and popping pills with no recent training, to beating the ever living crap out of the top middleweight contender in the country? Then he ends up meeting that same guy in the semi finals? If he beat the crap out of that guy without training, we can only imagine how much of a mismatch that's going to be, so why would the movie do this? At the very least they should have made the first match closer.2. Oh yeah and I love the part where Tommy apparently carries 3 full bottles of pills on him at all times. Not 1, not 2, but 3 and his dad knows that he has exactly 3 bottles on him because he knows the difference between 3 pill bottles rattling over 2 or 1. That's like Sherlock Holmes type crap. 3. At first it seemed a tad farfetched that Brendan (teacher) would get suspended because he chose to partake in organized fighting in his off time. Then I remembered that the department of education isn't logical or consistent when it comes to anything, so I definitely wouldn't put something like that past them. 4. Why did the dad just make it to the fight in the 3rd round. At that point it had been at least a day and a half since he got drunk. It made sense that he missed Tommy's next fight after getting drunk, but why wouldn't he make the start of the brothers fight? Was the start of the fight at the same time as his favorite TV program? How did he know that the fight wouldn't be over at that point? It seems like the movie cut out an important part to the story before the brothers got into the ring together, but if it was more time dedicated to unforgiveness they made the right decision to cut it out. All in all, I was thoroughly entertained, so even with it's flaws this was a very enjoyable movie.",9,2,3,1 February 2018
Foxcatcher," This movie actually succeeds in being weirder than John DuPont... And I mean weird in the crappiest way possible!
","This movie actually succeeds in being weirder than John DuPont. This movie commits to nothing, including substance. Why was this movie even made?... I understand why a movie was made depicting the circumstances associated with the Schultz brothers and Dupont, but why was this movie made? Sure, sometimes movies/writers/directors have a story/direction in mind, but in the end it doesn't come into fruition for whatever reason. In this instance, it's like, what the f__k was the director thinking? He was alright with this? I would imagine that the actual events associated with Foxcatcher should make for an interesting story and I'd really like to see that movie, so how did they end up with this bomb of a movie? The fact that some people rated this movie well is an interesting psychological experiment that is worth looking into... it's some type of psychological defect or something that tricks people into thinking something crappy was good? Who knows, but this is not a good movie in any way.The movie given to us is about nothing. Sure, Dave Schultz got shot by Dupont, but why? Even if no theories exist and/or no one knows the answer to that. This movie gives us nothing in reference to anything, including substance. Why was Mark pissed off at Dupont for the later half of the movie? Sure, Dupont was weird and everything... trying to present himself as the coach and having the wrestlers echo this sentiment, but for Mark to be enraged at both Dupont and his brother to the point where he is apparently so traumatized that he goes mute for the last 1/3rd of the movie... there's really only one conclusion one can come too. If that never happened, then one thing is for certain... if Mark wasn't taking it in the rear from DuPont this movie more than made up for it. I'd be surprised if Mark wasn't enraged after watching this movie.",1,2,4,10 March 2019
Drive," Character development with little dialogue.
","I can't think of any movies off the top of my head that builds characters without the use of dialogue, but somehow this director pulls it off. The actor who plays the driver dude does a kick-ass job, just with the use of facial expressions. His likability makes this movie that much more enjoyable. I'm surprised there aren't more people on here talking about how bad the 80's sounding pop theme music was throughout this movie. There is little excuse for something so unfitting and wretch-id! Some of the undertone music throughout was good and the opera music towards the end was fitting and I understood it's purpose. But the intro, the middle and the outro your forced to listen to several minutes of this weird pop crap that was even painful back in the 80's when they would do that crap. Anyway's, I didn't deduct it in my rating as much as I wanted too, because this movie is definitely not a 7. But what were they thinking!!!",8,1,6,9 September 2012
A Quiet Place," Silly Movie! I could take logical fallacies to a point, but this movie expects the audience to suspend disbelief to a level unsurpassed!
","Sure, not everything needs to add up or make sense in a movie/show, so I allow logical fallacies to a degree but when a story doesn't abide by any degree of logical sense or consistency, it's no longer really a story. It's the equivalent of a person with Alzheimer's talking or it's someone with a 5 second long attention span telling or listening to a story.The movie writer is essentially saying, I have no respect for the audience's intelligence. Nothing I write makes any sense, but that's alright because the audience is stupid and won't hold my feet to the fire and unfortunately the writer is partially right, because enough of the audience rewards this. Hopefully audiences will stop incentivizing this, because it's gotten to the point where we accept this mindless movie writing style as being the norm... this movie takes it to a level unsurpassed.I couldn't even begin to go point by point through all of the nonsense that this movie throws at us, so I'll just mention the first nonsensical thing to happen, which is a perfect demonstration of the monster pile of crap this movie is, because one instance has 10 ridonculous things going on simultaneously... the balls on this movie. What would have possessed the kid to play with his electronic space shuttle in extreme form (with lights and sound effects) in that particular moment or at all for that matter? Sure, kids aren't the sharpest, but the kids already gone 89 days... the kid would have to be a buddha master at not making noise at that point. He's had to learn sign language and walk around on egg shells for 89 days, but he's like, I'm falling off the wagon and I need to play with my shuttle in complete clueless/fearless form right now, while my family walks ahead of me. And why would the dad lead the front and the kid lead the back... doesn't make any sense at all? And why are they spaced so far apart? The dad's practically 400 meters in front of the kid. And did going to the pharmacy really have to be a family endeavor? As if these creatures could zip through steel and rock, which apparently, they can until it's not convenient to the plot, such as when the kids are in a car and it can't get at them, in which case being in a strong enclosed structure would easily protect them from these creatures, but I digress. Maybe the kid was smarter than we think and he committed suicide to remove himself from this steaming pile of crap of a movie.",1,1,2,7 November 2018
Logan," This movie is like watching Wolverine ail around in pain for 2 hours, actually that's exactly what it is!
","Nearly everyone I've ever come across unanimously says that this is an overrated movie and I couldn't agree more. 
Approx 95% of the movie is dedicated to Wolverine gimping around like a zombie, wincing in pain. 
Little makes sense, it's just a sloppy movie with little to no logical sequencing.The one chick needs Wolverine to take her and the kid to the border, but why? She has bundles of cash. She could pay anyone to take her... people who aren't radar magnets like wolverine. And could they make up their mind about the kid. One minute she's running around like she has led up her butt the next minute she's running around like Benny Hill. Also one minute she doesn't understand English the next she understands English, but speaks in Spanish, the next she's bilingual. 
And the old dude's best day in a long time is the day that he gets an entire family killed.... good times!This movie is significantly artificially inflated because homeboy dies in the end.",5,3,5,13 December 2017
Blood Diamond," Overrated, Total Disappointment!
","I had little doubts prior to watching this movie as to whether or not I would like it...I was sooo wrong! I was completely shocked that this movie was as weak as it was! It's not a good movie on so many levels. Come to find out, the critics didn't rate this movie very well either. I have little doubt that the user ratings were artificially inflated, because this movie is not an 8. Realistically it's more like a 6. I'll start off with the positives. The movie had good acting and pretty landscape/imagery! Major props to Decaprio for maintaining a great acting performance despite the weak storyline/dialogue etc. That's where the optimism stops. The story-line is dreadful!... The far fetched story and action sequences put a Rambo movie to shame! Trust me, I am not exaggerating! Especially for a movie that's supposed to take itself seriously. DiCaprio's story with Connelly had little development and I felt no connection what so ever. spoiler - Is it really supposed to be a sad moment when he calls her up on the phone in the end? Talk about a dud of a movie. Spoiler DiCaprio's character starts off like-able and becomes increasingly dislike-able as the movie plays out. It's one of those rare occasions when I would have been all down for the cliché' of essentially becoming enlightened along the way and giving the diamond away like he did, although the only reason he handed it off was because he was dying. I think if you throw Dicaprio and Connelly in a movie you could fool a lot of people into liking a movie. If these ratings are legitimate (which I doubt) people were fooled into liking it, because it's factually a weak movie! BTW I can't believe Dicaprio got nominated for best actor in this movie and not The Departed (one of the greatest acting performances in cinematic history).",4,3,7,31 July 2013
There's Something About Mary," A total classic!!! One of the best comedies ever made!!!!
","Just about everyone has seen this movie. If you haven't, where the hell have you been? I felt compelled to write a blurb on this, because I was surprised to see this only having a 72 rating on IMDb. I'm guessing, some of the offensiveness causes a certain minority of folks to bring the rating down, but why the hell would those peeps even watch a comedy like this in the first place? Anyways, this is one of the top 10 comedies ever made. I saw this in the theater originally. There were 4-5 scenes in this movie that caused me to laugh the hardest I've ever laughed while watching a movie. I think that was the case with most people. It was a blast to watch it in the theater a second time just to witness everyone laughing hysterically. I've seen the movie about 5 times. It has 0 rewatchability for me at this point, but it doesn't change the classic factor of this movie. At this point the only debate about this movie is where on the all time funny list does it belong. It's easily a top 10 and potentially a top 5. On my list it's a top 5.",10,0,0,21 October 2012
Sinister," One of the silliest horror movies I've ever seen and I grew up on B rate horror movies!
","This was one of the silliest horror movies I've ever seen, which says a lot, because I grew up watching nearly every B rate horror movie ever made. Even if I wanted to be extra lenient and look past such insane silliness and just take it for its entertainment value this movie is about as fun as AIDS. Sinister moves painfully slow, which I can handle in deeper build up type of horror movies, but this movie is the shallowest one dimensional horror movie ever made. The script is dreadful and so is this movie.A horror movie will typically create a façade that it's jumping out to scare/attack its characters, in the midst of jumping out and scaring the audience. Sinister doesn't even want to create this façade; the boogie people in this are putting on a show for the audience, rather than the characters (Ethan Hawk). This caused me to laugh out loud on several occasions as a knee jerk reaction. The boogie children's sole purpose is to be creepy for the audience; they do things in the realm of, making rabbit ears behind Ethan Hawk, then darting out of the way before he notices then for whatever reason they move in slow motion, while motion remains constant for everything elsethey also will stand in the background and look creepy solely for the audience. This movie has no shame unlike anything I've ever seen before. The movie has little motive, little twist, little plot, no rationale, etc. Basically the boogie dude lives on the souls of children and makes them filmographies so they can film the murders, so Ethan Hawk can watch it for the sole purpose of showing the audience, because it's completely unnecessary to show each victim family the prior family murders before they are murdered. Imagine 100 years from now, just how much video the victim will have to watch, or maybe he'll have a best of version by then. The only so called twist or tie in is, the entity will follow you, so there is no escape. Is that really much of a twist when 75% of all ghost/demon/possession movies use the same ghost will follow you rules? It would be like a werewolf movie ending on the twist of a silver bullet doing it in. Anyways, I'm shocked that this movie received mediocre reviews, because the script is a dreadful piece of crap, which made for a dreadful piece of crap movie.",2,3,6,5 August 2014
Limitless," Limitless potential, limited execution, however the concept and the cinematography carry it just enough to make it a movie I'm glad I finally watched.
","Even though I'm glad I watched this movie, I can't help but feel the disappointment of something that could have been significantly better, which I'm sure most viewers echo this sentiment....And man!... did this have some gargantuan plot holes. I wouldn't completely disagree with a viewer who couldn't get beyond it. I probably wouldn't have if this type of thing wasn't so typical in movies, however they should be pointed out.
Somehow homeboy, using his brain to the max, never accounted for running out of pills... perhaps figuring out a way to get or manufacture more? Eddie even runs out at the worst possible times (not once but twice) in which he knew would happen if all went well with the meeting (with Carl Van Loon- the De Nero character), so why put yourself in a situation on your run out day, knowing that you will look like a jackhole when you can't deliver? I won't even get into the nonsense with the Russian dude.
And man!... did it seem like they cut out a chunk of this movie or ran out of time. Apparently Eddie establishes more of a relationship/partnership/rivalry with the Carl then the viewer ever gets to see. So for this movie to end with Eddie one upping/beating Carl makes very little sense, since such a rivalry was never established. And lastly....a politician? Talk about limitations.",7,1,1,20 March 2020
The Disaster Artist," So Bad, it's Bad!
","I'm not sure if it's because I have a bias having already listened to the audio book (audio book is recommended because Greg Sestero does a perfect Tommy Wisseau impersonation, which really adds to the story), but I really wanted to like this movie and pretty much wrote it off as liking it even before I watched it. I was already a fan of The Room and the Disaster Artist book and had seen several interviews in reference to the movie, so liking this seemed inevitable, but it was horrible. That's what I theorize happened. People wanted to like this movie and it has such an interesting back story that they tricked themselves into thinking they liked it? Much like the room it didn't feel like a real movie. It's hard to imagine that this was a normal budgeted movie with normal actors and a normal director, because every aspect of the movie felt B rate. The only part that didn't was when they were reenacting scenes from The Room. I was in a full theater and this movie attracted minimal laughs. It got a handful of chuckles, mostly forced chuckles, but no real laughter. I am absolutely beside myself that James Franco got nominated and won best acting awards for this performance. It's easily the worst best actor award ever given in the history of cinema and I have nothing against James Franco's acting in his other roles, but this was bad... he does one of the worst impressions of Tommy Wisseau that I've ever heard. It's not even close. Anyways this was disappointing and has me baffled because no one in the theater where I watched it was laughing. It's such an interesting story in general that I think perhaps that carried it through such a ridiculously bad movie.
I think that movies and books are two different formats, so I usually get annoyed when book readers whine about a movies interpretation of a book, but in this instance the movie is so far removed from the book. One thing the movie did was, they completely cut out all of the really horrible crap that Tommy did and would do, instead turned some of his lessor antics into minor nuisances to keep him likable to the audience. Anyway I look at it, this movie was really bad.",3,20,38,1 February 2018
Stranger Than Fiction," Can you imagine how crappy the authors story would be?
","So when the Dustin Hoffman character reads the story, he's moved by it and thinks it's some beautiful masterpiece. So let me get this straight. An IRS agent (Harold) with OCD follows the exact same regiment daily. He ends up auditing some chick from a bakery that he starts taking a liking too. He begins to hear that someone is narrating him, so he tracks down the Dustin Hoffman character who helps him narrow down the author that may be writing his story. Harold begins to live less regimented, he hooks up with the chick from the bakery, he tracks down the author who's writing his story. Apparently this is such a beautiful masterpiece that the story should really end with him dying? That's a masterpiece? How? Did they edit all the good stuff out of the movie? Now don't get me wrong, the movie is OK, but you want us to play along and pretend that this story is a bring you to tears masterpiece? I'm sorry I won't play along, my imagination only goes so far.",5,0,3,26 November 2017
Her," Original, Realistic, Great Acting & Brilliantly Empathizes/Cares For All Of It's Characters!
","I really loved this movie. It's difficult to put into words how this movie made me feel, but I love when a movie such as this brings out a certain emotion within me. It's as if an endorphin is released, which causes a mixture of sadness, yet I leave the movie with a sense of well- being and perhaps optimism. It's pretty much impossible to put into words , but some other movies off the top of my head, which trigger a similar emotion are, American Beauty, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Lost in Translation. Going into this movie I had several assumptions neither negative nor positive, but my natural assumption was that Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) was going to be this quirky guy who would pathetically (for lack of a better term) develop a relationship with his OS and the humor that would go with such a scenario, but that wasn't the case at all. In fact, Her is so Stellar that you completely empathizes with Theodore as to how and why he would develop a relationship with his OS, which as you can imagine, is not an easy feat. Everything had to fall into place just right and that's exactly what Spike Jonze, so brilliantly succeeds in doing. The acting; Joaquin Phoenix, Scarlett Johansson, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde etc, is superb and so is the dialog. All of the conversations felt real and genuine. I found it amusing how the characters would throw out f bombs in a natural context. In Spike Jonze's future reality I could do without the above waist pants, although I liked the portrayal of the male characters in reference to being comfortable around one another.they aren't afraid to touch or complement.I would say that this movie probably captures the relationship process (breakups, sadness, growing, moving on etc.) better than any movie I've ever seen. This movie exposes the characters flaws without blaming anyone. For example, we find ourselves caring about Theodore's ex-wife Catherine as much as we care about him. We get to see Theodore grow as a person, particularly as a result of his relationship with Samantha (OS), but also from his friendship with Amy (Amy Adams) as well. The director's decision to lead the viewer to believe that Theodore and Amy could potentially build a romantic relationship was the correct one, rather than taking us by the hand and visually introducing it to us, which would have been very corny.",10,3,7,20 January 2014
The Island," Surprisingly a pretty good movie!
","Apparently this movie came out 10 years ago, but I had no knowledge of it until today. I'm normally not a big fan of these high budget mainstream action flicks, however this movie has an original entertaining premise, that had me enthralled. I just looked this up on IMDb and, while it's ranked pretty decent, I'm surprised this didn't do very well in the theater. Meanwhile a complete piece of crap like Armageddon can do 200,000,000. I guess I'll never figure it out. I noticed other reviewers saying that this felt like a 2 part movie, but I didn't think anything of it until I saw some reviews saying that. The first half went pretty fast for me, even though it's the slower portion of the movie. It may just be me, but I was more entertained during the non action sequences, but they have some really big budget action sequences going on. I acting was top notch all around. I enjoyed the Steve Buscemi character a lot (relatively small role, but was a major plot driver in the movie). Anyways, if you're someone who is prone to like action movies, I don't know how you pass this one up and who knows you may still enjoy otherwise. Maybe it helps if you find the premise intriguing, which I definitely did.",8,0,0,29 May 2017
