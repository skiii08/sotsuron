Iron Man 3," Better than you would expect from a '3' film.
","I enjoyed this film.With that summary statement out of the way (I sometimes tend to be esoteric in my analysis), I will touch on the things that I liked and did not like which should in no way sway the opinion you should make for yourself; ultimately (and obviously), a review of anything is just someone publishing a personal preference.Liked (in roughly descending order of appeal): -The dialog writing for the Stark character was, by far, my favorite of the four films featuring Robert Downey Jr. I really feel that the style of the actor and the character dialog have finally meshed into a brilliantly cohesive personality.-The CGI work was nearly seamless. I do not know if this is the result of the film's post crew, or if it's just the improving industry technology: I just know that for a refreshing change for my capacity to suspend disbelief and enjoy the film wasn't constantly bludgeoned with overly-conspicuous FX.-Far superior pacing over Iron Man 2 (no offense, Mr. Favreau the first installation is still my favorite of the Iron Man series). Specifically, the tendency for the second installation to side-track for superfluous humorous tangents was thankfully missing in this edition. I have nothing against comedy I just prefer it to be subtle or pace-sensitive in an action film.-Casting: A believable child character (Ty Simpkins) that didn't continuously bring the story to a saccharine-cute halt. Also, the limited screen time for non-plot support cast was appreciated.-Gag Reel in the special features. It should be a law for any and every film to have this extra on the DVD release.Kudos for disparaging reference to the DC Comics upcoming film response to The Avengers. All apologies, but I'm a Marvel fan with a sarcastic streak who is apparently easily amused.Disliked (in roughly descending order of annoyance): -Another example of the sequel cliché need for 'more'. The apparent requirement of Hollywood to 'one up' the previous film in a series by piling on gratuitous action; knowing how a film is going to resolve itself before the first frame even rolls is insanely tedious. I understand that this peeve will never be addressed; they are produced this way because it is profitable to do so.I'm also a hypocrite, as I purchased this DVD without ever seeing the film in theaters, knowing full well I was only reinforcing this practice by paying the film-makers for their platitudes. I can still hope the next film in the series deviates from the trend and relies less on fast cuts and bigger explosions, and more on talented screenplay, writing and cinematography (I will, however, still buy the Iron Man 4 DVD unless something utterly unacceptable and tragic occurs such as letting Michael Bay direct or recasting Downey).-Formula plot: The fallen hero who rises to an underdog victory. It's used extensively because people like it. Hell, I like it. The problem is that it really doesn't do much to imprint itself on the part of the brain that likes to remember bits of art that strikes a uniquely creative chord. It's rather like having a slice of your favorite cake; pleasant but hardly memorable.-Villains too derivative of the nemesis character in 'Terminator 2'; I could not stop my mind from generating the T2 signature percussive rhythm in all of the super-villain sequences.***A post-script to screenwriters and directors: If you are among those who feel 'professional' critiques of films are the only credible measure of your work, then allow me a suggestion: Why not only read user reviews, and avoid anyone anywhere who gets paid to review films? In the information age, you need no longer prostitute yourselves to the thumb position of celebrity critics.",7,2,5,3 October 2013
Fight Club," Where was my mind?
","This film has been out long enough to make a legitimate review either irrelevant or redundant; unless of course you've never seen it, in which case you really should decide for yourself its merits or lack thereof.I will comment on the appreciation I have for the sound work in this film; especially the treatment given to the final musical selection (i.e., it's near impossible to hear a song in its completion and without a severe hatchet-job in any movie, for obvious reasons) most attempts at incorporating popular music end in MTV-esque sound bites that resemble a delusional DJ with ADHD.Lastly, kudos to Mr. Fincher's menu concept for the Blu-ray release; even knowing what the film was about, I was still taken off guard.",9,0,0,18 October 2012
Crash," Hate is not black or white.
","This film explores prejudice but not in the way that, say, Spike Lee does. Nothing here is quite so black and white. Everyone is prejudice to some degree that is a part of what being human is. This is a film that lets you explore that aspect of your persona, and either a) reinforce your moral beliefs or b) force you to confront why it is you think the way you do. In other words, if you are set on judging another human being based on how they look, then this film will most likely anger youwhich is, I believe, all the more reason to rent it and watch it with an open heart. Personally, I was raised by a father who spat out racial slurs at every opportunity. This, unfortunately, is not so uncommon. What compelled me to re-think his point of view was two fold: I was endowed with an above-average IQ, and cursed with a father who was an asshole... hence, I was obliged to make up my own mind on a number of things. No matter how noble or righteous you believe your point of view to be, it is always a good thing to reinforce (*not* justify) exactly why it is you feel the way you do.Please forgive the tangent, but I am not one to believe in black rights, women's rights, gay rights, etc. To me, these are advocating separate but equal rightssomething that is fundamentally wrong and against what the U.S. Constitution stands for. I believe that everyone should have the same base rights but you cannot expect positive results from an antagonist movement. I realize that this is not very realistic in modern society, and that people are (understandably) desiring instant change for unjust representation. I have no issue with the intent of such movementsjust with the need for them in the first place.Back to the film. If you go into this movie with your prejudice, then you will be both rewarded and chastised for your beliefs. The trick is to pay attention to the effects of such thought, and acknowledge the larger picture. Here is, in effect, a spoiler: judge each human being you meet as the color graythen determine their true color by their actions. True, you may get burned from time to time but at least you will be a decent human being throughout the trials, one that is without regret or remorse. While this may be an overly idealistic point of view at least it's one that beats the alternative perspective of hate and mistrust. At the end of the day, it is only yourself that you need answer to.",Null,0,2,9 October 2005
"I, Robot"," The bright side: I am only out $3 for a rental, and not $8 for a ticket.
","Just one question: Who do I need to talk to about *not* attempting any more atrocious film renditions of Asimov stories? Yes, the advancement of computer technology in relation to CG is a good thing-- but why does that give the film industry carte blanche to remove any semblance of plot, intelligence, storyline and pace? These things were present in the original works. Yes, I am aware of the catch-all safety net that 'based on' providesbut they seem to have no inhibitions in using Asimov's name on the movie posters. Also, why the need to place comedic actors in the lead roles? Are they afraid the simpleton masses are unable to fathom the human condition without having it spoon-fed with slapstick? Don't get me wrong, I rather like both Will Smith and Robin Williams-- but it is obvious in both this film and 'The Positronic Man' parody that they were cast to 'lighten up' the primary narration, and thus give a boost to ticket revenues. Harmless to those like me who are merely angered and insulted... but what about the younger generation who forgo the quaint concept of reading a book? They are forever tainted by this celluloid drivel. Asimov was brilliant, compassionate and insightful... whereas the film renditions are nothing more than Beethoven's 5th played with a kazoo. Best theory I have is that this eye-candy was intended as an anti-piracy measure to reduce illegal DVD circulation.In summation, this would have been a decent film had it not been so erroneously based on another's creativity-- much like another passion of mine, music, is ever-increasingly based in sampling and borrowed lyrics. To those Powers That Assume The Mantle Of Film-Making: either *create*, or faithfully render and honor another's creativity, and stop the insane drive to make a buck and/or take a bow.",2,4,9,18 December 2004
