Raiders of the Lost Ark," Why did it have to be snakes?...
","I have recently re-watched Raiders of the Lost Ark, after seeing it many times on television in my childhood, but watching it now for the first time in years (and certainly the first time since I have become a big film fan) it is obvious just how superb this film really is.My enjoyment has been dampened slightly due to having seen it many times before (and seeing no end of parodies and homages to many of the key scenes over and over again in television programmes such as The Simpsons and Family Guy) but now I can appreciate the wonderful cinematography, the fantastically low-key lighting and brilliant acting by Ford to create a very tree-dimensional character in Indy. I was also astonished at just how many of the key moments from this film have gone down in cinema history and are imprinted on the minds of audiences everywhere. Even if they haven't seen the film many people will still be aware of scenes such as the fantastic opening (with Indy navigating through a trap-filled cave and narrowly escaping from a giant boulder), so I think it says a lot about a film when it has so many moments that have gone on to become so famous. Apart from the possible expectations of Star Wars and The Godfather, I can't think of any other films that achieve this memorability so well. My personal favourite moments from the film, as well as the opening scene which I have already mentioned, have got to include the hilarious moment when a swordsman challenges Indy, showing off his sword skills only for our hero to casually shoot him and continue on his way. Another fantastic moment is the plane fight, where Indiana is fighting a large henchman resulting in the man getting quite brutally killed in the propeller of an aeroplane. Not to mention the glorious melting faces of the villains at the end of the film when the ark is opened.. Despite my positively glowing account of the film so far, it's not without its faults. The film is so well known by now that it has admittedly lost a lot of the original sparkle (which is similarly true for the Star Wars trilogy) and also some of the special effects and matte backgrounds don't always convince...but these things are expected as they are due to age. Despite these small niggles, Raiders of the Lost Ark is pure cinema, a funny, engaging exciting adventure that is full of charm. If you've been living in a cave the last 25 years and haven't seen this film, then you need to. NOW!",9,0,1,14 July 2007
Lost in Translation," Magical
","As of last night i have seen this film 3 times, and each time i have loved it more and more. To but it simply, i now consider this to be quite possibly one of the best films i have ever seen. It's hard to justify this opinion with words, its just something that i feel when watching it. It's magical yet real, intimate yet distant, soul-warming and heart-breaking. It's a huge mix of contrasting feelings, all contradicting one and another, and this couldn't be more fitting. It's like love, gentle but engrossing.. but perhaps that's enough about 'feelings'. More technically, the cinematography is fantastically suiting to the story, with shallow focuses creating a delicate world around the lonely protagonists who are so out of place with it. The acting is superb, Bill Murray is the best he has ever been (evoking a whole spectrum of emotion, but also making us laugh)and Scarlett Johansson.. well, she may well be the most beautiful creature ever to be put on film. Lost in Translation feels like a very personal film, as if Coppola is putting herself into these characters. One specific moment brings this to mind, when Charlotte muses about being lost in life, to paraphrase; 'I tried writing but i hate what i write, I tried photography but my pictures are so..mediocre'. This feels like a reflection of the film-maker's own frustrations (for example, being shunned out of the acting world by the harsh criticisms to The Godfather Part3), But i am very happy to say that this films is every bit as good as anything her father has made, and whats more, i even prefer it. With Lost in Translation, Coppola has truly proved that she has found her vocation. It's fresh, different and excellently made. But more importantly it's magical.",10,0,3,28 June 2008
Predator," Predator is one of the coolest action/horror films ever made. FACT.
","I have only just seen this film recently and I wasn't expecting too much from it. But after seeing it, the only thing I can say is 'wow!' this is such a cool film, with good old Arnie in the role of the hero giving the great one-liners that have become expected of him. But this is much more than just another brainless action film. Although the film is based around the action, there are also strong elements of horror, sci- fi and thriller, as well as some very funny moments and utterly cool lines. I know that not every one will like this film, and many will dismiss it as brainless and shallow, but the fact is that it was not made to please everyone. What it is, is a macho movie, made by guys, for guys, and I recommend this film to every red-blooded male out there. it may not be a cinematic masterpiece (although it certainly has its moments) it is a hugely enjoyable film to watch. UTTERLY COOL!",9,2,3,7 December 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," A real ray of sunshine...
","The first thing i would like to say about Little Miss Sunshine is that it is nothing like what i was expecting. In fact, i wasn't sure what to expect as it's hard to classify the film into a particular genre, sheerly because of how original it is. I mean sure, its a comedy, but simply shoving it into this genre does no justice whatsoever to how good the film actually is. Because of what i had heard about Little Miss Sunshine before seeing it, i was more or less expecting a smart, and funny film with something to say about life. And that's exactly what i found, but so much more.I certainly wasn't prepared for the emotional depth of the characters,the,in places, stunning cinematography (i was especially impressed with the camera work in the opening sequence) and one of the best feel good endings i've seen in a while! The main point i want to get across is that its not everyday that i see a film that makes me think 'wow' and actually inspires decisions in my own life. Three kings, American beauty, and Rain man made me feel similar, just to name a few. However i realise that the film would not affect everyone in this way, some people may miss the point all together. but for those who want to see a group of people with more messed up lives than your own trying to tackle bizarre circumstances with life-affirming results, then you're in for a real treat...",9,1,3,3 June 2007
True Romance," IT'S so cool
","I first decided i wanted to see this film after becoming completely obsessed with Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction is my favourite film ever and i also loved Kill Bill (1 and 2), Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown, so i wanted to see true romance, which Tarantino wrote the script for.To be honest i wasn't sure what to expect, as the name seems to suggest a romantic comedy of sorts, but this definitely not a chick flick. From the very beginning you can see the 'tarantino-ness' of the film, the coolness, the pop culture references, the clever, quote-able dialogue, and although it lacks the visual flair of the films he has directed, this is still top notch entertainment. The main thing that hit me was the way i felt at the end of it. You know a film is good when u are still thinking about it long after the end credits have rolled, and the thing i couldn't get out of my mind was the line 'You're so cool'. you have to see it to understand, but i'd recommend this to anybody; a clever, entertaining, iconic film that has the 'cool factor' all the way through. Who said romance was dead...",8,1,2,10 February 2007
