Requiem for a Dream," How far are you willing to go to accomplish your dreams?
","This movie took me by a great surprise, i thought this was just a ordinary drama, and boy was i wrong. Let me just say this, you have to be psychologically prepared to see this movie. I've heard of some people that had to visit the bathroom after the movie (even during).The movie has a 'innocent drug-life start' for Harry (Jared Leto), Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and Marion (Jennifer Connelly) - where they begin with simple weed-smoking. Something that won't hold for long (without having to say more).Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) who plays the role extremely well, has a dream of being  famous, she has a dream of being _someone _, and begins to go pretty far to accomplish that, in this case by pill-abuse, something that causes hallucinations, angst, paranoia, addiction to the pills.
The movie is incredibly well made, it shows the life of normal people and their dreams as well as desires for a better life. During the entire movie the music is emotional, depressive, and in a way discouraging.
All i can say is see this movie a few hours after you have eaten. There are some very strong scenes with drug-abuse and sex.In my opinion this is a movie that should be shown to teenagers that wish to experiment with drugs, (on the message board there is a post that says: `should be shown in school' - I quite agree!).Once again, one of the best movies I've ever seen. 10 (++) out of 10",10,1,2,1 December 2002
