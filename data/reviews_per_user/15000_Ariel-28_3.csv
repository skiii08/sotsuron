One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Never have I loved any story like this one!
","101 Dalmatians is, no doubt, my all-time favourite story and also one of the greatest films I have ever seen. When I was small, I never got tired to listen to or to read the story, and because of thinking especially much about Cruella de Vil I very early noticed that in fact I like wicked characters. But, of course, the unforgettable dogs are best in the film. Because of this story I have loved real Dalmatians all my life and also thought that only the names of the film's dog figures are really suitable for Dalmatians. I have also read Dodie Smith's original story, and I was really glad that it's so much like the Disney film.",10,38,41,29 January 2000
Beauty and the Beast," No doubt, this is the best animated feature ever made.
","I'm sure everyone who has seen BEAUTY AND THE BEAST can say only good about it as a movie. For example, think about the staff's show during the song 'Be Our Guest' - it's quite incredible! And if someone thinks Alan Menken can't make good music he should hear all these songs. I like Belle because she loves reading and doesn't want to marry Gaston, that stupid boaster who doesn't have any manners. I really can't bear the scene in which Gaston 'helps Maurice out' of the tavern. When I saw the film for the first time, I had to confess that hearing the Beast's voice really frightened me although I knew no-one needs to be afraid of him. However, I have always liked 'The Mob Song'. The story is beautiful, too. Belle is and intelligent and friendly girl who teaches the Beast kindness and patience. But once he gets really angry with her, and that's no wonder; think about what would have happened if the rose had snapped!",10,1,1,11 June 1999
Tarzan," This IS a real Tarzan!
","I have read only the first of the Tarzan novels, and I must say that in fact I liked the Disney movie much more than it. Firstly, the filmmakers had changed the story so that Sabor (notice, the leopard, not the lioness) was the enemy of little Tarzan's family. I was really excited while she chased Kala and Tarzan. Kala is certainly the most tender and caring mother figure ever in the Disney films.It's a really excellent solution from Disney that Tarzan himself gets to know what it means to be different. It's also excellent that he moves like a gorilla and doesn't learn to speak human language perfectly. Finally the apes, even Kerchak, are ready to accept him as one of them, and it's good that he doesn't kill Kerchak like in the book.The meeting of Tarzan and Jane is one of the finest scenes in the movie. I was especially delighted when they both repeated each other's names - for I had been really amazed and disappointed that the famous words 'me Tarzan, you Jane' failed from the novel. It's quite incredible to see the future lovers fly from tree to tree!Clayton is quite unbearable. I was really shocked when he had the gorillas imprisoned and yet tried to shoot Tarzan! His death was really the only good solution to the situation.The end is also the only to be possible. The film would not have been a real Tarzan story if Jane and Tarzan hadn't stayed together.",10,1,1,18 December 1999
