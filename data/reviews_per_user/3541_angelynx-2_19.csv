The Blair Witch Project," real or fake? who cares?
","I must add a comment to all those who are involved in the big to-do over whether this film is fact or fiction. I have read too many posts from people who are only interested in BWP if it is 'true' and insist that they will feel cheated or hoaxed if it turns out to be otherwise. To any such person I say: forget it. Put all that aside and just experience the film as it is presented to you, without worrying whether or not you're watching a 'real documentary'. What you *are* watching is one of the finest exercises in relentless fear and unspeakable mystery ever set on film, and whether or not it really happened or these kids were truly lost in the Maryland woods just doesn't matter to that experience. X my heart it doesn't.",8,1,2,21 July 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Intense, suspenseful gem
","OK, if you're looking for a shock ride this is not the scariest movie ever made, but it beats any shock-ride movie I've ever seen for sheer breathtaking horror and dread. **SUPER intense!** I **mean** it! A bit slow getting started, but tightens the noose steadily and inexorably. Wonderful use of black-and-white photography and of the simplest possible - but terribly effective - visual devices to suggest primal nature magick and relentless pursuit by night. As the bewildered, terrified kids begin to collapse from hunger, hopelessness and exhaustion you are right there with them, and I guarantee you will *not* be breathing during the tremendous final ten minutes. Cripes, what a climax!--BWP is a pure triumph of filmmaking simplicity and understanding of basic human psychology over multi-million-dollar monster effects, and I hope its lesson - which was well known by directors of decades past - is well remembered by filmmakers now and to come.",8,0,1,21 July 1999
Unbreakable," Absorbing and fascinating
","An early holiday gift from a top-notch storyteller. M. Night Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' is a fascinating, totally absorbing film that does for the tale of superhero vs. super-villain what 'The Sixth Sense' did for the ghost story. It refreshes a done-to-death film theme and draws it completely into our own real world with thoughtful, sympathetic writing and performances of wonderful subtlety, humanity and depth. It is so exquisitely spare and minimal - especially in its dialog - and so careful to pick up every thread it lays down, that it puts 98% of the crowded, messy, noisy flicks out there to shame. Anyone who's turned off by the idea that this might be a 'comic-book movie', PLEASE put that thought aside - this is not about explosions, special effects or black/white solutions, but about the very nature of heroism and villainy (and I do *not* mean 'good and evil'), and the searching of soul that extraordinary beings must do before deciding what their work in the world should be. And the results of their search can be both inspiring and chilling, as we see here. Willis and Jackson are absolutely perfect, Willis' painful and troubled everyman honesty exactly contrasting Jackson's steely conviction and laser intensity (every fan will cheer the scene in which he icily rebuffs a sorely misguided gallery customer!). But no one here is a toss-away character, even the adversary's mom has importance. And the expected twist ending is a beauty; some apparently saw it coming sooner than I did=), but I was completely blindsided and loved it. --Again: if the idea of a movie with a comic book theme bothers you, please take my word on this and don't let it keep you from seeing 'Unbreakable'. You'd be missing something far too worthwhile.",10,0,0,25 November 2000
Cloverfield," Top-notch 21st century monster flick
","I was really looking forward to this movie, and it didn't disappoint me a bit. It's got everything I hoped for: an original monster, a breathtaking pace, genuine shocks and scares, some poignancy, some mystery, and absolutely no snarky condescension or cheesiness. This is a stripped-down, kick-ass dynamo of a movie experience unlike any giant creature flick I've ever seen, and I've been watching them since the 70s. It takes a little time to set up and get rolling, but once it's out of the gate it doesn't let up for a moment. The use of the hand-held camera gives it terrific immediacy and believability, since we see only as much of the creature and its rampage as the characters underfoot do. They're a pretty typical batch of well-heeled kids, used to getting immediate information on everything, and when they're suddenly plunged into violent chaos they react with terror and confusion. Yet despite that, they attempt a heroic rescue, acting with the kind of courage ordinary people show in the face of disaster every day. (Yes, some sequences do evoke the imagery of 9-11, but I wish people would quit sounding so indignant about that; surely it's off the sacred list and into the pool of legitimate film topics by now. The Cloverfield/9-11 = Godzilla/Hiroshima analogy ought to be enough to settle the point.) I liked them a lot more than I expected to (in fact I completely choked up when one character had to give his mom some very bad news) and felt completely pulled into the headlong rush of the story. It's as convincing a portrait of an event like this as I can imagine, and will leave you gasping for breath. I only have two credibility quibbles, in fact: the overly-helpful soldier and the apparent army of available helicopters. But those are minor. [[--I'm not going to say anything about the monster, except that it's none of the things people have been speculating it was, it's 100% cool, and I can't wait for the action figure.]] --I can't imagine anyone who really loves daikaiju cinema being disappointed with this: it's a fine, scary piece of work. Too nihilistic? Could be, but these are dark times, and we already know this film was intended to mirror the right-now dread and tension of our War on Terror landscape. There's no reassurance from those in power, the military doesn't know any more than the characters do, and all you get in return for facing the worst is the close-up rush of the adventure. Which, after all, may be all you ever get.",9,1,4,20 January 2008
Corpse Bride," the dead have much more fun!
","It's plain to see which side of the life-and-death divide Tim Burton's heart is on. The living, in Cousin Tim's universe, are stuffy, status-obsessed, grey people who frown upon music, deviations from the norm, and the frivolous notion that couples about to wed should--the very idea!--LIKE each other! Whereas downstairs in the land of the dead, skeletal barkeepers sing up a storm, there's hot jazz, dancing, bright colors, and (maybe not so surprisingly) very warm hearts. Heck, the dead even have cuter dogs (a common Burton theme and true again here). Victor, a very proper young man so non-morbid that he collects--and then releases--butterflies, accidentally finds himself married not to his living fianc√©e Victoria, but to the winsome and lovely Emily--whose only failing as a wife is her residence outside this mortal coil. (Tell ya the truth, though, he's not good enough for her; he's just too uptight, and the never-ending party vibe in the Ball & Socket Tavern seems to give him, well, butterflies.) How did sweet Emily end up a Corpse Bride? Will she be avenged? Can Victor and Victoria find their way back to each other and a subdued, proper, contented (but bloody boring!) life? You will have a great time finding out, cos this is a complete gem, funny, touching, dark and sweet, with the prettiest ending I've seen in years. It really did make me both laugh and cry, and I hardly ever get to say that. Tim, darlin', I forgive you for Willy Wonka; this one will go straight into Goth hearts worldwide and last for ages. (footnote: kids in the crowd we saw it with actually got up and danced in the aisles to the cookin' jazz in the closing credits! ever see THAT before? maybe the dead can even show us living stiffs how to have a good time. =)",10,5,7,25 September 2005
Burn After Reading," Can't believe this is supposed to be a comedy
","Nasty and mean-spirited. Only one sympathetic character in the whole thing, and he doesn't survive. Some of the native DC paranoia bits are funny, but when you can't care if a single person in the film gets what he or she wants, it's hard to enjoy any of it. I know lots of people love 'The Big Lebowski', but I know what I thought of it: unpleasant people doing awful things to each other for no good reason at all. This one's much the same.I swear, the Coens are brilliant when they're good, but when they aren't.... phew. And this is the only Coen film I've ever walked out on.",4,13,46,14 September 2008
The Fast and the Furious," A genuinely great B movie
","..and I really mean that. I was very pleasantly surprised to find that its scorching visuals and enormous kinetic energy were backed up by a fine, sympathetic performance by imposing Vin Diesel and, overall, what I like to call 'a good heart' --a film that isn't nihilistic and bitter at the core but has humanity and a sense of values. I had no trouble understanding why our cop hero, himself once in trouble with the law, slowly gravitated away from his chilly bosses and toward the vitality and warmth of the street racers' family unit, with its backyard picnics, protection of weaker members and strong internal loyalty.  I won't go into a lot about the plot, not because it doesn't have one but because you don't need to know: just know that if you get sick of movies where people do bad things for no reason, this one will make you feel better. And do NOT leave before the credits!",8,0,0,24 June 2001
No Country for Old Men," Bleak, wrenching, haunting film
","This is a film that will make you ask some big questions. Questions like 'what creates people with no human feelings?' and 'what can one person do about the existence of true evil? is there anything? should one try?' Tommy Lee Jones' character, honest and decent Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, is a long-time lawman from a long line of lawmen, but the kinds of crime and criminals he faces these days have left him emotionally, mentally and spiritually exhausted and bewildered. (--Like, I dare say, a lot of us.) His helplessness in the face of the grisly handiwork of the superbly played, formal and ice-cold psychopath Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem--and I will throw things at the screen if he doesn't win Best Supporting Actor for this stunning performance) is for me the emotional bedrock of this movie. I know people are impressed by Josh Brolin in this film, and I agree he's good, but for me his performance had nowhere near the complexity and subtlety of either Jones' or Bardem's: one good man whose moral compass no longer gives him the guidance he needs, and one man so simply relentless that for him good and evil are decided by the toss of a coin. They're not so much adversaries as polar opposites, the forces of law and chaos playing against each other at a distance, and I'm glad the Coens didn't settle for some falsely conclusive confrontation between them. It's a movie that doesn't give answers because there may not be any, a movie with no winner or loser; a movie that sets these painful questions in a gorgeous southwestern landscape and just looks at them, and helps you look at them too.I love the Coen Brothers' work (well, except for 'The Big Lebowski'), and I set this one right up on the shelf with their best. It's one I think no thoughtful person should miss.",9,1,5,26 January 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," What was Marvel thinking?!
","This thoughtless, reckless, noisy mess is an insult to the X-Men, their history, and anyone who has ever cared about them. I simply cannot imagine the line of thought that led to tossing aside one of the finest comic book story lines ever written--the deservedly famous Dark Phoenix Saga--in favor of this travesty. It would take me a lot more than 1000 words to go into any detail on just how much is wrong with this movie, not only as an X-Men adventure but even as competent film-making (is it day or night when Magneto performs his biggest stunt of the film? Why can't Rogue and Colossus hold onto their respective accents for more than a word or so per sentence? Why, for heaven's sake why, does Jean/Phoenix spend 90% of the movie JUST STANDING THERE?--except when doing things she would not, EVER, do?),--Man, it's sad to know Marvel has so little respect for one of its most successful and best-loved teams that it will let them be treated this way in public. (Yes, I know this movie made metric tons of woolongs last week. Yes, I know Marvel was thinking 'ka-ching' and not 'our beloved X-Men deserve the best'. But...can't help but wince when the people you grew up with behave so heartlessly at the first excuse.) (Good things: 1. Kelsey Grammar's entire performance. 2: Ian McKellen's wonderful voice. Bad things: Everything else. I mean everything.)",4,0,0,5 June 2006
Hellboy," most of these comments seem far off the mark to me...
","I'm seeing far too much use of the words 'corny' and 'cheesy' to suit me here. There was VERY little cheese in this flick as I understand the word (and I am a devotee of MST3K, so I think I know cinema du fromage when I see it).  OK, so maybe we've seen enough movies with Nazis as occultist villains: still, Mignola wrote it that way, and I am happy to see a movie follow its source material so closely (points for including a Spear of Destiny that looked just like the bloody real thing!).  I have seldom seen Lovecraftian monsters done so effectively--only LOTR's Watcher in the Water comes close. (And as a lifelong Creature from the Black Lagoon fan, I was personally delighted to see old Blacky updated as a bookish recluse with a Threepio accent.) I thought Perlman's world-weary, stoic workingman attitude was *far* from the melodramatic, 'tortured lone hero' pose that some are accusing him of--he's just a hardworking guy who's unlucky in love and tired of watching TV alone with his kittycats. (Nowhere near the stock, pasted-on torment of a cardboard character like Blade, IMHO.) I suppose one *could* say that having him fight off monsters with one hand while saving a box of kittens with the other was corny, but (a) we already knew he loves cats, and (b) it was sweet, darn it!  C'mon! Show me where it says big red bruisers can't do the sweet thing sometimes. =) I'll even admit that the last five minutes had me scratching my head--I get really tired of the 'Vast Enormous Evil Universe-Destroying Ritual Foiled At The Last Instant' plot--but, well...Overall I just loved this movie.  It is so good-natured and well-intended (all Hellboy's important motivations spring from love for someone), its humor is so gentle, and it just doesn't have that cold hard internal edge that I am so weary of in big SFX action movies (Blade, Blade II, Underworld, ad nauseam..) . Like its hero, it's a big powerhouse with a soft heart.",8,0,0,11 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," An exciting and emotional addition to the Star Wars universe
","In every way this film improves on its immediate prequel, The Force Awakens. I attribute that to the previous film's careful, almost shot-for-shot recreation of Episode IV, the original SW film. While I enjoyed TFA a great deal, and I understand the reasoning of essentially rebooting the franchise by reintroducing all its main themes and plot points, it did feel a bit over-familiar to a long-time fan. But The Last Jedi takes off from that beginning at top speed and delivers an exciting ride full of twists, dangers, spy missions, humor (rather a lot of that!), possible romance, and drama. Mark Hamill is excellent as a bitter and reclusive older Luke who slowly rediscovers his hope for the future. The new characters all step up to stronger roles, with an intriguing subplot between Rey and Kylo Ren and a great turn by new arrival Rose. There are important discussions on the workings of the Force and the place of the Jedi, and an ending that seems to leave the Resistance at its lowest ebb but contains great hope from unexpected sources. I did think it tried a bit too hard to be snarkily funny, and it plays very fast and loose with physics, but i don't think those are major flaws in a film that is so very much fun.",8,1,2,18 December 2017
The Happening," Filled with mystery and dread
","Now that I've seen 'The Happening' I'm genuinely puzzled by the bad reviews I've been reading. I think this is a fine, tense, frightening film, filled with an overwhelming sense of mystery and dread. Reminiscent (to me) of both 'The Birds' and 'The Blair Witch Project', it sets the inexplicable forces of Nature Herself against us, and if you've ever wondered what might happen if the Earth finally did get sick and tired of us, well, so apparently has M. Night. I'm sure I've never seen a film where the ordinarily peaceful sounds of rustling leaves and wind blowing through the grass became so fearsome. Yes, there's no explanation for what happens (of course not: if something like this did happen, what explanation could we possibly get, and who from? the Delphic Oracle?); yes, the deaths are shocking, though not excessively gory; but it seems to me that the film devotes all its energy to a single-minded paring down of the cast to one small, simple family group, and leaves its single note of hope right there. With stark, spare cinematography and top-notch sound editing, this is one keen little razor of a cautionary tale, with an oh-my-god final sequence.",8,4,11,13 June 2008
There Will Be Blood," Best Actor, yes. Best Picture, never.
","A gripping, utterly ruthless performance by Day-Lewis that definitely deserves acclaim, but a script with no narrative arc, no resolution of anything, just a dead-end stop in nihilistic gore. Is that it? the single-minded pursuit of profit destroys sanity and morality? that's all we get? I can hardly believe that I've seen this film compared to 'Citizen Kane'. There's no sense of epic futility and loss here, not even the soul-aching bewilderment of Sheriff Bell's last lines in the also-open-ended 'No Country for Old Men'. It just...ends. All we can do is hope the butler knows who to call next. Not even CLOSE to Best Picture of the year.",7,2,7,26 January 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Gorgeous erotic poem
","*Easily* the finest film adaptation of Bram Stoker's 'Dracula', though it should properly be called 'Francis Ford Coppola's McNally and Florescu's Bram Stoker's Dracula' for its unmatched amalgam of cinematic style, historical research (the visual evocation of Vlad the Impaler's battlefield triumph is just nonpareil) and Stoker's actual plot. Coppola had the nerve and integrity to combine the historic Dracula (even including his wife's dramatic suicide, a documented event!) with scenes from Stoker that had never been filmed before and some lovely extrapolations (including a revival of the classic 'reincarnation of lost love' theme) for a fresh, richly beautiful and emotionally powerful version of this much-filmed tale. Sumptuous in every sense of the word.",10,1,3,6 February 2000
Shrek," What a treat!
","I don't know what movie these last half-dozen or so people saw, but it sure wasn't the same delightful 'Shrek' we saw today! Only an ironbound Disney loyalist could consider its humor mean-spirited in the least. (And besides, really, it's high time the high and mighty Disney empire took a few shots of this nature.) The alleged flatulence obsession amounts to *one* fart joke and *one* belch joke - come on now, guys. Even the moments of gross bug and food humor (and I think kids will love those) are limited to the opening scene in Shrek's house. But why dwell on this stuff when the movie is so charming? It takes two of the most classic fairy tale stories - the heroic quest/rescue and the 'beauty and beast' romance (which, need I remind anyone, was NOT invented by the Mouse House?) - and updates them with a terrific combination of mildly edgy modern humor and the most dazzling computer animation yet. I could go on for paragraphs about the deliciousness of the fabric textures, the grasses and leaves stirring in the wind, the shine of hair...wow! Better yet, this technical quantum leap forward is never allowed to become the reason for the movie (as it so tiresomely is with live-action effects) but is kept firmly in the service of the story, providing emotional responses and facial expressions of such subtlety that even green ogres become humanly believable.  This is used especially well in the delicate development of the unspoken romance between Princess Fiona (who has already shown herself to be something other that what she appears!) and her rescuer, Shrek. Fiona - who begins by believing that only a guy with the correct princely trappings can be her true love and comes to see things quite differently - is a completely convincing creation, but so is proud, lonely Shrek and even his yakky sidekick Donkey. It is mind-boggling to contemplate what this technology will be used to do in the future. Here it has given us an adventure and a romance (yes it is!) crammed with visual humor, (And can I just take one moment to revel in all these Disney jokes? She-dragons with long eyelashes and lipstick! The Three Pigs with their eviction notice! Snow White in her glass coffin--and later brawling with Cinderella over the wedding bouquet! The individually named parking lots at Farquaad's castle! L-O-bloody-L!) --I have seen a lot of 6 and 8 movies in the past few months; this is my first 10 since 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' and if it's my only 10 all summer I won't feel shortchanged. Don't listen to these complainers. See it.",10,1,1,20 May 2001
Iron Man," About ten times better than I expected
","For many months I had no hopes for, or interest in, this movie whatever, expecting just another explosion-loaded summer gadget-fest for the tech fanboys. When I heard the buzz on Downey's performance I decided to see it, but I still had no expectations in particular. Well, I got a surprise and then some, because this is one heck of a smart, funny, rockin' movie. It has huge kinetic energy, and stays on course throughout, never sinking into the trap of a long, dumb, drawn-out special-effects brawl (I'm looking at you, X-Men III); the Iron Man suit is a ***real suit*** from the wonderworks of Stan Winston, not CGI, thank heaven!; music choices are very cool (Black Sabbath's 'Iron Man' and Suicidal Tendencies' 'Institutionalized', yeah!); casting and acting are excellent (Gwyneth Paltrow gets high marks); and Downey's performance is simply a marvel--pun only half intended!--perfect from start to finish. From his fast-talking hyperactive demeanor and the edgy, nervous intelligence of his eyes to his expressive face and understated body language, he really IS Tony Stark, completely believable as a high-tech genius used to living on his mind and nerves (and alcohol) alone. (I'm guessing the buff physique is just something he cultivates to make sure he looks good in those expensive suits.) Playing Stark as a wired 21st century media star instead of the outdated stereotype of the suave high-living playboy is a brilliant stroke, and his crisis of conscience is completely convincing without being at all maudlin or overdone. --Downey's just great in this, and I publicly apologize for not having had any confidence in him, cos this could not have been played better.To top it off, it's even got a relevant and topical anti-military message, raises touchy subjects like American foreign policy and war profiteering, and has a surprise cameo after the credits (do not leave early!) that raises all sorts of speculations for the future. =)---Man, I had the best time at this movie. It's a complete kick, and much, MUCH better than I expected.",9,4,8,4 May 2008
Signs," Another M. Night gem
","Reading through the preceding comments it strikes me that many people are evaluating this film on what it's not. It's 'not as good as Sixth Sense' or it's 'not really about alien invasions and crop circles' or it's 'not an action film like Independence Day' (--for which we should all be thanking our preferred version of the Supreme Being, in my opinion!) And many more are missing points that are perfectly clear (ahem: the reason Gibson's character doesn't want to use cusswords is because he was a minister, not because he's incapable of rage: his outburst to his kids later on is *perfectly* believable).--I don't know what movie all these folks saw, but the one I saw was one of the best this year, and doesn't need to apologize for anything it's not.The phrase that keeps coming to my mind is Fox Mulder's 'I want to believe.' So much of this movie is about belief and faith, about people's willingness--and unwillingness--to believe. Graham Hess' loss of his wife has caused him to lose his faith, not only in God, but in life; he can't believe. Little Morgan unhesitatingly accepts a writer's speculations about the nature and intent of the alien invaders; he needs to believe. People around the world take shelter (as in the classic War of the Worlds, which is referenced) in places of worship. But M. Night is not leading us toward religious faith only, but toward a much wider sense that 'there are no coincidences' --that there is reason to believe in fate, destiny, a vast and mysterious web that connects even the most seemingly unconnected details.There is tremendous build-up of fear and suspense, and a surprisingly large dose of humor (Gibson in particular does topnotch work in that regard: I loved his 'Raar! I'm insane with rage!' routine as he tries to intimidate what he thinks are trespassers, and his speech to the pantry door). The depiction of one family's response to a worldwide crisis --barricade yourselves indoors, devour reference books and watch CNN 20 hours a day; heck, I know I would--was completely believable. But the real process of the film is Graham's slow re-examination of his wife's death, especially of her last words, and his eventual understanding that they meant much more than they seemed to mean; that there really are no coincidences, and that even this seemingly random tragedy was a sign, with great meaning and gifts to give. It's not a head-snapping twist ending like the ones in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable (OK, there, even I did it =), but just as profound and breathtaking in its implications. And that's not even mentioning the superb craft of the film itself, its sheer no-background-noise silence in which the least sound is magnified, its shadows and subtlety and use of patterns in everyday life to convey the sense of signs all around us. (--dig the curtains and the doorframe; dig the test pattern Merrill sees on the TV when all channels have ceased broadcasting; does any station in the USA still use those? but you know M. Night couldn't resist using it because of its wonderful arcane look, like a crop circle itself, or some sort of mystical sigil...)From my new favorite director, a gem that deserves your attention.",9,0,1,4 August 2002
The Sixth Sense," Superb!
","Excellent in every way. Exquisitely plotted; striking, moody cinematography and direction; fine performances; a thoughtful, intelligent, deeply moving film. Though well-stocked with gore effects and some stunning shocks, its overall mood is cold, calm and still, and its theme on many levels is the need to communicate, to tell something, something that untold will not let the soul rest. Absolutely beautiful, and tied off with a blind-siding twist ending that you will *never* see coming but that makes perfect sense the moment you comprehend it. Four stars!",10,0,0,22 August 1999
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Rich and beautiful
","I have been shaking my head over the reviews this film is getting - even Roger Ebert and CNN, not to mention many writers here, apparently find it disjointed and plot less. How bizarre! I, and my housemates, walked out raving about the tightness of the plot. No character is superfluous, every thread begun is knotted in at the end - it's as neat as fine beadwork. I don't want to give away plot points, but trust me, it's just delectable how elegantly characters weave in and out of the plot, found and lost and saved just in time to do their part. Look, just for one example, at the scene where the Soggy Bottom Boys perform at the political rally, and at least five plot elements converge in about ten seconds of lovely reaction shots. Disjointed my boot! How can people be missing this?And that's not even all the good stuff! This is a beautiful movie, handsomely shot in bleached-out tones that fill the screen with the heat and weariness of the Depression South. The much-praised soundtrack deserves it. The performances are rich with quirky humor and affection; I can hardly remember feeling so good after a movie. That the Coens have chosen to use just about the entire catalog of pop-culture period Southern references - open-air baptism, singing chain gangs, the Ku Klux Klan, Huey Long-style politicians, bluesmen selling their souls at the crossroads - only adds to the abstracted and gentle comedy of the film. Even the firelit Klan meeting combines menace with absurdity, looking as if choreographed by the team of Leni Riefenstahl and Busby Berkeley. (Honestly, I just don't see all the ridicule and mockery of country Southerners that others are seeing here. It's too good-natured for that.) The thread of Homer's Odyssey runs through it more smoothly than you'd expect, from the prophetic, blind handcar man as Teiresias the seer (and maybe as Charon the boatman of the Styx as well); to the alluring sirens at the river --with a nod to Circe, the sorceress who turned men into animals, when a frog is mistaken for a transformed man; to big John Goodman as a club-wielding, eyepatched Cyclops; and of course to Ulysses' need to get home before his wife Penny (Penelope) remarries. And there are scenes of wonderful beauty and magic realism, like the singing, white-clad Baptists drifting through the woods toward the river, and the dreamy vision of the Sirens at their washing.This is a fine, fine movie, the Coens back at top form after the *utterly* disappointing and depressing 'Big Lebowski', and the rest of 2001 is gonna have to do some work to come up with a better film.",9,0,0,13 January 2001
