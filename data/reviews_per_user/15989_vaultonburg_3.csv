Requiem for a Dream," I Don't Care Enough To Care Enough About What's Happening
","It's totally unfair for me to even review this title as I started watching fully intending to not like it, and I haven't even finished watching. Also, having just read the wide variance in reviews, there's not much in my reaction to what I'm seeing that varies from a lot of others who didn't care for this.Except I'm not seeing this as an anti-drug movie in any way. I did have those original reactions, like this was just a more styleized version of anti-school specials, but that's not accurate here, because the director doesn't seem to be making any real anti-drug statement. All we're doing here is watching people we never really started to care about descend into a state where the only entertainment factor becomes lurid, prurient, and sadistic.So, unless I'm easily manipulated into caring about characters that don't seem real to me, or even if they did, I wouldn't care about, all that's left is going to the freakshow. And I guess I've never found that entertaining.What I do find lacking from this movie, to its credit, is the mean-spirited, taking of pleasure in the misfortune and suffering of others I've found in the works of other directors like Todd Solendz, Larry Clark, or Harmony Korine. But I'm not convinced showing putrid aspects of human nature equates with honesty in any real way.These just aren't characters I care about. I like some of the style going on here. I enjoy the baseline of the women in chairs in front of the building providing a hum drum contrast to what happens to the main characters. It's not a total botch by any means, but I don't find it all that profound or insightful, even when compared to better movies about the topic of drug abuse itself.Maybe the second half will change my mind.",4,1,2,13 March 2019
Hereditary," In the Lovecraft Tradition of the Unseen Being More Terrifying Than the Seen
","Once you realize this movie isn't going to be dependent on cheap jump scares that's when you can start to wrap your mind around what the true horror going on is about.Yes, it's slow.I hope I didn't ruin it with the jump scares thing. Should I call that a spoiler?Early on in the movie you're disabused of the programming you get from watching modern horror: characters stare at something, and you know they're in touch with something that scares them, and you wait for it to jump out at them. And it doesn't. Then you are forced to enter the Lovecraftian world of the unseen.I totally understand how that can be frustrating, especially for modern audiences.It's not a tour de force, but it works. And I almost think selling it as a pure horror film does it a disservice. This is a drama about grief. About the ravages of mental illness.And it's just gorgeous to look at. The movie is shot in such a warm and beautiful manner that it just raises into relief the horror roiling beneath the surface.Definitely worth a watch, but temper your expectations and slow down. Take it for what it is.",8,0,2,13 March 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fine Piece of Entertaining Fluff With Flaws
","I was excited about seeing this movie, and expected a little more than I got. I think that will be the experience of a lot of people who have heard rave reviews, but aren't especially into comic book movies. The movie is entertaining, and funny, but rather hollow. It opens with a scene that is sort of a cheap, manipulative trick to garner sympathy for a character, but doesn't really earn that level of emotional investment. It goes on to throw together an ad hoc collection of characters that are in essence bad guys, and somehow they set aside their self-interests to team up, and become the closest of friends remarkably fast. Once again, the writing doesn't earn this progression, it just asks us to accept it. I didn't. I had the same issue with Star Wars. Those characters didn't know each other long enough to have the feelings they developed in microwave fashion. None of this will matter to you for the most part. But it does take those shortcuts, and uses those manipulations to substitute for character and story development. I did like two of these characters more than the others, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot, because I did buy their symbiotic relationship. The others I didn't. The laughs are there. Big laughs. The soundtrack was goofy. On several occasions they seem to stop the movie altogether so they can play a tired 70's easy listening song that doesn't fit, move the story forward, or make any damn sense. The songs aren't even particularly well-chosen. Other than that, this is fantastic fare for those seeking what it offers. It will be frustrating for others.",6,3,9,15 August 2014
