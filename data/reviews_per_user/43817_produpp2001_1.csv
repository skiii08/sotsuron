The Expendables 2," Keep Em Coming!
","What are the haters getting so annoyed about? The Expendable franchise is fast, fun, nostalgic action heaven! I'm a child of the 80's and watching Expendables 2 was like an 80's wet dream to me. Yes I appreciate the argument that a more serious 'Predator' style movie with this ensemble cast could be incredible but I love the direction Sly has taken these films in, he understands that taking themselves too seriously would just invite a bombardment of hate along with a desire for the film to fail. Instead Sly lets us know that he's in on the joke and all we need do is sit back and enjoy the ride. Keep em coming Sly, loved seeing Van Damme back on the big screen, can't wait to see who you line up next.",9,1,2,24 January 2013
